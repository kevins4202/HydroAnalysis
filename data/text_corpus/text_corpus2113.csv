10565,internationally furrow irrigation efficiency remains frustratingly less than desired in australia reviews of irrigated cotton farming reveal deep drainage losses are at least 1 0 ml ha cropping season and irrigators are using excessive cultivation which causes rapid consolidation of tilth and slows infiltration this research sought to i evaluate the ability of deep blade loosening dbl shallow cultivation sc and no tillage nt soil management practices and 2 dimensional infiltration theory to respectively facilitate and predict lateral water penetration to the centre of wide beds 2 m spacing and ii to develop a simple irrigation practice based on assured wetting of bed centres field scale research was undertaken on self mulching clay on the queensland darling downs bulk density 0 300 mm depth and soil moisture changes to 1000 mm depth beneath furrows and beds were monitored in a maize crop that was irrigated twice the duration of water applications water inflow rates and water advance in furrows were also recorded the absorption form of 2 dimensional infiltration theory predicted the time for water to reach the centre of beds and the amount of water infiltrated at given times in all treatments only the dbl treatment enhanced lateral sorptivity and infiltration it had a ratio of lateral to vertical water penetration of 3 1 in contrast the sc and nt treatments had ratios of 1 1 took two to three times longer for bed centres to wet and were much more susceptible to deep drainage losses beneath furrows and bed shoulders an illustrative example shows how this technology specifies the rate and duration of water applications and improves irrigation efficiency and effectiveness conservative estimates of water savings generated by its use lie between 0 25 and 0 80 ml ha irrigation or 20 30 of water irrigation keywords stable tilth porosity lateral sorptivity time to bed centre irrigation efficiency 1 introduction furrow irrigation practice despite considerable research over the past 40 50 years remains less efficient than is desirable particularly given that diminishing water resources caused by global population growth and climate change are causing irregular and diminishing rainfall and insecure water supplies in traditional irrigation areas steffen et al 2018 in australia between 90 and 80 of the national cotton crop which is by far the largest irrigation crop 400 000 ha of a total irrigated area of 2 million ha anon 2016 is grown under furrow irrigation recent reviews of cotton irrigation roth et al 2013 silburn et al 2013 have identified that despite i improvements over the last 20 30 years in the whole farm irrigation efficiency index and ii increases in the crop water use efficiency cotton crops are still using 7 ml ha or 700 mm of irrigation water and losing 7 3 ml ha 730 mm as evapotranspiration and 0 5 1 0 ml ha or 50 100 mm season as deep drainage in other terms more than the seasonal rainfall is lost to deep drainage these authors also found saturated soil at depths of 2 6 m beneath irrigated fields and no saturated soil under native vegetation in the same landscapes they concluded there was considerable scope and need for further improvements in irrigation efficiency most recent attempts to improve furrow irrigation practice have involved models such as iparm irrigation parameters and runoff model gillies and smith 2005 which calculates one dimensional infiltration characteristics in the form of the kostiakov infiltration equation from data of water advance along and runoff from furrows and sirmod iii surface irrigation simulation model walker 2003 into which these infiltration characteristics are inserted along with data of furrow geometry slope length inflow rate and cut off time the outputs from these models are inflow rates and cut off times that attempt to match inflow with infiltration and minimise runoff and deep drainage losses and walker 2003 and gillies and smith 2005 predict improvements in the order of 20 25 should be possible apart from the input data for these models being beyond the resources of irrigation farmers the models have inherent weaknesses they implicitly assume that the results from just one analysis will apply for all seasonal and soil conditions over time assuming that these conditions are unchanging more explicitly these models take no account of i seasonal changes in the water content of the soil prior to the application of water and the influence this has on infiltration and ii reconsolidation of tilth caused by wetting and drying of the soil and the changes this makes to the distribution of pore sizes and hydraulic properties of soil furthermore because they are one dimensional these models are incapable of providing information on the extent and amount of water that moves laterally towards the centre of beds at a shallow depth where most crop roots exist akbar et al 2015 used the hydrus 2d software of simunek and genuchten 2007 to examine the lateral movement of water into beds at the same site with the same treatments as reported in this paper whilst their results are similar to those reported here the outputs require detailed experimental input assumed non varying soil hydraulic properties and considerable computer time all of which need to be replicated for each set of field circumstances the resources and time required for such modelling are well beyond those available to farmers the theory of two and three dimensional infiltration was developed 50 years ago philip 1969 and despite some work at that time to apply it field soils peck and talsma 1968 talsma 1969 plus other relevant theoretical work to illustrate the applicability of infiltration theory to highly structured philip 1968 and heterogeneous soils philip 1967 no substantial progress has been made with its application to field irrigation practice the reasons for this lack of application have never been published but undoubtedly include i the lack until the late 1990s of technology that continuously monitors soil moisture changes in field soils ii the variation in infiltration that results from changes in the soil moisture content and iii the changes in soil water transmission properties between and during irrigation events that occurs due to disaggregation and reconsolidation of loose tilth field soil moisture content changes can now be monitored and recorded telemetrically in real time e g alva et al 2003 and sentek plus compact and the soil management practice of deep blade loosening dbl appendix has been shown to increase root growth and conserve root mass through to at least the next cropping season hamilton et al 2016 2019 this practice creates and maintains near stable tilth porosity in a deepened seedbed in addition irrigation scheduling can constrain soil moisture changes to a relatively narrow range between field capacity and one third of field capacity and thereby avoid variations in infiltration caused by large variations in antecedent soil moisture conditions these practical capabilities provide the opportunity to test philip s two and three dimensional infiltration theory under real farming conditions if successful the theory can provide a much simpler and scientifically sound means of overcoming difficult management challenges such as i identifying an optimum width and depth of beds ii creating a near stable tilth porosity with properties that ensure water rapidly reaches the centre of beds and iii easily identifying an optimum rate and duration of water application that uniformly wets beds and minimises deep drainage the objectives of this research were to examine the extent to which the improved soil structure created by the deep blade loosening dbl soil management practice will improve lateral infiltration and furrow irrigation efficiency compared to conventional cultivation sc and no tillage nt practices and the adequacy of philip s 2 dimensional infiltration theory to predict infiltration from furrows into the centre of beds and thereby identify appropriate water application rates and durations for some or all of the three forms of soil management 2 theory when philip extended his series solution of 1 dimensional infiltration theory 1957a to include long time periods and multi dimensional flow philip 1969 the influence of the geometry of the supply surface and gravity had to be included and the 1 dimensional series equation became 1 i st1 2 a 2t r0 a 3 t3 2 r0 2 where i is cumulative infiltration mm t is time h and s is sorptivity mm h1 2 an integral parameter that embodies the influence of capillarity on the transient flow processes that follow an abrupt change in moisture content and moisture potential at the surface of a porous medium and a n mmn tn 2 is the nth term of a series and r0 is the radius of the supply surface or furrow philip 1969 all of which are related to the gravity driven hydraulic conductivity mm h the first term on the right hand side of eq 1 describes absorption that is controlled entirely by capillarity the second term describes the linearly additive interactions of gravity and multiple dimensional flow which produce the initial deviations from t1 2 behaviour the third term is the leading term of non linear interactions between capillarity gravity and geometry although early time behaviour of multi dimensional flows is dominated by capillary forces over time the force of gravity and the influence of multi dimensional geometry become substantial when flow is horizontal or the time of the event is short capillary forces alone drive the process which is referred to as absorption and eq 1 reduces to 2 i st1 2 thus the appropriateness of which particular equation to use when examining the two dimensional flow of water from furrows into beds and the underlying soil depends on the i the magnitude of s a function of the surface and initial moisture contents philip 1957b ii the geometry of the supply surface and iii the duration of the irrigation event philip 1969 derived the following relationship to establish a criterion for the radius of a furrow that would ensure the influence of gravity does not exceed one tenth of the two dimensional absorption from a semi circular furrow 3 ro 2 a 2 m 2 5 a2 where ro is the radius of the supply surface or furrow a 2 is the second term of the series solution of the multi dimensional infiltration equation m is the number of dimensions and a2 is the second term of the 1 dimensional equation using the linearised approximation of infiltration which matches exactly the non linear solutions of infiltration at small times and in some integral sense at large times philip 1966a this inequality can be expressed in terms of the easily field measured soil parameters of sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity philip 1969 where a2 ½ k1 and a 2 m 2 π s2 8 θ1 θ0 where θ1 is the soil water content at the irrigation supply surface and θ0 is the soil water content before irrigation substituting these approximations into inequality 3 produces ro π s2 10 k1 θ1 θ0 or 4 0 314 s2 k1 θ1 θ0 given the exact series solution produces a value of the numerical factor in 4 of 0 352 the smaller factor of 0 314 calculated from the linearised analysis provides a more conservative criterion for the choice of ro to identify the influence of gravity a more explicit examination of the effect of gravity is available in the dimensionless form of the infiltration theory philip 1966b this produces 5 r₀ r₀ k₁ k₀ θ₁ θ₀ π s² where r₀ is dimensionless furrow radius r₀ is the furrow radius k₁ k₀ is the increase in k between the initial and final moisture contents θ₁ θ₀ and s is the sorptivity for this form of analysis to be appropriate i e the effect of gravity is insubstantial ro must be 0 25 several papers have provided insight on the applicability of this theory describing infiltration in field conditions to do so requires the theory to predict infiltration in soils that are heterogeneous vertically i e having layers with different pores size distributions different moisture contents and varying proportions of macro and microporosity philip 1966a demonstrated the classical soil water flow equation was indeed applicable in terms of the square root of time behaviour in heterogeneous soils with soil water potential profiles behaving simply across different layers while producing complicated apparently discontinuous moisture profiles subsequently philip 1967 studied the applicability of soil water absorption theory to aggregated soils made up of macro and micro porosity and found that any deviations from classical behaviour would be very short 2 min and small and that essentially aggregated soils behave in a classical manner with sorptivity effectively equal to that of the macro porosity alone furthermore in most field soils deeper layers are denser resulting in smaller hydraulic conductivity and moister decreasing the moisture and potential gradients at the wetting front of infiltrating water and sorptivity decreasing hydraulic conductivity causes the influence of gravity on infiltration to decrease as is evident from 4 and 5 in situations where water is infiltrating in two or three dimensions such field soil circumstances should cause water to move laterally under the influence of capillary forces for longer than would occur in homogeneous soils with uniform density and moisture content data of talsma 1970 talsma and van der lelij 1976 illustrate that capillary forces dominate for longer where hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity decrease with depth during one dimensional infiltration into swelling soils 3 methods 3 1 site details the experimental site was located at cambooya queensland lat 27 73 long 151 82 approximately 20 km south south west of toowoomba queensland and was situated on a long low slope 0 05 plain that has a deep self mulching black soil classified as ug 5 11 northcote 1984 or a haplic vertisol world soil resources report 106 2015 it was used from 2010 to 2012 3 2 treatments the experimentation at cambooya was undertaken at a practical scale using farm size machinery all irrigation and cropping activities were part of the commercial operation of the farm and the farmer was an active operational and financial partner the treatments and the number three and size of replicates 1 67 ha were chosen to be compatible with farming operations three contrasting soil management treatments were imposed on permanent raised beds deep blade loosening to a depth of about 250 mm dbl cultivation to a depth of about 100 mm sc and no tillage crop establishment on a consolidated seedbed nt the dbl machine has swept horizontal blades that sever roots lift and open the soil and then drop it there is no inversion and no horizontal displacement of soil and the structure and mass of the roots of previous crops are retained hamilton et al 2016 2019 in a bed and furrow system the blades operate only beneath the beds the soil beneath the furrows is left undisturbed and compacted by farm traffic the design and operational objectives of this machine are presented in the appendix the treatments were laid out in a tri replicated randomised block configuration and each replicate comprised three 2 m wide beds that were 465 m long all measurements were undertaken on the central bed the beds and furrows were formed with a bed top width of 1 5 m and furrow width 0 5 m which matched the 2 m trackwidth and tyre width of the available tractor crops were established on all three treatments with a disc type no tillage seeder in a controlled traffic operation crop husbandry operations were the same on all of treatments irrigation water was applied via 50 mm id siphon tubes to all treatments for a duration based on the farmer s knowledge and experience this practice applied water until it backed up to the height of the beds at the lower end of dammed furrows scheduling was based on estimates of about 65 of the stored water capacity of the 1000 mm soil profile depth irrigations were undertaken when crops needed watering and the water was available 3 3 field measurements the following measurements were made bulk density of the 0 300 mm depth water inflow rate water application duration the advance of water flow along the furrows changes in soil moisture content to 1000 mm depth during the application of water in the furrow centre and at 330 mm spacings from the furrow centre to the bed centre and the productivity of a maize crop see hamilton 2019 for data and commentary on productivity 3 3 1 bulk density bulk density was monitored to track changes in density and tilth porosity in the 0 300 mm depth of soil in all treatments prior to sowing prior to irrigations and at harvest nine samples were taken from the central bed of each of the tri replicated plots of each treatment at the top end mid point and lower end of each plot sampling depths were 50 150 and 250 mm undisturbed core samplers of 50 mm diameter by 50 mm length were used 3 3 2 soil moisture soil moisture content of the 0 1000 mm profile depth was recorded prior to and during each irrigation event using sentek enviroscan recording moisture probes the data from these were collected from sensors located at 100 200 300 400 700 and 1000 mm depth intervals every 10 min 3 3 3 irrigation measurements water application rates and its advance along furrows were measured with irrimate siphon flow meters and water advance sensors siphon flow meters were installed on one siphon in each replicate of each treatment five water advance sensors were installed at approximately 100 m intervals along furrows starting 50 m from the top end and advance was measured in four furrows of each treatment inflow rates were set according to experience with the aim being to have water reach the lower end of the furrows at the same time in all treatments time of the start and cut off of water application was recorded manually for each siphon 3 3 4 tilth porosity total porosity was calculated from the bulk density data using the standard value for the specific gravity of soil particles of 2 65 g cm³ the difference between seasonal changes in the 0 300 mm porosity of the dbl sc and nt treatments and the final most consolidated state of the nt control treatment provided a monitored measure of the extra porosity created by each treatment and the extent to which this was retained over time as reconsolidation occurred this extra porosity is termed tilth porosity to distinguish it from the naturally occurring forms of textural and structural porosity 3 3 5 sorptivity horizontal and radial downwards flow weighted mean sorptivity data were estimated from the slope of linear graphs of cumulative infiltration vs square root of time data for the 0 300 mm soil layer of the beds and the 1000 mm by 1000 mm profile beneath the furrows and beds the linearity of these graphs was used to assess the validity of square root of time behaviour of infiltration 3 3 6 infiltration field measured infiltration was calculated as the difference between moisture content readings over time from the installed moisture probes integrated over horizontal and vertical distances between probes at elapsed time intervals the validity of philip s theory was assessed by the linearity of graphs of cumulative infiltration vs the square root of elapsed time by the criterion of a furrow radius that ensures the influence a gravity does not exceed one tenth of the 2 dimensional absorption from a furrow inequality 4 and eq 5 the latter used conservative i e large values for the change in hydraulic conductivity and by the ability of eq 2 to predict infiltration at given times 4 results 4 1 bulk density the mean bulk density data for the 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 mm depths in each treatment show the dbl treatment was substantially and statistically significantly p 0 05 less dense than the sc and nt treatments throughout the experiment fig 1 at the time of seeding this difference occurred in the shallower depths only but over the season the less dense conditions in the dbl treatment extended throughout the 300 mm depth the shrink swell nature of this vertisol is unlikely to have confounded the measured differences in bulk density between the treatments berndt and coughlan 1976 showed that density measurements of vertisols below moisture contents of field capacity were essentially constant during the experimental period the average 0 300 mm moisture content ranged from 17 i e permanent wilting point to 43 i e field capacity only the data sampled prior to harvest were likely to be confounded by the swelling nature of this soil they were sampled with an average 0 300 mm moisture content of 52 and therefore at drier moisture contents may be denser than shown in fig 1d 4 2 tilth porosity the tilth porosity or extra porosity created by the soil management treatments at the time of seeding usually diminishes over time as soil reconsolidates in response to wetting and drying cycles the relative magnitude of tilth porosity created by the different soil treatments in the 0 300 mm depth of soil and its decline over the season in response to the cumulative amount of irrigation water applied and rainfall received fig 2 shows the dbl treatment created and retained 3 7 more tilth porosity than the sc and nt treatments the statistical analyses of the bulk density data indicate the differences in tilth porosity between the dbl treatment and the sc and nt treatments were significant and that those between the sc and nt treatments were statistically indistinguishable importantly at the time of the first and second irrigations the dbl treatment had between 3 and 7 more tilth porosity than the sc and nt treatments 4 3 irrigation measurements 4 3 1 mass balance in pursuing the objectives of this research it was essential that the surface irrigation measurements of siphon inflow and cut off time which allow the calculation of the depth of water applied match the measured increases in soil moisture content that occurred during irrigation mean data of such a mass balance for the three soil management treatments for both irrigations table 1 were within 10 which given errors in each of the measuring techniques and spatial variability of soil is very good 4 3 2 water advance along furrows data of the mean rate of advance of water in the furrows of the three soil management treatments fig 3 and table 2 show a straight line relationship for all soil management treatments r² 0 92 between the distance water travelled along a furrow and the square root of time given the inflow fluxes of water mm3 mm² s were constant for each replicate s irrigation this type of relationship indicated that water must be extracted from the inflow by a process that was also proceeding linearly with the square root of time which is the early time absorption behaviour of classical infiltration theory the dbl treatment had substantially slower advance rates indicating its infiltration was greater than that of the sc and nt treatments that the rate of advance is controlled by a process other than the hydraulics of open channel flow is easily confirmed by comparing flow velocities calculated with manning s formula with field measured data using the cambooya furrow dimensions slope and furrow length with an appropriate range of flow depths 10 and 35 mm and a very conservative roughness coefficient of 0 033 for short grass chow 1959 p 112 manning s formula produced flow velocities of 59 and 124 mm s these contrasted with much smaller field measured flow velocities of 15 and 35 mm s for the experimental cut off times of the first and second irrigations 9 and 4 h respectively 4 4 soil moisture measurements 4 4 1 pre irrigation the initial soil moisture content of an infiltration event provides the boundary conditions that determine the sorptivity philip 1957b the soil moisture profiles beneath each of the soil management treatments prior to the first and second irrigations fig 4 a b exhibited some statistical differences p 0 05 between treatments prior to the first irrigation but these were of no practical significance because the moisture contents at all depths in all treatments for both irrigations were within 5 of considerably greater importance however were the large differences between the initial moisture profiles of the first and second irrigations prior to the first irrigation the mean moisture content of the 0 600 mm depth of all treatments was close to half field capacity and prior to the second irrigation it was less than permanent wilting point the near constant moisture content of the 600 1000 mm layer was close to field capacity throughout the experimental period the small excess or deficit from fc moisture content of this layer first irrigation an excess of 4 4 mm second irrigation a deficit of 6 1 mm illustrated that this layer had virtually no capacity to store excess water draining from the 0 600 mm layer therefore estimates of the irrigation requirement for the cambooya soil should be based only on the moisture deficit of 0 600 mm depth of soil profile 4 4 2 during irrigation the changing moisture content profiles in each of the treatments during the first and second irrigations shown as contours beneath a cross section of the furrows and beds in figs 5 and 7 illustrate no substantial differences in antecedent soil moisture profiles between treatments but large and statistically significant treatment differences p 0 05 at times close to when the bed centres of the dbl treatment had reached fc the differences between treatments become clearer when data are presented as infiltration θ₁ θ₀ contours at key times during water applications figs 6 and 8 the dbl treatment with its larger and more stable tilth porosity had a clear dominance of lateral infiltration over radial downwards infiltration in both the first and second irrigations in contrast the sc and nt treatments had wetting fronts that moved radially downwards from the furrow with no noticeable lateral penetration for example in the first irrigation the dbl treatment had 20 mm of infiltration penetrate laterally 900 mm and vertically only 300 mm a ratio of 3 1 while the sc and nt treatments had 20 mm penetrate approximately 300 mm laterally and vertically a ratio of 1 1 in the second irrigation the dbl treatment had 35 mm of infiltration penetrate 950 mm laterally and 300 mm vertically a ratio of 3 2 1 0 the sc treatment had 30 mm water penetrate laterally 550 mm and vertically 500 mm a ratio of 1 1 1 0 and the nt treatment had 30 mm penetrate 500 mm laterally and 500 mm vertically a ratio of 1 0 1 0 clearly the dbl treatment produced soil conditions that dramatically improved horizontal water absorption in the 0 300 mm soil layer to the extent that it occurred more quickly than radial downwards infiltration in the first irrigation the moisture data show the dbl treatment had the centre of its beds wet to almost field capacity after 6 7 h whereas at that time the centre of the beds in the sc and nt remained well short of field capacity in fact the centres of the beds in the sc and nt beds remained substantially unsaturated at the end of the 9 h irrigation application a similar but more differentiated set of results was obtained in the second irrigation dbl bed centres wet to field capacity around 4 h of irrigation and the sc and nt bed centres remained well short of saturation at the end of the 8 h moisture monitoring the ability of the dbl treatment to rapidly absorb water laterally so that the wetting fronts from adjacent furrows met quickly and largely saturated the centre of beds was clearly a manifestation of the creation and retention of considerable tilth porosity fig 2 comparatively the smaller amount and larger loss of tilth porosity in the sc and nt treatments produced steeper and slower moving wetting fronts than those of the dbl treatment figs 5 8 having irrigation water reach the centre of beds quickly is a key concern of irrigation farmers if this can be achieved the likelihood would be that less water and less time to irrigate would be needed and probably deep drainage losses would be smaller the other notable feature of the data in figs 5 8 is that generally the wetting fronts in all treatments but particularly in the dbl treatment were diffuse i e moisture gradients were small extending up to 1000 mm during both irrigations this phenomenon is typical of a linear soil in which the diffusivity is effectively constant over a wide range of moisture contents philip 1969 4 5 infiltration analyses the wide difference in antecedent moisture contents between the first and second irrigations respectively approximately half field capacity and less than permanent wilting point meant that the two irrigations took place on soils with vastly different macroporosity shrinkage cracks the first irrigation took place after 70 mm of rain over 23 days of mild spring temperatures and early crop growth and the second irrigation after a further 63 mm of rain and 120 mm irrigation over 54 days of summer heat and rapid crop growth soil moisture data of the first irrigation plotted as the mean cumulative infiltration vs the square root of time produced the classical linear relationships of absorption theory for early time 2 dimensional absorption into the whole profile and 1 dimensional lateral absorption into the beds fig 9 a b table 3 they thus illustrated that infiltration was driven by capillary forces with no discernible influence of gravity in reality the resultant values of sorptivity are flow weighted means because they embody the effects of variations in bulk density and moisture content with depth and the artificial partitioning of lateral flow is obviously a net value that excludes some radial downwards flow the same type of analyses could not be used for the data from the second irrigation because of the initial and substantial non darcian flow of water into large cracks in the dry swelling soil these cracks created a supply surface of free water that was much larger and indeterminate than the area of the furrow base and bed shoulders and resulted in quite large very short term entry of water into the soil fig 10 a b however the lateral and radial downwards absorption of water into the bed and the soil beneath it can only be the consequence of capillary forces hence because of this reality the graphical sorptivity values for the second irrigation were approximated by the slope of the line between zero and the final measured increase in infiltration in the 0 300 mm bed and whole profile and these values are presented in table 4 in both the first and second irrigations the lateral 1 dimensional and radial downwards 2 dimensional sorptivity values for the dbl treatment were considerably larger than those for the sc and nt treatments this was a clear expression of the larger and more stable tilth porosity in the 0 300 mm layer of this treatment notwithstanding the influence of the shrinkage cracks the fact that the sorptivity values for all treatments in the second irrigation were larger than in the first irrigation was due to the soil profile being substantially drier at the time of the second irrigation particularly the 0 600 mm depth the differences between the lateral and radial downwards sorptivity of the sc and nt treatments evident in the first irrigation did not persist to the second irrigation in the latter irrigation they were effectively the same despite the 0 300 mm layer being comparatively very much drier relative to the underlying soil the disappearance of this difference can only be interpreted as a consequence of the loss of tilth porosity in the 0 300 mm layer of these treatments that occurred between the first and second irrigations and or during the second irrigation figs 1 and 2 4 6 adequacy of philip s theory in addition to the linearity of the cumulative infiltration vs square root of time relationships the adequacy of philip s theory of 2 dimensional infiltration and the derived sorptivity values were further assessed by checking that i the radius of the furrows used in the experiments was the values calculated by inequality 4 and 0 25 when calculated by eq 5 ii predictions of the time for the bed centres to reach a specified moisture content were close to the monitored times when moisture contents reached that value and iii checking eq 2 was capable of predicting the amounts of water actually applied 4 6 1 furrow radius values of ro 4 and ro 5 were calculated for each of the soil management treatments in both irrigations for radial downwards infiltration into the profile beneath the furrows and beds and lateral infiltration into the beds tables 5 and 6 these calculations used the graphically derived sorptivity values tables 3 and 4 approximate values of the experimental increase in moisture content and the radius of the field furrows in addition they used assumed but conservative i e large values of the change in hydraulic conductivity k 240 and 480 mm day in all cases the calculated ro and ro values were comfortably greater than the radius of the field furrows 300 mm and very much 0 25 the values at which the use of absorption theory alone becomes inappropriate philip 1969 4 6 2 time to bed centre the derived values of lateral sorptivity allowed predictions of the times for water to wet the centre of beds tbc to a chosen level of satiation i e saturation entrapped air for each of the soil management treatments these calculations were made for the time the soil moisture content at the bed centres reached field capacity fctbc furthermore they took account of the reality that the soil moisture content ranges from satiation at the supply surface to the specified moisture content at the bed centre e g fctbc data of the predicted approach to fctbc fig 11 and measured values for fctbc in the dbl treatment for the first and second irrigations table 7 show remarkable agreement given the errors involved in the tri replicated moisture probe data natural field variability and the large amounts of soil shrinkage cracks present at the time of the second irrigation the fact that comparisons for the sc and nt treatments could not be made because predicted times exceeded the duration of soil moisture monitoring and water applications implied the bed centres of these treatments were drier than field capacity when soil moisture monitoring ceased at 9 and 8 h figs 5d and f 7 d and f and 10 a b 4 6 3 amount of water required the ability of philip s absorption theory to predict the measured amount of infiltration into the furrows and beds to the depth of 1000 mm at specified times was assessed by using eq 2 and the graphically derived sorptivity data for lateral and radial downwards flow tables 3 and 4 comparisons of measured vs predicted infiltration at fctbc for the dbl treatment where fctbc ta and at ta for the sc and nt treatments where fctbc ta table 8 showed good agreement linear regression slope of 1 09 and a goodness of fit r2 of 0 91 given the inherent errors caused by soil variability equipment error and soil shrinkage cracks at the time of the second irrigation the agreement between measured and predicted data was very good and further confirmed the adequacy of philip s theory 4 7 improved irrigation efficiency and effectiveness given the established predictive capacity of the theory the efficiency of irrigations on the three soil management treatments was assessed by calculating the amount of water needed to reach fc at the bed centre the data in table 8 show the dbl treatment required less water to reach fc at the bed centre than the sc and nt treatments 14 and 34 mm less in the first irrigation and 91 and 66 mm in the second irrigation or between 12 and 36 less water these irrigation savings become even more substantial over a growing season that requires multiple applications of water the effectiveness of irrigations was assessed by the ability of each treatment to absorb the required amount of water in the shortest time plus the proportion of total infiltration above 600 mm depth the fctbc data table 8 show the dbl treatment was clearly superior in the first irrigation dbl fctbc was 0 6 of sc ftbc and 0 4 of nt fctbc in the second irrigation the dbl fctbc was 0 3 of the sc fctbc and nt fctbc the amounts of infiltration absorbed in each of the three soil layers up to dbl fctbc fig 12 show the dbl treatment absorbs more water more quickly than the sc and nt treatments especially in the 0 300 mm layer in the first and the 0 600 mm layer in the second irrigation furthermore the dbl treatment reached fc in the bed centres while the bed centres of the sc and nt treatments did not figs 5d and f and 7 d and f all treatments had the same penetration of water below 600 mm depth fig 12a b over the 9 and 8 h durations of soil moisture monitoring in both irrigations the data in table 8 and fig 12 clearly show dbl soil management will facilitate more efficient and effective irrigation provided inflow rates and application times are properly specified and applied 4 8 probable deep drainage the data in table 8 also indicate probable deep drainage losses for the dbl treatment ceasing water applications at fctbc rather than ta would have saved 15 and 93 mm or 10 and 35 of water in the first and second irrigations respectively conversely for the sc and nt treatments continuing water applications beyond ta until fctbc would have added in the first irrigation an extra 13 and 37 mm to the sc and nt treatments that were already close to fc and 74 and 71 mm in the second irrigation which would have exceeded their profile satiation values both these treatments had satiated profiles beneath their furrows and bed shoulders at ta figs 5d and f and 7 dand f 4 9 llustrative examples of field application two examples are presented of the application of this technology to the field these use dbl data for fctbc and the antecedent soil moisture conditions of the first and second irrigations at cambooya these initial moisture conditions probably span those farmers are likely to experience the first irrigation had a field capacity deficit for the 0 600 mm soil depth of about 10 of total porosity the second irrigation a deficit of about 20 the prerequisites for applying this technology are knowledge of the a soil moisture contents at field

volume of water applied is the amount needed to raise the moisture content of the 0 600 mm depth of soil to field capacity at the bed centres i e the deficit to field capacity plus one half of the difference between field capacity at the bed centre and satiation at the bed shoulders given that infiltration controls the rate of advance along furrows the required volume has to be applied at an inflow rate that ensures the full length of beds experience the same duration of water supply in other words the volume required for the 0 600 mm soil depth for the full length of beds needs to be applied at a rate that provides water to all points of a furrow s length for the duration of fctbc such volumes are then divided by the fctbc to determine the required inflow rate the required inflow rates are obtained from relationships between furrow length the duration of application fctbc for specific soil moisture deficits as shown in fig 13 a b and the siphon specifications diameter length and hydraulic head to supply water at the required rates can be found from the tables and the theoretical equation provided by wigginton 2012 for the first and second irrigations respectively the 0 600 mm depth field capacity deficits fc600 were 10 and 20 the fctbc were 7 1 h and 4 3 h and furrow lengths were 500 m the required inflow rates are thus 2 l s fig 13a and 8 l s fig 13b these inflow rates require siphon diameters of 50 mm and 75 mm the diameter used at cambooya for both irrigations was 50 mm with the benefit of hindsight provided by knowledge of the soil benefits of dbl practice and irrigation management based on philip s infiltration theory the use of moisture deficits to 1000 mm profile depth longer than necessary water application time and the use of a smaller siphon pipe diameter than was required for the second irrigation the amount of water applied at cambooya was approximately double the amount required amounts of 1 2 and 2 4 ml ha 120 and 240 mm of water were applied in the first and second irrigations respectively when theoretically 0 6 and 1 2 ml ha 60 and 120 mm of water would have sufficed 5 discussion although this research has demonstrated that philip s 2 dimensional infiltration theory is capable of describing infiltration from furrows in a black self mulching soil improvements in irrigation efficiency and effectiveness were achieved only by the dbl treatment almost certainly these benefits will be achievable on other less well structured soils recent research published by the senior author and referenced herein showed dbl increased root growth organic carbon and soil structure stability plus other associated benefits in deepened seedbeds on unstable shallow texture contrast soils under dry and wet rainfed cropping systems at several sites in western australia and on a dispersive fine sandy clay loam soil under furrow irrigation cropping conditions in pakistan the essential requirements for the dbl produced soil improvements are herbicide weed control no cultivation and soil loosening that severs roots at 250 300 mm depth without any soil inversion this action preserves conserves a deeper than normal enhanced root mass that provides physical reinforcing against soil reconsolidation and maintains a food source for soil biota to the best of the senior author s knowledge the only machine capable of producing these conditions is the specially designed deep blade loosener appendix furthermore dbl soil management is probably capable of creating and maintaining even larger improvements in tilth stability and associated benefits than those so far reported from annual cropping systems in double cropping farming systems i e two crops a year there would be less time for roots to decay between harvest and seeding and thus the constrained reconsolidation measured in these experiments would be even less many irrigation farmers in australia use cultivation which produces structurally unstable soil that disaggregates on wetting and slows the penetration of irrigation water to the centre of beds in consequence they use narrow beds i e two beds per tractor trackwidth compared to 2 m wide bed spacing narrow beds have 25 less soil volume 33 more surface area and furrows occupy at least 50 of a paddock s surface area the smaller soil volume in narrow beds makes them more prone to satiation and deep drainage losses as well as greater water loss by soil evaporation because of their larger surface area compared to wide beds narrow beds are more difficult to efficiently irrigate using the same site soil and moisture conditions as existed at cambooya plus figs 11 and 13 calculations showed that while the sc and nt narrow beds have shorter fctbc the small amount of water needed to reach fc combined with the lack of differentiation between lateral and radial downwards sorptivity means that deep drainage would be difficult to avoid furthermore the smaller soil volume in narrow beds would have less inertia and internal friction and cause the dbl machine to considerably disturb the soil and diminish its ability to sever roots and leave the root mass of previous crops effectively undisturbed the agreement between experimental data and theoretical predictions provide confidence that the water savings identified for dbl beds are sound considerable and economically advantageous for crops watered twice a season the average savings dbl vs sc nt 2 table 8 for the first and second irrigations 24 and 79 mm or 20 30 produce estimates of seasonal water savings of between 0 48 and 1 58 ml ha 48 and 158 mm for a 1000 ha crop these savings would amount to 480 to 1580 ml using the average cost of water in the murray darling basin of australia which ranges from 1500 to 3500 aud ml market price information www agriculture gov au 2018 the total value of savings would range between of 1 20 m to 3 95 m for the two seasonal irrigation scenarios 6 conclusions philip s two dimensional theory of infiltration was shown to be applicable to field scale furrow irrigation for deep blade loosening dbl shallow cultivation sc and no tillage nt forms of soil management on a vertisol soil the usefulness of this theory was most conclusively shown for the dbl form of soil management dbl created near stable tilth porosity in the 0 300 mm soil layer that produced larger values of sorptivity for lateral than radial downwards flow which ensured lateral water penetration dominated sorptivity values of the sc and nt treatments were smaller than those in the dbl treatment and had ratios of lateral radial downwards sorptivity close to unity infiltration under these forms of soil management was slower and radially downwards in direction which caused soil beneath the furrows and bed shoulders to saturate and lose water to deep drainage before bed centres became wet the combination of 2 dimensional infiltration theory and dbl soil management generated a scientifically sound and simple method of predicting the rate and duration of water applications it is based on the time water is observed or measured to reach the centre of beds and uses this to define the required rate and duration of application and in turn the flow rates required of siphons or other types of application device dbl managed beds will ensure water moves dominantly laterally to the centre of wide beds and allow this practice to make furrow irrigation more efficient and effective conservative calculations show the water savings are likely to be in the order of 0 25 to 0 80 ml ha irrigation which represents a substantial reduction in costs and pressure on the environment declaration of competing interest the key to implementing this form of irrigation practice is the specially designed soil

council the authors also acknowledge the hospitality expertise and financial support of farmer david house cambooya qld appendix a the design of the dbl machine and its functions represent a paradigm shift in cultivation its objectives extend well beyond the historical objectives of cultivation to kill weeds and create a seedbed that facilitates germination and establishment it is not however a primary tillage machine it is designed to operate in a tilth of about 250 mm depth created initially by a chisel plough or like machine and thereafter each season in a near stable tilth it can be used either a stand alone operation or a single operation in tandem with a no tillage seeder the soil management objectives of this machine are i to remove and prevent the reformation of hardpans or ploughpans most of which occur between 150 and 250 mm depth ii to avoid soil inversion and the exposure of roots and soil biota to desiccation and uv irradiation iii to facilitate enhanced root growth and development iv to retain the structure and mass of enhanced root systems of previous crops in a near undisturbed state v to facilitate the creation and maintenance of a deepened loose and structurally stable root zone that prevents or minimises reconsolidation and maintains good water and air movement properties the machinery design objectives of the dbl were to create a machine capable of achieving these soil management objectives with i the lowest possible draft requirements so as to make possible a single pass operation in tandem with a no till seeder and thus retain the major operational and cost benefits of no tillage practice ii the lowest possible likelihood of creating a ploughpan and or smeared surface on the soil immediately beneath its operational depth and iii the maximum possible cutting efficiency to slice rather than shear roots the furrowers were designed to excavate a flat furrow base with an adjustable width of cut to match the width of implement tyres and so prevent compaction of bed shoulders in a system using permanent beds the furrow bases will become compacted which will limit infiltration beneath the furrow and allow a greater proportion of water to infiltrate into the beds these design objectives were achieved according to operators who were both farmers and research assistants they observed that a john deere 7700 tractor with a drawbar power rating of 116 hp or 87 kw operated a 7 5 m wide three and two half bed dbl machine with blades and furrowers with ease at 6 8 kph the machine can be constructed to span one one and two

10565,internationally furrow irrigation efficiency remains frustratingly less than desired in australia reviews of irrigated cotton farming reveal deep drainage losses are at least 1 0 ml ha cropping season and irrigators are using excessive cultivation which causes rapid consolidation of tilth and slows infiltration this research sought to i evaluate the ability of deep blade loosening dbl shallow cultivation sc and no tillage nt soil management practices and 2 dimensional infiltration theory to respectively facilitate and predict lateral water penetration to the centre of wide beds 2 m spacing and ii to develop a simple irrigation practice based on assured wetting of bed centres field scale research was undertaken on self mulching clay on the queensland darling downs bulk density 0 300 mm depth and soil moisture changes to 1000 mm depth beneath furrows and beds were monitored in a maize crop that was irrigated twice the duration of water applications water inflow rates and water advance in furrows were also recorded the absorption form of 2 dimensional infiltration theory predicted the time for water to reach the centre of beds and the amount of water infiltrated at given times in all treatments only the dbl treatment enhanced lateral sorptivity and infiltration it had a ratio of lateral to vertical water penetration of 3 1 in contrast the sc and nt treatments had ratios of 1 1 took two to three times longer for bed centres to wet and were much more susceptible to deep drainage losses beneath furrows and bed shoulders an illustrative example shows how this technology specifies the rate and duration of water applications and improves irrigation efficiency and effectiveness conservative estimates of water savings generated by its use lie between 0 25 and 0 80 ml ha irrigation or 20 30 of water irrigation keywords stable tilth porosity lateral sorptivity time to bed centre irrigation efficiency 1 introduction furrow irrigation practice despite considerable research over the past 40 50 years remains less efficient than is desirable particularly given that diminishing water resources caused by global population growth and climate change are causing irregular and diminishing rainfall and insecure water supplies in traditional irrigation areas steffen et al 2018 in australia between 90 and 80 of the national cotton crop which is by far the largest irrigation crop 400 000 ha of a total irrigated area of 2 million ha anon 2016 is grown under furrow irrigation recent reviews of cotton irrigation roth et al 2013 silburn et al 2013 have identified that despite i improvements over the last 20 30 years in the whole farm irrigation efficiency index and ii increases in the crop water use efficiency cotton crops are still using 7 ml ha or 700 mm of irrigation water and losing 7 3 ml ha 730 mm as evapotranspiration and 0 5 1 0 ml ha or 50 100 mm season as deep drainage in other terms more than the seasonal rainfall is lost to deep drainage these authors also found saturated soil at depths of 2 6 m beneath irrigated fields and no saturated soil under native vegetation in the same landscapes they concluded there was considerable scope and need for further improvements in irrigation efficiency most recent attempts to improve furrow irrigation practice have involved models such as iparm irrigation parameters and runoff model gillies and smith 2005 which calculates one dimensional infiltration characteristics in the form of the kostiakov infiltration equation from data of water advance along and runoff from furrows and sirmod iii surface irrigation simulation model walker 2003 into which these infiltration characteristics are inserted along with data of furrow geometry slope length inflow rate and cut off time the outputs from these models are inflow rates and cut off times that attempt to match inflow with infiltration and minimise runoff and deep drainage losses and walker 2003 and gillies and smith 2005 predict improvements in the order of 20 25 should be possible apart from the input data for these models being beyond the resources of irrigation farmers the models have inherent weaknesses they implicitly assume that the results from just one analysis will apply for all seasonal and soil conditions over time assuming that these conditions are unchanging more explicitly these models take no account of i seasonal changes in the water content of the soil prior to the application of water and the influence this has on infiltration and ii reconsolidation of tilth caused by wetting and drying of the soil and the changes this makes to the distribution of pore sizes and hydraulic properties of soil furthermore because they are one dimensional these models are incapable of providing information on the extent and amount of water that moves laterally towards the centre of beds at a shallow depth where most crop roots exist akbar et al 2015 used the hydrus 2d software of simunek and genuchten 2007 to examine the lateral movement of water into beds at the same site with the same treatments as reported in this paper whilst their results are similar to those reported here the outputs require detailed experimental input assumed non varying soil hydraulic properties and considerable computer time all of which need to be replicated for each set of field circumstances the resources and time required for such modelling are well beyond those available to farmers the theory of two and three dimensional infiltration was developed 50 years ago philip 1969 and despite some work at that time to apply it field soils peck and talsma 1968 talsma 1969 plus other relevant theoretical work to illustrate the applicability of infiltration theory to highly structured philip 1968 and heterogeneous soils philip 1967 no substantial progress has been made with its application to field irrigation practice the reasons for this lack of application have never been published but undoubtedly include i the lack until the late 1990s of technology that continuously monitors soil moisture changes in field soils ii the variation in infiltration that results from changes in the soil moisture content and iii the changes in soil water transmission properties between and during irrigation events that occurs due to disaggregation and reconsolidation of loose tilth field soil moisture content changes can now be monitored and recorded telemetrically in real time e g alva et al 2003 and sentek plus compact and the soil management practice of deep blade loosening dbl appendix has been shown to increase root growth and conserve root mass through to at least the next cropping season hamilton et al 2016 2019 this practice creates and maintains near stable tilth porosity in a deepened seedbed in addition irrigation scheduling can constrain soil moisture changes to a relatively narrow range between field capacity and one third of field capacity and thereby avoid variations in infiltration caused by large variations in antecedent soil moisture conditions these practical capabilities provide the opportunity to test philip s two and three dimensional infiltration theory under real farming conditions if successful the theory can provide a much simpler and scientifically sound means of overcoming difficult management challenges such as i identifying an optimum width and depth of beds ii creating a near stable tilth porosity with properties that ensure water rapidly reaches the centre of beds and iii easily identifying an optimum rate and duration of water application that uniformly wets beds and minimises deep drainage the objectives of this research were to examine the extent to which the improved soil structure created by the deep blade loosening dbl soil management practice will improve lateral infiltration and furrow irrigation efficiency compared to conventional cultivation sc and no tillage nt practices and the adequacy of philip s 2 dimensional infiltration theory to predict infiltration from furrows into the centre of beds and thereby identify appropriate water application rates and durations for some or all of the three forms of soil management 2 theory when philip extended his series solution of 1 dimensional infiltration theory 1957a to include long time periods and multi dimensional flow philip 1969 the influence of the geometry of the supply surface and gravity had to be included and the 1 dimensional series equation became 1 i st1 2 a 2t r0 a 3 t3 2 r0 2 where i is cumulative infiltration mm t is time h and s is sorptivity mm h1 2 an integral parameter that embodies the influence of capillarity on the transient flow processes that follow an abrupt change in moisture content and moisture potential at the surface of a porous medium and a n mmn tn 2 is the nth term of a series and r0 is the radius of the supply surface or furrow philip 1969 all of which are related to the gravity driven hydraulic conductivity mm h the first term on the right hand side of eq 1 describes absorption that is controlled entirely by capillarity the second term describes the linearly additive interactions of gravity and multiple dimensional flow which produce the initial deviations from t1 2 behaviour the third term is the leading term of non linear interactions between capillarity gravity and geometry although early time behaviour of multi dimensional flows is dominated by capillary forces over time the force of gravity and the influence of multi dimensional geometry become substantial when flow is horizontal or the time of the event is short capillary forces alone drive the process which is referred to as absorption and eq 1 reduces to 2 i st1 2 thus the appropriateness of which particular equation to use when examining the two dimensional flow of water from furrows into beds and the underlying soil depends on the i the magnitude of s a function of the surface and initial moisture contents philip 1957b ii the geometry of the supply surface and iii the duration of the irrigation event philip 1969 derived the following relationship to establish a criterion for the radius of a furrow that would ensure the influence of gravity does not exceed one tenth of the two dimensional absorption from a semi circular furrow 3 ro 2 a 2 m 2 5 a2 where ro is the radius of the supply surface or furrow a 2 is the second term of the series solution of the multi dimensional infiltration equation m is the number of dimensions and a2 is the second term of the 1 dimensional equation using the linearised approximation of infiltration which matches exactly the non linear solutions of infiltration at small times and in some integral sense at large times philip 1966a this inequality can be expressed in terms of the easily field measured soil parameters of sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity philip 1969 where a2 ½ k1 and a 2 m 2 π s2 8 θ1 θ0 where θ1 is the soil water content at the irrigation supply surface and θ0 is the soil water content before irrigation substituting these approximations into inequality 3 produces ro π s2 10 k1 θ1 θ0 or 4 0 314 s2 k1 θ1 θ0 given the exact series solution produces a value of the numerical factor in 4 of 0 352 the smaller factor of 0 314 calculated from the linearised analysis provides a more conservative criterion for the choice of ro to identify the influence of gravity a more explicit examination of the effect of gravity is available in the dimensionless form of the infiltration theory philip 1966b this produces 5 r₀ r₀ k₁ k₀ θ₁ θ₀ π s² where r₀ is dimensionless furrow radius r₀ is the furrow radius k₁ k₀ is the increase in k between the initial and final moisture contents θ₁ θ₀ and s is the sorptivity for this form of analysis to be appropriate i e the effect of gravity is insubstantial ro must be 0 25 several papers have provided insight on the applicability of this theory describing infiltration in field conditions to do so requires the theory to predict infiltration in soils that are heterogeneous vertically i e having layers with different pores size distributions different moisture contents and varying proportions of macro and microporosity philip 1966a demonstrated the classical soil water flow equation was indeed applicable in terms of the square root of time behaviour in heterogeneous soils with soil water potential profiles behaving simply across different layers while producing complicated apparently discontinuous moisture profiles subsequently philip 1967 studied the applicability of soil water absorption theory to aggregated soils made up of macro and micro porosity and found that any deviations from classical behaviour would be very short 2 min and small and that essentially aggregated soils behave in a classical manner with sorptivity effectively equal to that of the macro porosity alone furthermore in most field soils deeper layers are denser resulting in smaller hydraulic conductivity and moister decreasing the moisture and potential gradients at the wetting front of infiltrating water and sorptivity decreasing hydraulic conductivity causes the influence of gravity on infiltration to decrease as is evident from 4 and 5 in situations where water is infiltrating in two or three dimensions such field soil circumstances should cause water to move laterally under the influence of capillary forces for longer than would occur in homogeneous soils with uniform density and moisture content data of talsma 1970 talsma and van der lelij 1976 illustrate that capillary forces dominate for longer where hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity decrease with depth during one dimensional infiltration into swelling soils 3 methods 3 1 site details the experimental site was located at cambooya queensland lat 27 73 long 151 82 approximately 20 km south south west of toowoomba queensland and was situated on a long low slope 0 05 plain that has a deep self mulching black soil classified as ug 5 11 northcote 1984 or a haplic vertisol world soil resources report 106 2015 it was used from 2010 to 2012 3 2 treatments the experimentation at cambooya was undertaken at a practical scale using farm size machinery all irrigation and cropping activities were part of the commercial operation of the farm and the farmer was an active operational and financial partner the treatments and the number three and size of replicates 1 67 ha were chosen to be compatible with farming operations three contrasting soil management treatments were imposed on permanent raised beds deep blade loosening to a depth of about 250 mm dbl cultivation to a depth of about 100 mm sc and no tillage crop establishment on a consolidated seedbed nt the dbl machine has swept horizontal blades that sever roots lift and open the soil and then drop it there is no inversion and no horizontal displacement of soil and the structure and mass of the roots of previous crops are retained hamilton et al 2016 2019 in a bed and furrow system the blades operate only beneath the beds the soil beneath the furrows is left undisturbed and compacted by farm traffic the design and operational objectives of this machine are presented in the appendix the treatments were laid out in a tri replicated randomised block configuration and each replicate comprised three 2 m wide beds that were 465 m long all measurements were undertaken on the central bed the beds and furrows were formed with a bed top width of 1 5 m and furrow width 0 5 m which matched the 2 m trackwidth and tyre width of the available tractor crops were established on all three treatments with a disc type no tillage seeder in a controlled traffic operation crop husbandry operations were the same on all of treatments irrigation water was applied via 50 mm id siphon tubes to all treatments for a duration based on the farmer s knowledge and experience this practice applied water until it backed up to the height of the beds at the lower end of dammed furrows scheduling was based on estimates of about 65 of the stored water capacity of the 1000 mm soil profile depth irrigations were undertaken when crops needed watering and the water was available 3 3 field measurements the following measurements were made bulk density of the 0 300 mm depth water inflow rate water application duration the advance of water flow along the furrows changes in soil moisture content to 1000 mm depth during the application of water in the furrow centre and at 330 mm spacings from the furrow centre to the bed centre and the productivity of a maize crop see hamilton 2019 for data and commentary on productivity 3 3 1 bulk density bulk density was monitored to track changes in density and tilth porosity in the 0 300 mm depth of soil in all treatments prior to sowing prior to irrigations and at harvest nine samples were taken from the central bed of each of the tri replicated plots of each treatment at the top end mid point and lower end of each plot sampling depths were 50 150 and 250 mm undisturbed core samplers of 50 mm diameter by 50 mm length were used 3 3 2 soil moisture soil moisture content of the 0 1000 mm profile depth was recorded prior to and during each irrigation event using sentek enviroscan recording moisture probes the data from these were collected from sensors located at 100 200 300 400 700 and 1000 mm depth intervals every 10 min 3 3 3 irrigation measurements water application rates and its advance along furrows were measured with irrimate siphon flow meters and water advance sensors siphon flow meters were installed on one siphon in each replicate of each treatment five water advance sensors were installed at approximately 100 m intervals along furrows starting 50 m from the top end and advance was measured in four furrows of each treatment inflow rates were set according to experience with the aim being to have water reach the lower end of the furrows at the same time in all treatments time of the start and cut off of water application was recorded manually for each siphon 3 3 4 tilth porosity total porosity was calculated from the bulk density data using the standard value for the specific gravity of soil particles of 2 65 g cm³ the difference between seasonal changes in the 0 300 mm porosity of the dbl sc and nt treatments and the final most consolidated state of the nt control treatment provided a monitored measure of the extra porosity created by each treatment and the extent to which this was retained over time as reconsolidation occurred this extra porosity is termed tilth porosity to distinguish it from the naturally occurring forms of textural and structural porosity 3 3 5 sorptivity horizontal and radial downwards flow weighted mean sorptivity data were estimated from the slope of linear graphs of cumulative infiltration vs square root of time data for the 0 300 mm soil layer of the beds and the 1000 mm by 1000 mm profile beneath the furrows and beds the linearity of these graphs was used to assess the validity of square root of time behaviour of infiltration 3 3 6 infiltration field measured infiltration was calculated as the difference between moisture content readings over time from the installed moisture probes integrated over horizontal and vertical distances between probes at elapsed time intervals the validity of philip s theory was assessed by the linearity of graphs of cumulative infiltration vs the square root of elapsed time by the criterion of a furrow radius that ensures the influence a gravity does not exceed one tenth of the 2 dimensional absorption from a furrow inequality 4 and eq 5 the latter used conservative i e large values for the change in hydraulic conductivity and by the ability of eq 2 to predict infiltration at given times 4 results 4 1 bulk density the mean bulk density data for the 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 mm depths in each treatment show the dbl treatment was substantially and statistically significantly p 0 05 less dense than the sc and nt treatments throughout the experiment fig 1 at the time of seeding this difference occurred in the shallower depths only but over the season the less dense conditions in the dbl treatment extended throughout the 300 mm depth the shrink swell nature of this vertisol is unlikely to have confounded the measured differences in bulk density between the treatments berndt and coughlan 1976 showed that density measurements of vertisols below moisture contents of field capacity were essentially constant during the experimental period the average 0 300 mm moisture content ranged from 17 i e permanent wilting point to 43 i e field capacity only the data sampled prior to harvest were likely to be confounded by the swelling nature of this soil they were sampled with an average 0 300 mm moisture content of 52 and therefore at drier moisture contents may be denser than shown in fig 1d 4 2 tilth porosity the tilth porosity or extra porosity created by the soil management treatments at the time of seeding usually diminishes over time as soil reconsolidates in response to wetting and drying cycles the relative magnitude of tilth porosity created by the different soil treatments in the 0 300 mm depth of soil and its decline over the season in response to the cumulative amount of irrigation water applied and rainfall received fig 2 shows the dbl treatment created and retained 3 7 more tilth porosity than the sc and nt treatments the statistical analyses of the bulk density data indicate the differences in tilth porosity between the dbl treatment and the sc and nt treatments were significant and that those between the sc and nt treatments were statistically indistinguishable importantly at the time of the first and second irrigations the dbl treatment had between 3 and 7 more tilth porosity than the sc and nt treatments 4 3 irrigation measurements 4 3 1 mass balance in pursuing the objectives of this research it was essential that the surface irrigation measurements of siphon inflow and cut off time which allow the calculation of the depth of water applied match the measured increases in soil moisture content that occurred during irrigation mean data of such a mass balance for the three soil management treatments for both irrigations table 1 were within 10 which given errors in each of the measuring techniques and spatial variability of soil is very good 4 3 2 water advance along furrows data of the mean rate of advance of water in the furrows of the three soil management treatments fig 3 and table 2 show a straight line relationship for all soil management treatments r² 0 92 between the distance water travelled along a furrow and the square root of time given the inflow fluxes of water mm3 mm² s were constant for each replicate s irrigation this type of relationship indicated that water must be extracted from the inflow by a process that was also proceeding linearly with the square root of time which is the early time absorption behaviour of classical infiltration theory the dbl treatment had substantially slower advance rates indicating its infiltration was greater than that of the sc and nt treatments that the rate of advance is controlled by a process other than the hydraulics of open channel flow is easily confirmed by comparing flow velocities calculated with manning s formula with field measured data using the cambooya furrow dimensions slope and furrow length with an appropriate range of flow depths 10 and 35 mm and a very conservative roughness coefficient of 0 033 for short grass chow 1959 p 112 manning s formula produced flow velocities of 59 and 124 mm s these contrasted with much smaller field measured flow velocities of 15 and 35 mm s for the experimental cut off times of the first and second irrigations 9 and 4 h respectively 4 4 soil moisture measurements 4 4 1 pre irrigation the initial soil moisture content of an infiltration event provides the boundary conditions that determine the sorptivity philip 1957b the soil moisture profiles beneath each of the soil management treatments prior to the first and second irrigations fig 4 a b exhibited some statistical differences p 0 05 between treatments prior to the first irrigation but these were of no practical significance because the moisture contents at all depths in all treatments for both irrigations were within 5 of considerably greater importance however were the large differences between the initial moisture profiles of the first and second irrigations prior to the first irrigation the mean moisture content of the 0 600 mm depth of all treatments was close to half field capacity and prior to the second irrigation it was less than permanent wilting point the near constant moisture content of the 600 1000 mm layer was close to field capacity throughout the experimental period the small excess or deficit from fc moisture content of this layer first irrigation an excess of 4 4 mm second irrigation a deficit of 6 1 mm illustrated that this layer had virtually no capacity to store excess water draining from the 0 600 mm layer therefore estimates of the irrigation requirement for the cambooya soil should be based only on the moisture deficit of 0 600 mm depth of soil profile 4 4 2 during irrigation the changing moisture content profiles in each of the treatments during the first and second irrigations shown as contours beneath a cross section of the furrows and beds in figs 5 and 7 illustrate no substantial differences in antecedent soil moisture profiles between treatments but large and statistically significant treatment differences p 0 05 at times close to when the bed centres of the dbl treatment had reached fc the differences between treatments become clearer when data are presented as infiltration θ₁ θ₀ contours at key times during water applications figs 6 and 8 the dbl treatment with its larger and more stable tilth porosity had a clear dominance of lateral infiltration over radial downwards infiltration in both the first and second irrigations in contrast the sc and nt treatments had wetting fronts that moved radially downwards from the furrow with no noticeable lateral penetration for example in the first irrigation the dbl treatment had 20 mm of infiltration penetrate laterally 900 mm and vertically only 300 mm a ratio of 3 1 while the sc and nt treatments had 20 mm penetrate approximately 300 mm laterally and vertically a ratio of 1 1 in the second irrigation the dbl treatment had 35 mm of infiltration penetrate 950 mm laterally and 300 mm vertically a ratio of 3 2 1 0 the sc treatment had 30 mm water penetrate laterally 550 mm and vertically 500 mm a ratio of 1 1 1 0 and the nt treatment had 30 mm penetrate 500 mm laterally and 500 mm vertically a ratio of 1 0 1 0 clearly the dbl treatment produced soil conditions that dramatically improved horizontal water absorption in the 0 300 mm soil layer to the extent that it occurred more quickly than radial downwards infiltration in the first irrigation the moisture data show the dbl treatment had the centre of its beds wet to almost field capacity after 6 7 h whereas at that time the centre of the beds in the sc and nt remained well short of field capacity in fact the centres of the beds in the sc and nt beds remained substantially unsaturated at the end of the 9 h irrigation application a similar but more differentiated set of results was obtained in the second irrigation dbl bed centres wet to field capacity around 4 h of irrigation and the sc and nt bed centres remained well short of saturation at the end of the 8 h moisture monitoring the ability of the dbl treatment to rapidly absorb water laterally so that the wetting fronts from adjacent furrows met quickly and largely saturated the centre of beds was clearly a manifestation of the creation and retention of considerable tilth porosity fig 2 comparatively the smaller amount and larger loss of tilth porosity in the sc and nt treatments produced steeper and slower moving wetting fronts than those of the dbl treatment figs 5 8 having irrigation water reach the centre of beds quickly is a key concern of irrigation farmers if this can be achieved the likelihood would be that less water and less time to irrigate would be needed and probably deep drainage losses would be smaller the other notable feature of the data in figs 5 8 is that generally the wetting fronts in all treatments but particularly in the dbl treatment were diffuse i e moisture gradients were small extending up to 1000 mm during both irrigations this phenomenon is typical of a linear soil in which the diffusivity is effectively constant over a wide range of moisture contents philip 1969 4 5 infiltration analyses the wide difference in antecedent moisture contents between the first and second irrigations respectively approximately half field capacity and less than permanent wilting point meant that the two irrigations took place on soils with vastly different macroporosity shrinkage cracks the first irrigation took place after 70 mm of rain over 23 days of mild spring temperatures and early crop growth and the second irrigation after a further 63 mm of rain and 120 mm irrigation over 54 days of summer heat and rapid crop growth soil moisture data of the first irrigation plotted as the mean cumulative infiltration vs the square root of time produced the classical linear relationships of absorption theory for early time 2 dimensional absorption into the whole profile and 1 dimensional lateral absorption into the beds fig 9 a b table 3 they thus illustrated that infiltration was driven by capillary forces with no discernible influence of gravity in reality the resultant values of sorptivity are flow weighted means because they embody the effects of variations in bulk density and moisture content with depth and the artificial partitioning of lateral flow is obviously a net value that excludes some radial downwards flow the same type of analyses could not be used for the data from the second irrigation because of the initial and substantial non darcian flow of water into large cracks in the dry swelling soil these cracks created a supply surface of free water that was much larger and indeterminate than the area of the furrow base and bed shoulders and resulted in quite large very short term entry of water into the soil fig 10 a b however the lateral and radial downwards absorption of water into the bed and the soil beneath it can only be the consequence of capillary forces hence because of this reality the graphical sorptivity values for the second irrigation were approximated by the slope of the line between zero and the final measured increase in infiltration in the 0 300 mm bed and whole profile and these values are presented in table 4 in both the first and second irrigations the lateral 1 dimensional and radial downwards 2 dimensional sorptivity values for the dbl treatment were considerably larger than those for the sc and nt treatments this was a clear expression of the larger and more stable tilth porosity in the 0 300 mm layer of this treatment notwithstanding the influence of the shrinkage cracks the fact that the sorptivity values for all treatments in the second irrigation were larger than in the first irrigation was due to the soil profile being substantially drier at the time of the second irrigation particularly the 0 600 mm depth the differences between the lateral and radial downwards sorptivity of the sc and nt treatments evident in the first irrigation did not persist to the second irrigation in the latter irrigation they were effectively the same despite the 0 300 mm layer being comparatively very much drier relative to the underlying soil the disappearance of this difference can only be interpreted as a consequence of the loss of tilth porosity in the 0 300 mm layer of these treatments that occurred between the first and second irrigations and or during the second irrigation figs 1 and 2 4 6 adequacy of philip s theory in addition to the linearity of the cumulative infiltration vs square root of time relationships the adequacy of philip s theory of 2 dimensional infiltration and the derived sorptivity values were further assessed by checking that i the radius of the furrows used in the experiments was the values calculated by inequality 4 and 0 25 when calculated by eq 5 ii predictions of the time for the bed centres to reach a specified moisture content were close to the monitored times when moisture contents reached that value and iii checking eq 2 was capable of predicting the amounts of water actually applied 4 6 1 furrow radius values of ro 4 and ro 5 were calculated for each of the soil management treatments in both irrigations for radial downwards infiltration into the profile beneath the furrows and beds and lateral infiltration into the beds tables 5 and 6 these calculations used the graphically derived sorptivity values tables 3 and 4 approximate values of the experimental increase in moisture content and the radius of the field furrows in addition they used assumed but conservative i e large values of the change in hydraulic conductivity k 240 and 480 mm day in all cases the calculated ro and ro values were comfortably greater than the radius of the field furrows 300 mm and very much 0 25 the values at which the use of absorption theory alone becomes inappropriate philip 1969 4 6 2 time to bed centre the derived values of lateral sorptivity allowed predictions of the times for water to wet the centre of beds tbc to a chosen level of satiation i e saturation entrapped air for each of the soil management treatments these calculations were made for the time the soil moisture content at the bed centres reached field capacity fctbc furthermore they took account of the reality that the soil moisture content ranges from satiation at the supply surface to the specified moisture content at the bed centre e g fctbc data of the predicted approach to fctbc fig 11 and measured values for fctbc in the dbl treatment for the first and second irrigations table 7 show remarkable agreement given the errors involved in the tri replicated moisture probe data natural field variability and the large amounts of soil shrinkage cracks present at the time of the second irrigation the fact that comparisons for the sc and nt treatments could not be made because predicted times exceeded the duration of soil moisture monitoring and water applications implied the bed centres of these treatments were drier than field capacity when soil moisture monitoring ceased at 9 and 8 h figs 5d and f 7 d and f and 10 a b 4 6 3 amount of water required the ability of philip s absorption theory to predict the measured amount of infiltration into the furrows and beds to the depth of 1000 mm at specified times was assessed by using eq 2 and the graphically derived sorptivity data for lateral and radial downwards flow tables 3 and 4 comparisons of measured vs predicted infiltration at fctbc for the dbl treatment where fctbc ta and at ta for the sc and nt treatments where fctbc ta table 8 showed good agreement linear regression slope of 1 09 and a goodness of fit r2 of 0 91 given the inherent errors caused by soil variability equipment error and soil shrinkage cracks at the time of the second irrigation the agreement between measured and predicted data was very good and further confirmed the adequacy of philip s theory 4 7 improved irrigation efficiency and effectiveness given the established predictive capacity of the theory the efficiency of irrigations on the three soil management treatments was assessed by calculating the amount of water needed to reach fc at the bed centre the data in table 8 show the dbl treatment required less water to reach fc at the bed centre than the sc and nt treatments 14 and 34 mm less in the first irrigation and 91 and 66 mm in the second irrigation or between 12 and 36 less water these irrigation savings become even more substantial over a growing season that requires multiple applications of water the effectiveness of irrigations was assessed by the ability of each treatment to absorb the required amount of water in the shortest time plus the proportion of total infiltration above 600 mm depth the fctbc data table 8 show the dbl treatment was clearly superior in the first irrigation dbl fctbc was 0 6 of sc ftbc and 0 4 of nt fctbc in the second irrigation the dbl fctbc was 0 3 of the sc fctbc and nt fctbc the amounts of infiltration absorbed in each of the three soil layers up to dbl fctbc fig 12 show the dbl treatment absorbs more water more quickly than the sc and nt treatments especially in the 0 300 mm layer in the first and the 0 600 mm layer in the second irrigation furthermore the dbl treatment reached fc in the bed centres while the bed centres of the sc and nt treatments did not figs 5d and f and 7 d and f all treatments had the same penetration of water below 600 mm depth fig 12a b over the 9 and 8 h durations of soil moisture monitoring in both irrigations the data in table 8 and fig 12 clearly show dbl soil management will facilitate more efficient and effective irrigation provided inflow rates and application times are properly specified and applied 4 8 probable deep drainage the data in table 8 also indicate probable deep drainage losses for the dbl treatment ceasing water applications at fctbc rather than ta would have saved 15 and 93 mm or 10 and 35 of water in the first and second irrigations respectively conversely for the sc and nt treatments continuing water applications beyond ta until fctbc would have added in the first irrigation an extra 13 and 37 mm to the sc and nt treatments that were already close to fc and 74 and 71 mm in the second irrigation which would have exceeded their profile satiation values both these treatments had satiated profiles beneath their furrows and bed shoulders at ta figs 5d and f and 7 dand f 4 9 llustrative examples of field application two examples are presented of the application of this technology to the field these use dbl data for fctbc and the antecedent soil moisture conditions of the first and second irrigations at cambooya these initial moisture conditions probably span those farmers are likely to experience the first irrigation had a field capacity deficit for the 0 600 mm soil depth of about 10 of total porosity the second irrigation a deficit of about 20 the prerequisites for applying this technology are knowledge of the a soil moisture contents at field capacity and satiation b 0 600 mm profile soil moisture content prior to irrigating c time water takes to reach the centre of beds when applied at different antecedent moisture contents i e fctbc the volume of water applied is the amount needed to raise the moisture content of the 0 600 mm depth of soil to field capacity at the bed centres i e the deficit to field capacity plus one half of the difference between field capacity at the bed centre and satiation at the bed shoulders given that infiltration controls the rate of advance along furrows the required volume has to be applied at an inflow rate that ensures the full length of beds experience the same duration of water supply in other words the volume required for the 0 600 mm soil depth for the full length of beds needs to be applied at a rate that provides water to all points of a furrow s length for the duration of fctbc such volumes are then divided by the fctbc to determine the required inflow rate the required inflow rates are obtained from relationships between furrow length the duration of application fctbc for specific soil moisture deficits as shown in fig 13 a b and the siphon specifications diameter length and hydraulic head to supply water at the required rates can be found from the tables and the theoretical equation provided by wigginton 2012 for the first and second irrigations respectively the 0 600 mm depth field capacity deficits fc600 were 10 and 20 the fctbc were 7 1 h and 4 3 h and furrow lengths were 500 m the required inflow rates are thus 2 l s fig 13a and 8 l s fig 13b these inflow rates require siphon diameters of 50 mm and 75 mm the diameter used at cambooya for both irrigations was 50 mm with the benefit of hindsight provided by knowledge of the soil benefits of dbl practice and irrigation management based on philip s infiltration theory the use of moisture deficits to 1000 mm profile depth longer than necessary water application time and the use of a smaller siphon pipe diameter than was required for the second irrigation the amount of water applied at cambooya was approximately double the amount required amounts of 1 2 and 2 4 ml ha 120 and 240 mm of water were applied in the first and second irrigations respectively when theoretically 0 6 and 1 2 ml ha 60 and 120 mm of water would have sufficed 5 discussion although this research has demonstrated that philip s 2 dimensional infiltration theory is capable of describing infiltration from furrows in a black self mulching soil improvements in irrigation efficiency and effectiveness were achieved only by the dbl treatment almost certainly these benefits will be achievable on other less well structured soils recent research published by the senior author and referenced herein showed dbl increased root growth organic carbon and soil structure stability plus other associated benefits in deepened seedbeds on unstable shallow texture contrast soils under dry and wet rainfed cropping systems at several sites in western australia and on a dispersive fine sandy clay loam soil under furrow irrigation cropping conditions in pakistan the essential requirements for the dbl produced soil improvements are herbicide weed control no cultivation and soil loosening that severs roots at 250 300 mm depth without any soil inversion this action preserves conserves a deeper than normal enhanced root mass that provides physical reinforcing against soil reconsolidation and maintains a food source for soil biota to the best of the senior author s knowledge the only machine capable of producing these conditions is the specially designed deep blade loosener appendix furthermore dbl soil management is probably capable of creating and maintaining even larger improvements in tilth stability and associated benefits than those so far reported from annual cropping systems in double cropping farming systems i e two crops a year there would be less time for roots to decay between harvest and seeding and thus the constrained reconsolidation measured in these experiments would be even less many irrigation farmers in australia use cultivation which produces structurally unstable soil that disaggregates on wetting and slows the penetration of irrigation water to the centre of beds in consequence they use narrow beds i e two beds per tractor trackwidth compared to 2 m wide bed spacing narrow beds have 25 less soil volume 33 more surface area and furrows occupy at least 50 of a paddock s surface area the smaller soil volume in narrow beds makes them more prone to satiation and deep drainage losses as well as greater water loss by soil evaporation because of their larger surface area compared to wide beds narrow beds are more difficult to efficiently irrigate using the same site soil and moisture conditions as existed at cambooya plus figs 11 and 13 calculations showed that while the sc and nt narrow beds have shorter fctbc the small amount of water needed to reach fc combined with the lack of differentiation between lateral and radial downwards sorptivity means that deep drainage would be difficult to avoid furthermore the smaller soil volume in narrow beds would have less inertia and internal friction and cause the dbl machine to considerably disturb the soil and diminish its ability to sever roots and leave the root mass of previous crops effectively undisturbed the agreement between experimental data and theoretical predictions provide confidence that the water savings identified for dbl beds are sound considerable and economically advantageous for crops watered twice a season the average savings dbl vs sc nt 2 table 8 for the first and second irrigations 24 and 79 mm or 20 30 produce estimates of seasonal water savings of between 0 48 and 1 58 ml ha 48 and 158 mm for a 1000 ha crop these savings would amount to 480 to 1580 ml using the average cost of water in the murray darling basin of australia which ranges from 1500 to 3500 aud ml market price information www agriculture gov au 2018 the total value of savings would range between of 1 20 m to 3 95 m for the two seasonal irrigation scenarios 6 conclusions philip s two dimensional theory of infiltration was shown to be applicable to field scale furrow irrigation for deep blade loosening dbl shallow cultivation sc and no tillage nt forms of soil management on a vertisol soil the usefulness of this theory was most conclusively shown for the dbl form of soil management dbl created near stable tilth porosity in the 0 300 mm soil layer that produced larger values of sorptivity for lateral than radial downwards flow which ensured lateral water penetration dominated sorptivity values of the sc and nt treatments were smaller than those in the dbl treatment and had ratios of lateral radial downwards sorptivity close to unity infiltration under these forms of soil management was slower and radially downwards in direction which caused soil beneath the furrows and bed shoulders to saturate and lose water to deep drainage before bed centres became wet the combination of 2 dimensional infiltration theory and dbl soil management generated a scientifically sound and simple method of predicting the rate and duration of water applications it is based on the time water is observed or measured to reach the centre of beds and uses this to define the required rate and duration of application and in turn the flow rates required of siphons or other types of application device dbl managed beds will ensure water moves dominantly laterally to the centre of wide beds and allow this practice to make furrow irrigation more efficient and effective conservative calculations show the water savings are likely to be in the order of 0 25 to 0 80 ml ha irrigation which represents a substantial reduction in costs and pressure on the environment declaration of competing interest the key to implementing this form of irrigation practice is the specially designed soil management machine the deep blade loosener on which the senior author declares a conflict of interest this machine has national and international patents pending applications for patents were applied

council the authors also acknowledge the hospitality expertise and financial support of farmer david house cambooya qld appendix a the design of the dbl machine and its functions represent a paradigm shift in cultivation its objectives extend well beyond the historical objectives of cultivation to kill weeds and create a seedbed that facilitates germination and establishment it is not however a primary tillage machine it is designed to operate in a tilth of about 250 mm depth created initially by a chisel plough or like machine and thereafter each season in a near stable tilth it can be used either a stand alone operation or a single operation in tandem with a no tillage seeder the soil management objectives of this machine are i to remove and prevent the reformation of hardpans or ploughpans most of which occur between 150 and 250 mm depth ii to avoid soil inversion and the exposure of roots and soil biota to desiccation and uv irradiation iii to facilitate enhanced root growth and development iv to retain the structure and mass of enhanced root systems of previous crops in a near undisturbed state v to facilitate the creation and maintenance of a deepened loose and structurally stable root zone that prevents or minimises reconsolidation and maintains good water and air movement properties the machinery design objectives of the dbl were to create a machine capable of achieving these soil management objectives with i the lowest possible draft requirements so as to make possible a single pass operation in tandem with a no till seeder and thus retain the major operational and cost benefits of no tillage practice ii the lowest possible likelihood of creating a ploughpan and or smeared surface on the soil immediately beneath its operational depth and iii the maximum possible cutting efficiency to slice rather than shear roots the furrowers were designed to excavate a flat furrow base with an adjustable width of cut to match the width of implement tyres and so prevent compaction of bed shoulders in a system using permanent beds the furrow bases will become compacted which will limit infiltration beneath the furrow and allow a greater proportion of water to infiltrate into the beds these design objectives were achieved according to operators who were both farmers and research assistants they observed that a john deere 7700 tractor with a drawbar power rating of 116 hp or 87 kw operated a 7 5 m wide three and two half bed dbl machine with blades and furrowers with ease at 6 8 kph the machine can be constructed to span one one and two half three and two half or five and two half beds of widths that match the trackwidth of tractors and other implements the machine has patents pending pct au2016 050737 fig a1 fig a2 appendix b

10566,in recent years there has been increasing interest in and adoption of supplemental irrigation in humid regions that have traditionally relied on rainfed agriculture in these regions irrigation typically supplements rainfall and serves as a risk management strategy to avoid losses in years with low precipitation however the higher returns achieved with irrigation may not be sufficient to offset its investment and operational costs the question of whether supplemental irrigation is profitable for a given farm is subject to many sources of uncertainty such as system costs energy requirements and yield response as well as year to year variability in weather energy and commodity prices previous research on financial outcomes of irrigation rarely considers this uncertainty and variability in a comprehensive manner limiting their practical use for agricultural decision making the objective of this work is to present a novel approach to representing uncertainty and variability in farm specific cost benefit analyses of supplemental irrigation based on two levels of monte carlo simulation the first level estimates annual returns for each year of an irrigation system s useful life based on multiple realizations of historic weather crop prices and energy prices to demonstrate year to year variability in financial returns the second level repeats this process under different assumptions regarding system investment and operational costs to represent epistemic uncertainty in these factors this approach is demonstrated with a simple decision support tool that estimates financial costs and benefits of irrigation for four commodity crops in virginia and shows how this uncertainty and variability can be presented for a general audience this approach can be used to assess irrigation profitability for different crops and irrigation systems and highlight how factors such as the fuel source or irrigation scheduling method used can impact profitability keywords monte carlo simulation decision support epistemic uncertainty variability aleatory uncertainty 1 introduction and background agriculture in humid regions such as the eastern united states has historically benefited from sufficient rainfall making irrigation unnecessary for many producers for instance the usda 2013 farm and ranch irrigation survey found that only 15 of cropland in virginia was irrigated united states department of agriculture usda 2014 however the use of irrigation has been growing significantly in this region with almost every state east of the mississippi river reporting an increase in irrigated area over the past decade walton 2014 the use of supplemental irrigation in these regions can result in significant yield improvements in some instances doubling yields over rainfed crops by avoiding water stress during critical growing periods payero and khalilian 2017 supplemental irrigation also serves to manage production risk by ensuring that yields can remain high even in years with limited rainfall and can improve farm incomes by allowing diversification of crops grown vandeveer et al 1989 however supplemental irrigation also introduces financial risk as the upfront and operating costs of irrigation are high and may not be made up by additional revenues particularly in years where rainfall is high or crop prices are low determining whether adoption of supplemental irrigation is economically beneficial requires consideration of upfront installation costs operating costs potential yield improvements and the additional financial returns that would result from these improvements a number of studies have assessed financial costs and benefits of irrigation in an effort to determine the situations where it is economically beneficial many of these studies take place in arid regions and present comparative analyses of different types of irrigation systems designs and management strategies for example economic comparisons between furrow sprinkler and drip irrigation have typically shown that systems with increasingly high upfront costs sprinkler and drip irrigation are only economically justified in situations where yields income and operating costs are all improved with the new system lamm et al 2010 letey et al 1990 montazar et al 2017 o brien et al 1998 prevatt et al 1992 rodrigues et al 2013b studies have also demonstrated how the choice of irrigation system design enciso et al 2005 schwankl et al 1999 and scheduling strategy rodrigues et al 2013a romero et al 2006 can influence the financial benefits of irrigation however studies in arid areas typically assume that some form of irrigation is required for production and thus don t address the question of whether or not irrigation should be installed at all studies of supplemental irrigation in humid regions show that irrigation is only profitable in certain situations while supplemental irrigation typically improves yields this is not always the case for instance it was found to lower spring hay production in tennessee zhou et al 2014 additionally improved yields may not necessarily equate to better financial returns for instance an assessment of supplemental corn irrigation in tennessee found that irrigation was only profitable when energy prices were lower and corn prices were higher than they have been historically boyer et al 2014 financial benefits are also dependent on weather conditions for instance an evaluation of corn cotton and peanut irrigation in north carolina found that in years with heavy rainfall irrigation didn t result in additional economic returns jordan et al 2014 these studies are typically based on economic assessments of a single production scenario for example jordan et al 2014 compared yields and economic returns from a pair of field experiments with and without irrigation for five years at a research station researchers have also composed economic estimates based on vendor provided irrigation system costs and experimental comparisons of crop yields with and without irrigation boyer et al 2014 o brien et al 1998 some studies calculate expected costs and returns of irrigation based on a case study farms or hypothetical example farms heard et al 2012 prevatt et al 1992 romero et al 2006 because these analyses only evaluate a single specific situation their findings may not be useful in informing practical decisions on farms of differing size soil type climate water availability and economic conditions generalized practical recommendations regarding the value of irrigation in differing situations requires information that can help inform investments in a wide variety of contexts enciso et al 2005 efforts to provide practical site specific guidance for irrigation decision making have often taken the form of computational decision support tools these tools allow a producer to enter information about their farm and irrigation needs and combine this information with stored data on irrigation costs and benefits to estimate the financial returns possible with different types of irrigation systems for example the irrigation cost analysis program icap combined user supplied farm information irrigation system cost estimates and model derived yield estimates to calculate the economic risks and returns associated with supplemental irrigation of corn in michigan martin et al 1996 another tool developed by researchers at kansas state university compares the economic costs and benefits of installing a subsurface drip system and a center pivot system to replace furrow irrigation for corn production lamm et al 2014 similarly the high plains regional climate center u2u irrigation investment decision support tool aims to help producers in determining the profitability of installing an irrigation system in the midwest andresen et al 2016 this tool allows agricultural producers to enter information about their farm and shows users the difference between irrigated and dryland yield as well as the additional profit per acre possible with irrigation these tools attempt to leverage the insights gained from studies on irrigation costs and benefits to support practical irrigation decision making on farms with differing characteristics however there are many sources of uncertainty and variability which can greatly impact the financial outcomes associated with supplemental irrigation for instance irrigation system prices can vary significantly based on material and energy costs lamm et al 2006 as well as system design schwankl et al 1999 and field size lamm et al 2010 however most studies and decision support tools are based on a single estimate of system costs derived either from industry estimates extension farm enterprise budgets or irrigation literature yield response to irrigation will depend on management practices soil health crop varieties and other production factors variability in crop prices has been shown to have a substantial impact in the overall financial feasibility of irrigation in a number of studies o brien et al 2010 rey et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2013b in humid regions economic outcomes are also sensitive to variability in weather with greater benefits in dry years jordan et al 2014 however economic estimates are often based on results from a single study period long term average weather conditions or a small subset of years e g one normal year and one dry year researchers have acknowledged that addressing this variability requires consideration of long term variability in costs and other economic factors o brien et al 2010 and more sophisticated methods are needed to address underlying uncertainty in economic assessments boyer et al 2014 without considering and clearly communicating this uncertainty the recommendations provided by these studies and decision support tools could potentially result in misleading information about the potential financial risks and benefits of irrigation while prior research has used different approaches to address this uncertainty and variability it is typically done in a limited fashion that undermines practical insights for irrigation decision making for instance a number of studies use sensitivity or scenario analyses to quantify how different uncertain factors influence economic outcomes these studies generate multiple estimates of financial costs and benefits under different assumptions about factors such as energy prices boyer et al 2014 crop prices o brien et al 2010 rey et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2013b yield response heard et al 2012 and irrigation system cost rodrigues et al 2013a however these analyses typically consider only a single uncertain factor at a time even though some of these factors may be correlated such as energy and production costs and if multiple uncertain factors are considered holistically this can dramatically impact overall profitability o brien et al 1998 other studies have addressed uncertainty in costs and prices by identifying breakeven points such as the minimum crop price boyer et al 2014 or maximum irrigation costs zhou et al 2014 where irrigation is still profitable this can be useful in answering the question of whether irrigation is profitable e g are costs typically higher or lower than breakeven point however practical decision making requires an understanding of how profitable the investment will be since irrigation investments must be weighed against other possible investments that could improve farm profitability as well on the whole the use of sensitivity analyses scenario assessments and breakeven calculations suggests that these sources of uncertainty can greatly impact irrigation profitability but provides little practical guidance to inform irrigation decision making under these uncertain conditions the objective of this work is to present a novel approach to representing uncertainty and variability in farm specific economic cost benefit analyses of supplemental irrigation based on two levels of monte carlo simulation the first level estimates annual returns for each year of an irrigation system s useful life based on a single set of assumptions related to system investment and operational costs and multiple realizations of historic weather crop prices and energy prices this level of analysis can demonstrate how year to year variability in things like weather crop prices and energy costs aleatory uncertainties impact the financial returns associated with irrigation the second level repeats this process under different assumptions regarding system investment and operational requirements to represent uncertainty in these operational and financial factors demonstrating how this epistemic uncertainty impacts long term financial outcomes this approach is demonstrated within a simple decision support tool that estimates financial costs and benefits of irrigation for four commodity crops in virginia the tool estimates the difference between irrigated and a rain fed incomes for corn cotton soybeans and wheat based on user supplied information and internal data on historic weather commodity prices and irrigation system costs the tool then presents users with a personalized cost benefit analysis by giving them a range of annual expenses and additional revenues while the cost estimates included in our tool are relatively simple the overall monte carlo framework could easily incorporate more sophisticated approaches by providing a more complete representation of uncertainty in economic estimates this approach can capture the range of possible financial outcomes from supplemental irrigation providing practical insights to improve irrigation decision making 2 methods 2 1 general methodology the general approach we propose to represent uncertainty in irrigation cost estimates is based on two levels of monte carlo simulation conceptualized in fig 1 the two levels of simulation are motivated by the need to consider and represent both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty aleatory uncertainty also referred to as stochastic uncertainty stems from natural variability that is inherently irreducible lindley 2000 paté cornell 1996 factors that vary from year to year such as weather conditions fuel costs and energy prices are best described as aleatoric uncertainty however irrigation financial estimates are also subject to epistemic uncertainty that stems from a lack of knowledge ferson and ginzburg 1996 paté cornell 1996 for instance irrigation system costs and benefits depend on multiple factors such as system design operational parameters and procedures field conditions and production practices these uncertainties can be reduced for instance by obtaining a vendor s quote for installing irrigation on a specific farm however within a generalized cost estimate meant to be widely applicable they will still be present thus the two levels of monte carlo simulation are aimed at evaluating and presenting both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty the first level represented by the inner loop of fig 1 samples aleatoric uncertainty in variables that impact irrigation costs and benefits in any given year these stochastic variables can include weather conditions that impact the difference between irrigated and rainfed years i e additional yields under irrigation will be greater in years with low rainfall as well as the costs of production inputs like fuel fertilizer and pesticides and crop prices that determine the additional revenue associated with yield improvements at this level a single value for each relevant stochastic variable is sampled to represent a feasible realization of weather and economic conditions for single year these values are then used to estimate the additional revenue generated from irrigating as well as irrigation operating costs for that year these costs and revenues can be interpreted as one possible outcome for net costs in a single year this process is then repeated for each year of the system s useful life provide a characterization of the distribution of annual operating expenses and revenues that could be obtained but not yet considering upfront capital costs which are addressed in the second level of simulation these stochastic variables can be sampled using various approaches one approach is to use bootstrap sampling to repeatedly sample from the empirical cumulative density function of observed values efron 1979 in this approach a random year for which historic data on the variables of interest exist is selected and the values for each climatic and financial variable from that individual year are used to estimate financial returns for irrigation under the climatic and economic conditions that occurred in that year sampling all stochastic variables from a single year can implicitly account for cross correlation for instance a year with high energy prices will likely have high crop prices as well however a limitation of this approach is that the sampled values are confined to those that have been experienced historically furthermore independently sampling across historic values will not account for potential autocorrelation the time series of interest although methods such as block bootstrap sampling can address this an alternative approach is to model each stochastic variable as random variable following predefined distribution based on historic data thomopoulos 2013a the advantage of the this method is that the sampled values are not confined to those that have occurred historically however many relevant stochastic variables are not independent of each other for instance fuel prices and crop commodity prices are often cross correlated and decadal scale climatic oscillations induce cross correlation between many relevant climatic variables as well as autocorrelation through time therefore in this approach it is important use multivariate statistical distributions that can account for both cross correlation between variables and autocorrelation in the time series thomopoulos 2013b to address these issues we generate random values from a multivariate vector autoregression model in the demonstration decision support tool described below however the general framework can also accommodate empirical bootstrap sampling or other random sampling methods if desired the first level of monte carlo sampling essentially addresses irreducible variability in irrigation costs and benefits through time and provides a mechanism for calculating the impact that this variability has on lifetime costs however estimating farm level irrigation costs also entails uncertainty in translating the costs and returns obtained under a very specific set of conditions to different farms where those conditions might vary for instance published irrigation system costs based on vendor estimates can vary significantly based on the size and layout of the system required water sources and pumping requirements this uncertainty is best characterized as epistemic uncertainty as it stems from a lack of knowledge regarding the specific farm that the estimate is being generated for in theory this uncertainty can be reduced e g by obtaining a detailed information about farm conditions but in the context of guidance or decision support tools meant to be applicable in a wide range of conditions this process is likely to be infeasible the second level represented by the outer loop of fig 1 aims to represent this epistemic uncertainty at this level a set of constant but uncertain variables related to system costs and operational parameters are sampled from predefined statistical distributions at each sampling iteration the values of these variables are combined with the results from the first level of monte carlo simulation to calculate lifetime net costs and benefits of irrigation assuming that cost parameters are equal to the single set of randomly sampled values the results of each sampling iteration at the second level can be interpreted as a possible realization of lifetime net costs assuming that system costs are equal to the assumed values and that stochastic variables related to weather and prices are equivalent to the values sampled in the first level of simulation this process is then repeated many times to sample a large number of possible realizations in terms of epistemic system cost uncertainty and stochastic weather and price uncertainty this will provide a statistical distribution of financial outcomes such as net present value that represents the possible outcomes that a producer installing irrigation could potentially achieve 2 2 example decision support tool as a demonstration of the general duel level monte carlo simulation approach we developed a decision support tool aimed at characterizing the financial costs and benefits of irrigation for producers of four common row crops corn soybeans cotton and wheat in virginia called the irrigation financial estimator tool ifet users enter information on their geographic location soil type crop grown and acreage the tool leverages historic climatic and economic data as well as literature derived estimates for installation costs and operating requirements for four different irrigation system types center pivot linear move hose pull and drip to provide an estimate of the annualized capital operating and maintenance costs for different types of irrigation systems as well as the increased revenue associated with irrigating the overall framework of the tool is shown in fig 2 and described in further detail in the following sections the specific uncertain variables sampled at each level of the monte carlo simulation are presented in table 1 in an effort to emphasize how the approach used to address uncertainty could be presented in a grower target decision support system we have adopted a relatively simple approach to developing estimates of financial costs and benefits that necessarily includes a number of simplifications and assumptions described in the following sections however the overall framework can be used to accommodate more sophisticated approaches that have been demonstrated elsewhere for example cost calculations could be expanded to include more precise methods for incorporating the impact of field size and irrigation system layout o brien et al 1998 schwankl et al 1999 or additional fertilizer or harvesting costs that stem from the use of irrigation rey et al 2016 2 2 1 data sources a range of irrigation system purchase installation and operating costs were obtained from the peer reviewed scientific literature extension publications and irrigation vendor information cost information was collected separately for center pivot subsurface drip linear move and hose pull irrigation systems in addition to upfront capital costs required for system purchase and installation data was also collected for three types of operating expenses power necessary to pump water and run the system labor required operate the system and maintenance repair costs table 2 presents a summary of sources on irrigation systems costs used in the development of the example decision support tool many of the articles included economic information that was not well suited for a generalizable cost assessment and was thus not included tax costs were often specific to the state or municipality in which the article was written making them impossible to standardize across different locations thus all costs are estimated on a pre tax basis as in o brien et al 1998 insurance costs were sometimes included in cost information but generally calculated in different ways making the information across different studies difficult to compare lastly some articles that focused on an economic analysis included depreciation over the useful life and salvage value however for the purposes of this tool we assume that the system will have no salvage value and zero depreciation noting that the long depreciation period would have a negligible impact on overall finances lamm et al 2006 the nature of irrigation system cost information provided by the sources in table 2 was presented in a variety of forms that needed to be standardized for the purposes of incorporation within the decision support tool for instance some data sources contained cost benefit analyses of a single farm with different irrigation systems while others presented more general cost information in the form of cost per acre or acre inch to make this information consistent all investment costs were divided by the irrigated area to estimate investment costs per acre irrigation operating costs and labor requirements in humid regions will vary substantially based on how much rainfall occurs and how much irrigation water is needed as well as the power source therefore operating expenses were converted into a format that could accurately account for this variability the necessary units for power labor and maintenance were kilowatt hours kwh per acre inch hours of labor per acre inch and cost per acre inch respectively table 3 shows the typical units for operating expenses from the source documents the desired units for inclusion in ifet and how units were converted the range of values for capital costs acre and maintenance costs ai as well as energy and labor requirements in kwh ai and hours ai respectively from the documentation presented in table 3 were used to specify a uniform random variable of each uncertainty parameter for each of the four irrigation system types a uniform distribution was selected due to the limited data available on which to base these estimates thomopoulos 2013c and to be consistent with the epistemic nature of the uncertainty that exists in estimating them ferson and ginzburg 1996 as in montezar et al 2017 we make the simplifying assumption that production costs not related to irrigation such as fertilizer and harvesting costs do not vary based on whether irrigation is used or between different types of irrigation systems the example tool also uses historic crop prices to estimate the revenue associated with higher irrigated yields and historic energy costs to convert energy requirements into operating costs for each year historic data for crop prices were taken from the united states department of agriculture usda national agricultural statistics service nass for 1981 through 2016 united states department of agriculture 2018 the historic price for each of these fuel sources were taken from the united states energy information administration useia from 1995 to 2016 united states energy information adminstration useia 2017 historic weather data was used to estimate non irrigated crop yields as well as the volume of irrigation water needed in a given year weather data was calculated from the prism historic daily gridded climate data for 1981 2016 daly et al 2008 gridded daily values were spatially aggregated to daily average temperature and daily total precipitation at the county level these daily values were temporally aggregated to calculate average temperature and total precipitation from april through september for each year as well as other measures of rainfall variability described in section 2 2 3 2 2 2 user supplied information in addition to the data on irrigation costs historic weather and crop and energy prices stored within the tool users also supply farm specific information that is used to estimate financial costs and benefits for their operation this includes information on the farm itself county location crops grown irrigated acreage and soil type the irrigation system they are interested in type of irrigation power and water source and scheduling method and financial information labor costs repayment period interest rates etc this allows the tool to more accurate reflect the impact of these factors for instance previous analyses have pointed out that systems with larger up front costs are more economically competitive when interest rates are low o brien et al 2010 a list of all user supplied information is included in table 4 2 2 3 yield response to irrigation ideally yield responses to irrigation would be based on field data comparing irrigated and rainfed yields under a wide variety of conditions however this information is generally only available for research facilities and may not be appropriate for generalized estimates aimed at informing decisions under a wide variety of conditions to establish generalized estimates of increases in yield that are possible from irrigation multiple studies have employed the use of yield response functions that predict yields based on explanatory variables related to environmental conditions such as weather and nutrient conditions see for instance boyer et al 2014 letey et al 1990 rodrigues et al 2013b zhou et al 2014 in situations where sufficient field data to develop these models is unavailable process based crop models can help derive these estimates for instance martin et al 1996 used the corn model ceres to derive yield estimates based on 30 years of weather data and wibowo et al 2017 use the crop modeling program aquacrop to similuate corn yields under different irrigation strategies and evaluate how risk preferences impact water use for the purpose of developing response functions that could calculate yields of different crops based on rainfall conditions we used aquacrop version 6 1 food and agriculture organization 2017 aquacrop was selected as it is focused on simulating crop response to water stress and for the purposes of ifet we were most interested in the difference between rainfed and irrigated yields aquacrop uses this information to simulate the stresses on a crop throughout the growing season and compares the actual growth of the selected crop to its maximum potential growth modeled crops were corn wheat cotton and soybeans and tested soils were silt loam silt clay loam loam sandy loam loamy sand silt and silt clay thirty six years of historic daily temperature and rainfall data for middlesex county taken from the prism climate data set was input into aquacrop to develop a base model of corn soybean and wheat growth under different climatic conditions because cotton is not grown in middlesex county cotton simulations used data from isle of wight county from there every combination of soil and crops were simulated using aquacrop s preset parameter values while more detailed calibration procedures are possible when the necessary field data is available we used default values for aquacrop parameters to make the simulations a generalized representation of yield response to additional water rather than a replication of specific field conditions while this undoubtedly impacts the accuracy of the modeled yields compared to studies where models can be calibrated to observed field results it is a reasonable approach for a tool meant to quantify irrigation benefits over many different conditions other approaches for yield response estimation could easily be incorporated into the larger monte carlo simulation framework if sufficient data were available typically aquacrop is calibrated and validated against data from field experiments to confirm that multiple aspects of physiological crop development are accurately represented e g tsakmakis et al 2019 and qiao 2012 this process is appropriate for simulations aimed at replicating observed growth and yield in a specific setting such as at a single experimental site however the objective of the work presented in this manuscript is fundamentally different in that we aim to develop general estimates of irrigation yield response that are suitable for different field and farm conditions for this reason we compared simulated yields to observed county scale yield data from usda nass a fundamental limitation with this method of model validation is that aquacrop simulates yields under specific growing conditions while usda nass data represents average yield across all farms in a county thus there will undoubtedly be differences between the two datasets but both should at least be correlated in their response to higher rainfall and other beneficial climate conditions in the absence of other data for model validation this approach was deemed sufficient for the purposes of our study modeled yields from aquacrop were then compared to historic yields for middlesex county and isle of wight county for cotton taken from the national agricultural statistics service united states department of agriculture 2017 in general yields produced from aquacrop were higher than those from historic data likely because aquacrop did not take into account losses due to environmental factors such as disease or pests and exhibited greater variability year to year supplementary table s1 this is to be expected as the nass yields are results averaged across multiple farms within the county which likely masks significant variability nevertheless aquacrop was able to generally replicate year to year patterns in yields suggesting that this approach provides a reasonable estimate of the impact of water stress when other factors are held constant modeled yields were then used to develop response functions relating yields to growing season weather for different crops and soil conditions random forest models were used to account for interdependencies and nonlinearities between explanatory variables and yields breiman 2001 because yields will vary based on both total rainfall as well the timing in which it occurs multiple climatic variables were evaluated as possible predictors of yield average growing season temperature total growing season rainfall the maximum consecutive days where no rainfall occurred the maximum number of consecutive days where the 5 10 and 20 day moving average daily rainfall was below 3 mm per day the maximum number of consecutive days where the 5 10 and 20 day moving average daily rainfall was below 1 5 mm per day the moving average metrics were designed to account for the occurrence of prolonged periods where small volumes of rainfall occur and thus aren t captured by the metrics based on no rainfall but where the average rainfall amount is below plant requirements for each combination of crop and soil type a maximum of five explanatory variables were selected using out of sample cross validation to identify those minimized predicted mean squared error the variables selected for each crop and soil combination are presented in supplementary table s2 2 2 4 decision support tool calculations ifet combines the user provided information with stored data on irrigation costs weather and prices as well as yield response functions to calculate the costs and benefits of installing an irrigation system using the two tiered monte carlo simulation approach described in section 2 1 in the first tier of the monte carlo simulation the tool calculates annual operating costs and additional revenues for a sequence of l years where l is the lifetime of the system in years these l years of operating costs and revenues are combined with a single randomly selected value for installation costs to estimate a single lifetime annualized net value and net present value for the irrigation system in the second level of the monte carlo simulation this process is then repeated 250 times each time selecting different irrigation cost values and different sequences of weather and price data to estimate operating costs and revenues the tool first selects a random value from the predefined distributions of irrigation system capital costs acre energy requirements kwh ai labor requirements hours ai and maintenance costs ai the tool multiplies the randomly selected irrigation system capital costs in dollars per acre with the user supplied acreage information to calculate total capital costs this total cost is then combined with user supplied information on the down payment interest rate and loan repayment period to calculated the annualized loan payment for the system as in equation 1 p c r 1 1 r i where p is the annual loan repayment c is the total capital cost r is the interest rate and i is the loan repayment period the tool then generates a sequence of l random annual values for fuel costs crop prices and weather conditions based on historic data using vector autoregression var time series models because little cross correlation was observed between historic economic fuel and crop prices and weather data separate var models were to generate sequences of economic and climatic variables an economic var model was fit to simulate autocorrelation and cross correlation in prices for the user selected fuel and crop a climatic var was fit to simulate autocorrelation and cross correlation in the county level climate variables used to drive the yield response functions random forecasts were generated from each var model by randomly sampling from a multivariate normal distribution with mean values equal to the var n ahead forecast and the residual covariance structure estimated from the var model zivot and wang 2006 the simulated weather and economic data is used with the stored yield response functions to estimate yields revenues and operating costs for that year fig 3 county level weather data is entered into the appropriate yield response model for the user supplied soil type and crop to calculate rainfed yields irrigated yields are assumed to be the maximum i e non water stressed yields from the aquacrop simulations if a user selects ideal growth the tool assumes that this yield is achieved by applying the difference between growing season rainfall and the total water requirement for that crop if a user selects scheduled irrigation then the tool will calculate irrigated yields using the regression equations replacing the rainfall value with the sum of total rainfall and irrigation water applied the estimated rainfed and irrigated yields are then multiplied by the user supplied acreage and crop prices for that same year to determine a user s estimated income with and without irrigation comparing the irrigated and rainfed yields allows users to see the additional income they could have earned had there not been any water deficit under the weather and price conditions experienced in that year finally the tool calculates the operating costs necessary to irrigate based on the weather and economic data for that year since agricultural producers in virginia do not generally depend on irrigation for all of their crop water requirements annual operating expenses are calculated based on the volume of irrigation water applied the randomly selected value for the irrigation energy requirement in kwh ai is combined with the user supplied fuel source the randomly generated fuel price for that year and the amount of irrigation needed as in equation 2 p o w e r c o s t r e x p e x v d where re is the randomly selected energy requirement in kwh ai and v is the volume of irrigation applied in acre inches based on either the user supplied irrigation schedule if the user selects the scheduled irrigation option or the difference between seasonal rainfall and water requirements if the user selects the optimal irrigation option d is the energy density which equals 40 283 kw h gallon for diesel fuel 0 304 kw h ft3 for natural gas and 1 kw h kwh for electricity pe is the price for the user selected fuel in dollars per gallon cubic feet or kwh for diesel natural gas or electricity respectively energy costs for electric systems are multiplied by 0 5 to account for the improved efficiency of these pumps fraizer 2017 martin et al 2011 labor costs for the year are estimated by multiplying the randomly selected labor requirement value in hours ai by the user supplied labor payment rate hour and the volume of irrigation in ai maintenance costs are estimated by multiplying the randomly selected maintenance cost in ai by the volume of irrigation in ai these operating costs are summed to estimate total operating costs for the year and the net financial benefit of irrigating in that year is calculated as the difference between the additional revenue from irrigating and the sum of the loan repayment and operating costs this process is repeated l times where l is the user defined system lifetime in years and used to calculate net present value as well as an estimate of average annual operating costs and financial benefits this provides a single potential value of the lifetime financial benefits of installing irrigation assuming that system costs are equivalent to the randomly selected values and weather and crop prices are equivalent to those from the randomly generated time series however actual lifetime costs could not be expected to equal this exact amount since there is no reason to expect that actual costs weather and price conditions would equal those selected thus this process is then repeated 250 times for the second level of the monte carlo simulation each time selecting different random values for irrigation system costs and different years on which weather and price data is based this results in a total of 250 simulations of system lifetime costs and ifet then presents the user with a range of potential costs and benefits from across these simulations 2 3 case study example ifet can estimate net benefits associated with irrigation for multiple crops corn cotton soybeans and wheat irrigation system types center pivot linear move hose reel and drip and fuel sources diesel electricity and natural gas to demonstrate the tool s results a set of example calculations were completed for a hypothetical case study farm this hypothetical farm is located in culpeper county virginia on loamy sand soil the case study results present costs and benefits associated with irrigating 100 acres of corn using a diesel powered center pivot irrigation system with an assumed system life of 20 years operating costs assume that the grower schedules irrigation based on rainfall amounts rather than a set schedule each week to avoid applying excess water costs also assume a user provided labor cost of 10 per hour and that the system is financed with a 20 000 down payment and the remaining costs covered by a loan with an interest rate of 4 and a repayment period of 10 years all subsequent figures show results for this case study example 3 case study results fig 4 presents an example of the summary information on lifetime costs and revenues that is presented within the user interface of ifet this summary includes an overview of system costs in tabular and graphic form including annual operating costs investment cost and loan repayment as well as a summary of the annual additional income from irrigating after accounting for operating costs and loan repayment costs are presented as average annual values as well as net present value it is important to note that values presented for operating costs are the average of annual costs taken across the lifetime of the system i e although fuel costs will naturally vary from year to year these numbers only present long term average costs not year to year variability the average lower and upper estimates presented in the table are the expected value and bounds of the 95 confidence interval from the 250 monte carlo simulation run for the lifespan of the system thus they are primarily reflective of epistemic uncertainty surrounding installation costs and operational requirements other results within ifet were developed to present year to year variations and are discussed in the subsequent sections while it would be possible to present the full statistical distribution of results for each aspect of system costs the tool only includes a lower and upper estimate in order to make the results understandable to a wider audience than would be likely with more complex probabilistic information crettaz von roten 2006 gigerenzer et al 2005 for the case study example the largest costs are associated with fuel and loan repayment which have an average estimated value of 6100 and 9400 per year respectively although the loan repayment appears to be the largest contributor to annual costs the fuel costs exhibit more uncertainty with a range of 10 000 between the lower and upper estimate compared to a range of 2000 for the loan repayment average additional income from irrigation is expected to be between 17 600 and 33 200 per year when averaged over the lifetime of the pivot after accounting for loan repayment and operating costs the average additional net revenue is expected to range from 400 to 16 800 per year thus it appears that installing irrigation will be financially advantageous with an expected npv of 141 100 and an average additional revenue of 7800 per year but that it is possible that high costs combined with low returns or commodity prices could result in an overall loss of revenue when averaged over the lifetime of the system ifet also includes several graphs to help characterize stochastic uncertainty in costs and revenues associated with irrigation and the impact that different stochastic variables such as growing season rainfall and commodity prices have on these costs fig 5 presents a screenshot of an example time series graph showing a year by year comparison of revenue with and without irrigation for the cast study example this graph is not meant to be a prediction of the amount of income earned each year since prediction of growing season rainfall commodity prices and fuel costs would be impossible instead it is meant to represent a possible trajectory of total revenue and provide the user with a sense of how often the system is profitable and what the range of annual additional revenues might be from year to year in our case study example irrigation only results in greater revenue in five out of the ten first years of system s lifespan because the loan is still being paid off at that point and additional revenues from irrigation do not exceed the combined operating and loan costs however one single year where irrigation is highly profitable year 4 results in enough additional revenue approximately 40 000 to make up for the five years in which operating costs were greater than additional revenue in the second half of the system s life irrigation is profitable in all ten years this graph also shows that the losses and gains associated with irrigation in different years are not of the same magnitude losses from irrigation generally don t exceed 10 000 in any given year whereas gains from irrigation can be quite large and a small number of highly profitable years years 4 15 16 18 and 19 can make up for years with losses in addition to showing the year to year variability in irrigation revenues and costs ifet also aims to show the factors that influence this variability fig 6 shows two additional screenshots that related irrigation revenue in our case study example to growing season rainfall and corn prices the top plot shows that irrigation ceases to be profitable when growing season rainfall reaches about 22 in per year and that the majority of years experience rainfall below this amount however even in very dry years the additional revenue from irrigating can vary substantially likely due to variability in commodity prices panel b of fig 6 demonstrates how revenues relate to commodity prices while the maximum additional return from irrigation does increase with corn prices negative returns from irrigation are possible even when commodity prices are high this would occur in years where rainfall was high enough that the additional yields from irrigation are so minor that even with good prices additional returns don t exceed operating costs overall this demonstrates how in any given year both weather and price conditions have to be favorable for irrigation to result in higher revenues however the additional revenues in these years may be so high that they can make irrigation financially advantageous even if they do not occur frequently 4 discussion in an effort to demonstrate our approach towards the sampling and representation of uncertainty we made a number of simplifications which could be addressed within the same framework to improve precision in cost estimates for instance we make the simplifying assumption that increased yields under different irrigation systems are equivalent as has been done in other studies lamm et al 2006 however this may not be the case for instance yields of some crops have been shown to be higher under drip irrigation when compared to overhead possibly due to lower evaporative losses and a more favorable thermal environment lamm et al 2010 montezar et al 2016 we also assume that system costs increase linearly with field size but in reality costs per acre will vary drip irrigation systems in particular tend to become more economically competitive in small fields lamm et al 2010 while our example tool is focused on comparing financial outcomes with and without irrigation addressing these simplifications would be particularly important in an analysis aimed at comparing different systems which would further support irrigation investment decision making nevertheless certain differences between systems are apparent even in our simple tool for example drip irrigation systems tend to have higher installation and lower energy requirements when compared to overhead systems whereas hose pull systems have higher labor requirements than the other systems evaluated table 2 perhaps the greatest simplification made in our analysis was the treatment of irrigation impacts on yield because we needed generalized equations for estimating the difference between rainfed and irrigated years for different crops locations and soil types we used the aquacrop model to simulate rainfed yields using 30 years of weather data the results of these simulations were then used to fit regression equations that could be used to repeatedly estimate yields for each iteration of the monte carlo simulation although our regression models based on rainfall amount and dry spell occurrence generally fit the results from the aquacrop simulations well yields will also respond to other weather conditions such as extreme heat schlenker and roberts 2009 rainfall variability auffhammer et al 2012 fishman 2016 and whether dry spells coincide with sensitive growing periods usda natural resource conservation service 2010 one method for incorporating these impacts would be to use the aquacrop model or another physiological crop model to estimate yields directly as in andresen et al 2016 while this approach would provide more sophisticated yield estimates it would potentially introduce computational challenges if simulations must be run numerous times model emulators might be an effective way of reducing computational times blanc 2017 makowski et al 2015 this could be a valuable avenue for understanding how irrigation practices interact with other management approaches such as conservation measures aimed at improving soil water holding capacity to influence overall profitability and would also allow representation of a broader range of irrigation management strategies including deficit irrigation o brien et al 2001 rodrigues et al 2013a in our analysis we used uniform random variables to represent our epistemically uncertain variables because the small number of studies available precluded the use of more detailed statistical distributions thomopoulos 2013c and to distinguish between epistemic and aleatory uncertainty ferson and ginzburg 1996 furthermore more detailed probabilistic representation of uncertainty may have made the decision support tool results less interpretable to a wide audience however other statistical forms for representing this uncertainty could be used and may be particularly important in contexts where more detailed results are desired the use of expert elicitation which has a long history in the field of risk analysis could be useful in this regard lindley 1987 otway and winterfeldt 1992 this is particularly true since knowledgeable individuals are likely to have extensive experience and understanding of irrigation costs even if documented data on costs in different circumstances is limited presenting a complete statistical distribution of monte carlo simulation results could provide insights that are masked by only including a range of possible results for instance a skewed distribution with a long tail of high costs would suggest that for most circumstances costs are low but a small number of simulations with really high costs are driving the average up a user could then investigate those high cost simulations to identify the factors led to that situation and evaluate whether there are operational strategies that might make those conditions less likely using scenario discovery approaches bryant and lempert 2010 kwakkel and jaxa rozen 2016 finally a number of studies have pointed out that irrigation decisions are not driven by financial considerations alone and that risk preferences can influence the decision to invest in irrigation boyer et al 2014 vandeveer et al 1989 as well as how it is operated wibowo et al 2017 incorporating these risk preferences into financial assessments would be a valuable area for additional research that builds off of the approach developed here 5 conclusions the decision about whether or not to install irrigation in humid regions is consequential and complex and multiple studies and tools have been developed to assist producers in making this decision however the profitability of supplemental irrigation is highly sensitive to variability in weather commodity prices and energy costs as well as assumptions about system costs operational parameters and economic factors because few studies fully account for these sources of uncertainty they can only characterize profitability under a very specific set of conditions making them of limited use for broad scale practical decision making in this work we present an approach for characterizing this uncertainty within a decision support tool aimed at evaluating farm level financial outcomes from installing supplemental irrigation based on two levels of monte carlo simulation in the first level aleatory uncertainty in naturally varying conditions such as weather and crop prices is sampled to characterize the impact that year to year variation in these factors has on profitability in the second level epistemic uncertainty stemming from lack of knowledge about system costs and operational parameters is sampled to characterize how this uncertainty impacts long term financial outcomes we demonstrate this approach within a decision support tool aimed at providing farm level estimates of irrigation profitability for corn soybean cotton and wheat production in virginia the interactive tool can be used to evaluate profitability for multiple crops irrigation system types and locations the tool presents users with a personalized cost benefit analysis by giving them a range of expected long term costs and revenues as well as multiple graphs that demonstrate year to year variability in revenue while the cost estimates included in our tool are relatively simple the overall monte carlo framework could easily incorporate more sophisticated approaches by providing a more complete representation of uncertainty in economic estimates this approach can capture the range of possible financial outcomes from supplemental irrigation providing practical insights to improve irrigation decision making

10566,in recent years there has been increasing interest in and adoption of supplemental irrigation in humid regions that have traditionally relied on rainfed agriculture in these regions irrigation typically supplements rainfall and serves as a risk management strategy to avoid losses in years with low precipitation however the higher returns achieved with irrigation may not be sufficient to offset its investment and operational costs the question of whether supplemental irrigation is profitable for a given farm is subject to many sources of uncertainty such as system costs energy requirements and yield response as well as year to year variability in weather energy and commodity prices previous research on financial outcomes of irrigation rarely considers this uncertainty and variability in a comprehensive manner limiting their practical use for agricultural decision making the objective of this work is to present a novel approach to representing uncertainty and variability in farm specific cost benefit analyses of supplemental irrigation based on two levels of monte carlo simulation the first level estimates annual returns for each year of an irrigation system s useful life based on multiple realizations of historic weather crop prices and energy prices to demonstrate year to year variability in financial returns the second level repeats this process under different assumptions regarding system investment and operational costs to represent epistemic uncertainty in these factors this approach is demonstrated with a simple decision support tool that estimates financial costs and benefits of irrigation for four commodity crops in virginia and shows how this uncertainty and variability can be presented for a general audience this approach can be used to assess irrigation profitability for different crops and irrigation systems and highlight how factors such as the fuel source or irrigation scheduling method used can impact profitability keywords monte carlo simulation decision support epistemic uncertainty variability aleatory uncertainty 1 introduction and background agriculture in humid regions such as the eastern united states has historically benefited from sufficient rainfall making irrigation unnecessary for many producers for instance the usda 2013 farm and ranch irrigation survey found that only 15 of cropland in virginia was irrigated united states department of agriculture usda 2014 however the use of irrigation has been growing significantly in this region with almost every state east of the mississippi river reporting an increase in irrigated area over the past decade walton 2014 the use of supplemental irrigation in these regions can result in significant yield improvements in some instances doubling yields over rainfed crops by avoiding water stress during critical growing periods payero and khalilian 2017 supplemental irrigation also serves to manage production risk by ensuring that yields can remain high even in years with limited rainfall and can improve farm incomes by allowing diversification of crops grown vandeveer et al 1989 however supplemental irrigation also introduces financial risk as the upfront and operating costs of irrigation are high and may not be made up by additional revenues particularly in years where rainfall is high or crop prices are low determining whether adoption of supplemental irrigation is economically beneficial requires consideration of upfront installation costs operating costs potential yield improvements and the additional financial returns that would result from these improvements a number of studies have assessed financial costs and benefits of irrigation in an effort to determine the situations where it is economically beneficial many of these studies take place in arid regions and present comparative analyses of different types of irrigation systems designs and management strategies for example economic comparisons between furrow sprinkler and drip irrigation have typically shown that systems with increasingly high upfront costs sprinkler and drip irrigation are only economically justified in situations where yields income and operating costs are all improved with the new system lamm et al 2010 letey et al 1990 montazar et al 2017 o brien et al 1998 prevatt et al 1992 rodrigues et al 2013b studies have also demonstrated how the choice of irrigation system design enciso et al 2005 schwankl et al 1999 and scheduling strategy rodrigues et al 2013a romero et al 2006 can influence the financial benefits of irrigation however studies in arid areas typically assume that some form of irrigation is required for production and thus don t address the question of whether or not irrigation should be installed at all studies of supplemental irrigation in humid regions show that irrigation is only profitable in certain situations while supplemental irrigation typically improves yields this is not always the case for instance it was found to lower spring hay production in tennessee zhou et al 2014 additionally improved yields may not necessarily equate to better financial returns for instance an assessment of supplemental corn irrigation in tennessee found that irrigation was only profitable when energy prices were lower and corn prices were higher than they have been historically boyer et al 2014 financial benefits are also dependent on weather conditions for instance an evaluation of corn cotton and peanut irrigation in north carolina found that in years with heavy rainfall irrigation didn t result in additional economic returns jordan et al 2014 these studies are typically based on economic assessments of a single production scenario for example jordan et al 2014 compared yields and economic returns from a pair of field experiments with and without irrigation for five years at a research station researchers have also composed economic estimates based on vendor provided irrigation system costs and experimental comparisons of crop yields with and without irrigation boyer et al 2014 o brien et al 1998 some studies calculate expected costs and returns of irrigation based on a case study farms or hypothetical example farms heard et al 2012 prevatt et al 1992 romero et al 2006 because these analyses only evaluate a single specific situation their findings may not be useful in informing practical decisions on farms of differing size soil type climate water availability and economic conditions generalized practical recommendations regarding the value of irrigation in differing situations requires information that can help inform investments in a wide variety of contexts enciso et al 2005 efforts to provide practical site specific guidance for irrigation decision making have often taken the form of computational decision support tools these tools allow a producer to enter information about their farm and irrigation needs and combine this information with stored data on irrigation costs and benefits to estimate the financial returns possible with different types of irrigation systems for example the irrigation cost analysis program icap combined user supplied farm information irrigation system cost estimates and model derived yield estimates to calculate the economic risks and returns associated with supplemental irrigation of corn in michigan martin et al 1996 another tool developed by researchers at kansas state university compares the economic costs and benefits of installing a subsurface drip system and a center pivot system to replace furrow irrigation for corn production lamm et al 2014 similarly the high plains regional climate center u2u irrigation investment decision support tool aims to help producers in determining the profitability of installing an irrigation system in the midwest andresen et al 2016 this tool allows agricultural producers to enter information about their farm and shows users the difference between irrigated and dryland yield as well as the additional profit per acre possible with irrigation these tools attempt to leverage the insights gained from studies on irrigation costs and benefits to support practical irrigation decision making on farms with differing characteristics however there are many sources of uncertainty and variability which can greatly impact the financial outcomes associated with supplemental irrigation for instance irrigation system prices can vary significantly based on material and energy costs lamm et al 2006 as well as system design schwankl et al 1999 and field size lamm et al 2010 however most studies and decision support tools are based on a single estimate of system costs derived either from industry estimates extension farm enterprise budgets or irrigation literature yield response to irrigation will depend on management practices soil health crop varieties and other production factors variability in crop prices has been shown to have a substantial impact in the overall financial feasibility of irrigation in a number of studies o brien et al 2010 rey et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2013b in humid regions economic outcomes are also sensitive to variability in weather with greater benefits in dry years jordan et al 2014 however economic estimates are often based on results from a single study period long term average weather conditions or a small subset of years e g one normal year and one dry year researchers have acknowledged that addressing this variability requires consideration of long term variability in costs and other economic factors o brien et al 2010 and more sophisticated methods are needed to address underlying uncertainty in economic assessments boyer et al 2014 without considering and clearly communicating this uncertainty the recommendations provided by these studies and decision support tools could potentially result in misleading information about the potential financial risks and benefits of irrigation while prior research has used different approaches to address this uncertainty and variability it is typically done in a limited fashion that undermines practical insights for irrigation decision making for instance a number of studies use sensitivity or scenario analyses to quantify how different uncertain factors influence economic outcomes these studies generate multiple estimates of financial costs and benefits under different assumptions about factors such as energy prices boyer et al 2014 crop prices o brien et al 2010 rey et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2013b yield response heard et al 2012 and irrigation system cost rodrigues et al 2013a however these analyses typically consider only a single uncertain factor at a time even though some of these factors may be correlated such as energy and production costs and if multiple uncertain factors are considered holistically this can dramatically impact overall profitability o brien et al 1998 other studies have addressed uncertainty in costs and prices by identifying breakeven points such as the minimum crop price boyer et al 2014 or maximum irrigation costs zhou et al 2014 where irrigation is still profitable this can be useful in answering the question of whether irrigation is profitable e g are costs typically higher or lower than breakeven point however practical decision making requires an understanding of how profitable the investment will be since irrigation investments must be weighed against other possible investments that could improve farm profitability as well on the whole the use of sensitivity analyses scenario assessments and breakeven calculations suggests that these sources of uncertainty can greatly impact irrigation profitability but provides little practical guidance to inform irrigation decision making under these uncertain conditions the objective of this work is to present a novel approach to representing uncertainty and variability in farm specific economic cost benefit analyses of supplemental irrigation based on two levels of monte carlo simulation the first level estimates annual returns for each year of an irrigation system s useful life based on a single set of assumptions related to system investment and operational costs and multiple realizations of historic weather crop prices and energy prices this level of analysis can demonstrate how year to year variability in things like weather crop prices and energy costs aleatory uncertainties impact the financial returns associated with irrigation the second level repeats this process under different assumptions regarding system investment and operational requirements to represent uncertainty in these operational and financial factors demonstrating how this epistemic uncertainty impacts long term financial outcomes this approach is demonstrated within a simple decision support tool that estimates financial costs and benefits of irrigation for four commodity crops in virginia the tool estimates the difference between irrigated and a rain fed incomes for corn cotton soybeans and wheat based on user supplied information and internal data on historic weather commodity prices and irrigation system costs the tool then presents users with a personalized cost benefit analysis by giving them a range of annual expenses and additional revenues while the cost estimates included in our tool are relatively simple the overall monte carlo framework could easily incorporate more sophisticated approaches by providing a more complete representation of uncertainty in economic estimates this approach can capture the range of possible financial outcomes from supplemental irrigation providing practical insights to improve irrigation decision making 2 methods 2 1 general methodology the general approach we propose to represent uncertainty in irrigation cost estimates is based on two levels of monte carlo simulation conceptualized in fig 1 the two levels of simulation are motivated by the need to consider and represent both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty aleatory uncertainty also referred to as stochastic uncertainty stems from natural variability that is inherently irreducible lindley 2000 paté cornell 1996 factors that vary from year to year such as weather conditions fuel costs and energy prices are best described as aleatoric uncertainty however irrigation financial estimates are also subject to epistemic uncertainty that stems from a lack of knowledge ferson and ginzburg 1996 paté cornell 1996 for instance irrigation system costs and benefits depend on multiple factors such as system design operational parameters and procedures field conditions and production practices these uncertainties can be reduced for instance by obtaining a vendor s quote for installing irrigation on a specific farm however within a generalized cost estimate meant to be widely applicable they will still be present thus the two levels of monte carlo simulation are aimed at evaluating and presenting both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty the first level represented by the inner loop of fig 1 samples aleatoric uncertainty in variables that impact irrigation costs and benefits in any given year these stochastic variables can include weather conditions that impact the difference between irrigated and rainfed years i e additional yields under irrigation will be greater in years with low rainfall as well as the costs of production inputs like fuel fertilizer and pesticides and crop prices that determine the additional revenue associated with yield improvements at this level a single value for each relevant stochastic variable is sampled to represent a feasible realization of weather and economic conditions for single year these values are then used to estimate the additional revenue generated from irrigating as well as irrigation operating costs for that year these costs and revenues can be interpreted as one possible outcome for net costs in a single year this process is then repeated for each year of the system s useful life provide a characterization of the distribution of annual operating expenses and revenues that could be obtained but not yet considering upfront capital costs which are addressed in the second level of simulation these stochastic variables can be sampled using various approaches one approach is to use bootstrap sampling to repeatedly sample from the empirical cumulative density function of observed values efron 1979 in this approach a random year for which historic data on the variables of interest exist is selected and the values for each climatic and financial variable from that individual year are used to estimate financial returns for irrigation under the climatic and economic conditions that occurred in that year sampling all stochastic variables from a single year can implicitly account for cross correlation for instance a year with high energy prices will likely have high crop prices as well however a limitation of this approach is that the sampled values are confined to those that have been experienced historically furthermore independently sampling across historic values will not account for potential autocorrelation the time series of interest although methods such as block bootstrap sampling can address this an alternative approach is to model each stochastic variable as random variable following predefined distribution based on historic data thomopoulos 2013a the advantage of the this method is that the sampled values are not confined to those that have occurred historically however many relevant stochastic variables are not independent of each other for instance fuel prices and crop commodity prices are often cross correlated and decadal scale climatic oscillations induce cross correlation between many relevant climatic variables as well as autocorrelation through time therefore in this approach it is important use multivariate statistical distributions that can account for both cross correlation between variables and autocorrelation in the time series thomopoulos 2013b to address these issues we generate random values from a multivariate vector autoregression model in the demonstration decision support tool described below however the general framework can also accommodate empirical bootstrap sampling or other random sampling methods if desired the first level of monte carlo sampling essentially addresses irreducible variability in irrigation costs and benefits through time and provides a mechanism for calculating the impact that this variability has on lifetime costs however estimating farm level irrigation costs also entails uncertainty in translating the costs and returns obtained under a very specific set of conditions to different farms where those conditions might vary for instance published irrigation system costs based on vendor estimates can vary significantly based on the size and layout of the system required water sources and pumping requirements this uncertainty is best characterized as epistemic uncertainty as it stems from a lack of knowledge regarding the specific farm that the estimate is being generated for in theory this uncertainty can be reduced e g by obtaining a detailed information about farm conditions but in the context of guidance or decision support tools meant to be applicable in a wide range of conditions this process is likely to be infeasible the second level represented by the outer loop of fig 1 aims to represent this epistemic uncertainty at this level a set of constant but uncertain variables related to system costs and operational parameters are sampled from predefined statistical distributions at each sampling iteration the values of these variables are combined with the results from the first level of monte carlo simulation to calculate lifetime net costs and benefits of irrigation assuming that cost parameters are equal to the single set of randomly sampled values the results of each sampling iteration at the second level can be interpreted as a possible realization of lifetime net costs assuming that system costs are equal to the assumed values and that stochastic variables related to weather and prices are equivalent to the values sampled in the first level of simulation this process is then repeated many times to sample a large number of possible realizations in terms of epistemic system cost uncertainty and stochastic weather and price uncertainty this will provide a statistical distribution of financial outcomes such as net present value that represents the possible outcomes that a producer installing irrigation could potentially achieve 2 2 example decision support tool as a demonstration of the general duel level monte carlo simulation approach we developed a decision support tool aimed at characterizing the financial costs and benefits of irrigation for producers of four common row crops corn soybeans cotton and wheat in virginia called the irrigation financial estimator tool ifet users enter information on their geographic location soil type crop grown and acreage the tool leverages historic climatic and economic data as well as literature derived estimates for installation costs and operating requirements for four different irrigation system types center pivot linear move hose pull and drip to provide an estimate of the annualized capital operating and maintenance costs for different types of irrigation systems as well as the increased revenue associated with irrigating the overall framework of the tool is shown in fig 2 and described in further detail in the following sections the specific uncertain variables sampled at each level of the monte carlo simulation are presented in table 1 in an effort to emphasize how the approach used to address uncertainty could be presented in a grower target decision support system we have adopted a relatively simple approach to developing estimates of financial costs and benefits that necessarily includes a number of simplifications and assumptions described in the following sections however the overall framework can be used to accommodate more sophisticated approaches that have been demonstrated elsewhere for example cost calculations could be expanded to include more precise methods for incorporating the impact of field size and irrigation system layout o brien et al 1998 schwankl et al 1999 or additional fertilizer or harvesting costs that stem from the use of irrigation rey et al 2016 2 2 1 data sources a range of irrigation system purchase installation and operating costs were obtained from the peer reviewed scientific literature extension publications and irrigation vendor information cost information was collected separately for center pivot subsurface drip linear move and hose pull irrigation systems in addition to upfront capital costs required for system purchase and installation data was also collected for three types of operating expenses power necessary to pump water and run the system labor required operate the system and maintenance repair costs table 2 presents a summary of sources on irrigation systems costs used in the development of the example decision support tool many of the articles included economic information that was not well suited for a generalizable cost assessment and was thus not included tax costs were often specific to the state or municipality in which the article was written making them impossible to standardize across different locations thus all costs are estimated on a pre tax basis as in o brien et al 1998 insurance costs were sometimes included in cost information but generally calculated in different ways making the information across different studies difficult to compare lastly some articles that focused on an economic analysis included depreciation over the useful life and salvage value however for the purposes of this tool we assume that the system will have no salvage value and zero depreciation noting that the long depreciation period would have a negligible impact on overall finances lamm et al 2006 the nature of irrigation system cost information provided by the sources in table 2 was presented in a variety of forms that needed to be standardized for the purposes of incorporation within the decision support tool for instance some data sources contained cost benefit analyses of a single farm with different irrigation systems while others presented more general cost information in the form of cost per acre or acre inch to make this information consistent all investment costs were divided by the irrigated area to estimate investment costs per acre irrigation operating costs and labor requirements in humid regions will vary substantially based on how much rainfall occurs and how much irrigation water is needed as well as the power source therefore operating expenses were converted into a format that could accurately account for this variability the necessary units for power labor and maintenance were kilowatt hours kwh per acre inch hours of labor per acre inch and cost per acre inch respectively table 3 shows the typical units for operating expenses from the source documents the desired units for inclusion in ifet and how units were converted the range of values for capital costs acre and maintenance costs ai as well as energy and labor requirements in kwh ai and hours ai respectively from the documentation presented in table 3 were used to specify a uniform random variable of each uncertainty parameter for each of the four irrigation system types a uniform distribution was selected due to the limited data available on which to base these estimates thomopoulos 2013c and to be consistent with the epistemic nature of the uncertainty that exists in estimating them ferson and ginzburg 1996 as in montezar et al 2017 we make the simplifying assumption that production costs not related to irrigation such as fertilizer and harvesting costs do not vary based on whether irrigation is used or between different types of irrigation systems the example tool also uses historic crop prices to estimate the revenue associated with higher irrigated yields and historic energy costs to convert energy requirements into operating costs for each year historic data for crop prices were taken from the united states department of agriculture usda national agricultural statistics service nass for 1981 through 2016 united states department of agriculture 2018 the historic price for each of these fuel sources were taken from the united states energy information administration useia from 1995 to 2016 united states energy information adminstration useia 2017 historic weather data was used to estimate non irrigated crop yields as well as the volume of irrigation water needed in a given year weather data was calculated from the prism historic daily gridded climate data for 1981 2016 daly et al 2008 gridded daily values were spatially aggregated to daily average temperature and daily total precipitation at the county level these daily values were temporally aggregated to calculate average temperature and total precipitation from april through september for each year as well as other measures of rainfall variability described in section 2 2 3 2 2 2 user supplied information in addition to the data on irrigation costs historic weather and crop and energy prices stored within the tool users also supply farm specific information that is used to estimate financial costs and benefits for their operation this includes information on the farm itself county location crops grown irrigated acreage and soil type the irrigation system they are interested in type of irrigation power and water source and scheduling method and financial information labor costs repayment period interest rates etc this allows the tool to more accurate reflect the impact of these factors for instance previous analyses have pointed out that systems with larger up front costs are more economically competitive when interest rates are low o brien et al 2010 a list of all user supplied information is included in table 4 2 2 3 yield response to irrigation ideally yield responses to irrigation would be based on field data comparing irrigated and rainfed yields under a wide variety of conditions however this information is generally only available for research facilities and may not be appropriate for generalized estimates aimed at informing decisions under a wide variety of conditions to establish generalized estimates of increases in yield that are possible from irrigation multiple studies have employed the use of yield response functions that predict yields based on explanatory variables related to environmental conditions such as weather and nutrient conditions see for instance boyer et al 2014 letey et al 1990 rodrigues et al 2013b zhou et al 2014 in situations where sufficient field data to develop these models is unavailable process based crop models can help derive these estimates for instance martin et al 1996 used the corn model ceres to derive yield estimates based on 30 years of weather data and wibowo et al 2017 use the crop modeling program aquacrop to similuate corn yields under different irrigation strategies and evaluate how risk preferences impact water use for the purpose of developing response functions that could calculate yields of different crops based on rainfall conditions we used aquacrop version 6 1 food and agriculture organization 2017 aquacrop was selected as it is focused on simulating crop response to water stress and for the purposes of ifet we were most interested in the difference between rainfed and irrigated yields aquacrop uses this information to simulate the stresses on a crop throughout the growing season and compares the actual growth of the selected crop to its maximum potential growth modeled crops were corn wheat cotton and soybeans and tested soils were silt loam silt clay loam loam sandy loam loamy sand silt and silt clay thirty six years of historic daily temperature and rainfall data for middlesex county taken from the prism climate data set was input into aquacrop to develop a base model of corn soybean and wheat growth under different climatic conditions because cotton is not grown in middlesex county cotton simulations used data from isle of wight county from there every combination of soil and crops were simulated using aquacrop s preset parameter values while more detailed calibration procedures are possible when the necessary field data is available we used default values for aquacrop parameters to make the simulations a generalized representation of yield response to additional water rather than a replication of specific field conditions while this undoubtedly impacts the accuracy of the modeled yields compared to studies where models can be calibrated to observed field results it is a reasonable approach for a tool meant to quantify irrigation benefits over many different conditions other approaches for yield response estimation could easily be incorporated into the larger monte carlo simulation framework if sufficient data were available typically aquacrop is calibrated and validated against data from field experiments to confirm that multiple aspects of physiological crop development are accurately represented e g tsakmakis et al 2019 and qiao 2012 this process is appropriate for simulations aimed at replicating observed growth and yield in a specific setting such as at a single experimental site however the objective of the work presented in this manuscript is fundamentally different in that we aim to develop general estimates of irrigation yield response that are suitable for different field and farm conditions for this reason we compared simulated yields to observed county scale yield data from usda nass a fundamental limitation with this method of model validation is that aquacrop simulates yields under specific growing conditions while usda nass data represents average yield across all farms in a county thus there will undoubtedly be differences between the two datasets but both should at least be correlated in their response to higher rainfall and other beneficial climate conditions in the absence of other data for model validation this approach was deemed sufficient for the purposes of our study modeled yields from aquacrop were then compared to historic yields for middlesex county and isle of wight county for cotton taken from the national agricultural statistics service united states department of agriculture 2017 in general yields produced from aquacrop were higher than those from historic data likely because aquacrop did not take into account losses due to environmental factors such as disease or pests and exhibited greater variability year to year supplementary table s1 this is to be expected as the nass yields are results averaged across multiple farms within the county which likely masks significant variability nevertheless aquacrop was able to generally replicate year to year patterns in yields suggesting that this approach provides a reasonable estimate of the impact of water stress when other factors are held constant modeled yields were then used to develop response functions relating yields to growing season weather for different crops and soil conditions random forest models were used to account for interdependencies and nonlinearities between explanatory variables and yields breiman 2001 because yields will vary based on both total rainfall as well the timing in which it occurs multiple climatic variables were evaluated as possible predictors of yield average growing season temperature total growing season rainfall the maximum consecutive days where no rainfall occurred the maximum number of consecutive days where the 5 10 and 20 day moving average daily rainfall was below 3 mm per day the maximum number of consecutive days where the 5 10 and 20 day moving average daily rainfall was below 1 5 mm per day the moving average metrics were designed to account for the occurrence of prolonged periods where small volumes of rainfall occur and thus aren t captured by the metrics based on no rainfall but where the average rainfall amount is below plant requirements for each combination of crop and soil type a maximum of five explanatory variables were selected using out of sample cross validation to identify those minimized predicted mean squared error the variables selected for each crop and soil combination are presented in supplementary table s2 2 2 4 decision support tool calculations ifet combines the user provided information with stored data on irrigation costs weather and prices as well as yield response functions to calculate the costs and benefits of installing an irrigation system using the two tiered monte carlo simulation approach described in section 2 1 in the first tier of the monte carlo simulation the tool calculates annual operating costs and additional revenues for a sequence of l years where l is the lifetime of the system in years these l years of operating costs and revenues are combined with a single randomly selected value for installation costs to estimate a single lifetime annualized net value and net present value for the irrigation system in the second level of the monte carlo simulation this process is then repeated 250 times each time selecting different irrigation cost values and different sequences of weather and price data to estimate operating costs and revenues the tool first selects a random value from the predefined distributions of irrigation system capital costs acre energy requirements kwh ai labor requirements hours ai and maintenance costs ai the tool multiplies the randomly selected irrigation system capital costs in dollars per acre with the user supplied acreage information to calculate total capital costs this total cost is then combined with user supplied information on the down payment interest rate and loan repayment period to calculated the annualized loan payment for the system as in equation 1 p c r 1 1 r i where p is the annual loan repayment c is the total capital cost r is the interest rate and i is the loan repayment period the tool then generates a sequence of l random annual values for fuel costs crop prices and weather conditions based on historic data using vector autoregression var time series models because little cross correlation was observed between historic economic fuel and crop prices and weather data separate var models were to generate sequences of economic and climatic variables an economic var model was fit to simulate autocorrelation and cross correlation in prices for the user selected fuel and crop a climatic var was fit to simulate autocorrelation and cross correlation in the county level climate variables used to drive the yield response functions random forecasts were generated from each var model by randomly sampling from a multivariate normal distribution with mean values equal to the var n ahead forecast and the residual covariance structure estimated from the var model zivot and wang 2006 the simulated weather and economic data is used with the stored yield response functions to estimate yields revenues and operating costs for that year fig 3 county level weather data is entered into the appropriate yield response model for the user supplied soil type and crop to calculate rainfed yields irrigated yields are assumed to be the maximum i e non water stressed yields from the aquacrop simulations if a user selects ideal growth the tool assumes that this yield is achieved by applying the difference between growing season rainfall and the total water requirement for that crop if a user selects scheduled irrigation then the tool will calculate irrigated yields using the regression equations replacing the rainfall value with the sum of total rainfall and irrigation water applied the estimated rainfed and irrigated yields are then multiplied by the user supplied acreage and crop prices for that same year to determine a user s estimated income with and without irrigation comparing the irrigated and rainfed yields allows users to see the additional income they could have earned had there not been any water deficit under the weather and price conditions experienced in that year finally the tool calculates the operating costs necessary to irrigate based on the weather and economic data for that year since agricultural producers in virginia do not generally depend on irrigation for all of their crop water requirements annual operating expenses are calculated based on the volume of irrigation water applied the randomly selected value for the irrigation energy requirement in kwh ai is combined with the user supplied fuel source the randomly generated fuel price for that year and the amount of irrigation needed as in equation 2 p o w e r c o s t r e x p e x v d where re is the randomly selected energy requirement in kwh ai and v is the volume of irrigation applied in acre inches based on either the user supplied irrigation schedule if the user selects the scheduled irrigation option or the difference between seasonal rainfall and water requirements if the user selects the optimal irrigation option d is the energy density which equals 40 283 kw h gallon for diesel fuel 0 304 kw h ft3 for natural gas and 1 kw h kwh for electricity pe is the price for the user selected fuel in dollars per gallon cubic feet or kwh for diesel natural gas or electricity respectively energy costs for electric systems are multiplied by 0 5 to account for the improved efficiency of these pumps fraizer 2017 martin et al 2011 labor costs for the year are estimated by multiplying the randomly selected labor requirement value in hours ai by the user supplied labor payment rate hour and the volume of irrigation in ai maintenance costs are estimated by multiplying the randomly selected maintenance cost in ai by the volume of irrigation in ai these operating costs are summed to estimate total operating costs for the year and the net financial benefit of irrigating in that year is calculated as the difference between the additional revenue from irrigating and the sum of the loan repayment and operating costs this process is repeated l times where l is the user defined system lifetime in years and used to calculate net present value as well as an estimate of average annual operating costs and financial benefits this provides a single potential value of the lifetime financial benefits of installing irrigation assuming that system costs are equivalent to the randomly selected values and weather and crop prices are equivalent to those from the randomly generated time series however actual lifetime costs could not be expected to equal this exact amount since there is no reason to expect that actual costs weather and price conditions would equal those selected thus this process is then repeated 250 times for the second level of the monte carlo simulation each time selecting different random values for irrigation system costs and different years on which weather and price data is based this results in a total of 250 simulations of system lifetime costs and ifet then presents the user with a range of potential costs and benefits from across these simulations 2 3 case study example ifet can estimate net benefits associated with irrigation for multiple crops corn cotton soybeans and wheat irrigation system types center pivot linear move hose reel and drip and fuel sources diesel electricity and natural gas to demonstrate the tool s results a set of example calculations were completed for a hypothetical case study farm this hypothetical farm is located in culpeper county virginia on loamy sand soil the case study results present costs and benefits associated with irrigating 100 acres of corn using a diesel powered center pivot irrigation system with an assumed system life of 20 years operating costs assume that the grower schedules irrigation based on rainfall amounts rather than a set schedule each week to avoid applying excess water costs also assume a user provided labor cost of 10 per hour and that the system is financed with a 20 000 down payment and the remaining costs covered by a loan with an interest rate of 4 and a repayment period of 10 years all subsequent figures show results for this case study example 3 case study results fig 4 presents an example of the summary information on lifetime costs and revenues that is presented within the user interface of ifet this summary includes an overview of system costs in tabular and graphic form including annual operating costs investment cost and loan repayment as well as a summary of the annual additional income from irrigating after accounting for operating costs and loan repayment costs are presented as average annual values as well as net present value it is important to note that values presented for operating costs are the average of annual costs taken across the lifetime of the system i e although fuel costs will naturally vary from year to year these numbers only present long term average costs not year to year variability the average lower and upper estimates presented in the table are the expected value and bounds of the 95 confidence interval from the 250 monte carlo simulation run for the lifespan of the system thus they are primarily reflective of epistemic uncertainty surrounding installation costs and operational requirements other results within ifet were developed to present year to year variations and are discussed in the subsequent sections while it would be possible to present the full statistical distribution of results for each aspect of system costs the tool only includes a lower and upper estimate in order to make the results understandable to a wider audience than would be likely with more complex probabilistic information crettaz von roten 2006 gigerenzer et al 2005 for the case study example the largest costs are associated with fuel and loan repayment which have an average estimated value of 6100 and 9400 per year respectively although the loan repayment appears to be the largest contributor to annual costs the fuel costs exhibit more uncertainty with a range of 10 000 between the lower and upper estimate compared to a range of 2000 for the loan repayment average additional income from irrigation is expected to be between 17 600 and 33 200 per year when averaged over the lifetime of the pivot after accounting for loan repayment and operating costs the average additional net revenue is expected to range from 400 to 16 800 per year thus it appears that installing irrigation will be financially advantageous with an expected npv of 141 100 and an average additional revenue of 7800 per year but that it is possible that high costs combined with low returns or commodity prices could result in an overall loss of revenue when averaged over the lifetime of the system ifet also includes several graphs to help characterize stochastic uncertainty in costs and revenues associated with irrigation and the impact that different stochastic variables such as growing season rainfall and commodity prices have on these costs fig 5 presents a screenshot of an example time series graph showing a year by year comparison of revenue with and without irrigation for the cast study example this graph is not meant to be a prediction of the amount of income earned each year since prediction of growing season rainfall commodity prices and fuel costs would be impossible instead it is meant to represent a possible trajectory of total revenue and provide the user with a sense of how often the system is profitable and what the range of annual additional revenues might be from year to year in our case study example irrigation only results in greater revenue in five out of the ten first years of system s lifespan because the loan is still being paid off at that point and additional revenues from irrigation do not exceed the combined operating and loan costs however one single year where irrigation is highly profitable year 4 results in enough additional revenue approximately 40 000 to make up for the five years in which operating costs were greater than additional revenue in the second half of the system s life irrigation is profitable in all ten years this graph also shows that the losses and gains associated with irrigation in different years are not of the same magnitude losses from irrigation generally don t exceed 10 000 in any given year whereas gains from irrigation can be quite large and a small number of highly profitable years years 4 15 16 18 and 19 can make up for years with losses in addition to showing the year to year variability in irrigation revenues and costs ifet also aims to show the factors that influence this variability fig 6 shows two additional screenshots that related irrigation revenue in our case study example to growing season rainfall and corn prices the top plot shows that irrigation ceases to be profitable when growing season rainfall reaches about 22 in per year and that the majority of years experience rainfall below this amount however even in very dry years the additional revenue from irrigating can vary substantially likely due to variability in commodity prices panel b of fig 6 demonstrates how revenues relate to commodity prices while the maximum additional return from irrigation does increase with corn prices negative returns from irrigation are possible even when commodity prices are high this would occur in years where rainfall was high enough that the additional yields from irrigation are so minor that even with good prices additional returns don t exceed operating costs overall this demonstrates how in any given year both weather and price conditions have to be favorable for irrigation to result in higher revenues however the additional revenues in these years may be so high that they can make irrigation financially advantageous even if they do not occur frequently 4 discussion in an effort to demonstrate our approach towards the sampling and representation of uncertainty we made a number of simplifications which could be addressed within the same framework to improve precision in cost estimates for instance we make the simplifying assumption that increased yields under different irrigation systems are equivalent as has been done in other studies lamm et al 2006 however this may not be the case for instance yields of some crops have been shown to be higher under drip irrigation when compared to overhead possibly due to lower evaporative losses and a more favorable thermal environment lamm et al 2010 montezar et al 2016 we also assume that system costs increase linearly with field size but in reality costs per acre will vary drip irrigation systems in particular tend to become more economically competitive in small fields lamm et al 2010 while our example tool is focused on comparing financial outcomes with and without irrigation addressing these simplifications would be particularly important in an analysis aimed at comparing different systems which would further support irrigation investment decision making nevertheless certain differences between systems are apparent even in our simple tool for example drip irrigation systems tend to have higher installation and lower energy requirements when compared to overhead systems whereas hose pull systems have higher labor requirements than the other systems evaluated table 2 perhaps the greatest simplification made in our analysis was the treatment of irrigation impacts on yield because we needed generalized equations for estimating the difference between rainfed and irrigated years for different crops locations and soil types we used the aquacrop model to simulate rainfed yields using 30 years of weather data the results of these simulations were then used to fit regression equations that could be used to repeatedly estimate yields for each iteration of the monte carlo simulation although our regression models based on rainfall amount and dry spell occurrence generally fit the results from the aquacrop simulations well yields will also respond to other weather conditions such as extreme heat schlenker and roberts 2009 rainfall variability auffhammer et al 2012 fishman 2016 and whether dry spells coincide with sensitive growing periods usda natural resource conservation service 2010 one method for incorporating these impacts would be to use the aquacrop model or another physiological crop model to estimate yields directly as in andresen et al 2016 while this approach would provide more sophisticated yield estimates it would potentially introduce computational challenges if simulations must be run numerous times model emulators might be an effective way of reducing computational times blanc 2017 makowski et al 2015 this could be a valuable avenue for understanding how irrigation practices interact with other management approaches such as conservation measures aimed at improving soil water holding capacity to influence overall profitability and would also allow representation of a broader range of irrigation management strategies including deficit irrigation o brien et al 2001 rodrigues et al 2013a in our analysis we used uniform random variables to represent our epistemically uncertain variables because the small number of studies available precluded the use of more detailed statistical distributions thomopoulos 2013c and to distinguish between epistemic and aleatory uncertainty ferson and ginzburg 1996 furthermore more detailed probabilistic representation of uncertainty may have made the decision support tool results less interpretable to a wide audience however other statistical forms for representing this uncertainty could be used and may be particularly important in contexts where more detailed results are desired the use of expert elicitation which has a long history in the field of risk analysis could be useful in this regard lindley 1987 otway and winterfeldt 1992 this is particularly true since knowledgeable individuals are likely to have extensive experience and understanding of irrigation costs even if documented data on costs in different circumstances is limited presenting a complete statistical distribution of monte carlo simulation results could provide insights that are masked by only including a range of possible results for instance a skewed distribution with a long tail of high costs would suggest that for most circumstances costs are low but a small number of simulations with really high costs are driving the average up a user could then investigate those high cost simulations to identify the factors led to that situation and evaluate whether there are operational strategies that might make those conditions less likely using scenario discovery approaches bryant and lempert 2010 kwakkel and jaxa rozen 2016 finally a number of studies have pointed out that irrigation decisions are not driven by financial considerations alone and that risk preferences can influence the decision to invest in irrigation boyer et al 2014 vandeveer et al 1989 as well as how it is operated wibowo et al 2017 incorporating these risk preferences into financial assessments would be a valuable area for additional research that builds off of the approach developed here 5 conclusions the decision about whether or not to install irrigation in humid regions is consequential and complex and multiple studies and tools have been developed to assist producers in making this decision however the profitability of supplemental irrigation is highly sensitive to variability in weather commodity prices and energy costs as well as assumptions about system costs operational parameters and economic factors because few studies fully account for these sources of uncertainty they can only characterize profitability under a very specific set of conditions making them of limited use for broad scale practical decision making in this work we present an approach for characterizing this uncertainty within a decision support tool aimed at evaluating farm level financial outcomes from installing supplemental irrigation based on two levels of monte carlo simulation in the first level aleatory uncertainty in naturally varying conditions such as weather and crop prices is sampled to characterize the impact that year to year variation in these factors has on profitability in the second level epistemic uncertainty stemming from lack of knowledge about system costs and operational parameters is sampled to characterize how this uncertainty impacts long term financial outcomes we demonstrate this approach within a decision support tool aimed at providing farm level estimates of irrigation profitability for corn soybean cotton and wheat production in virginia the interactive tool can be used to evaluate profitability for multiple crops irrigation system types and locations the tool presents users with a personalized cost benefit analysis by giving them a range of expected long term costs and revenues as well as multiple graphs that demonstrate year to year variability in revenue while the cost estimates included in our tool are relatively simple the overall monte carlo framework could easily incorporate more sophisticated approaches by providing a more complete representation of uncertainty in economic estimates this approach can capture the range of possible financial outcomes from supplemental irrigation providing practical insights to improve irrigation decision making

10567,the treatment of wastewater and its reuse for crop irrigation is one of the solutions for efficient management of the available water but the acceptance of this type of recycled water by farmers and their willingness to use and pay for it has not been well documented especially in iran using the contingent valuation method and a binary probit model the current study assessed farmers acceptance of treated wastewater i e their willingness to use and pay for applying treated wastewater in crop irrigation and explored factors affecting farmers willingness to use and pay in khorramabad iran by proposing three qualities of wastewater and three prices for treated wastewater outlflow of the plant treatment physico chemical tests of treated wastewater in the study area showed that it was suitable for surface irrigation of crops farmers willingness to use was differentiated based on treated wastewater quality i e most farmers 91 7 were willing to use treated wastewater of quality 1 q1 one third of the farmers 33 0 were willing to use treated wastewater of quality 2 q2 whereas only 14 0 of the farmers were willing to use treated wastewater of quality 3 q3 regarding willingness to pay more than half of the farmers 56 were willing to pay for treated wastewater in the price of 1 500 000 rials per ha which equals to fresh water irrigation charge less than one fifth of the farmers 18 3 were willing to pay at the highest bid level of 1 800 000 rials per ha for the outflow of refinery whereas the vast majority 91 7 were willing to pay at the lowest bid level of 1 200 000 rials per ha among socio economic variables the living place had the greatest impact on both willingness to use and pay while the reuse of treated wastewater had the greatest impact on willingness to pay among knowledge attitudinal variables health risk perception and education had the greatest impact on willingness to use while education and information had the greatest impact on willingness to pay use of appropriate incentives such as price reduction of treated wastewater according to quality testing physico chemical properties and microbial contamination of treated wastewater as well as extension training courses can be effective on promoting farmers willingness to use treated wastewater for crop irrigation keywords irrigation khorramabad sewage treatment treated wastewater water scarcity 1 introduction as almost 70 of the world water is used in agriculture the reuse of treated wastewater tww for crop irrigation can substantially reduce the amount of water to be extracted from fresh water sources such as groundwaters and rivers apart from reducing ejection of wastewater to the environment gleick 2000 pedrero et al 2010 hence the limited availability of freshwater in many parts of the world is a serious constraint for agricultural production sheidaei et al 2016 the water scarcity around the globe leads to adoption and use of unconventional waters such as treated municipal wastewater and saline drainage water as well as other kind of wastewater in many large urban areas which were previously thought to have sufficient water resources okun 1996 dixon et al 1999 nolde 1999 weizhen and andrew 2003 junying et al 2004 two thirds of the area of iran is located in semi arid and arid regions of the world zarghani et al 2013 average annual precipitation of the country is 250 mm with erratic spatial and temporal distribution with almost 70 of precipitation falling in the northern and western regions of the country forouzani and karami 2010 under this condition the agricultural sector accounts for more than 93 of fresh water supplies consumption and 97 of net blue water abstraction ardakanian 2005 and thus iran is facing severe water shortage despite these problems there is little effort to treat and reuse wastewater and other kinds of recycled water in agriculture as a suitable option to cope with water shortage therefore it is necessary to find a way to overcome future possible crises by applying reasonable strategies ehsani and khaledi 2003 various strategies have been developed to meet the growing demands for water over current decades including interareas water transfer which requires a lot of time and cost sea or saline water desalinization and water conservation measures by using efficient water use technologies such as pressured irrigation systems wastewater treatment and recycling is now considered as a practical alternative for coping with water scarcity faruqui et al 2004 garcia and pargament 2015 this method is considered an alternative resource of water supply and it is one of the reliable water resources even under drought conditions nazari et al 2006 as menegaki et al 2007 quoted from tsagarakis 2005 any integration protection and sustainable management of water in today s societies will incorporate marginal waters that can be recycled therefore water rehabilitation recycling and reuse are now recognized as key components of water management po et al 2003 such practices help to protect environmental quality while at the same time alleviate the relentless pressure on limited freshwater sources adewumi et al 2010 to make projects of water reuse successful several key factors must be considered including public opinion risk analysis evaluation of monetary benefits and willingness to pay as well as the environmental impacts of recycled water lazarova et al 2001 acceptance and successful implementation of wastewater use projects in agriculture largely depends upon support of the farmers but no studies have addressed farmers willingness to use wtu and willingness to pay wtp for tww after testing tww quality for crop irrigation before studying wtu in a remote and arid area mainly with resource poor farmers indeed little information is known about farmers perceptions of tww use in iran sheidaei et al 2016 partially because assessing farmers willingness to accept wastewater use for crop irrigation represents a relatively recent question in the study area hence this aspect calls for a better understanding of decisive factors of acceptance among farmers in this context farmers acceptance of tww reuse for irrigated agriculture should be assessed so that greater acceptance of wastewater uses could be fostered farmers acceptance or rejection of reclaimed wastewater is influenced by specific local cultural religious and socio economic conditions while economic and technical factors such as water costs structure of irrigation networks and crop patterns should also be considered ganoulis 2012 however social factors have been recognized as the main challenges to more effective water management compared with technical factors ricart et al 2019 moreover non market benefits by the use of treated wastewater in agriculture justify its implementation as those benefits overcome the average treatment costs alcon et al 2010 2013 nevertheless only identifying potential users of tww is not enough for planning purposes but there must be some assurance before embarking on design and construction of reuse projects so that the intended users will be ready to use and pay for the reclaimed wastewater tanik et al 2010 therefore assessing the potential market for reclaimed wastewater is necessary but the limited information about potential users explains in part the existing gap between planned and practiced reuse abu madi et al 2003 based on the above the present study was conducted with three main objectives a to test the appropriateness of tww for irrigation based on its physico chemical properties b to estimate farmers wtu and wtp for tww using the contingent valuation method cvm and c to examine factors affecting farmers wtu and wtp for tww use for crop irrigation the contribution of this work is mainly empirical providing new evidence on the topic in the study area in this sense it could help in bridging the knowledge gap in what predicts acceptance behavior and thus allowing agricultural managers and water planners to overcome concerns often held by farmers on tww use 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and quality of treated wastewater tww this study was conducted in baba abbas region of lorestan province in september 2017 fig 1 baba abbas is the only region of the province where the sewage water is treated conveyed to flow of kashkan river and provided directly to farmers during the dry season of summer all farmers of the region have water right from the current water source kashkan river but the supply is not reliable in seasons with high water demand for crop irrigation i e from mid spring to mid fall especially in summer periods of severe water shortage often occur farmers pay for the use of river water the water price is determined by the water bureau authorities of the province based on crop product price e g up to 3 of the crop income tww is pumped to the river at regular times but it is not enough for all farmers of the county for the moment it is conveyed to the farms of the study area through a canal in water shortage periods three qualities of wastewater were introduced to farmers for the assessment of wtu q1 includes complete treatment of wastewater from the sewage entering to treatment system which passes three steps a physical treatment of sewage such as deposited waste and suspended materials in sewage b sewage aeration c sewage chemical treatment including chlorine q2 includes sewage that only passes through the first two phases of treatment i e physical treatment and aeration and q3 that includes raw sewage considered as the first stage of treatment moreover three prices for the outflow of refinery were introduced to farmers for the assessment of wtp the first price wtp1 is the base price of 1 500 000 rials ha i e the price of conventional water of the river the farmers pay for irrigation as defined by the water office of the area the second proposed price wtp2 is 20 higher than the base price wtp2 1 800 000 rials ha and the third proposed price wtp3 is 20 lower than the base price wtp3 1 200 000 rials ha 2 2 sample survey instrument and data collection the statistical population of this study consisted of farmers of baba abbas region who use the kashkan river for irrigation all farmers of baba abbas were 120 eleven of them were orchard farmers and because the study focused on crop farmers wheat and corn are dominant crops in the region orchard farmers were not considered in the survey a questionnaire was used as instrument for data collection the first part of the questionnaire included demographic characteristics of the respondents i e age living place education number of educated members of family and income the second part contained farmers farm characteristics crop yields and type of water used for crop irrigation the third part included information sources used by farmers for treatment of sewage water and use of this type of water treated water for crop irrigation farmers attitudes towards environmental issues and health risks related to the use of tww for crop irrigation water shortage attitudes and knowledge about the use of tww were examined in part four the variables of interest i e farmers wtu and wtp for tww for crop irrigation were examined in part five in this part farmers were asked whether they would be willing to use wtu each quality q1 q2 and q3 of this type of water on the basis of a simple dichotomous question no yes for each quality separately then farmers were asked whether they would be willing to pay wtp for the outflow of refinery on the basis of a simple dichotomous question no yes for each of three proposed prices compared with freshwater therefore we asked three wtp questions to each farmer with three price levels considering the outflow of refinery compared with freshwater in this manner each respondent produced a score for wtu each of three proposed qualities q1 q2 and q3 of tww and a score for wtp each of three proposed prices for the outflow of refinery for irrigating their crops the variables of the study and their description are illustrated in table 1 after listing farmers residential addresses a home to home and face to face contact procedure was followed for data collection some farmers were present at the first visit of the researchers to their living place and the questionnaires were filled out at that time in case of farmers absence several visits were required finally all farmers voluntarily participated in this study because they found the topic intriguing and all questionnaires were filled out the study examined factors affecting farmers wtu and wtp for reuse of tww as well as the levels of wtp for tww use by farmers wtu is a decision that occurs before that of wtp wtu firstly determines whether one is prepared to use a good regardless of one will use it or not then wtp determines how much one is prepared to pay for that good that is related to the attractiveness of the good and its price menegaki et al 2007 based on the literature our proposed prices were only for tww outflow of treatment for this reason wtu was assessed without taking prices into account after a literature review a number of factors affecting farmers wtu and wtp for tww were considered depending on the context of the research problem these are socio economic factors including age income wheat yield corn yield number of educated members in the family living place and use of recycled water as well as knowledge attitudinal variables including knowledge information perception of water shortage health risk education and environmental attitude the wtp and wtu models were set up in the form of a logit probit framework the research tool was validated by a panel of experts consisting of academic staff and field experts water engineers including three irrigation and drainage experts and two agricultural economics experts from the department of water engineering and agricultural management one environmental economist from the department of economics of the university of mohaghegh ardabili and two water field experts from lorestan province iran a pilot study was conducted with 30 farmers of the sample for determining the reliability of the research tool some questions were removed following feedback after one week we came back and began data collection with 79 farmers after data collection we applied kolmogorov smirnov test to compare the means of the pilot sample group and the full sample group of farmers because there were no significant differences between the two groups we assumed that the two groups showed similar responses during the two periods of data collection except for some questions that were not relevant and were deleted therefore the data of the first group 30 farmers were merged with data of the second group 79 farmers cronbach s alpha values showed high reliability for eight statements of environmental attitudes α 0 710 and for three statements of health risk α 0 785 2 3 binary probit model a binary probit model was used in this study according to the general formula p y 1 φ xi β the binary probit model was used because the dependent variable in this study was dichotomous 0 and 1 the purpose of this model is to estimate the probability that an observation with particular characteristics will fall into a specific one of the categories in the regression eq 1 β represents the marginal effects of explanatory variables on the dependent variable the dependent variable represents the utility that is invisible by estimating β the probability of y will be as follows 1 pi p yi 1 xi φ xi β φ β 1 β 2 x 2 i βkxki where yi and xi are the dependent and independent variables respectively pi is the probability of y i 1 n indexing number of farmers k number of explanatory variables in the first step to avoid collinearity problems among independent variables and increasing of freedom degree for estimation the variables affecting wtu and wtp were divided into two categories i socio economic and ii knowledge attitudinal variables and the impact of the variables of each group on wtu and wtp were examined separately the study examined the impact of each of these variables on the dependent variables i e wtu and wtp under the binary probit framework including wtu1 wtu for tww q1 wtu2 wtu for tww q2 and wtu3 wtu for tww q3 for the wtu variable as well as wtp1 wtp at first proposed price 1 500 000 rials ha for the outflow of refinery wtp2 wtp at second proposed price 1 800 000 rials ha for the outflow of refinery and wtp3 wtp at third proposed price 1 200 000 rials ha for the outflow of refinery for the wtp variable the rate of farmers wtp for tww use for irrigation was also estimated there are several techniques to design a core question to assess wtp open ended questions proposed price dichotomous choice referendum are among them akbari et al 2017 the type of data acquisition instrument can have a great impact on the accuracy of the collected data therefore it should commensurate with questions of the contingent valuation method cvm and public opinion surveys gayarti and barbier 2000 where people are asked about their preferences according to an assigned monetary value the proposed price and face to face interviewing were used for implementing the cvm while both cvm and choice modeling or control experiments ce are suitable for assessing the value of a rural good the ce approach is capable of measuring the marginal value of a change in the rural good characteristics specified by the researcher while the cvm is used to value the rural good and any associated features as a single whole package hynes et al 2011 the valuation is a function of characteristics of the respondents and random components that cause differences among respondents unless respondents have the same characteristics the capacity of the cvm to capture public preferences allows the analysis of the heterogeneity of demand for a rural good or measure by accounting for the effect of several characteristics of the respondents on their wtp alcon et al 2010 the cvm is highly flexible and can be used to assess the economic value of virtually any good and service especially goods and services that are easily understood by users and are consumed in discrete units venkatachalam 2004 moreover the nature of cv studies and the results of cv studies are easy to analyze and describe the maximum likelihood ml method was used to examine and estimate the related regression baghestani and zibaei 2010 then the parameters were estimated by the maximum interval method to maximize the likelihood of a real wtp of farmer being between the two upper and lower limits in fact in this method there are two dependent variables upper and lower limit to use the interval maximum likelihood technique in this study we used the recurrent bidding method auction method for data collection baghestani and zibaei 2010 it is assumed that the maximum wtp wtpm of respondents is at least equal to the number selected in the recurrent proposed bidding method by the respondents and the larger value afterwards is wtpl baghestani and zibaei 2010 the probability that the wtp i occurs between wtpm i and wtpl i is as below prob wtpm i wtp i wtpl i prob wtp i wtpl i prob wtp i wtpm i or else as in eq 2 2 φ wtp l i e wt p i σ i φ wtp m i e wt p i σ i where φ is the standardized cumulative density function and the expected value of wtp for each person i is the ith wtp for each case wtpm i is the maximum wtp wtpl i is the larger value afterwards while e wtp i in the case of socio economic variables is obtained from eq 3 3 wtp i e wtpi ξ i α β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β 4 x 4 β 5 x 5 β 6 x 6 β 7 x 7 ξi where α constant value x 1 income x 2 farmers age x 3 wheat yield x 4 corn yield x 5 number of

whole model when the p value calculated for the lr of each variable is 0 05 the significance of the model is confirmed 3 results 3 1 appropriateness of tww for irrigation before investigating farmers wtu and wtp for using tww the composition of tww was measured in the laboratory in a sample of tww from the outflow of refinery of khorramabad for evaluation using existing standards the acidity ph of the tww sample was 7 8 table 2 which is in the permissible range table 3 measured values of total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were 417 8 mg l and 0 71 ds m respectively table 2 the allowable limits of these variables were 2000 mg l for tds and 3 ds m for ec indicating no significant restriction of the tww for irrigation sodium na is a main parameter in the evaluation of irrigation water quality and can cause soil physical problems such as decreasing soil infiltration the permissible limit value of na in the tww for irrigation use is about 250 mg l shakir et al 2017 the concentration of na in the sample was 30 1 mg l table 2 indicating a slight restriction on the use of this kind of water for irrigation sodium hazard is usually stated by sar sodium adsorption ratio which is calculated from the ratio of sodium to calcium and magnesium sar is an important factor for determining the suitability of tww for crop irrigation in order to investigate the hazard of sodium on soil infiltration sar is considered with ec the sar and ec values of the sample were 5 9 and 0 71 ds m respectively table 2 according to the criteria presented in table 3 the tww quality is in the moderate range regarding the values of bod5 and caco3 the tww quality is not limited in terms of these two parameters overall it can be concluded that the tww of khorramabad does not have a significant degree of restriction for use in crop irrigation 3 2 farmers profile the average age of participants was 51 16 years with most farmers being in the age group of 43 60 years table 4 most farmers belonged to a family with up to 4 educated members whereas almost one third belonged to a family with 4 educated members most farmers were living in villages as normally expected but almost one fifth were living in urban areas the average income of participants was 360 24 million iranian rials irr with 1 usd being equal to 42 000 irr the average wheat yield was 4 74 tonnes per ha and the average corn yield was 42 75 tonnes per ha the majority of the farmers were using tww for crop irrigation whereas a considerable fraction was not using this type of water in their farms indeed almost 70 of the farmers of baba abbas were using tww for crop irrigation but almost 30 of them were persisting against tww use while it is important to know factors affecting farmers acceptance of tww by farmers of the region in this study we had in mind all users of kashkan river who are potential users of tww in the future so that the results can be useful for future development because there are huge amounts of sewage that are lost in the county while farmers suffer from water shortage on the other hand the development of refinery stations and treating water is very costly so that users should pay for using treated water for irrigation for this reason we proposed three quality of sewage water to investigate farmers response 3 3 environmental attitude and health risk perception towards tww more than half of the farmers 51 4 had relatively positive attitude towards the use of tww for crop irrigation ea1 but only one third of them 33 0 had this attitude for orchard irrigation ea2 and less than half stated that tww pollutes groundwater and the environment ea3 ea4 table 5 despite moderate attitudes towards use of tww compared with untreated wastewater farmers attitudes towards treating this water were highly positive ea5 ea8 with reference to health risk perception more than 60 of the farmers perceived high or very high health risk from tww use in crop production table 5 3 4 wtu and wtp for tww in crop production the vast majority of the participants 92 were willing to use the q1 tww whereas wtu q2 and wtu q3 tww were 33 and 14 respectively fig 2 a more than half 56 of the farmers were willing to pay for tww at the price of 1 500 000 irr per ha wtp1 which was equal to fresh water irrigation charge fig 2b less than one fifth 18 of farmers were willing to pay for tww at the higher price of 1 800 000 irr per ha wtp2 whereas the vast majority of the farmers 92 were willing to pay for tww at the lowest price of 1 200 000 irr per ha wtp3 it appears that the cost of tww is one of the main factors affecting farmers tendency towards the use of tww 3 5 information sources of farmers on tww farmers information on wastewater treatment and reuse was very limited with mean values 1 table 6 because of the novelty of the subject there were no specific sources of information available on this subject for farmers extension services were the most common source of information followed by neighbors and relatives who often had no more information than the respondents radio and television programs do not offer programs on wastewater treatment and because of the low level of education farmers had little access to scientific journals and the internet experts of the bureau of water and sewage who are responsible for wastewater treatment were not a popular source of information 3 6 factors affecting wtu and wtp in binary logistic regression mcfadden r 2 is used to determine the amount of variability in the dependent variable explained by the explanatory variables according to table 7 the lr ratio was not significant for wtp3 in both socio economic and knowledge attitudinal variables but in the rest the lr ratio confirmed significance of the whole model among socio economic factors age had a significantly negative impact on wtu1 and a significantly positive impact on wtp1 and wtp2 table 7 wheat yield had a significantly positive impact on wtu1 wtu2 and wtp1 the number of educated members in the family had a significantly negative effect on wtu1 while the living place had a significantly negative impact on wtu2 and a significantly positive impact on wtu1 and wtp1 farmers residing in the region were more willing to use and pay for treated water of q1 than q2 the use of tww showed a significantly negative impact on wtp2 farmers who were using tww in their farms were less willing to pay for q2 wtp2 i e tww had negative impact on wtp2 briefly the living place and the use of tww were the main factors in our estimation from knowledge attitudinal factors knowledge had a significantly positive impact on wtu3 and information had a significantly positive impact on wtp1 table 7 perceived health risk had a significantly negative impact on wtu1 wtu2 and wtu3 as well as on wtp1 finally education had a significantly negative impact on wtu2 and wtu3 as well as on wtp1 and wtp2 health risk perception and education had the greatest impact on wtu while education and information had the greatest impact on wtp averagely farmers willingness to pay at the price of 1 500 000 irr wtp1 was 245 542 for price of 1 800 000 irr wtp2 it was equal to 32 833 and at the price of 1 200 000 wtp3 it was 132 379 irr this result implies that farmers were not much willing to pay for tww 4 discussion the current study tested the appropriateness of tww for crop irrigation based on its physico chemical properties explored farmers wtu and wtp for applying tww in crop irrigation and examined factors affecting farmers wtu and wtp for tww application in lorestan province of western iran the vast majority of the participants 92 were willing to use q1 tww while more than half of the farmers 56 were willing to pay for tww in the price of 1 500 000 irr per ha q1 which was equal to fresh water irrigation charge it appears that the price of tww is one of the main factors affecting farmers tendency towards the use of tww but the results suggest a promising era for reclaimed wastewater use for crop irrigation in the study area when farmers prefer lower water price it implies that cost is an important variable affecting their decision to use of tww because they believe that this kind of water has lower quality and thus it must be cheaper than freshwater evidently more effort will be required to improve farmers acceptance levels of tww through addressing various factors that influence their perceptions and attitudes sheidaei et al 2016 to this end findings of this study can be useful to identify farmers attitudes towards tww and determine the level of wtu and wtp for this type of water for crop irrigation the need for recycling and reusing wastewater especially in the agricultural sector of lorestan province is mainly because the water level of rivers decreases sharply especially in summer so that water does not meet the needs of farmers for crop irrigation in some regions climate change is expected to deteriorate this situation in the future quite similar trends among farmers from different countries can be found in the literature thessaly farmers in greece were willing to pay for recycled water especially during drought spells in the region in an area characterized by increased agricultural activity with cotton plants as the main crop bakopoulou et al 2010 moreover previous research from greece showed that 77 4 of the respondents had a positive attitude for the use of reclaimed water for olive tree irrigation but a very low proportion had a positive attitude for other irrigation uses in crop production petousi et al 2015 in india farmers predicted a significant increase in agricultural benefits due to additional irrigation with improved water and they were willing to pay significantly higher than what they were currently paying to secure these benefits biswas and venkatachalam 2015 similarly water reuse was acceptable to farmers in the south africa with opportunities securing good quality of water and limited restrictions on practical issues saldías et al 2016 on the contrary in the west bank tunisia and qatar most stakeholders viewed wastewater as unsafe for reuse in agriculture while users felt that local monitoring and oversight are insufficient dare and mohtar 2018 moreover stakeholders in southeastern italy including farmers and citizens showed a high level of acceptance of wastewater reuse saliba et al 2018 similarly a recent study from italy found adequate willingness of farmers towards wastewater reuse for crop irrigation michetti et al 2019 age negatively influenced wtu among farmers namely wtu was less among elderly farmers this finding is in line with previous research where young farmers had more positive attitudes towards tww compared with elderly farmers al shenaifi et al 2015 wheat yield had a positive impact on both wtu and wtp the use of this kind of water has advantages for crop growth such as increased productivity due to the supply of nutrients for plant growth musazura et al 2019 and presumably these benefits may be a reason for this result the number of educated members in the family negatively affected wtu1 probably because high number of educated members reflected elevated awareness of the health impacts of tww as more than 60 of the farmers perceived high or very high health risk from tww use in crop production table 5 faruqui et al 2004 also found that the use of sewage water had negative health effect on farmers their families and the environment the living place positively influenced both wtu and wtp similarly alataway et al 2011 showed a difference in attitudes among residents of rural and urban communities in saudi arabia i e residents of al hassa area rural area where a large scale wastewater reuse for unrestricted irrigation occurs were more sensitive than residents of tabuk area urban area in which the reuse of wastewater was very limited in contrast to alataway et al 2011 in our study residents of baba abbas region where a sewage reuse project is implemented were less sensitive than other farmers tww use negatively affected wtp among farmers during the field interviews participants noted that because of the low quality of tww in relation to fresh water that they experienced they were unwilling to use it participants also noted that because of the low quality the price of recycled water should be much lower than that of fresh water knowledge about tww positively affected wtu among farmers this finding is in line with those reported by an najah 2005 who found that more informed farmers of the consequences of using tww had more positive attitude towards the use of this type of water a positive attitude towards tww therefore could be a reason for farmers to use it attitude is a key component of human behavior gorton et al 2008 and the behavior of a person is usually expected to be consistent with the attitudes that the individual holds information positively influenced wtp which is consistent with findings of abu shaban et al 2006 who showed the major influence of information on the acceptance of tww in irrigated agriculture perception of health risk by tww use for crop irrigation negatively influenced both wtu and wtp during the field interviews farmers stated that they suffered by dermal diseases due to direct exposure to this type of water during working in farms irrigated with tww similarly fear of disease and pollution through the use of wastewater was a major factor determining farmers negative attitude toward the use of this kind of water abu shaban et al 2006 respondents from palestine believed that the main factor affecting purchase and consumption of products irrigated with reclaimed wastewater is the concern from potential health risks so more than half of the respondents refused to pay for edible commodities irrigated with tww ghanem 2012 probably this negative attitude may be an important factor for non wtu and non wtp for application of tww in crop production the main reason for the negative environmental attitudes towards tww can be related to low knowledge and information as well as weak information sources the result of health risk perceptions also indicates that respondents perceived this water as hazardous for people this result is related also to their experience of working in their farms after irrigation with tww they reported symptoms of problems such as itching skin infections and blisters when they worked in the farms irrigated with this water education negatively influenced wtp among farmers despite the fact that more educated farmers were aware that tww is a by product of lower quality than fresh water angelakis and bontoux 2001 in our study education had no significant impact on wtu additionally because of severe drought and water shortage in current years small scale farmers environmental attitudes had no significant impact on wtu or wtp which is in contrast to previous studies angelakis and bontoux 2001 as already stated among socio economic variables the living place had the greatest impact on wtu while the use of tww and the living place had the greatest impact on wtp among the knowledge attitudinal variables the perceived health risk and education had the greatest impact on wtu while education and information had the greatest impact on wtp therefore because farmers knowledge and information was weak and information sources were inefficient to provide farmers with information on how to use the tww in order to increase wtu and wtp for applying tww in crop irrigation and change the negative attitudes towards the use of recycled water it is necessary to increase farmers information by the use of mass media pioneer farmers and religious leaders farmers are also required to be classified in terms of literacy and information and extension services should provide them with the necessary training courses according to their level of literacy the descriptive findings of this study showed that quality is one of the factors influencing farmers wtu as also reported by carr et al 2011 while the price of tww is one of the factors affecting farmers wtp the price seriously affected farming profitability and farmers wtp for reclaimed wastewater in jordan and tunisia abu madi et al 2003 the use of appropriate incentives such as reduction in prices of tww in relation to freshwater because of its lower quality testing its physico chemical quality and microbial contamination as well as determining its suitability for irrigation can be effective in promoting wtu testing the quality of tww and comparing its results with related standards in this study showed that this water is suitable for surface irrigation due to the fact that all the farmlands of the region are irrigated with surface irrigation farmers should be aware of this result and trust the quality of tww of the refinery of khorramabad findings of this study have implications for other regions especially large cities with huge amounts of sewage where recycle sewage water for irrigation is going to be implemented this study has some limitations that should be taken into account for better view of the main findings of this work first the size of the sample is representative of the farmers community of the study area but generalization of findings to other areas should be done with care comprehensive data collection from different areas should be conducted in future research with farmers from different areas with different cropping patterns e g fruits and vegetables and different agricultural practices second the number and type of variables may be considered limited so that more information has to be collected in future research to capture additional variables of interest future research works could also address the aspect of transaction costs by considering setting up obligations of treatment plants to deliver reclaimed wastewater services to farmers 5 conclusions the current study tested the appropriateness of tww for crop irrigation based on its physico chemical properties explored farmers wtu and wtp for applying tww in crop irrigation and examined factors affecting farmers wtu and wtp for tww application in lorestan province of western iran generally farmers showed a positive perception of tww reuse for crop irrigation probably because they are aware of the problem of water scarcity among socio economic variables the living place had the greatest impact on wtu while the use of tww and the living place had the greatest impact on wtp among the knowledge attitudinal variables the perceived health risk and education had the greatest impact on wtu while education and information had the greatest impact on wtp the work provides new evidence on the topic explaining in part the existing gap between planned and practiced reuse of tww thus bridging the knowledge gap in what can define and predict acceptance behavior allowing agricultural managers and water planners to address concerns often held by farmers on tww use moreover the importance of raising stakeholders awareness and encouraging their involvement to foster technology diffusion is essential in terms of policy implications for informing local actors a more careful look at local water needs by potential users is required along with building on personal experiences and addressing potential business specific water related concerns declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10567,the treatment of wastewater and its reuse for crop irrigation is one of the solutions for efficient management of the available water but the acceptance of this type of recycled water by farmers and their willingness to use and pay for it has not been well documented especially in iran using the contingent valuation method and a binary probit model the current study assessed farmers acceptance of treated wastewater i e their willingness to use and pay for applying treated wastewater in crop irrigation and explored factors affecting farmers willingness to use and pay in khorramabad iran by proposing three qualities of wastewater and three prices for treated wastewater outlflow of the plant treatment physico chemical tests of treated wastewater in the study area showed that it was suitable for surface irrigation of crops farmers willingness to use was differentiated based on treated wastewater quality i e most farmers 91 7 were willing to use treated wastewater of quality 1 q1 one third of the farmers 33 0 were willing to use treated wastewater of quality 2 q2 whereas only 14 0 of the farmers were willing to use treated wastewater of quality 3 q3 regarding willingness to pay more than half of the farmers 56 were willing to pay for treated wastewater in the price of 1 500 000 rials per ha which equals to fresh water irrigation charge less than one fifth of the farmers 18 3 were willing to pay at the highest bid level of 1 800 000 rials per ha for the outflow of refinery whereas the vast majority 91 7 were willing to pay at the lowest bid level of 1 200 000 rials per ha among socio economic variables the living place had the greatest impact on both willingness to use and pay while the reuse of treated wastewater had the greatest impact on willingness to pay among knowledge attitudinal variables health risk perception and education had the greatest impact on willingness to use while education and information had the greatest impact on willingness to pay use of appropriate incentives such as price reduction of treated wastewater according to quality testing physico chemical properties and microbial contamination of treated wastewater as well as extension training courses can be effective on promoting farmers willingness to use treated wastewater for crop irrigation keywords irrigation khorramabad sewage treatment treated wastewater water scarcity 1 introduction as almost 70 of the world water is used in agriculture the reuse of treated wastewater tww for crop irrigation can substantially reduce the amount of water to be extracted from fresh water sources such as groundwaters and rivers apart from reducing ejection of wastewater to the environment gleick 2000 pedrero et al 2010 hence the limited availability of freshwater in many parts of the world is a serious constraint for agricultural production sheidaei et al 2016 the water scarcity around the globe leads to adoption and use of unconventional waters such as treated municipal wastewater and saline drainage water as well as other kind of wastewater in many large urban areas which were previously thought to have sufficient water resources okun 1996 dixon et al 1999 nolde 1999 weizhen and andrew 2003 junying et al 2004 two thirds of the area of iran is located in semi arid and arid regions of the world zarghani et al 2013 average annual precipitation of the country is 250 mm with erratic spatial and temporal distribution with almost 70 of precipitation falling in the northern and western regions of the country forouzani and karami 2010 under this condition the agricultural sector accounts for more than 93 of fresh water supplies consumption and 97 of net blue water abstraction ardakanian 2005 and thus iran is facing severe water shortage despite these problems there is little effort to treat and reuse wastewater and other kinds of recycled water in agriculture as a suitable option to cope with water shortage therefore it is necessary to find a way to overcome future possible crises by applying reasonable strategies ehsani and khaledi 2003 various strategies have been developed to meet the growing demands for water over current decades including interareas water transfer which requires a lot of time and cost sea or saline water desalinization and water conservation measures by using efficient water use technologies such as pressured irrigation systems wastewater treatment and recycling is now considered as a practical alternative for coping with water scarcity faruqui et al 2004 garcia and pargament 2015 this method is considered an alternative resource of water supply and it is one of the reliable water resources even under drought conditions nazari et al 2006 as menegaki et al 2007 quoted from tsagarakis 2005 any integration protection and sustainable management of water in today s societies will incorporate marginal waters that can be recycled therefore water rehabilitation recycling and reuse are now recognized as key components of water management po et al 2003 such practices help to protect environmental quality while at the same time alleviate the relentless pressure on limited freshwater sources adewumi et al 2010 to make projects of water reuse successful several key factors must be considered including public opinion risk analysis evaluation of monetary benefits and willingness to pay as well as the environmental impacts of recycled water lazarova et al 2001 acceptance and successful implementation of wastewater use projects in agriculture largely depends upon support of the farmers but no studies have addressed farmers willingness to use wtu and willingness to pay wtp for tww after testing tww quality for crop irrigation before studying wtu in a remote and arid area mainly with resource poor farmers indeed little information is known about farmers perceptions of tww use in iran sheidaei et al 2016 partially because assessing farmers willingness to accept wastewater use for crop irrigation represents a relatively recent question in the study area hence this aspect calls for a better understanding of decisive factors of acceptance among farmers in this context farmers acceptance of tww reuse for irrigated agriculture should be assessed so that greater acceptance of wastewater uses could be fostered farmers acceptance or rejection of reclaimed wastewater is influenced by specific local cultural religious and socio economic conditions while economic and technical factors such as water costs structure of irrigation networks and crop patterns should also be considered ganoulis 2012 however social factors have been recognized as the main challenges to more effective water management compared with technical factors ricart et al 2019 moreover non market benefits by the use of treated wastewater in agriculture justify its implementation as those benefits overcome the average treatment costs alcon et al 2010 2013 nevertheless only identifying potential users of tww is not enough for planning purposes but there must be some assurance before embarking on design and construction of reuse projects so that the intended users will be ready to use and pay for the reclaimed wastewater tanik et al 2010 therefore assessing the potential market for reclaimed wastewater is necessary but the limited information about potential users explains in part the existing gap between planned and practiced reuse abu madi et al 2003 based on the above the present study was conducted with three main objectives a to test the appropriateness of tww for irrigation based on its physico chemical properties b to estimate farmers wtu and wtp for tww using the contingent valuation method cvm and c to examine factors affecting farmers wtu and wtp for tww use for crop irrigation the contribution of this work is mainly empirical providing new evidence on the topic in the study area in this sense it could help in bridging the knowledge gap in what predicts acceptance behavior and thus allowing agricultural managers and water planners to overcome concerns often held by farmers on tww use 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and quality of treated wastewater tww this study was conducted in baba abbas region of lorestan province in september 2017 fig 1 baba abbas is the only region of the province where the sewage water is treated conveyed to flow of kashkan river and provided directly to farmers during the dry season of summer all farmers of the region have water right from the current water source kashkan river but the supply is not reliable in seasons with high water demand for crop irrigation i e from mid spring to mid fall especially in summer periods of severe water shortage often occur farmers pay for the use of river water the water price is determined by the water bureau authorities of the province based on crop product price e g up to 3 of the crop income tww is pumped to the river at regular times but it is not enough for all farmers of the county for the moment it is conveyed to the farms of the study area through a canal in water shortage periods three qualities of wastewater were introduced to farmers for the assessment of wtu q1 includes complete treatment of wastewater from the sewage entering to treatment system which passes three steps a physical treatment of sewage such as deposited waste and suspended materials in sewage b sewage aeration c sewage chemical treatment including chlorine q2 includes sewage that only passes through the first two phases of treatment i e physical treatment and aeration and q3 that includes raw sewage considered as the first stage of treatment moreover three prices for the outflow of refinery were introduced to farmers for the assessment of wtp the first price wtp1 is the base price of 1 500 000 rials ha i e the price of conventional water of the river the farmers pay for irrigation as defined by the water office of the area the second proposed price wtp2 is 20 higher than the base price wtp2 1 800 000 rials ha and the third proposed price wtp3 is 20 lower than the base price wtp3 1 200 000 rials ha 2 2 sample survey instrument and data collection the statistical population of this study consisted of farmers of baba abbas region who use the kashkan river for irrigation all farmers of baba abbas were 120 eleven of them were orchard farmers and because the study focused on crop farmers wheat and corn are dominant crops in the region orchard farmers were not considered in the survey a questionnaire was used as instrument for data collection the first part of the questionnaire included demographic characteristics of the respondents i e age living place education number of educated members of family and income the second part contained farmers farm characteristics crop yields and type of water used for crop irrigation the third part included information sources used by farmers for treatment of sewage water and use of this type of water treated water for crop irrigation farmers attitudes towards environmental issues and health risks related to the use of tww for crop irrigation water shortage attitudes and knowledge about the use of tww were examined in part four the variables of interest i e farmers wtu and wtp for tww for crop irrigation were examined in part five in this part farmers were asked whether they would be willing to use wtu each quality q1 q2 and q3 of this type of water on the basis of a simple dichotomous question no yes for each quality separately then farmers were asked whether they would be willing to pay wtp for the outflow of refinery on the basis of a simple dichotomous question no yes for each of three proposed prices compared with freshwater therefore we asked three wtp questions to each farmer with three price levels considering the outflow of refinery compared with freshwater in this manner each respondent produced a score for wtu each of three proposed qualities q1 q2 and q3 of tww and a score for wtp each of three proposed prices for the outflow of refinery for irrigating their crops the variables of the study and their description are illustrated in table 1 after listing farmers residential addresses a home to home and face to face contact procedure was followed for data collection some farmers were present at the first visit of the researchers to their living place and the questionnaires were filled out at that time in case of farmers absence several visits were required finally all farmers voluntarily participated in this study because they found the topic intriguing and all questionnaires were filled out the study examined factors affecting farmers wtu and wtp for reuse of tww as well as the levels of wtp for tww use by farmers wtu is a decision that occurs before that of wtp wtu firstly determines whether one is prepared to use a good regardless of one will use it or not then wtp determines how much one is prepared to pay for that good that is related to the attractiveness of the good and its price menegaki et al 2007 based on the literature our proposed prices were only for tww outflow of treatment for this reason wtu was assessed without taking prices into account after a literature review a number of factors affecting farmers wtu and wtp for tww were considered depending on the context of the research problem these are socio economic factors including age income wheat yield corn yield number of educated members in the family living place and use of recycled water as well as knowledge attitudinal variables including knowledge information perception of water shortage health risk education and environmental attitude the wtp and wtu models were set up in the form of a logit probit framework the research tool was validated by a panel of experts consisting of academic staff and field experts water engineers including three irrigation and drainage experts and two agricultural economics experts from the department of water engineering and agricultural management one environmental economist from the department of economics of the university of mohaghegh ardabili and two water field experts from lorestan province iran a pilot study was conducted with 30 farmers of the sample for determining the reliability of the research tool some questions were removed following feedback after one week we came back and began data collection with 79 farmers after data collection we applied kolmogorov smirnov test to compare the means of the pilot sample group and the full sample group of farmers because there were no significant differences between the two groups we assumed that the two groups showed similar responses during the two periods of data collection except for some questions that were not relevant and were deleted therefore the data of the first group 30 farmers were merged with data of the second group 79 farmers cronbach s alpha values showed high reliability for eight statements of environmental attitudes α 0 710 and for three statements of health risk α 0 785 2 3 binary probit model a binary probit model was used in this study according to the general formula p y 1 φ xi β the binary probit model was used because the dependent variable in this study was dichotomous 0 and 1 the purpose of this model is to estimate the probability that an observation with particular characteristics will fall into a specific one of the categories in the regression eq 1 β represents the marginal effects of explanatory variables on the dependent variable the dependent variable represents the utility that is invisible by estimating β the probability of y will be as follows 1 pi p yi 1 xi φ xi β φ β 1 β 2 x 2 i βkxki where yi and xi are the dependent and independent variables respectively pi is the probability of y i 1 n indexing number of farmers k number of explanatory variables in the first step to avoid collinearity problems among independent variables and increasing of freedom degree for estimation the variables affecting wtu and wtp were divided into two categories i socio economic and ii knowledge attitudinal variables and the impact of the variables of each group on wtu and wtp were examined separately the study examined the impact of each of these variables on the dependent variables i e wtu and wtp under the binary probit framework including wtu1 wtu for tww q1 wtu2 wtu for tww q2 and wtu3 wtu for tww q3 for the wtu variable as well as wtp1 wtp at first proposed price 1 500 000 rials ha for the outflow of refinery wtp2 wtp at second proposed price 1 800 000 rials ha for the outflow of refinery and wtp3 wtp at third proposed price 1 200 000 rials ha for the outflow of refinery for the wtp variable the rate of farmers wtp for tww use for irrigation was also estimated there are several techniques to design a core question to assess wtp open ended questions proposed price dichotomous choice referendum are among them akbari et al 2017 the type of data acquisition instrument can have a great impact on the accuracy of the collected data therefore it should commensurate with questions of the contingent valuation method cvm and public opinion surveys gayarti and barbier 2000 where people are asked about their preferences according to an assigned monetary value the proposed price and face to face interviewing were used for implementing the cvm while both cvm and choice modeling or control experiments ce are suitable for assessing the value of a rural good the ce approach is capable of measuring the marginal value of a change in the rural good characteristics specified by the researcher while the cvm is used to value the rural good and any associated features as a single whole package hynes et al 2011 the valuation is a function of characteristics of the respondents and random components that cause differences among respondents unless respondents have the same characteristics the capacity of the cvm to capture public preferences allows the analysis of the heterogeneity of demand for a rural good or measure by accounting for the effect of several characteristics of the respondents on their wtp alcon et al 2010 the cvm is highly flexible and can be used to assess the economic value of virtually any good and service especially goods and services that are easily understood by users and are consumed in discrete units venkatachalam 2004 moreover the nature of cv studies and the results of cv studies are easy to analyze and describe the maximum likelihood ml method was used to examine and estimate the related regression baghestani and zibaei 2010 then the parameters were estimated by the maximum interval method to maximize the likelihood of a real wtp of farmer being between the two upper and lower limits in fact in this method there are two dependent variables upper and lower limit to use the interval maximum likelihood technique in this study we used the recurrent bidding method auction method for data collection baghestani and zibaei 2010 it is assumed that the maximum wtp wtpm of respondents is at least equal to the number selected in the recurrent proposed bidding method by the respondents and the larger value afterwards is wtpl baghestani and zibaei 2010 the probability that the wtp i occurs between wtpm i and wtpl i is as below prob wtpm i wtp i wtpl i prob wtp i wtpl i prob wtp i wtpm i or else as in eq 2 2 φ wtp l i e wt p i σ i φ wtp m i e wt p i σ i where φ is the standardized cumulative density function and the expected value of wtp for each person i is the ith wtp for each case wtpm i is the maximum wtp wtpl i is the larger value afterwards while e wtp i in the case of socio economic variables is obtained from eq 3 3 wtp i e wtpi ξ i α β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β 4 x 4 β 5 x 5 β 6 x 6 β 7 x 7 ξi where α constant value x 1 income x 2 farmers age x 3 wheat yield x 4 corn yield x 5 number of

wtu and wtp for using tww the composition of tww was measured in the laboratory in a sample of tww from the outflow of refinery of khorramabad for evaluation using existing standards the acidity ph of the tww sample was 7 8 table 2 which is in the permissible range table 3 measured values of total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were 417 8 mg l and 0 71 ds m respectively table 2 the allowable limits of these variables were 2000 mg l for tds and 3 ds m for ec indicating no significant restriction of the tww for irrigation sodium na is a main parameter in the evaluation of irrigation water quality and can cause soil physical problems such as decreasing soil infiltration the permissible limit value of na in the tww for irrigation use is about 250 mg l shakir et al 2017 the concentration of na in the sample was 30 1 mg l table 2 indicating a slight restriction on the use of this kind of water for irrigation sodium hazard is usually stated by sar sodium adsorption ratio which is calculated from the ratio of sodium to calcium and magnesium sar is an important factor for determining the suitability of tww for crop irrigation in order to investigate the hazard of sodium on soil infiltration sar is considered with ec the sar and ec values of the sample were 5 9 and 0 71 ds m respectively table 2 according to the criteria presented in table 3 the tww quality is in the moderate range regarding the values of bod5 and caco3 the tww quality is not limited in terms of these two parameters overall it can be concluded that the tww of khorramabad does not have a significant degree of restriction for use in crop irrigation 3 2 farmers profile the average age of participants was 51 16 years with most farmers being in the age group of 43 60 years table 4 most farmers belonged to a family with up to 4 educated members whereas almost one third belonged to a family with 4 educated members most farmers were living in villages as normally expected but almost one fifth were living in urban areas the average income of participants was 360 24 million iranian rials irr with 1 usd being equal to 42 000 irr the average wheat yield was 4 74 tonnes per ha and the average corn yield was 42 75 tonnes per ha the majority of the farmers were using tww for crop irrigation whereas a considerable fraction was not using this type of water in their farms indeed almost 70 of the farmers of baba abbas were using tww for crop irrigation but almost 30 of them were persisting against tww use while it is important to know factors affecting farmers acceptance of tww by farmers of the region in this study we had in mind all users of kashkan river who are potential users of tww in the future so that the results can be useful for future development because there are huge amounts of sewage that are lost in the county while farmers suffer from water shortage on the other hand the development of refinery stations and treating water is very costly so that users should pay for using treated water for irrigation for this reason we proposed three quality of sewage water to investigate farmers response 3 3 environmental attitude and health risk perception towards tww more than half of the farmers 51 4 had relatively positive attitude towards the use of tww for crop irrigation ea1 but only one third of them 33 0 had this attitude for orchard irrigation ea2 and less than half stated that tww pollutes groundwater and the environment ea3 ea4 table 5 despite moderate attitudes towards use of tww compared with untreated wastewater farmers attitudes towards treating this water were highly positive ea5 ea8 with reference to health risk perception more than 60 of the farmers perceived high or very high health risk from tww use in crop production table 5 3 4 wtu and wtp for tww in crop production the vast majority of the participants 92 were willing to use the q1 tww whereas wtu q2 and wtu q3 tww were 33 and 14 respectively fig 2 a more than half 56 of the farmers were willing to pay for tww at the price of 1 500 000 irr per ha wtp1 which was equal to fresh water irrigation charge fig 2b less than one fifth 18 of farmers were willing to pay for tww at the higher price of 1 800 000 irr per ha wtp2 whereas the vast majority of the farmers 92 were willing to pay for tww at the lowest price of 1 200 000 irr per ha wtp3 it appears that the cost of tww is one of the main factors affecting farmers tendency towards the use of tww 3 5 information sources of farmers on tww farmers information on wastewater treatment and reuse was very limited with mean values 1 table 6 because of the novelty of the subject there were no specific sources of information available on this subject for farmers extension services were the most common source of information followed by neighbors and relatives who often had no more information than the respondents radio and television programs do not offer programs on wastewater treatment and because of the low level of education farmers had little access to scientific journals and the internet experts of the bureau of water and sewage who are responsible for wastewater treatment were not a popular source of information 3 6 factors affecting wtu and wtp in binary logistic regression mcfadden r 2 is used to determine the amount of variability in the dependent variable explained by the explanatory variables according to table 7 the lr ratio was not significant for wtp3 in both socio economic and knowledge attitudinal variables but in the rest the lr ratio confirmed significance of the whole model among socio economic factors age had a significantly negative impact on wtu1 and a significantly positive impact on wtp1 and wtp2 table 7 wheat yield had a significantly positive impact on wtu1 wtu2 and wtp1 the number of educated members in the family had a significantly negative effect on wtu1 while the living place had a significantly negative impact on wtu2 and a significantly positive impact on wtu1 and wtp1 farmers residing in the region were more willing to use and pay for treated water of q1 than q2 the use of tww showed a significantly negative impact on wtp2 farmers who were using tww in their farms were less willing to pay for q2 wtp2 i e tww had negative impact on wtp2 briefly the living place and the use of tww were the main factors in our estimation from knowledge attitudinal factors knowledge had a significantly positive impact on wtu3 and information had a significantly positive impact on wtp1 table 7 perceived health risk had a significantly negative impact on wtu1 wtu2 and wtu3 as well as on wtp1 finally education had a significantly negative impact on wtu2 and wtu3 as well as on wtp1 and wtp2 health risk perception and education had the greatest impact on wtu while education and information had the greatest impact on wtp averagely farmers willingness to pay at the price of 1 500 000 irr wtp1 was 245 542 for price of 1 800 000 irr wtp2 it was equal to 32 833 and at the price of 1 200 000 wtp3 it was 132 379 irr this result implies that farmers were not much willing to pay for tww 4 discussion the current study tested the appropriateness of tww for crop irrigation based on its physico chemical properties explored farmers wtu and wtp for applying tww in crop irrigation and examined factors affecting farmers wtu and wtp for tww application in lorestan province of western iran the vast majority of the participants 92 were willing to use q1 tww while more than half of the farmers 56 were willing to pay for tww in the price of 1 500 000 irr per ha q1 which was equal to fresh water irrigation charge it appears that the price of tww is one of the main factors affecting farmers tendency towards the use of tww but the results suggest a promising era for reclaimed wastewater use for crop irrigation in the study area when farmers prefer lower water price it implies that cost is an important variable affecting their decision to use of tww because they believe that this kind of water has lower quality and thus it must be cheaper than freshwater evidently more effort will be required to improve farmers acceptance levels of tww through addressing various factors that influence their perceptions and attitudes sheidaei et al 2016 to this end findings of this study can be useful to identify farmers attitudes towards tww and determine the level of wtu and wtp for this type of water for crop irrigation the need for recycling and reusing wastewater especially in the agricultural sector of lorestan province is mainly because the water level of rivers decreases sharply especially in summer so that water does not meet the needs of farmers for crop irrigation in some regions climate change is expected to deteriorate this situation in the future quite similar trends among farmers from different countries can be found in the literature thessaly farmers in greece were willing to pay for recycled water especially during drought spells in the region in an area characterized by increased agricultural activity with cotton plants as the main crop bakopoulou et al 2010 moreover previous research from greece showed that 77 4 of the respondents had a positive attitude for the use of reclaimed water for olive tree irrigation but a very low proportion had a positive attitude for other irrigation uses in crop production petousi et al 2015 in india farmers predicted a significant increase in agricultural benefits due to additional irrigation with improved water and they were willing to pay significantly higher than what they were currently paying to secure these benefits biswas and venkatachalam 2015 similarly water reuse was acceptable to farmers in the south africa with opportunities securing good quality of water and limited restrictions on practical issues saldías et al 2016 on the contrary in the west bank tunisia and qatar most stakeholders viewed wastewater as unsafe for reuse in agriculture while users felt that local monitoring and oversight are insufficient dare and mohtar 2018 moreover stakeholders in southeastern italy including farmers and citizens showed a high level of acceptance of wastewater reuse saliba et al 2018 similarly a recent study from italy found adequate willingness of farmers towards wastewater reuse for crop irrigation michetti et al 2019 age negatively influenced wtu among farmers namely wtu was less among elderly farmers this finding is in line with previous research where young farmers had more positive attitudes towards tww compared with elderly farmers al shenaifi et al 2015 wheat yield had a positive impact on both wtu and wtp the use of this kind of water has advantages for crop growth such as increased productivity due to the supply of nutrients for plant growth musazura et al 2019 and presumably these benefits may be a reason for this result the number of educated members in the family negatively affected wtu1 probably because high number of educated members reflected elevated awareness of the health impacts of tww as more than 60 of the farmers perceived high or very high health risk from tww use in crop production table 5 faruqui et al 2004 also found that the use of sewage water had negative health effect on farmers their families and the environment the living place positively influenced both wtu and wtp similarly alataway et al 2011 showed a difference in attitudes among residents of rural and urban communities in saudi arabia i e residents of al hassa area rural area where a large scale wastewater reuse for unrestricted irrigation occurs were more sensitive than residents of tabuk area urban area in which the reuse of wastewater was very limited in contrast to alataway et al 2011 in our study residents of baba abbas region where a sewage reuse project is implemented were less sensitive than other farmers tww use negatively affected wtp among farmers during the field interviews participants noted that because of the low quality of tww in relation to fresh water that they experienced they were unwilling to use it participants also noted that because of the low quality the price of recycled water should be much lower than that of fresh water knowledge about tww positively affected wtu among farmers this finding is in line with those reported by an najah 2005 who found that more informed farmers of the consequences of using tww had more positive attitude towards the use of this type of water a positive attitude towards tww therefore could be a reason for farmers to use it attitude is a key component of human behavior gorton et al 2008 and the behavior of a person is usually expected to be consistent with the attitudes that the individual holds information positively influenced wtp which is consistent with findings of abu shaban et al 2006 who showed the major influence of information on the acceptance of tww in irrigated agriculture perception of health risk by tww use for crop irrigation negatively influenced both wtu and wtp during the field interviews farmers stated that they suffered by dermal diseases due to direct exposure to this type of water during working in farms irrigated with tww similarly fear of disease and pollution through the use of wastewater was a major factor determining farmers negative attitude toward the use of this kind of water abu shaban et al 2006 respondents from palestine believed that the main factor affecting purchase and consumption of products irrigated with reclaimed wastewater is the concern from potential health risks so more than half of the respondents refused to pay for edible commodities irrigated with tww ghanem 2012 probably this negative attitude may be an important factor for non wtu and non wtp for application of tww in crop production the main reason for the negative environmental attitudes towards tww can be related to low knowledge and information as well as weak information sources the result of health risk perceptions also indicates that respondents perceived this water as hazardous for people this result is related also to their experience of working in their farms after irrigation with tww they reported symptoms of problems such as itching skin infections and blisters when they worked in the farms irrigated with this water education negatively influenced wtp among farmers despite the fact that more educated farmers were aware that tww is a by product of lower quality than fresh water angelakis and bontoux 2001 in our study education had no significant impact on wtu additionally because of severe drought and water shortage in current years small scale farmers environmental attitudes had no significant impact on wtu or wtp which is in contrast to previous studies angelakis and bontoux 2001 as already stated among socio economic variables the living place had the greatest impact on wtu while the use of tww and the living place had the greatest impact on wtp among the knowledge attitudinal variables the perceived health risk and education had the greatest impact on wtu while education and information had the greatest impact on wtp therefore because farmers knowledge and information was weak and information sources were inefficient to provide farmers with information on how to use the tww in order to increase wtu and wtp for applying tww in crop irrigation and change the negative attitudes towards the use of recycled water it is necessary to increase farmers information by the use of mass media pioneer farmers and religious leaders farmers are also required to be classified in terms of literacy and information and extension services should provide them with the necessary training courses according to their level of literacy the descriptive findings of this study showed that quality is one of the factors influencing farmers wtu as also reported by carr et al 2011 while the price of tww is one of the factors affecting farmers wtp the price seriously affected farming profitability and farmers wtp for reclaimed wastewater in jordan and tunisia abu madi et al 2003 the use of appropriate incentives such as reduction in prices of tww in relation to freshwater because of its lower quality testing its physico chemical quality and microbial contamination as well as determining its suitability for irrigation can be effective in promoting wtu testing the quality of tww and comparing its results with related standards in this study showed that this water is suitable for surface irrigation due to the fact that all the farmlands of the region are irrigated with surface irrigation farmers should be aware of this result and trust the quality of tww of the refinery of khorramabad findings of this study have implications for other regions especially large cities with huge amounts of sewage where recycle sewage water for irrigation is going to be implemented this study has some limitations that should be taken into account for better view of the main findings of this work first the size of the sample is representative of the farmers community of the study area but generalization of findings to other areas should be done with care comprehensive data collection from different areas should be conducted in future research with farmers from different areas with different cropping patterns e g fruits and vegetables and different agricultural practices second the number and type of variables may be considered limited so that more information has to be collected in future research to capture additional variables of interest future research works could also address the aspect of transaction costs by considering setting up obligations of treatment plants to deliver reclaimed wastewater services to farmers 5 conclusions the current study tested the appropriateness of tww for crop irrigation based on its physico chemical properties explored farmers wtu and wtp for applying tww in crop irrigation and examined factors affecting farmers wtu and wtp for tww application in lorestan province of western iran generally farmers showed a positive perception of tww reuse for crop irrigation probably because they are aware of the problem of water scarcity among socio economic variables the living place had the greatest impact on wtu while the use of tww and the living place had the greatest impact on wtp among the knowledge attitudinal variables the perceived health risk and education had the greatest impact on wtu while education and information had the greatest impact on wtp the work provides new evidence on the topic explaining in part the existing gap between planned and practiced reuse of tww thus bridging the knowledge gap in what can define and predict acceptance behavior allowing agricultural managers and water planners to address concerns often held by farmers on tww use moreover the importance of raising stakeholders awareness and encouraging their involvement to foster technology diffusion is essential in terms of policy implications for informing local actors a more careful look at local water needs by potential users is required along with building on personal experiences and addressing potential business specific water related concerns declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

pressure of 1 4 bar using combined screen sand filters for aquaculture drainage filtration while screen filter for groundwater filtration keywords aquaculture farms groundwater resource performance evaluation onion yield 1 introduction water for agriculture is crucial to the future of global food security because it uses more than 80 of total water resources however the continued increase in demand for water by nonagricultural uses as urban and industrial uses has put the irrigation water demand in a closer examination and threatened food security now with a global focus on sustainable development especially in the agricultural sector more efforts have been put into improving resource usage boyd et al 2008 in general the continuous reduction in water resources in the world egypt in particular has forced farmers to use other alternative resources aquaculture is an important source of non traditional water that can be exploited for irrigation because it contains nutrients useful for the plant it provides a unique way to participate towards socio economic development and food security during the multiple and sustainable use of water resources rana et al 2005 fish excrete waste nitrogen in the form of ammonia which converted to nitrite and then to nitrate by bacteria directly into the water through their gills nakada et al 2007 fish excreted nutrients directly by the microbial breakdown of organic wastes to be absorbed by crops fish feed supplies most of the nutrients required for crop growth abdelraouf and hoballah 2014 reuse of aquaculture water can be considered as a solution of new irrigation water resources this technology will enhance the efficiency and productivity of water use by plants in fish disposal without using fertilizers mustapha et al 2014 aquaculture effluents contain appropriate nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus that can be used by plants yildiz et al 2017 the use of drainage water of fish farms dwff for wheat irrigation were compared to canal freshwater iw the results showed that the wheat yield under dwff was higher than iw treatment by between 11 and 51 in 2014 and between 8 and 38 in 2015 this is due to the additional amount of dissolved organic nitrogen and other nutrients inherent in dwff abdelraouf and ragab 2017 development of water management mostly modern irrigation systems in the irrigated area have been one of the important targets of the policymakers and planners in the agriculture sector the efficiency of modern irrigation systems such as drip irrigation depends mainly on their design maintenance and operating conditions the appropriate design for drip irrigation system had to be managed for successful operation under different conditions efficiency through modern irrigation systems is an important performance criterion that must be taken into consideration through the design operation maintenance and management of irrigation sytem to increase agricultural productivity holzapfel et al 2009 drip irrigation is a method of applying the uniform amount of water directly to the root zone of the plants through emitters at frequent intervals over a long period via the pressure piping network suryawanshi 2018 the effect of using surface drip irrigation system compared to subsurface drip irrigation system with drip lateral depths of 0 05 and 0 1 m on the onion yield and water productivity was studied variations in the obtained onion yield using surface and subsurface irrigation systems were non significant the values of the irrigation water use efficiency iwue were ranged from 3 55 to 4 97 kg m3 while the evapotranspiration water use efficiency etwue were ranged from 3 72 to 5 22 kg m3 the highest onion yield was obtained under drip lateral depth of 0 1 m pejić et al 2018 the influence of three irrigation methods rainfed rf surface drip irrigation sdi and subsurface drip irrigation ssdi and nitrogen fertilization rates on water use efficiency wue yield and yield components of onion grown was studied results found that sdi with nitrogen fertilization rate of 90 kg ha were the most effective irrigation method and nitrogen application rate for improving wue yield and yield components of onion crop elnamas 2019 filtration is an important element in the application of modern irrigation systems the role of filtration is removing any organic sediments particles that may be present in the irrigation water types of filters play an important purpose in the filtration screen filters are effective at sand removal screen filters can be used as fundament filtration under conditions where inorganic particles were big screen filters should not be used when organic contaminants were found robert 2002 drip irrigation with using wastewater is confined by emitter clogging because the organic material sedimentation bacterial growth and high ph values of the wastewater effluent accelerate the growth of biofilm pitts et al 2003 emitter clogging is affected the performance of drip irrigation system especially when using wastewater that discourages farmers from introducing it screen filters were found to be inappropriate for using with wastewater except for diluted and settled wastewater capra and scicolone 2004 irrigation water quality can affect soil fertility and irrigation systems performance added to crop yields and soil physical condition so knowing the quality of irrigation water is critical for realizing the necessary management changes in long term productivity bauder et al 2004 the clogging of drip emitters changes the operating pressure flow rate and application uniformity of the drip irrigation system souza et al 2006 removal efficiency of sand filters was ranged from 11 4 48 but it ranged from 37 to 80 3 using a combined sand disc filter wen yong et al 2015 clogging is one of the most important problems encountered in drip irrigation system that significantly reduce its efficiency clogging of emitters has been a major problem in the drip line because of the high levels of suspended solids and nutrients related to water shaw et al 2018 it is clear from the above literature that numerous studies were published dealing with the use of a drip irrigation system and the most important problems arising during filtration but such studies have to be carried out to identify the effect of using aquaculture drainage on a drip irrigation system and their effects on clogging percentage and crop yield from this point of view the main objective of the study is to improve onion crop yield using aquaculture drainage under surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems additionally the objective is to evaluate the hydraulic performance of drip irrigation system under different operating pressures in order to select the suitable filter for reducing emitters clogging 2 materials and methods the present work was carried out at wadi el natroun station 30 13 e longitude and 30 25 n latitude water management research institute el behera governorate egypt 2 1 experimental setup 2 1 1 onion crop onion crop giza 20 variety was transplanted on 15th november 2018 all agronomic techniques agricultural practices and fertilizer rates were applied as recommended by agriculture research center ministry of agriculture egypt it was harvested on 1st april 2019 fertilizers needs for onion crop were added as follow organic manure 10 ton fed and superphosphate at rate of 150 kg fed 15 5 p2o5 were added through soil preparation potassium sulfate at the rate of 50 kg fed 48 k2o was added twice while nitrate and ammonium sulfate were added at the rate of 200 kg fed 20 5 n divided by five times the first after 25 days and the other four times were applied every 20 days 2 1 2 the used irrigation water the groundwater and aquaculture drainage was used for irrigating onion crop under the present study with using groundwater the nitrate fertilizer was added by fertigation according to recommended doses while for aquaculture drainage minimum doses from minerals fertilizers was added based on the dissolved percentage of nitrate in aquaculture so aquaculture drainage saved the fertilizer use fish farm is the principal form of aquaculture the dimension of the used fish farms was 26 30 2 5 m tilapia fish type is raised on fish farms the quantity of fish was about 10 000 fish the amount of water changed every day was about 25 of the total amount of water in the fish farm the fish put in the reservoir in may and harvested in december the specifications of the two used waters were presented in table 1 2 1 3 drip irrigation systems two different types of drip irrigation systems were used surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems the subsurface lines were put at 15 cm depth from the surface the soil is wet by operating the irrigation system before transplanting the onion crop the water was collected for surface irrigation by cans method while by putting the plastic sheet under the points subsurface drip lines both irrigation systems consisted of a control head centrifugal pump pressure regulator pressure gauges flow meter and filtration unit pvc main sub main and manifold lines as shown in fig 1 pvc pipes diameters of 110 75 and 50 mm were used for main sub main and manifold lines respectively emitters gr that used under the present study were installed in lateral lines of polyethene pe with diameter of 16 mm emitter s distance of 30 cm and emitter s discharge of 4 l h the manifold line has equipped with a valve a water meter and a pressure gauge which located at the beginning of laterals as shown in fig 1 the lengths of laterals were 25 m while the spacing between them was 60 cm respectively before selecting the previous dimensions of the irrigation system several measurements were taken the maximum irrigation water requirements emitter discharge and the needed time to operate were determined additionally the overall losses through the system were determined by hazen and williams 1920 and then the required power was calculated an electrical centrifugal pump was used with 36 5 kw 50 hp engine power and a discharge rate of 80 m3 h at 4 bar operating pressure head with 5 5 inch inlet outlet diameter the pump was operated to lift the water from the well to the pipe network and the reservoir another electrical centrifugal pump is used to lift the water from fish farm reservoir to the pipe network with 25 kw engine power and a discharge rate of 70 m3 h at 4 bar operating pressure with 4 3 in inch inlet outlet diameters the chemical fertilizers were dissolved in separate tank and then withdrawn from the tank by the pump and mix with water into the irrigation network 2 1 4 filtration unit the filtration unit was consisted of small pump 0 74 kw 1 hp and tank 200 l two different types of filters were used in the experiment screen and sand as follows 2 1 4 1 screen filter the specifications of the used screen filter under study

maximum pressure 1 1 m2 filter area 7 62 cm inlet diameter and 7 62 cm outlet diameter as shown in fig 3 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 experimental conditions the performance evaluation of drip irrigation system was experimentally done under the following conditions as illustrated in fig 4 two drip irrigation systems surface and subsurface two different water resources groundwater and aquaculture drainage four different operating pressures 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 bar two types of filters screen and sand filters and combination of them the performance evaluation was done at the beginning of the experiment and after 1 5 months of an experiment in order to select the best filter and the optimum operating pressure to avoid the problems caused by clogging for groundwater experiments were carried out using screen filter while for aquaculture drainage screen filter only sand filter only and combined filters screen filter sand filter were used based on the hydraulic preliminary experiments the obtained recommended conditions were applied to study the effect of using groundwater and aquaculture drainage on onion yield and water use efficiency under surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems all readings were taken three times as replicates to calculate average values 2 2 2 measurements and determinations different emitters from each lateral three emitters at the beginning three at the middle and three at the end had been chosen to be evaluated for flow rate the following measurements were carried out to evaluate the performance of drip irrigation system as

standards 1996 emission uniformity values were 90 greater or greater excellent 80 90 good 70 80 fair and less than 70 poor amount of water applied the amount of irrigation water was determined according to israelsen and hansen 1962 as follow 7 d a i w f c θ 1 100 b d d where daiw the depth of irrigation water applied mm fc soil moisture content at field capacity ө1 soil moisture content

onion crop with 3 m length under each treatment were harvested manually the onion was weighed by analogue balance and the onion yield was calculated under all experimental conditions water use efficiency water use efficiency wue was used to evaluate various treatments as it can be expressed as the weight of crop yield per unit of consumed water according to pene and edi 1996 8 w u e o n i o n y i e l d a m o u n t o f w a t e r a p p l i e d 3 results and discussion the results obtained will be discussed under the following heads 3 1 filtration efficiency and discharge reduction the performance of the used filters for groundwater and aquaculture drainage was evaluated as a function of the filtration efficiency and discharge reduction as illustrated in table 2 for groundwater with screen filter the filtration efficiency was noticed to be 45 4 and discharge reduction was 33 1 using aquaculture drainage the filtration efficiency was 25 1 28 6 and 37 3 under the screen sand and combined filters respectively while the discharge reduction percentages were 45 5 42 1 and 37 5 under the previous conditions the filtration efficiency of using the combined filters unit was greater than those achieved for these filters working alone this result is compatible with tripathi et al 2014 it was obvious that flow rate reduction using aquaculture drainage was greater than groundwater because of increasing the organic matters and chemical contents according to el tantawy et al 2009 decreasing the reduction of flow rate increases the filtration efficiency 3 2 emitters discharge the emitter discharge for surface and subsurface irrigation systems using groundwater and aquaculture drainage water under different operating pressures was indicated in fig 5 results clarified that increasing operating pressure the discharge rate was increased by the use of groundwater the discharge rate at the beginning of the experiment was 3 32 3 54 3 61 and 3 67 l h for the surface irrigation system and 3 40 3 70 3 75 and 3 80 l h for subsurface irrigation system under operating pressures of 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 bar while after a period of 1 5 months the rates were 3 12 3 32 3 40 and 3 43 l h for the surface irrigation system and 3 21 3 48 3 53 and 3 57 l h for subsurface irrigation system under the previously mentioned conditions respectively it was obvious that the emitter discharge was decreased after operating period compared to the beginning state of the experiment this is due to the sort of filter and the emitters clogging this is agreed with el berry et al 2006 regarding the use of aquaculture drainage as an alternative water resource results showed that the highest discharge values were 3 8 and 3 88 l h at the beginning of operating while 3 70 and 3 75 l h after 1 5 months of operating for surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems respectively using combined screen sand filters under operating pressure of 1 6 bar the screen filter gave the minimum discharge rates in comparison with either sand or combined filters due to the properties of aquaculture drainage the use of this alternative resource gave the minimum discharge rate compared to groundwater but using the combined filters compensated the different rates and enhanced the performance of emitters obtained data indicated that using subsurface drip irrigation system gave the highest rates of emitters discharge compared to surface drip irrigation 3 3 application efficiency fig 6 presented the effect of different operating pressures on application efficiency for groundwater and aquaculture drainage under surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems results showed that with increasing operating pressure the application efficiency was increased this may be due to the fact that by increasing the pressure the emitter clogging was reduced which affected the application uniformity these results are compatible with nassar et al 2016 at the beginning of operating the application efficiency values of groundwater were 86 12 88 90 89 70 and 90 10 for surface irrigation while 84 06 86 00 88 15 and 88 72 for subsurface irrigation under operating pressures of 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 bar respectively after 1 5 months of operating the application uniformity was decreased compared to the first stages of operating due to emitter clogging which affected the water flow rate when aquaculture was used the emitter clogging problems are increased because of the suspended solids and organic matter content el tantawy et al 2009 and goyal 2016 this blocking of emitters reduced the application uniformity therefore it was noticed that the application efficiency for aquaculture drainage was less than groundwater at the beginning of the experimental period the efficiency values of using aquaculture drainage were 77 20 81 21 82 90 and 83 40 for screen filter 81 40 84 27 86 20 and 87 32 for the sand filter under 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 bar operating pressures but using combined screen and sand filters the application efficiency was greater than the other two filters individually the values were 86 30 88 91 89 78 and 90 22 under the previous conditions respectively it was observed that the surface irrigation gave minimum clogging ratio compared to subsurface which reflected on increasing application efficiency 3 4 emitters clogging as shown in fig 7 the obtained results illustrated that increasing the operating pressure gave high discharge rate thus the emitters clogging was decreased this gave a strong agreement with el gindy et al 2009 and liu and huang 2009 at low operating pressure fine sediment in the water was more likely to be deposited in the emitter and cause emitter clogging as reported by zhou et al 2017 by the use of groundwater with screen filter the emitters clogging values for surface irrigation at the beginning period of operating were 6 98 6 61 6 34 and 5 98 under 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 bar operating pressures respectively while the values were 8 70 8 46 8 13 and 7 98 for subsurface irrigation under the same previous mentioned conditions in that order the obtained data showed that using aquaculture drainage affected the emitters clogging under all irrigation treatments comparing with ground water because the use of aquaculture drainage caused some system problems as emitters clogging by solids this result is in agreement with zamaniyan et al 2014 respecting the effect of filter type on the performance of the tested emitters under different operating conditions results clarified that the lowest clogging rates were found by using the combined of screen and sand filters for aquaculture drainage compared to other filters the emitter clogging ratio is varied according to the filter type the best filter type is the one that gives the highest filtration efficiency with reducing the problems of the emitter clogging according to duran ros et al 2010 at the beginning of experiment under 1 6 bar operating pressure the minimum clogging using aquaculture drainage was 6 89 and 8 30 for screen filter 6 33 and 8 06 for sand filter while 5 86 and 7 55 for combined screen sand filters under surface and subsurface drip irrigation in that order after 1 5 months of operating the emitter hydraulic characteristic was changed and the clogging was increased the highest clogging ratio was observed at 1 0 bar operating pressure the values were 32 10 17 72 and 14 50 for surface irrigation while 34 74 19 05 and 16 30 for subsurface irrigation using screen sand and combined filters respectively data indicated that the emitters clogging of using subsurface was higher than surface drip irrigation 3 5 emission uniformity field emission uniformity was measured at the beginning and after 1 5 months of operating under two types of drip irrigation systems using groundwater and aquaculture drainage as illustrated in fig 8 results clarified that generally emission uniformity is increased by increasing the operating pressure this may be due to the decrease of the emitter clogging which affect the water distribution uniformity and thereby negatively influenced the crop growth and yield this is identical with liu and huang 2009 the results showed that there was a great influence of aquaculture drainage on the performance of drip irrigation system compared to groundwater the total suspended solids and organic matter content was higher in aquaculture so the percentage of total clogged emitters also was increased so the emission uniformity decreased under operating conditions obtained results agreed with el tantawy et al 2009 it is clear that using combination of screen sand filter was more efficient than the use of screen or sand filter individually for aquaculture drainage emission uniformity of surface irrigation system at the beginning of experimental period were 79 26 82 54 82 95 and 83 45 for screen filter 83 24 86 14 86 42 and 87 54 for sand filter while 84 15 86 24 88 70 and 89 91 for combined screen sand filters under pressures of 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 bar respectively under subsurface drip irrigation emission uniformity percentages were 80 03 82 78 83 81 and 84 51 for screen filter 84 41 86 78 86 81 and 87 94 for sand filter while 84 97 87 04 89 44 and 90 54 for screen sand combination filters under the same previously mentioned conditions in that arrangement the emission uniformity was decreased after 1 5 months compared to the state at the beginning the use of combined filters for aquaculture drainage decreased the difference of emission uniformity by about 0 61 and 1 26 after 1 5 months under operating pressure of 1 6 bar in comparison with groundwater for surface and subsurface irrigation systems respectively surface drip irrigation system gave minimum emitters clogging and therefore produced very satisfactory emission uniformity values compared to subsurface irrigation 3 6 onion yield and water use efficiency based on the previous mentioned hydraulic preliminary experiments the recommended conditions of using screen sand combined filters for aquaculture drainage and screen filter for groundwater under pressure of 1 4 bar were applied fig 9 showed the effect of using groundwater and aquaculture drainage on onion yield and water use efficiency under surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems results clarified that the use of aquaculture drainage with screen sand combined filters for onion crop gave the highest onion yield in comparison with groundwater these results are in accordance with abdelraouf and ragab 2017 moursy 2018 the improve in onion crop yield with the use of aquaculture was attributed to the dissolved nutrients that are excreted directly by ﬁsh or generated from the microbial breakdown of ﬁsh wastes according to elnwishy et al 2006 regarding to drip irrigation systems the emitter clogging was decreased resulting in increase in emission uniformity so surface irrigation gave superiority in onion yield compared to subsurface irrigation system the onion yield values were 17 55 and 19 17 mg fed for surface irrigation while 14 2 and 17 03 mg fed for subsurface irrigation under groundwater and aquaculture respectively these results are in agreement with those obtained by elnamas 2019 results also showed that water use efficiency were 6 6 and 5 7 kg m3 for groundwater while 6 9 and 6 5 kg m3 for aquaculture drainage under surface and subsurface irrigation systems respectively it was clear that the use of aquaculture for onion irrigation improved the water use efficiency in comparison with groundwater in addition water use efficiency values for surface drip irrigation system were higher than for subsurface irrigation system these results are in line with abdelraouf and ragab 2017 moursy 2018 based on the above it is important to use aquaculture drainage as alternative irrigation resource for saving the required water and fertilizer on the other hand it can be used as a source of protein and therefore it will be more benefitcial to farmers 4 conclusions aquaculture drainage was utilized for irrigating onion crop under drip irrigation system compared to groundwater in order to provide well performed drip

application efficiency emitters clogging emission uniformity onion yield and water use efficiency the obtained experimental results show that irrigation with aquaculture drainage gives the highest onion yield of 19 17 mg fed for surface drip irrigation and 17 03 mg fed for subsurface drip irrigation compared to groundwater which gives 17 55 mg fed for surface irrigation and 14 20 mg fed for subsurface irrigation surface drip irrigation achieves the lowest emitter clogging 5 98 for groundwater and 5 86 for aquaculture drainage and the highest emission uniformity 90 22 for groundwater and

evaluation onion yield 1 introduction water for agriculture is crucial to the future of global food security because it uses more than 80 of total water resources however the continued increase in demand for water by nonagricultural uses as urban and industrial uses has put the irrigation water demand in a closer examination and threatened food security now with a global focus on sustainable development especially in the agricultural sector more efforts have been put into improving resource usage boyd et al 2008 in general the continuous reduction in water resources in the world egypt in particular has forced farmers to use other alternative resources aquaculture is an important source of non traditional water that can be exploited for irrigation because it contains nutrients useful for the plant it provides a unique way to participate towards socio economic development and food security during the multiple and sustainable use of water resources rana et al 2005 fish excrete waste nitrogen in the form of ammonia which converted to nitrite and then to nitrate by bacteria directly into the water through their gills nakada et al 2007 fish excreted nutrients directly by the microbial breakdown of organic wastes to be absorbed by crops fish feed supplies most of the nutrients required for crop growth abdelraouf and hoballah 2014 reuse of aquaculture water can be considered as a solution of new irrigation water resources this technology will enhance the efficiency and productivity of water use by plants in fish disposal without using fertilizers mustapha et al 2014 aquaculture effluents contain appropriate nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus that can be used by plants yildiz et al 2017 the use of drainage water of fish farms dwff for wheat irrigation were compared to canal freshwater iw the results showed that the wheat yield under dwff was higher than iw treatment by between 11 and 51 in 2014 and between 8 and 38 in 2015 this is due to the additional amount of dissolved organic nitrogen and other nutrients inherent in dwff abdelraouf and ragab 2017 development of water management mostly modern irrigation systems in the irrigated area have been one of the important targets of the policymakers and planners in the agriculture sector the efficiency of modern irrigation systems such as drip irrigation depends mainly on their design maintenance and operating conditions the appropriate design for drip irrigation system had to be managed for successful operation under different conditions efficiency through modern irrigation systems is an important performance criterion that must be taken into consideration through the design operation maintenance and management of irrigation sytem to increase agricultural productivity holzapfel et al 2009 drip irrigation is a method of applying the uniform amount of water directly to the root zone of the plants through emitters at frequent intervals over a long period via the pressure piping network suryawanshi 2018 the effect of using surface drip irrigation system compared to subsurface drip irrigation system with drip lateral depths of 0 05 and 0 1 m on the onion yield and water productivity was studied variations in the obtained onion yield using surface and subsurface irrigation systems were non significant the values of the irrigation water use efficiency iwue were ranged from 3 55 to 4 97 kg m3 while the evapotranspiration water use efficiency etwue were ranged from 3 72 to 5 22 kg m3 the highest onion yield was obtained under drip lateral depth of 0 1 m pejić et al 2018 the influence of three irrigation methods rainfed rf surface drip irrigation sdi and subsurface drip irrigation ssdi and nitrogen fertilization rates on water use efficiency wue yield and yield components of onion grown was studied results found that sdi with nitrogen fertilization rate of 90 kg ha were the most effective irrigation method and nitrogen application rate for improving wue yield and yield components of onion crop elnamas 2019 filtration is an important element in the application of modern irrigation systems the role of filtration is removing any organic sediments particles that may be present in the irrigation water types of filters play an important purpose in the filtration screen filters are effective at sand removal screen filters can be used as fundament filtration under conditions where inorganic particles were big screen filters should not be used when organic contaminants were found robert 2002 drip irrigation with using wastewater is confined by emitter clogging because the organic material sedimentation bacterial growth and high ph values of the wastewater effluent accelerate the growth of biofilm pitts et al 2003 emitter clogging is affected the performance of drip irrigation system especially when using wastewater that discourages farmers from introducing it screen filters were found to be inappropriate for using with wastewater except for diluted and settled wastewater capra and scicolone 2004 irrigation water quality can affect soil fertility and irrigation systems performance added to crop yields and soil physical condition so knowing the quality of irrigation water is critical for realizing the necessary management changes in long term productivity bauder et al 2004 the clogging of drip emitters changes the operating pressure flow rate and application uniformity of the drip irrigation system souza et al 2006 removal efficiency of sand filters was ranged from 11 4 48 but it ranged from 37 to 80 3 using a combined sand disc filter wen yong et al 2015 clogging is one of the most important problems encountered in drip irrigation system that significantly reduce its efficiency clogging of emitters has been a major problem in the drip line because of the high levels of suspended solids and nutrients related to water shaw et al 2018 it is clear from the above literature that numerous studies were published dealing with the use of a drip irrigation system and the most important problems arising during filtration but such studies have to be carried out to identify the effect of using aquaculture drainage on a drip irrigation system and their effects on clogging percentage and crop yield from this point of view the main objective of the study is to improve onion crop yield using aquaculture drainage under surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems additionally the objective is to evaluate the hydraulic performance of drip irrigation system under different operating pressures in order to select the suitable filter for reducing emitters clogging 2 materials and methods the present work was carried out at wadi el natroun station 30 13 e longitude and 30 25 n latitude water management

groundwater and aquaculture drainage was used for irrigating onion crop under the present study with using groundwater the nitrate fertilizer was added by fertigation according to recommended doses while for aquaculture drainage minimum doses from minerals fertilizers was added based on the dissolved percentage of nitrate in aquaculture so aquaculture drainage saved the fertilizer use fish farm

at the beginning of laterals as shown in fig 1 the lengths of laterals were 25 m while the spacing between them was 60 cm respectively before selecting the previous dimensions of the irrigation system several measurements were taken the maximum irrigation water requirements emitter discharge and the needed time to operate were determined additionally the overall losses through the system were determined by hazen and williams 1920 and then the required power was calculated an electrical centrifugal pump was used with 36 5 kw 50 hp engine power and a discharge rate of 80 m3 h at 4 bar

fertilizers were dissolved in separate tank and then withdrawn from the tank by the pump and mix with water into the irrigation network 2 1 4 filtration unit the filtration unit was consisted of small pump 0 74 kw 1 hp and tank 200 l two different types of filters were used in the experiment screen and sand as follows 2 1 4 1 screen filter the specifications of the used screen filter under study

irrigation system was experimentally done under the following conditions as illustrated in fig 4 two drip irrigation systems surface and subsurface two different water resources groundwater and aquaculture drainage four different operating pressures 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 bar two types of filters screen and sand filters and combination of them the performance evaluation was done at the beginning of the experiment and after 1 5 months of an experiment in order to select the best filter and the optimum operating pressure to avoid the problems caused by clogging for groundwater experiments were carried out using screen filter while for aquaculture drainage screen filter only sand filter only and combined filters screen filter sand filter were used based on the hydraulic preliminary experiments the obtained recommended conditions were applied to study the effect of using groundwater and aquaculture drainage on onion yield and water use efficiency under surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems all readings were taken three times as replicates to calculate average values 2 2 2 measurements and determinations different emitters from each lateral three emitters at the beginning three at the middle and three at the end had been chosen to be evaluated for flow rate the following measurements were carried out to evaluate the performance of drip irrigation system as

standards 1996 emission uniformity values were 90 greater or greater excellent 80 90 good 70 80 fair and less than 70 poor amount of water applied the amount of irrigation water was determined according to israelsen and hansen 1962 as follow 7 d a i w f c θ 1 100 b d d where daiw the depth of irrigation water applied mm fc soil moisture content at field capacity ө1 soil moisture content

n y i e l d a m o u n t o f w a t e r a p p l i e d 3 results and discussion the results obtained will be discussed under the following heads 3 1 filtration efficiency and discharge reduction the performance of the used filters for groundwater and aquaculture drainage was evaluated as a function of the filtration efficiency and discharge reduction as illustrated in table 2 for groundwater with screen filter the filtration efficiency was noticed to be 45 4 and discharge reduction was 33 1 using aquaculture drainage the filtration efficiency was 25 1 28 6 and 37 3 under the screen sand and combined filters respectively while the discharge reduction percentages were 45 5 42 1 and 37 5 under the previous conditions the filtration efficiency of using the combined filters unit was greater than those achieved for these filters working alone this result is compatible with tripathi et al 2014 it was obvious that flow rate reduction using aquaculture drainage was greater than groundwater because of increasing the organic matters and chemical contents according to el tantawy et al 2009 decreasing the reduction of flow rate increases the filtration efficiency 3 2 emitters discharge the emitter discharge for surface and subsurface irrigation systems using groundwater and aquaculture drainage water under different operating pressures was indicated in fig 5 results clarified that increasing operating pressure the discharge rate was increased by the use of groundwater the discharge rate at the beginning of the experiment was 3 32 3 54 3 61 and 3 67 l h for the surface irrigation system and 3 40 3 70 3 75 and 3 80 l h for subsurface irrigation system under operating pressures of 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 bar while after a period of 1 5 months the rates were 3 12 3 32 3 40 and 3 43 l h for the surface irrigation system and 3 21 3 48 3 53 and 3 57 l h for subsurface irrigation system under the previously mentioned conditions respectively it was obvious that the emitter discharge was decreased after operating period compared to the beginning state of the experiment this is due to the sort of filter and the emitters clogging this is agreed with el berry et al 2006 regarding the use of aquaculture drainage as an alternative water resource results showed that the highest discharge values were 3 8 and 3 88 l h at the beginning of operating while 3 70 and 3 75 l h after 1 5 months of operating for surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems respectively using combined screen sand filters under operating pressure of 1 6 bar the screen filter gave the minimum discharge rates in comparison with either sand or combined filters due to the properties of aquaculture drainage the use of this alternative resource gave the minimum discharge rate compared to groundwater but using the combined filters compensated the different rates and enhanced the performance of emitters obtained data indicated that using subsurface drip irrigation system gave the highest rates of emitters discharge compared to surface drip irrigation 3 3 application efficiency fig 6 presented the effect of different operating pressures on application efficiency for groundwater and aquaculture drainage under surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems results showed that with increasing operating pressure the application efficiency was increased this may be due to the fact that by increasing the pressure the emitter clogging was reduced which affected the application uniformity these results are compatible with nassar et al 2016 at the beginning of operating the application efficiency values of groundwater were 86 12 88 90 89 70 and 90 10 for surface irrigation while 84 06 86 00 88 15 and 88 72 for subsurface irrigation under operating pressures of 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 bar respectively after 1 5 months of operating the application uniformity was decreased compared to the first stages of operating due to emitter clogging which affected the water flow rate when aquaculture was used the emitter clogging problems are increased because of the suspended solids and organic matter content el tantawy et al 2009 and goyal 2016 this blocking of emitters reduced the application uniformity therefore it was noticed that the application efficiency for aquaculture drainage was less than groundwater at the beginning of the experimental period the efficiency values of using aquaculture drainage were 77 20 81 21 82 90 and 83 40 for screen filter 81 40 84 27 86 20 and 87 32 for the sand filter under 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 bar operating pressures but using combined screen and sand filters the application efficiency was greater than the other two filters individually the values were 86 30 88 91 89 78 and 90 22 under the previous conditions respectively it was observed that the surface irrigation gave minimum clogging ratio compared to subsurface which reflected on increasing application efficiency 3 4 emitters clogging as shown in fig 7 the obtained results illustrated that increasing the operating pressure gave high discharge rate thus the emitters clogging was decreased this gave a strong agreement with el gindy et al 2009 and liu and huang 2009 at low operating pressure fine sediment in the water was more likely to be deposited in the emitter and cause emitter clogging as reported by zhou et al 2017 by the use of groundwater with screen filter the emitters clogging values for surface irrigation at the beginning period of operating were 6 98 6 61 6 34 and 5 98 under 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 bar operating pressures respectively while the values were 8 70 8 46 8 13 and 7 98 for subsurface irrigation under the same previous mentioned conditions in that order the obtained data showed that using aquaculture drainage affected the emitters clogging under all irrigation treatments comparing with ground water because the use of aquaculture drainage caused some system problems as emitters clogging by solids this result is in agreement with zamaniyan et al 2014 respecting the effect of filter type on the performance of the tested emitters under different operating conditions results clarified that the lowest clogging rates were found by using the combined of screen and sand filters for aquaculture drainage compared to other filters the emitter clogging ratio is varied according to the filter type the best filter type is the one that gives the highest filtration efficiency with reducing the problems of the emitter clogging according to duran ros et al 2010 at the beginning of experiment under 1 6 bar operating pressure the minimum clogging using aquaculture drainage was 6 89 and 8 30 for screen filter 6 33 and 8 06 for sand filter while 5 86 and 7 55 for combined screen sand filters under surface and subsurface drip irrigation in that order after 1 5 months of operating the emitter hydraulic characteristic was changed and the clogging was increased the highest clogging ratio was observed at 1 0 bar operating pressure the values were 32 10 17 72 and 14 50 for surface irrigation while 34 74 19 05 and 16 30 for subsurface irrigation using screen sand and combined filters respectively data indicated that the emitters clogging of using subsurface was higher than surface drip irrigation 3 5 emission uniformity field emission uniformity was measured at the beginning and after 1 5 months of operating under two types of drip irrigation systems using groundwater and aquaculture drainage as illustrated in fig 8 results clarified that generally emission uniformity is increased by increasing the operating pressure this may be due to the decrease of the emitter clogging which affect the water distribution uniformity and thereby negatively influenced the crop growth and yield this is identical with liu and huang 2009 the results showed that there was a great influence of aquaculture drainage on the performance of drip irrigation system compared to groundwater the total suspended solids and organic matter content was higher in aquaculture so the percentage of total clogged emitters also was increased so the emission uniformity decreased under operating conditions obtained results agreed with el tantawy et al 2009 it is clear that using combination of screen sand filter was more efficient than the use of screen or sand filter individually for aquaculture drainage emission uniformity of surface irrigation system at the beginning of experimental period were 79 26 82 54 82 95 and 83 45 for screen filter 83 24 86 14 86 42 and 87 54 for sand filter while 84 15 86 24 88 70 and 89 91 for combined screen sand filters under pressures of 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 bar respectively under subsurface drip irrigation emission uniformity percentages were 80 03 82 78 83 81 and 84 51 for screen filter 84 41 86 78 86 81 and 87 94 for sand filter while 84 97 87 04 89 44 and 90 54 for screen sand combination filters under the same previously mentioned conditions in that arrangement the emission uniformity was decreased after 1 5 months compared to the state at the beginning the use of combined filters for aquaculture drainage decreased the difference of emission uniformity by about 0 61 and 1 26 after 1 5 months under operating pressure of 1 6 bar in comparison with groundwater for surface and subsurface irrigation systems respectively surface drip irrigation system gave minimum emitters clogging and therefore produced very satisfactory emission uniformity values compared to subsurface irrigation 3 6 onion yield and water use efficiency based on the previous mentioned hydraulic preliminary experiments the recommended conditions of using screen sand combined filters for aquaculture drainage and screen filter for groundwater under pressure of 1 4 bar were applied fig 9 showed the effect of using groundwater and aquaculture drainage on onion yield and water use efficiency under surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems results clarified that the use of aquaculture drainage with screen sand combined filters for onion crop gave the highest onion yield in comparison with groundwater these results are in accordance with abdelraouf and ragab 2017 moursy 2018 the improve in onion crop yield with the use of aquaculture was attributed to the dissolved nutrients that are excreted directly by ﬁsh or generated from the microbial breakdown of ﬁsh wastes according to elnwishy et al 2006 regarding to drip irrigation systems the emitter clogging was decreased resulting in increase in emission uniformity so surface irrigation gave superiority in onion yield compared to subsurface irrigation system the onion yield values were 17 55 and 19 17 mg fed for surface irrigation while 14 2 and 17 03 mg fed for subsurface irrigation under groundwater and aquaculture respectively these results are in agreement with those obtained by elnamas 2019 results also showed that water use efficiency were 6 6 and 5 7 kg m3 for groundwater while 6 9 and 6 5 kg m3 for aquaculture drainage under surface and subsurface irrigation systems respectively it was clear that the use of aquaculture for onion irrigation improved the water use efficiency in comparison with groundwater in addition water use efficiency values for surface drip irrigation system were higher than for subsurface irrigation system these results are in line with abdelraouf and ragab 2017 moursy 2018 based on the above it is important to use aquaculture drainage as alternative irrigation resource for saving the required water and fertilizer on the other hand it can be used as a source of protein and therefore it will be more benefitcial to farmers 4 conclusions aquaculture drainage was utilized for irrigating onion crop under drip irrigation system compared to groundwater in order to provide well performed drip irrigation some operational parameters and hydraulic characteristics were optimized the obtained experimental results reveal that utilizing aquaculture drainage enhances both water use efficiency and onion crop yield compared to ground water drip irrigation system under pressure of 1 4 bar provides the suitable condition for operating surface irrigation system gives greater results of application efficiency emitter clogging and water use efficiency compared to subsurface irrigation system screen sand combined filters can be used for aquaculture drainage filtration while screen filter can be used for groundwater to obtain minimum emitter clogging so it is recommended to reuse aquaculture drainage as alternative resource for irrigation to improve onion crop yield funding i certify that no

10569,today water resources shortage becomes more and more serious in reality uncertainties are inevitable due to the complex of irrigation system therefore an inexact interval programming model was developed for optimizing irrigation water resources which was also applied to a case study in jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china in the case study maximum economic benefit was made as planning objective and crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation were took under consideration which have significant influence on optimization allocation of irrigation water resources different optimal irrigation and planting structure schemes which have the ability to conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater were obtained under different representative hydrological year from the results water resources shortage is very serious which have made great negative influence on the development of jinghuiqu irrigation district in addition a lot of water resources has been saved by introducing effective precipitation in the model such as 47 36 of total water consumption was saved in maize when p 25 furthermore the decision makers can choose the desired optimal scheme according to the actual situation keywords irrigation water optimized allocation effective precipitation crop evapotranspiration interval sets conjunctive use uncertainty 1 introduction water resources are one of the necessary resources for life which is not only an environmental resource that maintains ecological balance but also a strategic resource that determines national planning and development ren et al 2019a in recent years there is great contradiction between the demand and supply of water resources which causes water shortage for example the cultivated area accounts for 12 2 of china in loess plateau but the amount of water resources accounts for only 1 8 moreover with the rapid growth of the economy and population water shortage is becoming more and more serious especially in arid and semi arid areas li et al 2019a ren and zhang 2019 li et al 2020a in addition the waste of water resources has exacerbated water shortage crisis for example approximately 90 of freshwater resources has been used for agricultural irrigation in the northwest of china characterized with low precipitation and high evaporation but the average irrigation water utilization coefficient is approximately 0 5 li et al 2016a ren et al 2019c therefore it is necessary to optimize management of irrigation water resources for eliminating or reducing the negative consequence caused by water resources shortage in recent decades extensive studies have been carried on optimal management of irrigation water resources li and guo 2014 wang et al 2015 morankar et al 2016 tan et al 2017 ren and zhang 2018 for example tran et al 2011 proposed a stochastic dynamic programming model for dealing with competitive uses of water between irrigation and fisheries which incorporated three production scenarios a linear and a mixed integer linear model were developed for optimizing irrigation water allocation and dealing with multi crop planning problem which selected maximize net benefit as objective based on the results the discrete nature of cropping area variables in the ml model has a significant effect on assigned areas and reservoir operation policies noory et al 2012 in order to improve irrigation water use efficiency an integrated optimization method is developed by coupling two stage stochastic programming with inexact quadratic program which made maximize the system benefit as objective the obtained results can help to generate desired policies for water resources management with maximized economic benefit and minimized system failure risk huang et al 2012 sabouni and mardani 2013 proposed a linear programming model with objective of maximizing the total gross margin for the delivery of water to agricultural areas an integrated interval nonlinear programming models based on jensen s water production function was proposed by fu which can improve water use efficiency by allocating water to different growth stage of crops fu et al 2014 yang et al 2015 proposed a nonlinear fuzzy interval irrigation optimization model for optimal agricultural water allocation which made three different scenarios under considered based on the result it can not only provide an effective evaluation under present scenarios but also reveal the associated economic implications li et al 2016b put forwarded a biobjective programming model which was capable of increasing agricultural water productivity and reducing irrigation water shortages in order to optimize irrigation water a two stage stochastic chance constrained fractional programming model was developed by incorporating chance constrained programming and two stage stochastic programming into linear fractional programming optimized framework zhang et al 2017 for the purpose of reducing negative influence of water scarcity a simulation optimization model was developed for crop optimal irrigation scheduling which made maximize net benefit as objective li et al 2018a 2018b guo et al 2019a developed a novel nonlinear multi level multi objective optimization model for complex canal systems which could help to shorten the operational duration by two days and improve water delivery efficiency from 0 566 to 0 687 in order to get optimal irrigation water allocation systems a model framework was established by integrating statistical downscaling model back propagation neural networks and evapotranspiration model based on the results different optimal schemes were provided by making different climate change scenarios wang et al 2019 yue et al 2020 developed a full fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming model for dealing with water shortage caused by ineffective irrigation water management which made maximize system benefit as objective based on the results the lower credibility level corresponds to higher level of system benefits and system efficiency in general the previous studies put forwarded extensive work on optimization allocation of agricultural water resources and there were mainly focused on minimizing system cost maximizing yield or balancing multi objectives and optimal schemes in addition fewer studies take effective precipitation and actual crop water requirement under consideration at the same time effective precipitation is always ignored in the studies about optimal allocation of agricultural water resources which has significant positive influence on improving irrigation water efficiency xie et al 2018 the reason is that crops have to absorb soil water to grow while effective precipitation is one of the water sources for soil water thus a certain amount of irrigation water would be saved when effective precipitation is incorporated into optimal model in addition during the operation of optimizing agricultural water resources actual crop water requirement was always replaced by the irrigation quota which may cause negative influence on the result and water saving yan and li 2018 it is because of that the irrigation quota always selects the maximum amount of water to ensure there is sufficient water for irrigation thus it is inevitable that irrigation water would be wasted therefore in this study an optimization model was developed which takes both effective precipitation and actual crop water requirements under consideration in addition as irrigation system involves many aspects it is a very complex system which involves a series of parameters such as available surface water crop areas irrigation water quota etc however some of the above parameters can not obtain a definite value i e the parameters are characterized by uncertainty for example groundwater exploitation crop price available surface water etc therefore uncertainties should be took under consideration during the operation of optimizing irrigation water resources xie et al 2017 li et al 2019b li et al 2020b and a series of optimal models characterized with uncertainties were developed such as bi level fuzzy programming stochastic fractional goal programming and interval stochastic programming zhu et al 2009 yan et al 2015 in this paper many parameters characterized with interval uncertainties such as crop price available surface water resources and planting area morankar et al 2016 wang et al 2015 interval mathematical programming is mainly used to deal with interval uncertainty programming which just determine the upper and lower bound of the interval to represent the uncertain information and can not obtain the accurate random distribution characterized of the relevant parameters fu et al 2018 li et al 2018a 2018b in addition when facing water shortage groundwater would be extracted for ensuring the supply of water resources however excessive exploitation of groundwater could lead to serious consequences thus conjunctive use of surface and groundwater should be incorporated into optimization model in past decades many studies about conjunctive use of surface and groundwater have been carried out karamouz et al 2007 montazar et al 2010 chen et al 2013 yousefi et al 2018 for example in order to develop an index system for evaluation impact of conjunctive use 16 characteristic factors of water resources and related systems were incorporated into the established model shi et al 2012 a conjunctive use model combined fuzzy inference and neural networks was proposed by safavi and enteshari which made minimize water shortage and groundwater drawdown as objective safavi and enteshari 2015 safavi and enteshari 2016 developed an optimization model for solving monthly conjunctive supply of irrigation water by incorporating artificial neural networks into ant system based on the results it presented that the optimal model has the ability to determine water extraction quantities due to the severe water shortage a genetic algorithm optimization model was developed to make an appropriate plan for the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater which also made two different deficit irrigation scenarios safavi and falsafioun 2017 in order to achieve sustainable management of water resources a coupled model incorporated fuzzy optimization model and fuzzy inference system was established for conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources milan et al 2018 for conjunctive of surface and ground water resources a coupled model introduced genetic algorithm into a coupled surface water groundwater model was proposed zeinali et al 2020 therefore based on the above analysis the inexact interval programming model iipm which incorporated effective precipitation and crop evapotranspiration was proposed to optimal allocation of irrigation water resources moreover conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater was under consideration and food security was also took introduced into the established model according to the actual situation then the presented model was applied to jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china which made maximum economic benefit as objective functions the advantages of developed model are as following a take effective precipitation into account b optimize irrigation water resources according to crop evapotranspiration c deal with uncertainty which expressed as interval sets d conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water resources e provide a series of optimization allocation of irrigation water resources under uncertainty in different representative hydrological years 2 model formulation 2 1 interval linear programming in order to deal with the uncertain information expressed as interval numbers in the model huang first proposed the interval linear programming to deal with the problem li et al 2016 the method characterized as providing a relatively stable solution without the specific distribution information of the parameters has the ability to deal with the uncertainty contained in the objective functions and the constraints of an established model zhang et al 2018 guo et al 2019b the general form of interval linear programming is as following objective 1 1 m a x f c x subjective to 1 2 a x b 1 3 x 0 where a r m n b r m 1 c r 1 n x r n 1 r denotes a set of interval numbers according to huang et al 1993 the above mode can be converted into the following two sub models sub model 1 objective 2 1 m a x f j 1 k c j x j j k 1 n c j x j subjective to 2 2 j 1 k a i j sign a i j x j j k 1 n a i j sign a i j x j b i 2 3 x j 0 x j 0 j solving sub model 1 f o p t x j o p t j 1 2 k 1 and x j o p t j k 1 1 k 1 2 n can be obtained sub model 2 objective 3 1 m a x f j 1 k c j x j j k 1 n c j x j subjective to 3 2 j 1 k a i j sign a i j x j j k 1 n a i j sign a i j x j b i 3 3 x j x j o p t j 1 2 k 3 4 x j x j o p t j k 1 k 2 n 3 5 x j 0 x j 0 j solving sub model 2 f o p t x j o p t j 1 2 k 1 and x j o p t j k 1 1 k 1 2 n can be obtained where a r j and a r j mean the absolute value of a r j respectively sign is a signal function which is defined as sign x 1 x 0 or sign x 1 x 0 x j j 1 2 k are the interval variables which have positive coefficients in the objective function x j j k 1 k 2 n are interval variables which have negative coefficients therefore based on the solution of two sub models the solution of model will be obtained which express as a set of intervals x j o p t x j o p t x j o p t and f o p t f o p t f o p t therefore the steps of solving the iipm are as follows 1 build the original iipm eq 1 2 convert the eq 1 into upper level linear programming model eq 2 and lower level linear programming model eq 3 3 solve the upper and lower linear programming model eq 2 and eq 3 respectively 4 get the optimal solutions 3 application 3 1 study area jinghuiqu irrigation district was selected as study area fig 1 located in the central part of guanzhong plain shaanxi province 108 34 34 109 21 35 e 34 25 20 34 41 40 yi et al 2010 the total area of the jinghuiqu irrigation district is approximately 1180 km2 and the total irrigation area is about 978 km2 in which the effective irrigation area is about 879 3 km2 in general jinghuiqu irrigation district plays an important role in the development of shaanxi province in addition the annual average precipitation in jinghuiqu irrigation district is approximately 538 9 mm mainly from july to september however the annual average evapotranspiration even reaches 1212 mm the water resources shortage in jinghuiqu irrigation district becomes more and more serious due to the significantly decrease of runoff of jinghe river which is the main water source of jinghuiqu irrigation district in addition the above situation exacerbated the exploitation of groundwater which could cause serious ecological problems liu et al 2011 however a lot of water resources is wasted during the process of irrigation based on the characteristic of agriculture which is a heavily water consumption industry therefore optimization allocation of water resources has significant influence on the development of jinghuiqu irrigation district the study crops selected wheat maize fruit tree and vegetable which are the main crops of study area in addition actual crop evapotranspiration which always replaced by irrigation quota and effective precipitation which always ignored have significant influence on the optimization allocation of irrigation water resources therefore this paper established an inexact optimal model by taking the above problems under consideration and considering the parameters characterized with uncertainty in the collected data the irrigation water can be optimized based on the result of the developed model 3 2 crop evapotranspiration crop evapotranspiration i e crop water requirement refers to the water consumption which reach or approach the maximum yield under suitable growing conditions tomas burguera et al 2018 and it plays an important role in determining the agricultural irrigation water consumption moreover it also has great impact on making crop irrigation schemes the calculation formula is as follows 4 e t c k c e t o where e t c means crop water requirements and it is also crop evapotranspiration mm k c means crop coefficient which determined by the experiment in the jinghuiqu irrigation district e t o is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm the e t o can be obtained by modified the penman equation 1979 allen et al 1998 hu et al 2005 which represented as follows 5 e t o p o p δ γ r n e a p o p δ γ 1 where p and p o represent surface standard atmosphere pressure and actual atmosphere pressure of calculation location respectively kpa δ is

2 e s and e a represent saturation vapor pressure and actual vapor pressure k p a e s e a is saturation vapor pressure deficit k p a u 2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s c is the wind speed correction coefficient related to the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature in this study a series of data in gaoling and jingyang meteorological station which located in jinghuiqu irrigation area has been collected such as air temperature rainfall sunlight intensity relative humidity etc in addition the hydrologic frequency analysis method was selected to analyze 54 years of precipitation series data which used precipitation series data of jingyang meteorological station to replace the precipitation in jinghuiqu irrigation district according to the analysis the wet normal and dry water years are 1996 p 25 1991 p 50 and 2008 p 75 respectively table 1 therefore based on the above analysis and modified the penman equation the reference crop evapotranspiration of each growing period in different representative hydrological years of jinghuiqu irrigation district was obtained which represented in table 2 moreover based on the characteristics of different crops during the growing periods and the irrigation scheduling of different crops the crop coefficient of different growing periods can be obtained in addition based on the obtained crop coefficient among different growing periods the crop evapotranspiration among different growing periods in different representative hydrological years can be obtained which represented in table 3 3 3 model building based on the above analysis an inexact interval optimization model which took crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation under consideration was established for optimizing irrigation water resources under uncertainty the formulation of the proposed model is presented below objective function maximization of economic benefit 6 1 max i 1 i p i a i y i i 1 i w s i a i c w i 1 i w g i a i c g subjective to

hydrological years were selected which were 1996 p 25 1991 p 50 and 2008 p 75 respectively thus the corresponding available surface water for irrigation are 2 6351 108 m3 2 4508 108 m3 1 8440 108 m3 respectively the main parameters of the established model were presented in tables 4 and 5 the data in the table were collected through field investigations the water resources bulletin of jinghuiqu etc 4 result and discussion in this paper the developed model determined three representative hydrological years which were wet p 25 normal p 50 and dry year p 75 respectively fig 2 represents the objective value under different representative hydrological years from the figure as the representative hydrological years changed the objective value of the upper and lower bound would change in general when the representative hydrological years changes from wet to dry the objective values of upper and lower bound represent a downward trend for example the lower bound of economic benefit would decrease from 87 11 108 p 25 to 38 70 108 p 75 the upper bound of economic benefit would decrease from 130 16 108 p 25 to 69 36 108 p 75 fig 3 and 4 represent total irrigation area and distribution of irrigation area among different crops under different representative hydrological year from the figures as the representative hydrological years changed the upper and lower bound of irrigation area would change from the fig 3 when the representative hydrological year changes from wet to dry the upper and lower level of total irrigation aera represent a downward trend from example the upper and lower bound of total irrigation area would decrease from 9 73 104 ha p 25 to 6 18 104 p 75 and 9 44 104 ha p 25 to 6 18 104 ha p 75 respectively when facing fig 4 it has roughly similar trend as the trend of total irrigation area under different representative hydrological years in fig 3 especially the trend of fruiter and vegetable from figure when facing maize regardless of how the representative hydrological years changes the value of upper and lower bound was the same while the trend of vegetable fruiter and wheat is roughly consistent with the trend in fig 3 for example when representative hydrological years changes from wet to dry the lower bound of vegetable would decrease from 1 95 104 ha p 25 to 0 85 104 ha p 75 the upper bound of vegetable would decrease from 1 95 104 ha p 25 to 1 08 104 ha p 75 it is because that minimum water demand of crops should be satisfied firstly based on the developed model the crops characterized with high yield or high economic benefit would consume the rest of irrigation water resources therefore when meeting food security and minimum water demand the rest of water resources would not assign to maize which characterized with lower economic benefit fig 5 represents the total water resources consumption under different representative hydrological years from figure optimized total water consumption which has the similar trend of economic benefit represented in fig 2 would change as representative hydrological years changed for example when representative hydrological year changed from wet to dry the upper and lower bound of water resources consumption would decrease from 44919 24 104 m3 p 25 to 38539 50 104 m3 p 75 and 44051 2 104 m3 p 25 to 36139 5 104 m3 p 75 respectively fig 6 represents the consumption of surface and groundwater under different representative hydrological years from figure when the representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry the consumption of surface water would change while the value of upper and lower bound would be the same when they were at the same representative hydrological years for example when the representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry the upper and lower bound of surface water consumption would decrease from 26351 00 104 m3 p 25 to 18440 00 104 m3 p 75 in addition the upper bound of groundwater consumption would decrease as representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry while the lower bound of groundwater consumption would be the same as representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry moreover when it compared with surface water consumption the upper and lower bound of groundwater consumption are different when they were at the same representative hydrological years for example when the representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry the upper bound of groundwater consumption would increase from 18568 04 104 m3 p 25 to 20100 104 m3 p 75 while the lower bound of groundwater consumption was always 17700 00 104 m3 no matter how representative hydrological years changed it is because that the available surface water resources under each representative hydrological year of which price is lower than groundwater has been completely consumed for groundwater the available groundwater under each representative hydrological year has also been completely consumed except for the upper bound of p 25 the reason is that there is no enough irrigation area in general water resources shortage has great negative influence on the development of jinghuiqu irrigation district in order to interpret the composition of water resources consumption among crops the wet representative hydrological year was chosen as the representative one fig 7 illustrates the composition of water consumption per unit of different crops from figure the crop water requirement i e crop evapotranspiration determined by modified the penman equation was consisted of effective precipitation and optimization allocation of water resources moreover when the four crops compared with each other it represents that vegetable fruiter and maize require relatively more water resources than wheat especially vegetable for example the crop evapotranspiration of vegetable is 8480 m3 while the crop evapotranspiration of wheat is only 3201 m3 in addition it also suggests that the effective precipitation plays an important role in the operation of optimizing irrigation water resources especially when water resources shortage is particularly severe this is because that the effective precipitation could save a lot of irrigation water resources for example the crop evapotranspiration and optimization allocation of water resources in vegetable is 8480 m3 and 3827 8 m3 respectively while the effective precipitation is 4652 2 m3 which even accounted for 54 86 of the total water resources consumption and it accounted for 51 88 47 36 and 35 11 in wheat maize and fruiter respectively however those elements were ignored in many other previous optimal studies therefore when crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation were took under consideration in the operation of optimizing irrigation water resources irrigation water could be greatly saved by the developed model therefore irrigation water resources can be effectively saved based on the developed model which not only optimizes irrigation water resources among crops but also incorporates crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation in addition the water resources which was saved can be used for other purposes furthermore different optimal schemes under different representative hydrological years can be offered by the developed model 5 conclusion in this study an inexact interval programming model was established for optimizing irrigation water resources under uncertainties which can provide different optimal schemes under different representative hydrological years and then the established model was applied to a real world case study in jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china based on the results when effective precipitation and crop evapotranspiration were incorporated into the established model 54 86 51 88 47 36 and 35 11 water resources has been saved for vegetable wheat maize and fruiter respectively compared with the previous studies the advantages of established model are as followings a it has the ability to optimize irrigation water resources and planting structure simultaneously b crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation was incorporated into the developed model c surface water and groundwater can be coordinative optimal allocation in the developed model d uncertainty expressed as interval sets can be deal with by the developed model in addition as different representative hydrological years were incorporated different optimal schemes under different representative hydrological years were provided by the developed model in general a feasible optimization solution can be offered for the decision makers based on the above analysis the developed model has the ability to provide a series of optimal schemes due to different representative hydrological years were incorporated however the developed model still can be improved for example there are some parameters characterized with different kinds of uncertainties moreover due to irrigation system involves many sectors multi objective programming which has the ability to obtain an optimal solution from different objectives may be incorporated into the developed model therefore further work may focus on multi objectives or multiple uncertainties declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10569,today water resources shortage becomes more and more serious in reality uncertainties are inevitable due to the complex of irrigation system therefore an inexact interval programming model was developed for optimizing irrigation water resources which was also applied to a case study in jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china in the case study maximum economic benefit was made as planning objective and crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation were took under consideration which have significant influence on optimization allocation of irrigation water resources different optimal irrigation and planting structure schemes which have the ability to conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater were obtained under different representative hydrological year from the results water resources shortage is very serious which have made great negative influence on the development of jinghuiqu irrigation district in addition a lot of water resources has been saved by introducing effective precipitation in the model such as 47 36 of total water consumption was saved in maize when p 25 furthermore the decision makers can choose the desired optimal scheme according to the actual situation keywords irrigation water optimized allocation effective precipitation crop evapotranspiration interval sets conjunctive use uncertainty 1 introduction water resources are one of the necessary resources for life which is not only an environmental resource that maintains ecological balance but also a strategic resource that determines national planning and development ren et al 2019a in recent years there is great contradiction between the demand and supply of water resources which causes water shortage for example the cultivated area accounts for 12 2 of china in loess plateau but the amount of water resources accounts for only 1 8 moreover with the rapid growth of the economy and population water shortage is becoming more and more serious especially in arid and semi arid areas li et al 2019a ren and zhang 2019 li et al 2020a in addition the waste of water resources has exacerbated water shortage crisis for example approximately 90 of freshwater resources has been used for agricultural irrigation in the northwest of china characterized with low precipitation and high evaporation but the average irrigation water utilization coefficient is approximately 0 5 li et al 2016a ren et al 2019c therefore it is necessary to optimize management of irrigation water resources for eliminating or reducing the negative consequence caused by water resources shortage in recent decades extensive studies have been carried on optimal management of irrigation water resources li and guo 2014 wang et al 2015 morankar et al 2016 tan et al 2017 ren and zhang 2018 for example tran et al 2011 proposed a stochastic dynamic programming model for dealing with competitive uses of water between irrigation and fisheries which incorporated three production scenarios a linear and a mixed integer linear model were developed for optimizing irrigation water allocation and dealing with multi crop planning problem which selected maximize net benefit as objective based on the results the discrete nature of cropping area variables in the ml model has a significant effect on assigned areas and reservoir operation policies noory et al 2012 in order to improve irrigation water use efficiency an integrated optimization method is developed by coupling two stage stochastic programming with inexact quadratic program which made maximize the system benefit as objective the obtained results can help to generate desired policies for water resources management with maximized economic benefit and minimized system failure risk huang et al 2012 sabouni and mardani 2013 proposed a linear programming model with objective of maximizing the total gross margin for the delivery of water to agricultural areas an integrated interval nonlinear programming models based on jensen s water production function was proposed by fu which can improve water use efficiency by allocating water to different growth stage of crops fu et al 2014 yang et al 2015 proposed a nonlinear fuzzy interval irrigation optimization model for optimal agricultural water allocation which made three different scenarios under considered based on the result it can not only provide an effective evaluation under present scenarios but also reveal the associated economic implications li et al 2016b put forwarded a biobjective programming model which was capable of increasing agricultural water productivity and reducing irrigation water shortages in order to optimize irrigation water a two stage stochastic chance constrained fractional programming model was developed by incorporating chance constrained programming and two stage stochastic programming into linear fractional programming optimized framework zhang et al 2017 for the purpose of reducing negative influence of water scarcity a simulation optimization model was developed for crop optimal irrigation scheduling which made maximize net benefit as objective li et al 2018a 2018b guo et al 2019a developed a novel nonlinear multi level multi objective optimization model for complex canal systems which could help to shorten the operational duration by two days and improve water delivery efficiency from 0 566 to 0 687 in order to get optimal irrigation water allocation systems a model framework was established by integrating statistical downscaling model back propagation neural networks and evapotranspiration model based on the results different optimal schemes were provided by making different climate change scenarios wang et al 2019 yue et al 2020 developed a full fuzzy interval credibility constrained nonlinear programming model for dealing with water shortage caused by ineffective irrigation water management which made maximize system benefit as objective based on the results the lower credibility level corresponds to higher level of system benefits and system efficiency in general the previous studies put forwarded extensive work on optimization allocation of agricultural water resources and there were mainly focused on minimizing system cost maximizing yield or balancing multi objectives and optimal schemes in addition fewer studies take effective precipitation and actual crop water requirement under consideration at the same time effective precipitation is always ignored in the studies about optimal allocation of agricultural water resources which has significant positive influence on improving irrigation water efficiency xie et al 2018 the reason is that crops have to absorb soil water to grow while effective precipitation is one of the water sources for soil water thus a certain amount of irrigation water would be saved when effective precipitation is incorporated into optimal model in addition during the operation of optimizing agricultural water resources actual crop water requirement was always replaced by the irrigation quota which may cause negative influence on the result and water saving yan and li 2018 it is because of that the irrigation quota always selects the maximum amount of water to ensure there is sufficient water for irrigation thus it is inevitable that irrigation water would be wasted therefore in this study an optimization model was developed which takes both effective precipitation and actual crop water requirements under consideration in addition as irrigation system involves many aspects it is a very complex system which involves a series of parameters such as available surface water crop areas irrigation water quota etc however some of the above parameters can not obtain a definite value i e the parameters are characterized by uncertainty for example groundwater exploitation crop price available surface water etc therefore uncertainties should be took under consideration during the operation of optimizing irrigation water resources xie et al 2017 li et al 2019b li et al 2020b and a series of optimal models characterized with uncertainties were developed such as bi level fuzzy programming stochastic fractional goal programming and interval stochastic programming zhu et al 2009 yan et al 2015 in this paper many parameters characterized with interval uncertainties such as crop price available surface water resources and planting area morankar et al 2016 wang et al 2015 interval mathematical programming is mainly used to deal with interval uncertainty programming which just determine the upper and lower bound of the interval to represent the uncertain information and can not obtain the accurate random distribution characterized of the relevant parameters fu et al 2018 li et al 2018a 2018b in addition when facing water shortage groundwater would be extracted for ensuring the supply of water resources however excessive exploitation of groundwater could lead to serious consequences thus conjunctive use of surface and groundwater should be incorporated into optimization model in past decades many studies about conjunctive use of surface and groundwater have been carried out karamouz et al 2007 montazar et al 2010 chen et al 2013 yousefi et al 2018 for example in order to develop an index system for evaluation impact of conjunctive use 16 characteristic factors of water resources and related systems were incorporated into the established model shi et al 2012 a conjunctive use model combined fuzzy inference and neural networks was proposed by safavi and enteshari which made minimize water shortage and groundwater drawdown as objective safavi and enteshari 2015 safavi and enteshari 2016 developed an optimization model for solving monthly conjunctive supply of irrigation water by incorporating artificial neural networks into ant system based on the results it presented that the optimal model has the ability to determine water extraction quantities due to the severe water shortage a genetic algorithm optimization model was developed to make an appropriate plan for the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater which also made two different deficit irrigation scenarios safavi and falsafioun 2017 in order to achieve sustainable management of water resources a coupled model incorporated fuzzy optimization model and fuzzy inference system was established for conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources milan et al 2018 for conjunctive of surface and ground water resources a coupled model introduced genetic algorithm into a coupled surface water groundwater model was proposed zeinali et al 2020 therefore based on the above analysis the inexact interval programming model iipm which incorporated effective precipitation and crop evapotranspiration was proposed to optimal allocation of irrigation water resources moreover conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater was under consideration and food security was also took introduced into the established model according to the actual situation then the presented model was applied to jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china which made maximum economic benefit as objective functions the advantages of developed model are as following a take effective precipitation into account b optimize irrigation water resources according to crop evapotranspiration c deal with uncertainty which expressed as interval sets d conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water resources e provide a series of optimization allocation of irrigation water resources under uncertainty in different representative hydrological years 2 model formulation 2 1 interval linear programming in order to deal with the uncertain information expressed as interval numbers in the model huang first proposed the interval linear programming to deal with the problem li et al 2016 the method characterized as providing a relatively stable solution without the specific distribution information of the parameters has the ability to deal with the uncertainty contained in the objective functions and the constraints of an established model zhang et al 2018 guo et al 2019b the general form of interval linear programming is as following objective 1 1 m a x f c x subjective to 1 2 a x b 1 3 x 0 where a r m n b r m 1 c r 1 n x r n 1 r denotes a set of interval numbers according to huang et al 1993 the above mode can be converted into the following two sub models sub model 1 objective 2 1 m a x f j 1 k c j x j j k 1 n c j x j subjective to 2 2 j 1 k a i j

c j x j j k 1 n c j x j subjective to 3 2 j 1 k a i j sign a i j x j j k 1 n a i j sign a i j x j b i 3 3 x j x j o p t j 1 2 k 3 4 x j x j o p t j k 1 k 2 n 3 5 x j 0 x j 0 j solving sub model 2 f o p t x j o p t j 1 2 k 1 and x j o p t j k 1 1 k 1 2 n can be obtained where a r j and a r j mean the absolute value of a r j respectively sign is a signal function which is defined as sign x 1 x 0 or sign x 1 x 0 x j j 1 2 k are the interval variables which have positive coefficients in the objective function x j j k 1 k 2 n are interval variables which have negative coefficients therefore based on the solution of two sub models the solution of model will be obtained which express as a set of intervals x j o p t x j o p t x j o p t and f o p t f o p t f o p t therefore the steps of solving the iipm are as follows 1 build the original iipm eq 1 2 convert the eq 1 into upper level linear programming model eq 2 and lower level linear programming model eq 3 3 solve the upper and lower linear programming model eq 2 and eq 3 respectively 4 get the optimal solutions 3 application 3 1 study area jinghuiqu irrigation district was selected as study area fig 1 located in the central part of guanzhong plain shaanxi province 108 34 34 109 21 35 e 34 25 20 34 41 40 yi et al 2010 the total area of the jinghuiqu irrigation district is approximately 1180 km2 and the total irrigation area is about 978 km2 in which the effective irrigation area is about 879 3 km2 in general jinghuiqu irrigation district plays an important role in the development of shaanxi province in addition the annual average precipitation in jinghuiqu irrigation district is approximately 538 9 mm mainly from july to september however the annual average evapotranspiration even reaches 1212 mm the water resources shortage in jinghuiqu irrigation district becomes more and more serious due to the significantly decrease of runoff of jinghe river which is the main water source of jinghuiqu irrigation district in addition the above situation exacerbated the exploitation of groundwater which could cause serious ecological problems liu et al 2011 however a lot of water resources is wasted during the process of irrigation based on the characteristic of agriculture which is a heavily water consumption industry therefore optimization allocation of water resources has significant influence on the development of jinghuiqu irrigation district the study crops selected wheat maize fruit tree and vegetable which are the main crops of study area in addition actual crop evapotranspiration which always replaced by irrigation quota and effective precipitation which always ignored have significant influence on the optimization allocation of irrigation water resources therefore this paper established an inexact optimal model by taking the above problems under consideration and considering the parameters characterized with uncertainty in the collected data the irrigation water can be optimized based on the result of the developed model 3 2 crop evapotranspiration crop evapotranspiration i e crop water requirement refers to the water consumption which reach or approach the maximum yield under suitable growing conditions tomas burguera et al 2018 and it plays an important role in determining the agricultural irrigation water consumption moreover it also has great impact on making crop irrigation schemes the calculation formula is as follows 4 e t c k c e t o where e t c means crop water requirements and it is also crop evapotranspiration mm k c means crop coefficient which determined by the experiment in the jinghuiqu irrigation district e t o is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm the e t o can be obtained by modified the penman equation 1979 allen et al 1998 hu et al 2005 which represented as follows 5 e t o p o p δ γ r n e a p o p δ γ 1 where p and p o represent surface standard atmosphere pressure and actual atmosphere pressure of calculation location respectively kpa δ is the slope of saturated water vapor pressure temperature curve k p a c r n is the net radiation m j m 2 d a y γ is psychrometric constant k p a c e a means air driving force mm d e a 0 26 e s e a 1 c u

coefficient related to the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature in this study a series of data in gaoling and jingyang meteorological station which located in jinghuiqu irrigation area has been collected such as air temperature rainfall sunlight intensity relative humidity etc in addition the hydrologic frequency analysis method was selected to analyze 54 years of precipitation series data which used precipitation series data of jingyang meteorological station to replace the precipitation in jinghuiqu irrigation district according to the analysis the wet normal and dry water years are 1996 p 25 1991 p 50 and 2008 p 75 respectively table 1 therefore based on the above analysis and modified the penman equation the reference crop evapotranspiration of each growing period in different representative hydrological years of jinghuiqu irrigation district was obtained which represented in table 2 moreover based on the characteristics of different crops during the growing periods and the irrigation scheduling of different crops the crop coefficient of different growing periods can be obtained in addition based on the obtained crop coefficient among different growing periods the crop evapotranspiration among different growing periods in different representative hydrological years can be obtained which represented in table 3 3 3 model building based on the above analysis an inexact interval optimization model which took crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation under consideration was established for optimizing irrigation water resources under

hydrological years were selected which were 1996 p 25 1991 p 50 and 2008 p 75 respectively thus the corresponding available surface water for irrigation are 2 6351 108 m3 2 4508 108 m3 1 8440 108 m3 respectively the main parameters of the established model were presented in tables 4 and 5 the data in the table were collected through field investigations the water resources bulletin of jinghuiqu etc 4 result and discussion in this paper the developed model determined three representative hydrological years which were wet p 25 normal p 50 and dry year p 75 respectively fig 2 represents the objective value under different representative hydrological years from the figure as the representative hydrological years changed the objective value of the upper and lower bound would change in general when the representative hydrological years changes from wet to dry the objective values of upper and lower bound represent a downward trend for example the lower bound of economic benefit would decrease from 87 11 108 p 25 to 38 70 108 p 75 the upper bound of economic benefit would decrease from 130 16 108 p 25 to 69 36 108 p 75 fig 3 and 4 represent total irrigation area and distribution of irrigation area among different crops under different representative hydrological year from the figures as the representative hydrological years changed the upper and lower bound of irrigation area would change from the fig 3 when the representative hydrological year changes from wet to dry the upper and lower level of total irrigation aera represent a downward trend from example the upper and lower bound of total irrigation area would decrease from 9 73 104 ha p 25 to 6 18 104 p 75 and 9 44 104 ha p 25 to 6 18 104 ha p 75 respectively when facing fig 4 it has roughly similar trend as the trend of total irrigation area under different representative hydrological years in fig 3 especially the trend of fruiter and vegetable from figure when facing maize regardless of how the representative hydrological years changes the value of upper and lower bound was the same while the trend of vegetable fruiter and wheat is roughly consistent with the trend in fig 3 for example when representative hydrological years changes from wet to dry the lower bound of vegetable would decrease from 1 95 104 ha p 25 to 0 85 104 ha p 75 the upper bound of vegetable would decrease from 1 95 104 ha p 25 to 1 08 104 ha p 75 it is because that minimum water demand of crops should be satisfied firstly based on the developed model the crops characterized with high yield or high economic benefit would consume the rest of irrigation water resources therefore when meeting food security and minimum water demand the rest of water resources would not assign to maize which characterized with lower economic benefit fig 5 represents the total water resources consumption under different representative hydrological years from figure optimized total water consumption which has the similar trend of economic benefit represented in fig 2 would change as representative hydrological years changed for example when representative hydrological year changed from wet to dry the upper and lower bound of water resources consumption would decrease from 44919 24 104 m3 p 25 to 38539 50 104 m3 p 75 and 44051 2 104 m3 p 25 to 36139 5 104 m3 p 75 respectively fig 6 represents the consumption of surface and groundwater under different representative hydrological years from figure when the representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry the consumption of surface water would change while the value of upper and lower bound would be the same when they were at the same representative hydrological years for example when the representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry the upper and lower bound of surface water consumption would decrease from 26351 00 104 m3 p 25 to 18440 00 104 m3 p 75 in addition the upper bound of groundwater consumption would decrease as representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry while the lower bound of groundwater consumption would be the same as representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry moreover when it compared with surface water consumption the upper and lower bound of groundwater consumption are different when they were at the same representative hydrological years for example when the representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry the upper bound of groundwater consumption would increase from 18568 04 104 m3 p 25 to 20100 104 m3 p 75 while the lower bound of groundwater consumption was always 17700 00 104 m3 no matter how representative hydrological years changed it is because that the available surface water resources under each representative hydrological year of which price is lower than groundwater has been completely consumed for groundwater the available groundwater under each representative hydrological year has also been completely consumed except for the upper bound of p 25 the reason is that there is no enough irrigation area in general water resources shortage has great negative influence on the development of jinghuiqu irrigation district in order to interpret the composition of water resources consumption among crops the wet representative hydrological year was chosen as the representative one fig 7 illustrates the composition of water consumption per unit of different crops from figure the crop water requirement i e crop evapotranspiration determined by modified the penman equation was consisted of effective precipitation and optimization allocation of water resources moreover when the four crops compared with each other it represents that vegetable fruiter and maize require relatively more water resources than wheat especially vegetable for example the crop evapotranspiration of vegetable is 8480 m3 while the crop evapotranspiration of wheat is only 3201 m3 in addition it also suggests that the effective precipitation plays an important role in the operation of optimizing irrigation water resources especially when water resources shortage is particularly severe this is because that the effective precipitation could save a lot of irrigation water resources for example the crop evapotranspiration and optimization allocation of water resources in vegetable is 8480 m3 and 3827 8 m3 respectively while the effective precipitation is 4652 2 m3 which even accounted for 54 86 of the total water resources consumption and it accounted for 51 88 47 36 and 35 11 in wheat maize and fruiter respectively however those elements were ignored in many other previous optimal studies therefore when crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation were took under consideration in the operation of optimizing irrigation water resources irrigation water could be greatly saved by the developed model therefore irrigation water resources can be effectively saved based on the developed model which not only optimizes irrigation water resources among crops but also incorporates crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation in addition the water resources which was saved can be used for other purposes furthermore different optimal schemes under different representative hydrological years can be offered by the developed model 5 conclusion in this study an inexact interval programming model was established for optimizing irrigation water resources under uncertainties which can provide different optimal schemes under different representative hydrological years and then the established model was applied to a real world case study in jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china based on the results when effective precipitation and crop evapotranspiration were incorporated into the established model 54 86 51 88 47 36 and 35 11 water resources has been saved for vegetable wheat maize and fruiter respectively compared with the previous studies the advantages of established model are as followings a it has the ability to optimize irrigation water resources and planting structure simultaneously b crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation was incorporated into the developed model c surface water and groundwater can be coordinative optimal allocation in the developed model d uncertainty expressed as interval sets can be deal with by the developed model in addition as different representative hydrological years were incorporated different optimal schemes under different representative hydrological years were provided by the developed model in general a feasible optimization solution can be offered for the decision makers based on the above analysis the developed model has the ability to provide a series of optimal schemes due to different representative hydrological years were incorporated however the developed model still can be improved for example there are some parameters characterized with different kinds of uncertainties moreover due to irrigation system involves many sectors multi objective programming which has the ability to obtain an optimal solution from different objectives may be incorporated into the developed model therefore further work may focus on multi objectives or multiple uncertainties declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
