9720,soil moisture sm is an important indicator of the photosynthetic rate and growth status of crops a few related parameters such as the red edge parameters and spectral indices have been adopted for retrieving the sm of winter wheat to further study their abilities to detect the sm field scale water stress experiments on winter wheat were conducted during the 2018 19 growing season the spectral ratio index in the near infrared nir shoulder region nsri 700 1100 nm was selected by comparing the correlations between the sm and the red edge parameters and spectral indices and it was optimized using the partial least squares regression plsr method to assess the performance of the sensitive wavebands of the nsri in retrieving the sm three types of spectral index models were established using multiple linear regression mlr for the winter wheat from the jointing to the ripening stage the results indicate that the red edge parameters are more sensitive to the spectral variation during the jointing and flowering stages the sensitivity decreased with increasing water stress the red edge area sdr of winter wheat irrigated in the flowering stage d1 treatment and irrigated in the jointing stage d2 treatment decreased by 20 30 respectively in general all of the parameters and indices were correlated with the surface sm 0 40 cm depth especially for the nsri with a significant coefficient of determination r2 of 0 52 in the 10 20 cm depth interval p 0 01 moreover all of the spectral index models based on the optimized nsri have good capabilities for retrieving the sm in the jointing stage the model for one derivative of the logarithm of the nsri logarithmic nsri performed best with r2 and root mean square error rmse values of 0 81 0 92 and 0 17 0 89 respectively finally the logarithmic nsri model was used to retrieve the sm in the flowering ripening stage r2 0 85 overall the optimized spectral index models can accurately and quickly retrieve the sm and can assist in predicting the effect of drought on the crop yield in the future graphical abstract ga1 keywords hyperspectral data water stress winter wheat soil moisture spectral indices 1 introduction winter wheat is one of the main grain crops in china and its planting area accounts for one fifth of the grain planting area ren et al 2006 wei et al 2021 soil moisture sm is regarded as a crucial property affecting the state of the agricultural water cycle over land kumar et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 with global warming and frequent heat waves drought has become much more serious in northern china especially during the growth stages of winter wheat bai et al 2020 ren et al 2021 xiao et al 2015 therefore accurately detecting the changes in the sm to predict the effect of drought on the yield plays a vital role during the growth stages of winter wheat zha et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 in general the degree of winter wheat water stress is judged based on the soil water status and is represented by the sm oltra carrio et al 2015 zhu et al 2020 traditional methods of measuring the sm are based on site scale or local surveys however these are often limited by labor and resources recently hyperspectral technology has been developed to retrieve the sm due to its high spectral resolution timely inexpensive and non destructive characteristics peng et al 2020 yang et al 2019 hyperspectral sensors acquire more than 100 contiguous spectral bands with a narrow bandwidth 5 10 nm in the 500 2500 nm wavelength region to collect spectral information peng et al 2013 providing an opportunity to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the growth status of winter wheat and the changes in the sm zou et al 2018 the visible near infrared vis nir region is a special region used to extract the spectral information about winter wheat and to monitor changes in the sm peng et al 2013 there is an abrupt leaf reflectance change between 680 nm and 780 nm in the vegetation spectra caused by the combined effects of strong chlorophyll absorption and internal scattering in the leaves which has been proven to be more sensitive to the physiological changes in winter wheat zhu et al 2014 in addition researchers have reported that the red edge region provides more accurate information for assessing the effect of the changes in the sm on the winter wheat in the development stages zhang et al 2015 the most widely applied indices in the red edge region are the red edge parameters such as the red edge position rep red edge amplitude dr and red edge area sdr wu et al 2014 these red edge parameters can be adopted to accurately monitor the growth status of winter wheat and the degree of water stress of the farmland gu et al 2008 xu et al 2018 unfortunately the red edge parameters extracted from ground spectra tend to suffer from the influence of soil background and environmental noise to better extract the spectral feature information about the vegetation and soil researchers proposed several hyperspectral indices related to the feature extraction including the water index wi normalized difference water index ndwi normalized difference infrared index ndii simple ratio water index srwi moisture stress index msi spectral ratio index in the nir shoulder region nsri optimized soil adjusted vegetation index osavi and depth water index dwi chai and chen 2017 lees et al 2019 liang et al 2015 liu et al 2014 2016 pasqualotto et al 2018 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2015 xiao et al 2014 these hyperspectral indices are sensitive in detecting moisture changes and are frequently used to retrieve the sm in different ecosystems e g agriculture forests and grassland casas et al 2014 peng et al 2013 yi et al 2014 all of the above mentioned hyperspectral indices and red edge parameters make use of narrow hyperspectral bands thus to improve the availability of these narrow hyperspectral bands plsr has been effectively applied to reduce the multicollinearity and over fitting in the spectral wavebands it optimally chooses a suitable number of principal components and deletes the noise wavebands compared to stepwise linear regression analysis fu et al 2014 in recent years the plsr method has been used to detect and retrieve the sm wu et al 2018 applied the plsr method to retrieve the soil water content of saline soils by analyzing the original measured and first order derivative spectra gou et al 2020 established estimation models of the purple soil moisture content using the plsr method and vis nir spectroscopy overall many previous studies have focused on exploring the relationships between the sm and the soil features utilizing plsr models based on reflectance however limited research has been conducted to explore the relationships between the sm and the spectral indices in the red edge or nir shoulder region in addition a greater number of the sensitive wavebands in the red edge or nir shoulder region can also be identified using the plsr method to improve the accuracy of the sm retrieval in this study we aimed to establish accurate sm retrieval models for winter wheat combined with optimized spectral indices selected by analyzing the sensitive region of winter wheat under water stress using red edge parameters the specific objectives of this study were 1 to analyze the response of the spectral reflectance and red edge parameters in the main growth stages of winter wheat under water stress 2 to optimize the spectral indices in the red edge or nir shoulder region based on plsr and 3 to improve the accuracy of spectral index models for retrieving the sm at depths of 0 40 cm using multiple linear regression mlr and the optimized spectral indices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in jiaozhou 36 00 36 30 n 119 37 120 12 e jiaozhou is located in the southwestern part of the shandong peninsula with an area of 539 km2 fig s1 it is located in the northern temperate monsoon area and is close to the yellow sea huang et al 2018 song et al 2015 therefore it has the characteristics of monsoon and marine climates with an annual average precipitation and temperature of 485 4 mm and 13 6 c respectively song et al 2015 the jiaozhou area is characterized by abundant light rain and heat in the same season and a long frost free period this region is suitable for growing various crops such as winter wheat corn and soybeans 2 2 experiment the experiment on the water stress of winter wheat was conducted in a water saving irrigation field in the modern agricultural science and technology demonstration park of qingdao agricultural university qingdao the experiment was conducted over four winter wheat growing stages i e the regreening jointing flowering and ripening stages table s1 there were nine plots in the test site namely a i the size of each plot was 13 m 5 m the distance between neighboring plots was 0 5 m with a 1 2 m deep waterproof layer installed to prevent water exchange between the plots the seeding and harvest dates for this growing season were october 20 2018 and june 10 2019 respectively in addition we followed local crop management practices to control pests diseases and weeds and to keep each plot uniform in terms of water treatments two irrigation levels were determined as sufficient 6 m3 and deficit 3 m3 according to the seasonal water demands of winter wheat in this region table 1 fig 1 shows the growth status of the winter wheat with sufficient irrigation from the regreening to ripening stages plots d and i were irrigated with sufficient water in the jointing and flowering stages w treatment plots b and g were not irrigated in the jointing stage and they were irrigated with approximately 3 m3 of water in the flowering stage d1 treatment plots a and e were not irrigated in the flowering stage and they were irrigated with approximately 3 m3 of water in the jointing stage d2 treatment in addition reirrigation was conducted for the d1 and d2 treatments in the other growth stages of the winter wheat to keep it consistent with the w treatment plots c f and h were not irrigated throughout the entire growth period except for water from natural rainwater r treatment 2 3 datasets the hyperspectral reflectance measurements were collected using a high resolution full range svc hr 768i spectroradiometer spectra vista co usa between 10 00 and 14 00 local time the measurements were obtained under clear sky conditions to minimize variations in the solar angle and canopy shadows the spectroradiometer acquired measurements have spectral sampling intervals of 1 5 nm 7 6 nm and 5 nm in the 350 1000 nm 1000 1890 nm and 1890 2500 nm bands respectively according to the weather and time conditions on march 17 april 22 may 18 and june 9 in 2019 which corresponded to the regreening stage jointing stage flowering stage and ripening stage respectively a total of four measurements were conducted we used a spectroradiometer with a 4 field of view fov to take top of canopy spectral measurements from 1 m above the canopy covering the winter wheat canopy vertically downward in the nadir orientation during each observation for optimization purpose and to reduce the possible effects of the sky and field conditions we took the spectral measurements of a white calibration target 10 times and averaged it for each plot the dark current and spectral white reference panel measurements were obtained every 5 min in the experiment 6 data samples were separately collected for the w d1 and d2 treatments and 9 data samples were collected for the r treatment per stage from the regreening to ripening stage thus a total of 108 data samples were obtained in the four growth stages then the correction function in the viewspecpro software was used to make preliminary corrections to remove outliers with spectral reflectances greater than 1 0 the savitzky golay filter was applied to denoise the hyperspectral data and then the smoothed spectral data were averaged the in situ sm measurements were collected with a portable time domain reflectometry tdr sm probe trime pico 64 imko ettlingen germany equipped with a data reader hd2 imko germany tdr sensor is an electronic device that works on the principle of radar by transmitting signals into the medium which is soil and collecting the reflected signals it measures the dielectric constant and consequently the permittivity and water content of the soil via wave propagation transmitted by two parallel embedded metal probes with great accuracy biase et al 2021 the sm is then calculated and displayed by the reading system through the analog voltage output in addition sm data were collected on march 14 april 19 may 15 and june 6 in 2019 the dates for the sm data collection were close to the dates for the hyperspectral measurements from the regreening stage to the ripening stage the sm measurements were also collected four times during the winter wheat growth stages the sm data were collected at eight soil depths 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm 40 50 cm 50 60 cm 60 70 cm and 70 80 cm from the center of each plot a i thus 8 data samples were collected in each plot and 72 data samples were obtained in the entire field we collected a total of 288 sm data samples in the four growth stages then the moving average filter was used to eliminate the sm data sample outliers 2 4 methodology 2 4 1 red edge parameters the rep dr and sdr were used to evaluate the vegetation status ju et al 2010 wu et al 2014 the rep is the wavelength corresponding to the maximum value of the first derivative of the spectra in the 680 760 nm bands the dr is the first order differential value when the wavelength is in the position of the red edge the sdr is the area enclosed by the first derivative of the spectra between 680 and 760 nm the first derivative is calculated using the first order differential transformation of the reflectance spectra dawson et al 1998 1 ρ λ i ρ λ i 1 ρ λ i 1 2 δ λ where λ is the wavelength of each waveband ρ λ i is the first order differential value of the wavelength and λ is the interval from λ 1 to λ i 2 4 2 spectral indices the spectral indices can be used to explore the correlation between the sm and the spectral reflectance these indices were established using the reflectance at sensitive wavelengths and were used to detect variations in the sm in this study several representative spectral indices including wi ndwi ndii srwi msi nsri osavi and dwi were applied to test their correlations with the sm the specific formulas for calculating the spectral indices from the ground spectral reflectance are presented in table 2 the most sensitive spectral indices and the optimized waveband combinations were determined by analyzing the results of the spectral indices correlations and two dimensional 2d plots the spectral indices can effectively eliminate background noise and mixed signals and they also have significantly more sensitivity than a single band oltra carrio et al 2015 these indices have been used to retrieve the soil surface moisture and for detecting winter wheat under water stress cheng et al 2013 2 4 3 partial least squares regression the plsr method is a widely used technique for reducing a large number of collinear spectral variables to a few non correlated latent variables or specifying factors fu et al 2014 li et al 2014b compared with the effect of reducing the dimension of the principal component regression pcr the plsr can automatically select relevant variables and perform decomposition of two spectra chun and keleş 2010 the aim of plsr is to build a linear model as follows geladi and kowalski 1986 1 y x β ε where y is the mean centered vector of a dependent variable x is the mean centered matrix of the independent variables β is the matrix of the regression coefficients and ε is the matrix of the residuals 2 4 4 multiple linear regression mlr has been frequently used to predict soil attributes zhang et al 2019 it assumes that the remotely sensed independent variables are linearly related to the samples in addition the mlr algorithm requires the specification of several parameters and the setting of these parameters impacts the results zhang et al 2019 in this study the spectral index models established using the optimized waveband combinations as parameters in the mlr greatly improved the accuracy of the sm retrieval of the winter wheat during the growth stages 2 4 5 validation to select the optimal number of factors included in the plsr model we used the leave one out cross validation method rayo and hoteit 2012 the dataset was randomly divided into two sets 75 were used for construction in which n 40 samples were collected per stage from the regreening to jointing stages were used to elaborate the calibration regression models and 25 a validation set of n 14 samples collected per stage from the regreening to jointing stages were used to evaluate the sm estimation capacity of the developed models in each stage from the regreening to jointing stages finally the estimation performances of the regression models were evaluated using the determination coefficients r2 and the root mean square error rmse the r2 and rmse were calculated as follows 3 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 4 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n where n is number of samples xi is the measured moisture yi is the estimated moisture x and y are the mean values of xi and yi respectively 3 results 3 1 variation characteristics of the winter wheat canopy hyperspectral reflectance under water stress the canopy structure of winter wheat will change under different degrees of water stress during the growth stages chen et al 2007 because the water deficient stems and leaves impact the winter wheat canopy s spectra reflectance wang et al 2015 we chose the original values and the first order differential transformation of the spectra to accurately analyze the spectral characteristics of the winter wheat under water stress fig 2 shows the spectral reflectance of the winter wheat canopy under four water treatments from the regreening to ripening stages fig 2a shows the spectral reflectance curves of the winter wheat not subjected to water stress in the regreening stage the differences in the four types of spectral reflectance are not large between 950 and 1050 nm in addition owing to the absorption of the water the spectral reflection curve fluctuates greatly in this waveband with the water absorption trough appearing at 970 nm fig 2b shows the reflectance ranges 700 900 nm during the jointing stage which is higher than those during the other growth stages at this time the d1 treatment was under water stress but the d2 and w treatments were under normal irrigation the winter wheat reflectance of the water controlled treatment in the jointing stage was greatly affected by water stress in the near infrared waveband 750 1350 nm the spectral reflectances of the four treatments reached the highest value at 850 nm the spectral reflectances of the d1 treatment and w treatment were 0 51 and 0 63 respectively the spectral reflectance of the d1 treatment was 19 0 lower than that of the w treatment moreover similar characteristics can be seen in fig 2c after the jointing stage the d1 treatment was retreated with normal irrigation while the d2 treatment has a water control status thus the spectral reflectances of the d1 treatment and d2 treatment at 850 nm were 0 39 and 0 32 respectively the spectral reflectance of the d1 treatment was 17 9 higher than that of the d2 treatment furthermore the reflectance of the w treatment exhibited an obvious disparity compared with the other treatments after the flowering stage previous studies have shown that the hyperspectral reflectance in the near infrared waveband is mainly determined by the crops leaf structure and healthy crops have a high reflectance in the near infrared waveband he et al 2013 the leaves begin to wither and deform when the winter wheat enters the senescence stage the leaf water content and chlorophyll content decrease the plant characteristics basically disappear in addition the effect of water stress intensifies the decomposition of the chlorophyll pigments the winter wheat chlorophyll spectra absorption valley disappears in the 400 600 nm bands during the ripening stage and the reflectance of the water absorption valley decreases in the 950 1050 nm bands fig 2d in the later stage the leaves of the winter wheat are completely dry and the physical and chemical properties no longer change then the total reflectance of the winter wheat gradually decreases to a minimum value and the soil background has a significant impact on the spectral changes thus the spectra exhibit similar characteristics to the soil this is caused by the yellowing of the leaves and the loss of sm wijewardana et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 3 2 changes in the red edge parameters under water stress the red edge parameters can better reflect the steep slope characteristics of the crop reflection spectra at 680 760 nm zhu et al 2014 to learn more about the response of the hyperspectral parameters to the sm changes we analyzed the first derivative spectra of the winter wheat canopy and the red edge parameters fig 3 shows the comparison between the first derivative reflectances of the winter wheat under water stress from the regreening to ripening stages the first derivatives of the spectra for the d1 and d2 treatments are approximately 0 0088 at 730 nm in the regreening stage moreover the first derivatives of the spectra of the four treatments reach the highest values at 730 750 nm in the jointing stage ranging from 0 01073 to 0 01346 however the first derivatives of the spectra of the four treatments decrease from the flowering to ripening stages and they are all less than 0 003 at 690 710 nm in the ripening stage previous studies have reported that the changes in the crop biomass leaf water content leaf area index canopy chlorophyll density and growth status are closely related to the red edge parameters fu et al 2014 huang et al 2009 ju et al 2010 liu et al 2004 thus as can be seen from fig 4 the reps of the maximum values of the d1 d2 and w treatments are relatively close from the beginning of the regreening stage to the beginning of the jointing stage in addition the rep of the w treatment is about 5 nm from 730 nm red shift the dr and sdr both decrease to different levels when the winter wheat is subjected to water stress fig 5 moreover when the water stress time was about 3 d the sdr values of the d1 and d2 treatments decreased by 16 1 and 22 4 respectively and their dr values decreases by 38 1 and 16 3 compared with the w treatment in the jointing and flowering stages when the water stress time of the d2 treatment reached about 20 d the sdr and dr values were 58 2 and 24 8 lower than those of the w treatment in the ripening stage respectively in general the longer the winter wheat was subjected to water stress the lower the water holding capacity was in the field with the red edge parameters exhibiting blue shift notably the red edge changes of the winter wheat under water stress were more obvious from the flowering to ripening stages thus the red edge parameters can be effectively used during this period to monitor and evaluate the water status of winter wheat 3 3 correlations between spectral indices and sm the spectral reflectance data for the canopy obtained via remote sensing are the result of numerous contributing factors including leaves stems soil scatter and other sources of spectra li et al 2014b in our study nine related spectral indices were identified as parameters correlated with the sm and they were used to further determine the optimal spectral indices for reducing the effect of the soil background and unrelated spectra fig 6 shows that the sm is significantly negatively correlated with the msi and osavi at all soil depths in addition the correlation between the sm and wi is not significant for all depths compared with the other spectral indices with correlation coefficients r of 0 11 0 35 p 0 05 in contrast the nsri is more valuable and sensitive for detecting the sm with r values of 0 57 0 72 p 0 01 the spectral indices composed of the red edge and the shoulder of the nir wavebands are better at detecting the sm than the other indices after the jointing stage li et al 2014b however there are some differences in the nsri for detecting the sm at different soil depths the correlations weaken after 10 20 cm especially at 30 40 cm but are still obviously higher than those of the other spectral indices overall the nsri has a good relationship with the sm at different soil depths 3 4 evaluation of optimized spectral indices based on plsr to test the stability of the nsri for retrieving the sm at soil depths of 0 40 cm an illustration of the evaluation results is shown in fig 7 each meeting point of every pair of wavelengths on the plot corresponds to the r2 values of the relationship between the sm and nsri then the r2 was calculated from the reflectance values from 700 to 1100 nm fig 7 shows that the sensitive wavebands for detecting the sm at soil depths of 0 40 cm are 760 800 nm 810 850 nm 860 950 nm and 980 1100 nm to evaluate the effect of these sensitive wavebands at retrieving the sm the r2 and rmse values were calculated for the plsr models the r2 and rmse values of these plsr models for both the calibration and validation are presented in table 3 in addition each model also includes various numbers of plsr factors in the independent validation the plsr model based on 860 950 nm has the highest accuracy r2 0 69 and rmse 0 79 followed by plsr model based on 810 850 nm r2 0 52 rmse 1 23 plsr model based on 760 800 nm r2 0 41 and rmse 1 46 and plsr model based on 980 1100 nm r2 0 30 rmse 1 51 although the plsr model based on 980 1100 nm had the lowest accuracy it can still be used to retrieve the sm effectively according to the above accuracy analysis these sensitive wavebands all have a good potential to form the optimized nsri thus we chose the specific sensitive waveband combinations of these waveband ranges to form the optimized nsri and used the r2 values to assess the spectral behavior table 4 the r2 values were 0 86 0 92 0 88 0 94 0 83 0 88 and 0 86 0 90 for soil depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm respectively overall the optimized nsri composed of the sensitive waveband combinations has a higher accuracy for retrieving the sm at soil depths of 0 40 cm 3 5 development and validation of spectral index models for retrieving the sm at different depths in this study the optimized nsri composed of the sensitive waveband combinations was calculated from the measured spectra data for the winter wheat under normal irrigation in the regreening stage the three spectral methods and the mlr method were used to establish spectral index models nsri nsri logarithmic nsri for retrieving the sm at different soil depths a previous study reported that the root length of winter wheat in the 0 40 cm soil layer accounts for 90 of the root system liu et al 2008 therefore we mainly established the three types of spectral index models for retrieving the sm at soil depths of 0 40 cm tables 5 7 the results of the various error indices i e r2 relative error re and rmse were used to evaluate the accuracies of the nsri nsri and logarithmic nsri spectral index models for retrieving the sm in the regreening stage fig 8 the results demonstrate that the accuracy of the model established using the original spectra is low compared with those of the other models with r2 0 34 and rmse 1 44 the retrieval results of the nsri model are better than the results of the nsri model r2 0 72 rmse 0 81 while the accuracy of the nsri model is still lower than that of the logarithmic nsri model r2 0 88 rmse 0 17 thus the logarithmic nsri model was used to accurately retrieve the sm when the winter wheat was subjected to water stress in the jointing stage fig 8 shows that at 10 20 cm the model has the highest accuracy with r2 0 92 and rmse 0 18 the accuracies of the sm retrieval at depths of 0 10 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm were also reliable with r2 values of 0 81 0 88 and 0 90 respectively in summary the logarithmic nsri model produced the highest accuracy sm for the winter wheat during this section thus the logarithmic nsri model was used to retrieve the sm in the flowering stage under water stress and in the ripening stage under normal irrigation fig 9 shows the measured data and the retrieved results at soil depths of 0 40 cm obtained using the logarithmic nsri model from the flowering to ripening stages the dots are much closer to the 1 1 line r2 0 85 consequently the spectral index models based on the optimized nsri and the logarithmic nsri spectral method greatly improve the accuracy of the sm retrieval for winter wheat during the regreening ripening stages under water stress 4 discussion the field data collection of sm and winter wheat canopy spectra from different treatments during the growing season were conducted in jiaozhou qingdao china in 2019 this allowed us to assess the accuracy of using the red edge parameters to monitor winter wheat growth status under water stress from the regreening to ripening stages the spectral data collected from the regreening to jointing stages were used to establish and validate the spectral index models the optimized spectral index models were found to accurately retrieve the sm of winter wheat under water stress from the flowering to ripening stages previous studies have documented the potential of using the red edge parameters shown in figs 4 and 5 as water indicators for monitoring winter wheat growth stages under water stress peng et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 the reason for this is that water stress affects the reflection absorption and transmission of the incident light by the crop canopy sun et al 2020 the red edge parameters calculated from the red edge region can accurately capture the changes in the canopy s reflectance under water stress because there is an obvious change in the reflectance in this region compared with other wavebands zhu et al 2014 thus the stress status can be quickly determined by analyzing the changes in the red edge parameters sun et al 2020 moreover the rep of the d2 treatment had a greater wavelength than that of the d1 treatment in the jointing stage this is due to the fact that the former had a denser canopy than the latter which is consistent with the actual winter wheat canopy growing situation observed on the ground in our experiment the dr and sdr of the winter wheat in the w treatment were higher than those of the d1 and d2 treatments by about 16 1 and 11 9 and by about 38 1 and 8 3 respectively in the jointing stage similar differences were found in the flowering and ripening stages of the winter wheat which is consistent with the results of he et al 2013 this indicates that the leaf water content can affect the spectral reflectance changes in the red edge region liu et al 2014 thus based on this mechanism it is effective to monitor the water stress status of winter wheat during the growth stages using the red edge parameters calculated from the red edge region the abilities of the nine spectral indices calculated from the vis nir to retrieve the sm were separately tested by analyzing the correlation the nsri was selected as the most sensitive spectral index for retrieving the sm it is found in the nir shoulder region at around 810 950 nm the nsri has a higher correlation with the sm and is 51 4 higher than the wi and ndii fig 6 in this study the performance of the nsri in the 700 1100 nm bands for retrieving the sm at soil depths of 0 40 cm was also explored fig 7 since there is abundant spectral information in the 700 1100 nm bands the plsr was used to identify the useful sensitive wavebands the plsr provides a regression model of considering weight allocation in the entire spectral dataset li et al 2014b the 700 1100 nm band ranges of the nsri were loaded as the main latent waveband variables in this study the high loading values focused on the red edge region 760 800 nm the nir shoulder region 810 850 nm and 860 950 nm and approximately 1000 nm 980 1100 nm in the latent variables for all of the plsr models for retrieving the sm table 3 the r2 values of the plsr models based on 760 800 nm and 980 1100 nm were lower during the calibration and validation relative to the other wavebands the plsr model based on 860 950 nm had the highest accuracy during the calibration and validation the r2 of the 860 950 nm model was 23 6 41 7 56 5 and 40 6 higher than those of the 760 800 nm and 980 1100 nm models during the calibration and validation thus the results confirm that the four band regions especially in the nir shoulder and water absorption waveband accurately retrieve the sm li et al 2014b meingast et al 2014 in the process of exploring the use of the spectral index of two band combinations to retrieve the sm we established models using three spectral methods nsri nsri logarithmic nsri and mlr tables 5 7 it was found that the spectral index models based on the optimized nsri and the three spectral methods improve the retrieval accuracy especially the spectral index models based on the logarithmic nsri fig 8 the average r2 for the logarithmic nsri model increased by 35 8 the rmse and re decreased by 62 7 and 51 3 respectively compared to the original nsri spectral model however the accuracy of the logarithmic nsri model in the jointing stage was lower than that in the regreening stage r2 0 69 and rmse 0 84 this is because the leaf structure under water stress results in lower spectral reflectance values chen et al 2007 additionally owing to the accumulation of leaf biomass the precisions of the sm retrieval in the flowering and ripening stages were further improved by applying the logarithmic nsri model fig 9 therefore the general model for retrieving the sm can also be adjusted for other crops under water stress in each growth stage in a further study however it is important to emphasize that limited research has been devoted to retrieving the sm of crops using the red edge parameters or spectral indices under various stresses thus it is still necessary to investigate the applicability of the spectral index models for retrieving the sm when crops are under other stresses e g temperature disease nitrogen content and soil salinity 5 conclusions this study presents an evaluation of using the red edge parameters as winter wheat water stress indicators to monitor the changes in the spectral characteristics and winter wheat growth status under water stress in addition the correlations between the sm and spectral indices were explored and optimized spectral index models for accurately retrieving the sm were established the results of this study reveal that the variations in the red edge parameters can be used to monitor winter wheat under water stress during the regreening ripening stages the responses of the red edge parameters of winter wheat under water stress are more sensitive in the jointing and flowering stages than during the other growth stages because of the changes in the leaf reflectance in addition the nsri calculated from the nir shoulder region was selected as the most optimal index for retrieving the sm at depths of 0 40 cm compared with the other spectral indices and red edge parameters thus the three types of spectral index models nsri nsri and logarithmic nsri established using the optimized nsri composed of 760 800 nm 810 850 nm 860 950 nm and 980 1100 nm can significantly improve the sm retrieval accuracy at depths of 0 40 cm for winter wheat during the regreening and jointing stages the results of the logarithmic nsri model for retrieving the sm during the flowering stage and ripening stage are also reliable at soil depths of 0 40 cm r2 0 85 further studies of spectral index models are required to evaluate a wider range of factors and to combine advanced machine learning techniques together with spectral indices and environmental factors such as precipitation soil temperature and wind speed to improve the sm retrieving capability of the spectral index models throughout the growth stages moreover additional quantitative experiments should be set up to study the impact of drought stress due to soil moisture deficit on winter wheat

9720,soil moisture sm is an important indicator of the photosynthetic rate and growth status of crops a few related parameters such as the red edge parameters and spectral indices have been adopted for retrieving the sm of winter wheat to further study their abilities to detect the sm field scale water stress experiments on winter wheat were conducted during the 2018 19 growing season the spectral ratio index in the near infrared nir shoulder region nsri 700 1100 nm was selected by comparing the correlations between the sm and the red edge parameters and spectral indices and it was optimized using the partial least squares regression plsr method to assess the performance of the sensitive wavebands of the nsri in retrieving the sm three types of spectral index models were established using multiple linear regression mlr for the winter wheat from the jointing to the ripening stage the results indicate that the red edge parameters are more sensitive to the spectral variation during the jointing and flowering stages the sensitivity decreased with increasing water stress the red edge area sdr of winter wheat irrigated in the flowering stage d1 treatment and irrigated in the jointing stage d2 treatment decreased by 20 30 respectively in general all of the parameters and indices were correlated with the surface sm 0 40 cm depth especially for the nsri with a significant coefficient of determination r2 of 0 52 in the 10 20 cm depth interval p 0 01 moreover all of the spectral index models based on the optimized nsri have good capabilities for retrieving the sm in the jointing stage the model for one derivative of the logarithm of the nsri logarithmic nsri performed best with r2 and root mean square error rmse values of 0 81 0 92 and 0 17 0 89 respectively finally the logarithmic nsri model was used to retrieve the sm in the flowering ripening stage r2 0 85 overall the optimized spectral index models can accurately and quickly retrieve the sm and can assist in predicting the effect of drought on the crop yield in the future graphical abstract ga1 keywords hyperspectral data water stress winter wheat soil moisture spectral indices 1 introduction winter wheat is one of the main grain crops in china and its planting area accounts for one fifth of the grain planting area ren et al 2006 wei et al 2021 soil moisture sm is regarded as a crucial property affecting the state of the agricultural water cycle over land kumar et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 with global warming and frequent heat waves drought has become much more serious in northern china especially during the growth stages of winter wheat bai et al 2020 ren et al 2021 xiao et al 2015 therefore accurately detecting the changes in the sm to predict the effect of drought on the yield plays a vital role during the growth stages of winter wheat zha et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 in general the degree of winter wheat water stress is judged based on the soil water status and is represented by the sm oltra carrio et al 2015 zhu et al 2020 traditional methods of measuring the sm are based on site scale or local surveys however these are often limited by labor and resources recently hyperspectral technology has been developed to retrieve the sm due to its high spectral resolution timely inexpensive and non destructive characteristics peng et al 2020 yang et al 2019 hyperspectral sensors acquire more than 100 contiguous spectral bands with a narrow bandwidth 5 10 nm in the 500 2500 nm wavelength region to collect spectral information peng et al 2013 providing an opportunity to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the growth status of winter wheat and the changes in the sm zou et al 2018 the visible near infrared vis nir region is a special region used to extract the spectral information about winter wheat and to monitor changes in the sm peng et al 2013 there is an abrupt leaf reflectance change between 680 nm and 780 nm in the vegetation spectra caused by the combined effects of strong chlorophyll absorption and internal scattering in the leaves which has been proven to be more sensitive to the physiological changes in winter wheat zhu et al 2014 in addition researchers have reported that the red edge region provides more accurate information for assessing the effect of the changes in the sm on the winter wheat in the development stages zhang et al 2015 the most widely applied indices in the red edge region are the red edge parameters such as the red edge position rep red edge amplitude dr and red edge area sdr wu et al 2014 these red edge parameters can be adopted to accurately monitor the growth status of winter wheat and the degree of water stress of the farmland gu et al 2008 xu et al 2018 unfortunately the red edge parameters extracted from ground spectra tend to suffer from the influence of soil background and environmental noise to better extract the spectral feature information about the vegetation and soil researchers proposed several hyperspectral indices related to the feature extraction including the water index wi normalized difference water index ndwi normalized difference infrared index ndii simple ratio water index srwi moisture stress index msi spectral ratio index in the nir shoulder region nsri optimized soil adjusted vegetation index osavi and depth water index dwi chai and chen 2017 lees et al 2019 liang et al 2015 liu et al 2014 2016 pasqualotto et al 2018 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2015 xiao et al 2014 these hyperspectral indices are sensitive in detecting moisture changes and are frequently used to retrieve the sm in different ecosystems e g agriculture forests and grassland casas et al 2014 peng et al 2013 yi et al 2014 all of the above mentioned hyperspectral indices and red edge parameters make use of narrow hyperspectral bands thus to improve the availability of these narrow hyperspectral bands plsr has been effectively applied to reduce the multicollinearity and over fitting in the spectral wavebands it optimally chooses a suitable number of principal components and deletes the noise wavebands compared to stepwise linear regression analysis fu et al 2014 in recent years the plsr method has been used to detect and retrieve the sm wu et al 2018 applied the plsr method to retrieve the soil water content of saline soils by analyzing the original measured and first order derivative spectra gou et al 2020 established estimation models of the purple soil moisture content using the plsr method and vis nir spectroscopy overall many previous studies have focused on exploring the relationships between the sm and the soil features utilizing plsr models based on reflectance however limited research has been conducted to explore the relationships between the sm and the spectral indices in the red edge or nir shoulder region in addition a greater number of the sensitive wavebands in the red edge or nir shoulder region can also be identified using the plsr method to improve the accuracy of the sm retrieval in this study we aimed to establish accurate sm retrieval models for winter wheat combined with optimized spectral indices selected by analyzing the sensitive region of winter wheat under water stress using red edge parameters the specific objectives of this study were 1 to analyze the response of the spectral reflectance and red edge parameters in the main growth stages of winter wheat under water stress 2 to optimize the spectral indices in the red edge or nir shoulder region based on plsr and 3 to improve the accuracy of spectral index models for retrieving the sm at depths of 0 40 cm using multiple linear regression mlr and the optimized spectral indices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in jiaozhou 36 00 36 30 n 119 37 120 12 e jiaozhou is located in the southwestern part of the shandong peninsula with an area of 539 km2 fig s1 it is located in the northern temperate monsoon area and is close to the yellow sea huang et al 2018 song et al 2015 therefore it has the characteristics of monsoon and marine climates with an annual average precipitation and temperature of 485 4 mm and 13 6 c respectively song et al 2015 the jiaozhou area is characterized by abundant light rain and heat in the same season and a long frost free period this region is suitable for growing various crops such as winter wheat corn and soybeans 2 2 experiment the experiment on the water stress of winter wheat was conducted in a water saving irrigation field in the modern agricultural science and technology demonstration park of qingdao agricultural university qingdao the experiment was conducted over four winter wheat growing stages i e the regreening jointing flowering and ripening stages table s1 there were nine plots in the test site namely a i the size of each plot was 13 m 5 m the distance between neighboring plots was 0 5 m with a 1 2 m deep waterproof layer installed to prevent water exchange between the plots the seeding and harvest dates for this growing season were october 20 2018 and june 10 2019 respectively in addition we followed local crop management practices to control pests diseases and weeds and to keep each plot uniform in terms of water treatments two irrigation levels were determined as sufficient 6 m3 and deficit 3 m3 according to the seasonal water demands of winter wheat in this region table 1 fig 1 shows the growth status of the winter wheat with sufficient irrigation from the regreening to ripening stages plots d and i were irrigated with sufficient water in the jointing and flowering stages w treatment plots b and g were not irrigated in the jointing stage and they were irrigated with approximately 3 m3 of water in the flowering stage d1 treatment plots a and e were not irrigated in the flowering stage and they were irrigated with approximately 3 m3 of water in the jointing stage d2 treatment in addition reirrigation was conducted for the d1 and d2 treatments in the other growth stages of the winter wheat to keep it consistent with the w treatment plots c f and h were not irrigated throughout the entire growth period except for water from natural rainwater r treatment 2 3 datasets the hyperspectral reflectance measurements were collected using a high resolution full range svc hr 768i spectroradiometer spectra vista co usa between 10 00 and 14 00 local time the measurements were obtained under clear sky conditions to minimize variations in the solar angle and canopy shadows the spectroradiometer acquired measurements have spectral sampling intervals of 1 5 nm 7 6 nm and 5 nm in the 350 1000 nm 1000 1890 nm and 1890 2500 nm bands respectively according to the weather and time conditions on march 17 april 22 may 18 and june 9 in 2019 which corresponded to the regreening stage jointing stage flowering stage and ripening stage respectively a total of four measurements were conducted we used a spectroradiometer with a 4 field of view fov to take top of canopy spectral measurements from 1 m above the canopy covering the winter wheat canopy vertically downward in the nadir orientation during each observation for optimization purpose and to reduce the possible effects of the sky and field conditions we took the spectral measurements of a white calibration target 10 times and averaged it for each plot the dark current and spectral white reference panel measurements were obtained every 5 min in the experiment 6 data samples were separately collected for the w d1 and d2 treatments and 9 data samples were collected for the r treatment per stage from the regreening to ripening stage thus a total of 108 data samples were obtained in the four growth stages then the correction function in the viewspecpro software was used to make preliminary corrections to remove outliers with spectral reflectances greater than 1 0 the savitzky golay filter was applied to denoise the hyperspectral data and then the smoothed spectral data were averaged the in situ sm measurements were collected with a portable time domain reflectometry tdr sm probe trime pico 64 imko ettlingen germany equipped with a data reader hd2 imko germany tdr sensor is an electronic device that works on the principle of radar by transmitting signals into the medium which is soil and collecting the reflected signals it measures the dielectric constant and consequently the permittivity and water content of the soil via wave propagation transmitted by two parallel embedded metal probes with great accuracy biase et al 2021 the sm is then calculated and displayed by the reading system through the analog voltage output in addition sm data were collected on march 14 april 19 may 15 and june 6 in 2019 the dates for the sm data collection were close to the dates for the hyperspectral measurements from the regreening stage to the ripening stage the sm measurements were also collected four times during the winter wheat growth stages the sm data were collected at eight soil depths 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm 40 50 cm 50 60 cm 60 70 cm and 70 80 cm from the center of each plot a i thus 8 data samples were collected in each plot and 72 data samples were obtained in the entire field we collected a total of 288 sm data samples in the four growth stages then the moving average filter was used to eliminate the sm data sample outliers 2 4 methodology 2 4 1 red edge parameters the rep dr and sdr were used to evaluate the vegetation status ju et al 2010 wu et al 2014 the rep is the wavelength corresponding to the maximum value of the first derivative of the spectra in the 680 760 nm bands the dr is the first order differential value when the wavelength is in the position of the red edge the sdr is the area enclosed by the first derivative of the spectra between 680 and 760 nm the first derivative is calculated using the first order differential transformation of the reflectance spectra dawson et al 1998 1 ρ λ i ρ λ i 1 ρ λ i 1 2 δ λ where λ is the wavelength of each waveband ρ λ i is the first order differential value of the wavelength and λ is the interval from λ 1 to λ i 2 4 2 spectral indices the spectral indices can be used to explore the correlation between the sm and the spectral reflectance these indices were established using the reflectance at sensitive wavelengths and were used to detect variations in the sm in this study several representative spectral indices including wi ndwi ndii srwi msi nsri osavi and dwi were applied to test their correlations with the sm the specific formulas for calculating the spectral indices from the ground spectral reflectance are presented in table 2 the most sensitive spectral indices and the optimized waveband combinations were determined by analyzing the results of the spectral indices correlations and two dimensional 2d plots the spectral indices can effectively eliminate background noise and mixed signals and they also have significantly more sensitivity than a single band oltra carrio et al 2015 these indices have been used to retrieve the soil surface moisture and for detecting winter wheat under water stress cheng et al 2013 2 4 3 partial least squares regression the plsr method is a widely used technique for reducing a large number of collinear spectral variables to a few non correlated latent variables or specifying factors fu et al 2014 li et al 2014b compared with the effect of reducing the dimension of the principal component regression pcr the plsr can automatically select relevant variables and perform decomposition of two spectra chun and keleş 2010 the aim of plsr is to build a linear model as follows geladi and kowalski 1986 1 y x β ε where y is the mean centered vector of a dependent variable x is the mean centered matrix of the independent variables β is the matrix of the regression coefficients and ε is the matrix of the residuals 2 4 4 multiple linear regression mlr has been frequently used to predict soil attributes zhang et al 2019 it assumes that the remotely sensed independent variables are linearly related to the samples in addition the mlr algorithm requires the specification of several parameters and the setting of these parameters impacts the results zhang et al 2019 in this study the spectral index models established using the optimized waveband combinations as parameters in the mlr greatly improved the accuracy of the sm retrieval of the winter wheat during the growth stages 2 4 5 validation to select the optimal number of factors included in the plsr model we used the leave one out cross validation method rayo and hoteit 2012 the dataset was randomly divided into two sets 75 were used for construction in which n 40 samples were collected per stage from the regreening to jointing stages were used to elaborate the calibration regression models and 25 a validation set of n 14 samples collected per stage from the regreening to jointing stages were used to evaluate the sm estimation capacity of the developed models in each stage from the regreening to jointing stages finally the estimation performances of the regression models were evaluated using the determination coefficients r2 and the root mean square error rmse the r2 and rmse were calculated as follows 3 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 4 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n where n is number of samples xi is the measured moisture yi is the estimated moisture x and y are the mean values of xi and yi respectively 3 results 3 1 variation characteristics of the winter wheat canopy hyperspectral reflectance under water stress the canopy structure of winter wheat will change under different degrees of water stress during the growth stages chen et al 2007 because the water deficient stems and leaves impact the winter wheat canopy s spectra reflectance wang et al 2015 we chose the original values and the first order differential transformation of the spectra to accurately analyze the spectral characteristics of the winter wheat under water stress fig 2 shows the spectral reflectance of the winter wheat canopy under four water treatments from the regreening to ripening stages fig 2a shows the spectral reflectance curves of the winter wheat not subjected to water stress in the regreening stage the differences in the four types of spectral reflectance are not large between 950 and 1050 nm in addition owing to the absorption of the water the spectral reflection curve fluctuates greatly in this waveband with the water absorption trough appearing at 970 nm fig 2b shows the reflectance ranges 700 900 nm during the jointing stage which is higher than those during the other growth stages at this time the d1 treatment was under water stress but the d2 and w treatments were under normal irrigation the winter wheat reflectance of the water controlled treatment in the jointing stage was greatly affected by water stress in the near infrared waveband 750 1350 nm the spectral reflectances of the four treatments reached the highest value at 850 nm the spectral reflectances of the d1 treatment and w treatment were 0 51 and 0 63 respectively the spectral reflectance of the d1 treatment was 19 0 lower than that of the w treatment moreover similar characteristics can be seen in fig 2c after the jointing stage the d1 treatment was retreated with normal irrigation while the d2 treatment has a water control status thus the spectral reflectances of the d1 treatment and d2 treatment at 850 nm were 0 39 and 0 32 respectively the spectral reflectance of the d1 treatment was 17 9 higher than that of the d2 treatment furthermore the reflectance of the w treatment exhibited an obvious disparity compared with the other treatments after the flowering stage previous studies have shown that the hyperspectral reflectance in the near infrared waveband is mainly determined by the crops leaf structure and healthy crops have a high reflectance in the near infrared waveband he et al 2013 the leaves begin to wither and deform when the winter wheat enters the senescence stage the leaf water content and chlorophyll content decrease the plant characteristics basically disappear in addition the effect of water stress intensifies the decomposition of the chlorophyll pigments the winter wheat chlorophyll spectra absorption valley disappears in the 400 600 nm bands during the ripening stage and the reflectance of the water absorption valley decreases in the 950 1050 nm bands fig 2d in the later stage the leaves of the winter wheat are completely dry and the physical and chemical properties no longer change then the total reflectance of the winter wheat gradually decreases to a minimum value and the soil background has a significant impact on the spectral changes thus the spectra exhibit similar characteristics to the soil this is caused by the yellowing of the leaves and the loss of sm wijewardana et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 3 2 changes in the red edge parameters under water stress the red edge parameters can better reflect the steep slope characteristics of the crop reflection spectra at 680 760 nm zhu et al 2014 to learn more about the response of the hyperspectral parameters to the sm changes we analyzed the first derivative spectra of the winter wheat canopy and the red edge parameters fig 3 shows the comparison between the first derivative reflectances of the winter wheat under water stress from the regreening to ripening stages the first derivatives of the spectra for the d1 and d2 treatments are approximately 0 0088 at 730 nm in the regreening stage moreover the first derivatives of the spectra of the four treatments reach the highest values at 730 750 nm in the jointing stage ranging from 0 01073 to 0 01346 however the first derivatives of the spectra of the four treatments decrease from the flowering to ripening stages and they are all less than 0 003 at 690 710 nm in the ripening stage previous studies have reported that the changes in the crop biomass leaf water content leaf area index canopy chlorophyll density and growth status are closely related to the red edge parameters fu et al 2014 huang et al 2009 ju et al 2010 liu et al 2004 thus as can be seen from fig 4 the reps of the maximum values of the d1 d2 and w treatments are relatively close from the beginning of the regreening stage to the beginning of the jointing stage in addition the rep of the w treatment is about 5 nm from 730 nm red shift the dr and sdr both decrease to different levels when the winter wheat is subjected to water stress fig 5 moreover when the water stress time was about 3 d the sdr values of the d1 and d2 treatments decreased by 16 1 and 22 4 respectively and their dr values decreases by 38 1 and 16 3 compared with the w treatment in the jointing and flowering stages when the water stress time of the d2 treatment reached about 20 d the sdr and dr values were 58 2 and 24 8 lower than those of the w treatment in the ripening stage respectively in general the longer the winter wheat was subjected to water stress the lower the water holding capacity was in the field with the red edge parameters exhibiting blue shift notably the red edge changes of the winter wheat under water stress were more obvious from the flowering to ripening stages thus the red edge parameters can be effectively used during this period to monitor and evaluate the water status of winter wheat 3 3 correlations between spectral indices and sm the spectral reflectance data for the canopy obtained via remote sensing are the result of numerous contributing factors including leaves stems soil scatter and other sources of spectra li et al 2014b in our study nine related spectral indices were identified as parameters correlated with the sm and they were used to further determine the optimal spectral indices for reducing the effect of the soil background and unrelated spectra fig 6 shows that the sm is significantly negatively correlated with the msi and osavi at all soil depths in addition the correlation between the sm and wi is not significant for all depths compared with the other spectral indices with correlation coefficients r of 0 11 0 35 p 0 05 in contrast the nsri is more valuable and sensitive for detecting the sm with r values of 0 57 0 72 p 0 01 the spectral indices composed of the red edge and the shoulder of the nir wavebands are better at detecting the sm than the other indices after the jointing stage li et al 2014b however there are some differences in the nsri for detecting the sm at different soil depths the correlations weaken after 10 20 cm especially at 30 40 cm but are still obviously higher than those of the other spectral indices overall the nsri has a good relationship with the sm at different soil depths 3 4 evaluation of optimized spectral indices based on plsr to test the stability of the nsri for retrieving the sm at soil depths of 0 40 cm an illustration of the evaluation results is shown in fig 7 each meeting point of every pair of wavelengths on the plot corresponds to the r2 values of the relationship between the sm and nsri then the r2 was calculated from the reflectance values from 700 to 1100 nm fig 7 shows that the sensitive wavebands for detecting the sm at soil depths of 0 40 cm are 760 800 nm 810 850 nm 860 950 nm and 980 1100 nm to evaluate the effect of these sensitive wavebands at retrieving the sm the r2 and rmse values were calculated for the plsr models the r2 and rmse values of these plsr models for both the calibration and validation are presented in table 3 in addition each model also includes various numbers of plsr factors in the independent validation the plsr model based on 860 950 nm has the highest accuracy r2 0 69 and rmse 0 79 followed by plsr model based on 810 850 nm r2 0 52 rmse 1 23 plsr model based on 760 800 nm r2 0 41 and rmse 1 46 and plsr model based on 980 1100 nm r2 0 30 rmse 1 51 although the plsr model based on 980 1100 nm had the lowest accuracy it can still be used to retrieve the sm effectively according to the above accuracy analysis these sensitive wavebands all have a good potential to form the optimized nsri thus we chose the specific sensitive waveband combinations of these waveband ranges to form the optimized nsri and used the r2 values to assess the spectral behavior table 4 the r2 values were 0 86 0 92 0 88 0 94 0 83 0 88 and 0 86 0 90 for soil depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm respectively overall the optimized nsri composed of the sensitive waveband combinations has a higher accuracy for retrieving the sm at soil depths of 0 40 cm 3 5 development and validation of spectral index models for retrieving the sm at different depths in this study the optimized nsri composed of the sensitive waveband combinations was calculated from the measured spectra data for the winter wheat under normal irrigation in the regreening stage the three spectral methods and the mlr method were used to establish spectral index models nsri nsri logarithmic nsri for retrieving the sm at different soil depths a previous study reported that the root length of winter wheat in the 0 40 cm soil layer accounts for 90 of the root system liu et al 2008 therefore we mainly established the three types of spectral index models for retrieving the sm at soil depths of 0 40 cm tables 5 7 the results of the various error indices i e r2 relative error re and rmse were used to evaluate the accuracies of the nsri nsri and logarithmic nsri spectral index models for retrieving the sm in the regreening stage fig 8 the results demonstrate that the accuracy of the model established using the original spectra is low compared with those of the other models with r2 0 34 and rmse 1 44 the retrieval results of the nsri model are better than the results of the nsri model r2 0 72 rmse 0 81 while the accuracy of the nsri model is still lower than that of the logarithmic nsri model r2 0 88 rmse 0 17 thus the logarithmic nsri model was used to accurately retrieve the sm when the winter wheat was subjected to water stress in the jointing stage fig 8 shows that at 10 20 cm the model has the highest accuracy with r2 0 92 and rmse 0 18 the accuracies of the sm retrieval at depths of 0 10 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm were also reliable with r2 values of 0 81 0 88 and 0 90 respectively in summary the logarithmic nsri model produced the highest accuracy sm for the winter wheat during this section thus the logarithmic nsri model was used to retrieve the sm in the flowering stage under water stress and in the ripening stage under normal irrigation fig 9 shows the measured data and the retrieved results at soil depths of 0 40 cm obtained using the logarithmic nsri model from the flowering to ripening stages the dots are much closer to the 1 1 line r2 0 85 consequently the spectral index models based on the optimized nsri and the logarithmic nsri spectral method greatly improve the accuracy of the sm retrieval for winter wheat during the regreening ripening stages under water stress 4 discussion the field data collection of sm and winter wheat canopy spectra from different treatments during the growing season were conducted in jiaozhou qingdao china in 2019 this allowed us to assess the accuracy of using the red edge parameters to monitor winter wheat growth status under water stress from the regreening to ripening stages the spectral data collected from the regreening to jointing stages were used to establish and validate the spectral index models the optimized spectral index models were found to accurately retrieve the sm of winter wheat under water stress from the flowering to ripening stages previous studies have documented the potential of using the red edge parameters shown in figs 4 and 5 as water indicators for monitoring winter wheat growth stages under water stress peng et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 the reason for this is that water stress affects the reflection absorption and transmission of the incident light by the crop canopy sun et al 2020 the red edge parameters calculated from the red edge region can accurately capture the changes in the canopy s reflectance under water stress because there is an obvious change in the reflectance in this region compared with other wavebands zhu et al 2014 thus the stress status can be quickly determined by analyzing the changes in the red edge parameters sun et al 2020 moreover the rep of the d2 treatment had a greater wavelength than that of the d1 treatment in the jointing stage this is due to the fact that the former had a denser canopy than the latter which is consistent with the actual winter wheat canopy growing situation observed on the ground in our experiment the dr and sdr of the winter wheat in the w treatment were higher than those of the d1 and d2 treatments by about 16 1 and 11 9 and by about 38 1 and 8 3 respectively in the jointing stage similar differences were found in the flowering and ripening stages of the winter wheat which is consistent with the results of he et al 2013 this indicates that the leaf water content can affect the spectral reflectance changes in the red edge region liu et al 2014 thus based on this mechanism it is effective to monitor the water stress status of winter wheat during the growth stages using the red edge parameters calculated from the red edge region the abilities of the nine spectral indices calculated from the vis nir to retrieve the sm were separately tested by analyzing the correlation the nsri was selected as the most sensitive spectral index for retrieving the sm it is found in the nir shoulder region at around 810 950 nm the nsri has a higher correlation with the sm and is 51 4 higher than the wi and ndii fig 6 in this study the performance of the nsri in the 700 1100 nm bands for retrieving the sm at soil depths of 0 40 cm was also explored fig 7 since there is abundant spectral information in the 700 1100 nm bands the plsr was used to identify the useful sensitive wavebands the plsr provides a regression model of considering weight allocation in the entire spectral dataset li et al 2014b the 700 1100 nm band ranges of the nsri were loaded as the main latent waveband variables in this study the high loading values focused on the red edge region 760 800 nm the nir shoulder region 810 850 nm and 860 950 nm and approximately 1000 nm 980 1100 nm in the latent variables for all of the plsr models for retrieving the sm table 3 the r2 values of the plsr models based on 760 800 nm and 980 1100 nm were lower during the calibration and validation relative to the other wavebands the plsr model based on 860 950 nm had the highest accuracy during the calibration and validation the r2 of the 860 950 nm model was 23 6 41 7 56 5 and 40 6 higher than those of the 760 800 nm and 980 1100 nm models during the calibration and validation thus the results confirm that the four band regions especially in the nir shoulder and water absorption waveband accurately retrieve the sm li et al 2014b meingast et al 2014 in the process of exploring the use of the spectral index of two band combinations to retrieve the sm we established models using three spectral methods nsri nsri logarithmic nsri and mlr tables 5 7 it was found that the spectral index models based on the optimized nsri and the three spectral methods improve the retrieval accuracy especially the spectral index models based on the logarithmic nsri fig 8 the average r2 for the logarithmic nsri model increased by 35 8 the rmse and re decreased by 62 7 and 51 3 respectively compared to the original nsri spectral model however the accuracy of the logarithmic nsri model in the jointing stage was lower than that in the regreening stage r2 0 69 and rmse 0 84 this is because the leaf structure under water stress results in lower spectral reflectance values chen et al 2007 additionally owing to the accumulation of leaf biomass the precisions of the sm retrieval in the flowering and ripening stages were further improved by applying the logarithmic nsri model fig 9 therefore the general model for retrieving the sm can also be adjusted for other crops under water stress in each growth stage in a further study however it is important to emphasize that limited research has been devoted to retrieving the sm of crops using the red edge parameters or spectral indices under various stresses thus it is still necessary to investigate the applicability of the spectral index models for retrieving the sm when crops are under other stresses e g temperature disease nitrogen content and soil salinity 5 conclusions this study presents an evaluation of using the red edge parameters as winter wheat water stress indicators to monitor the changes in the spectral characteristics and winter wheat growth status under water stress in addition the correlations between the sm and spectral indices were explored and optimized spectral index models for accurately retrieving the sm were established the results of this study reveal that the variations in the red edge parameters can be used to monitor winter wheat under water stress during the regreening ripening stages the responses of the red edge parameters of winter wheat under water stress are more sensitive in the jointing and flowering stages than during the other growth stages because of the changes in the leaf reflectance in addition the nsri calculated from the nir shoulder region was selected as the most optimal index for retrieving the sm at depths of 0 40 cm compared with the other spectral indices and red edge parameters thus the three types of spectral index models nsri nsri and logarithmic nsri established using the optimized nsri composed of 760 800 nm 810 850 nm 860 950 nm and 980 1100 nm can significantly improve the sm retrieval accuracy at depths of 0 40 cm for winter wheat during the regreening and jointing stages the results of the logarithmic nsri model for retrieving the sm during the flowering stage and ripening stage are also reliable at soil depths of 0 40 cm r2 0 85 further studies of spectral index models are required to evaluate a wider range of factors and to combine advanced machine learning techniques together with spectral indices and environmental factors such as precipitation soil temperature and wind speed to improve the sm retrieving capability of the spectral index models throughout the growth stages moreover additional quantitative experiments should be set up to study the impact of drought stress due to soil moisture deficit on winter wheat

9721,many options for reducing nitrogen n losses from agriculture rely on changing the surface pathways of n runoff in one way or another but the runoff n mechanism by agricultural interventions such as biochar grass and cross ridge is not well understood herein 12 artificial simulated rainstorms by three biochars 0 3 and 6 two planting modes conventional flat planting cross ridge and two underlying surfaces bare grass were designed to investigate the surface pathways of n loss and possible tradeoffs in loessial sloping lands under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity results indicate that i 3 and 6 biochar application can aggravate soil erosion on bare slope but planting grass on 0 or 3 biochar bare slope has good reduction effects on sediment and n loss while 6 belongs to excessive biochar on grassed slopes ii grass planting may decrease the loss fractions of particulate nitrogen pn more obviously than bare slope because it decreases the kinetic energy of raindrops slows the rate of water flow and improves the shear strength of soils with deep penetrating roots configuring cross ridge with 0 or 3 biochar on grassed slope can reduce pn fraction obviously but the interception of cross ridge on bare slope is limited and easy to fail iii the hydrological pathways transporting various n fractions vary greatly owing to the interaction of biochar grass and cross ridge runoff n from 10 15 and 20 bare slope materializes mainly in particulate fractions 65 58 50 15 and 60 46 while from grassed slope it occurs mainly in dissolved fractions 54 01 59 50 and 66 48 these findings may help provide new insights needed to enhance soil health and maintain agroecosystem sustainability through decreasing n losses via sloping farmland management in loess hilly and gully regions keywords particulate nitrogen dissolved nitrogen grass biochar cross ridge artificial simulated rainfall 1 introduction nitrogen n is often applied as a fertilizer to maintain adequate soil levels for crop production addy et al 2020 but n losses through surface runoff not only increase the cost of production but also increase the environmental risk of surface and ground water contamination hatfield and follett 2008 previous studies regarding the variability in n transport in cropping systems show that the loss of n varies greatly under different hydrological and underlying surface conditions yan et al 2014 however these research mainly focus on reducing the loss of n in runoff erosion leaching and denitrification by single management practice chu et al 2014 there are few studies on the effect of various agricultural interventions such as biochar grass and planting modes on runoff n processes wu et al 2018b understanding the hydrological pathways transporting the various n fractions is a main challenge in developing appropriate management practices for the sustainability of sloping farmland which is also the key knowledge gap between the possible tradeoffs of runoff n fractions and the targeted conservation practices in the loess plateau rainfed agroecosystems to prevent excess losses of n into the surrounding environment it is important to curtail transport processes runoff erosion leaching and gaseous losses so that applied and residual n sources within the soil crop system are not lost but remain where needed for crop use malik et al 2020 best management practices bmps are methods and practices for preventing or reducing diffuse pollution to a level compatible with water quality goals briak et al 2019 bmps can be classified as structural vegetative or management and each class is somewhat more effective in controlling certain types of diffuse pollution than others uniyal et al 2020 for instance biochar has characteristics of a large number of organic functional groups rich pore structure large specific surface area strong adsorption and stability sun et al 2017 which can be used as an important soil amendment product to increase soil organic matter and improve soil ecosystems s wang et al 2020 z q wang et al 2020 when selecting bmps it is important that the pollutants and the forms in which they are transported are known mtibaa et al 2018 it is also important to realize that bmps are not necessarily synonymous with resource management systems or conservation treatments igras and creed 2020 however there is relatively little information comparing different environmentally friendly bmp combinations for limiting n migration yoder et al 2020 thus it is of great practical significance to explore the effective configuration of agricultural management practices on n and on sediment reduction yu et al 2018 which is of vital importance for the linkage between changes in agricultural practices and effects in n transport control of loessial sloping farmland precipitation drives the processes that generate diffuse pollution rajapakse et al 2010 at present the methods to obtain soil n or p loss data mainly include laboratory or field studies under simulated rainfall and runoff plots under natural rainfall imdad and rafique 2019 unlike natural rainfall the use of rainfall simulators in fields or laboratories can eliminate many interference factors it has many advantages in controlling drop size intensity test conditions length and width to runoff flume fast results standardization etc wu et al 2021b more importantly it is essential to clearly define the issue to be investigated and the accuracy of the required answer when choosing a measurement system todisco et al 2012 therefore laboratory studies with simulated rainstorms were designed to quantify the surface pathways of n loss and the effects of agricultural management practices on the possible tradeoffs of particulate and dissolved n fractions from loessial sloping lands this is critical to testing hypotheses regarding the roles of agricultural interventions such as biochar grass and cross ridge in the surface pathways of n loss and in developing effective management strategies for mitigating unacceptably high n inputs to receiving waters the objectives of this study are to i quantify the effects of various agricultural interventions such as biochar grass and cross ridge on particulate and dissolved n fractions of loessial sloping lands under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity ii elucidate the mechanism of biochar grass and cross ridge on the surface pathways of runoff nitrogen and possible tradeoffs iii optimize the design of targeted and sustainable agricultural interventions to minimize n losses in overland flow our findings may provide scientific guidance for further understanding the mechanism of n reduction in sloping farmlands and optimizing appropriate countermeasures for different n loss pathways in the rain fed agroecosystems of the loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 runoff flume and simulated rainfall three groups of runoff flumes with variable slope 10 15 and 20 were designed 2 m length 1 m width 0 45 m height each of which are divided into two parts from the middle and conventional flat planting and horizontal ridge planting were set separately fig 1 the v shaped outlet is installed in one short side of the runoff flume and the 10 cm free plate is installed in the other three sides of the runoff flume to prevent soil from splashing out under the strike of raindrops and small circular holes are evenly drilled at the bottom of the runoff flume to facilitate the free downward leakage of soil moisture the simulated rainfall was conducted in the artificial simulated rainfall hall of the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau from may to october 2019 the side spray automatic rainfall simulation system with the rainfall height of 16 m was adopted in this study to make all rainfall raindrops reach the reasonable terminal speed the range of rainfall intensity in the system is 40 260 mm h 1 the rainfall uniformity is 80 and the maximum rainfall duration is 12 h zheng and zhao 2004 according to the statistical probability of maximum rainfall in different periods the rainstorm with maximum rainfall of 60 mm in 60 min easily occurs on the loess plateau an et al 2021 therefore 60 mm h 1 was selected as the designed rainfall intensity in this study and the total rainfall volume was set as 90 mm in each rainstorm event the corresponding rainfall duration was 90 min two repetitions with a total of 12 rainstorm events were determined in this rainfall test table 1 there were 6 treatments for each rainstorm event and a total of 72 scenarios before each rainfall five point method was used to calibrate rainfall intensity and ensure that the rainfall uniformity reached 80 then the rainstorm test was conducted when the measured soil moisture was approximately 10 2 2 biochar perennial ryegrass and tested loessial soil biochar used in this experiment comprising the sawdust black carbon obtained from apple branch by pyrolysis at 600 using a particle size mesh of 80 400 was provided by shaanxi yixin bioenergy technology development co ltd wu et al 2021a perennial ryegrass a perennial herb with well developed fibrous roots thin stems and hollow upright and linear leaves was sown by drilling method with the planting density of 20 g m 2 and row spacing of 10 cm according to the local growth and distribution of local grass in ansai county so that the grass coverage was basically the same in each flume approximately 80 the tested loessial soil was collected from ansai county yan an city subsequent to its retrieval the soil was dried by natural air and debris were removed through a 10 mm sieve the physicochemical properties of the tested loessial soil are as follows antecedent soil moisture is 6 8 ph value is 7 6 soil particle compositions are 11 62 clay 0 002 mm 65 1 silt 0 002 0 05 mm and 23 74 sand 0 05 mm the original tn content of the loessial soil is 0 43 g kg 1 but needed to be controlled at 1 4 g kg 1 in this test the chemical fertilizer was dissolved by the required amount of hydrating water and was evenly sprayed on the soil by a sprayer to replenish n and maintain the initial soil water content of about 10 wang et al 2014 after that 0 3 and 6 biochars mass percent were each mixed with soil by an electric mixer then sealed and left for 24 h to form the tested fertile soil for standby after the soil was mixed evenly the runoff flume for filling the tested soil was adjusted to the level the layered loading method was adopted to ensure the soil bulk density of the tested soil reaches 1 2 0 2 g cm 3 han et al 2011 first we covered it with permeable gauze to ensure uniform infiltration of water and 5 cm thick natural fine sand was layered at the flume bottom then the rest were filled with a thickness of 10 cm per layer with a total of 4 layers for the runoff flume with horizontal ridge measures the size of the horizontal ridge is 5 cm ridge height 10 cm ridge width and 10 cm ridge spacing 2 3 runoff testing and statistical analyses the time when the water flows in a continuous form from the v shaped outlet of runoff flume was recorded as the initial runoff generation time the sampling method was once every 1 min interval in the first 20 min and then once every 10 min until the end of rainfall the sampling time was 1 min at the end of the test the volume and weight of water samples in each bucket were weighed and 50 ml runoff samples were taken from each bucket with polyethylene bottles runoff samples were taken back to the laboratory for chemical analysis the remaining water samples were dried in the oven 120 c then weighed and the amount of sediment yield in proportion was calculated total nitrogen tn and dissolved total nitrogen dn which is operationally defined as n that can pass through 0 45 µm membranes were both measured by uv spectrophotometry method combined with alkaline potassium persulfate digestion and centrifugation gb11893 89 finally the particulate total nitrogen pn concentration was calculated by subtracting dn concentration from tn concentration excel 2019 was used for data statistics and chart making and paired samples t test student s t test based on spss 23 0 statistical product and service solutions software were employed to determine significant differences between the means of two samples 3 results 3 1 sediment yield processes the sediment yield process of ck m5 on the 10 bare slope is similar to that of 15 bare slope fig 2 that is the sediment yield rate increases first and then decreases at the initial stage of runoff generation and then tends to be stable after 20 min but the only difference is that the fluctuation of sediment yield on 10 bare slope lasts longer the uniform convergence of sediment yield rate in each treatment decreases gradually in the later stage of rainfall with the increase of slope gradient for instance the sediment yield rate of m2 m5 at 20 bare slope does not decrease all the time but grows wavily in the later stage of rainfall this can be attributed to the fact that the temporary crust soil on the slope with 3 and 6 biochar is relatively loose owing to the physicochemical properties of biochar which is easily damaged by the developed rill erosion under steep slope the initial sediment yield amount of ck m5 was 7 78 3 02 25 62 4 23 36 61 and 6 73 g at 10 slope respectively and the decreasing order was m4 m2 ck m5 m3 m1 indicating that the horizontal ridge could effectively intercept sediment at the initial stage of runoff generation because the initial sediment yield amount of horizontal ridge was less than that of conventional flat planting under the same biochar application moreover the initial sediment yield amount increased with the increase of biochar content under the same tillage method indicating that increasing the biochar content from 3 to 6 increased the risk of soil erosion of bare slope compared with the bare slope the variation ranges of sediment yield rate of 10 15 and 20 grassed slopes m6 m9 m11 except m10 are all less than those of ck m5 and the variation range also fluctuates slightly with the increase of slope angle indicating that ryegrass planting can effectively mitigate the adverse impact of soil erosion caused by steep slope under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity however the sediment yield rate of m10 increased dramatically with the increase of slope angle and was even higher than that of m4 at 20 slope indicating that the effect of grassed slope with high dosage of biochar on slope erosion control was very poor and even an aggravating risk of erosion potential 3 2 tn loss processes tn loss concentration under different management practices at three slopes of 10 15 and 20 first decreased and then stabilized with the extension of rainfall duration fig 3 on the 10 slope tn loss concentration of m4 m5 m10 and m11 was relatively high during the whole rainfall period and that of m4 was higher than m5 and m10 was higher than that of m11 indicating that horizontal ridge has better performance on reducing runoff and sediment than conventional flat planting and 6 biochar may be the excessive biochar that can aggravate n loss on the 15 slope although the tn loss concentrations of m4 and m5 were still relatively high the tn loss concentration of m10 was higher than that of the bare slope and the initial tn loss concentration of m10 was 88 54 mg l 1 3 67 times that of m6 and 16 07 times that of ck however tn loss concentration of grassed slope with 3 biochar was lower than that of bare slope i e the tn loss concentrations of m8 and m9 were 22 53 mg l 1 and 15 59 mg l 1 respectively while tn loss concentrations of m3 and m4 were 30 98 and 19 71 mg l 1 indicating that grass can reduce the risk of tn loss caused by steepness slope and biochar addition 3 but the effect of the grassed slope with 6 biochar on reducing tn loss may be weakened or even fail on the 20 slope although the tn loss concentrations of m4 and m5 were still higher than that of other bare slopes tn loss concentrations of m10 and m11 were higher than that of bare slope and the initial tn loss concentration of m10 was 171 67 mg l 1 which is 2 72 times than that of m4 the initial tn loss concentration of m11 was 128 86 mg l 1 which is 1 71 times than that of m5 tn loss trend of bare slope with 3 and 6 biochar was much higher than that of 0 biochar under 20 slope indicating that 3 and 6 biochar could aggravate the risk of tn loss on bare slope with the increase of slope gradient tn loss trend of 3 biochar was similar to that of 0 biochar under ryegrass slope indicating that grass could reduce the potential of tn loss caused by steepness slope and 3 biochar further 3 biochar under grassed slope may be the critical biochar content for tn loss similar to 0 biochar and 6 biochar may be excessive in biochar content because n loss increased sharply when the biochar content increased from 3 to 6 6 biochar 3 biochar 0 biochar whereas both 3 and 6 biochar exhibit excessive biochar content under bare slope 6 biochar 3 biochar 0 biochar therefore the combination of horizontal ridge and 0 biochar or 3 biochar under grassed slope were helpful to reduce n loss for the slope with excessive biochar application grass combined with horizontal ridge could decrease the risk of n loss under gentle slope 3 3 sediment yield characteristics the cumulative sediment yield of 0 biochar ck m1 3 biochar m2 m3 and 6 biochar m4 m5 were 0 16 0 54 and 1 47 kg on 10 bare slope 0 17 1 77 and 1 9 kg on 15 bare slope and 0 68 3 16 and 2 66 kg on 20 bare slope respectively fig 4 indicating that the application of biochar might increase the risk of sediment loss of bare slope however the horizontal ridge m3 m5 on the bare slope with biochar application m2 m4 can effectively prevent and control sediment loss but the effect of horizontal ridge on sediment reduction decreases with the increase of biochar content that is the sediment reduction rate of m3 is higher 66 68 than that of m5 53 84 on 10 bare slope in comparison the cumulative sediment yield of 0 biochar ck m1 3 biochar m2 m3 and 6 biochar m4 m5 were 0 09 0 13 and 0 9 kg on 10 grassed slope 0 06 0 15 and 0 61 kg on 15 slope and 0 02 0 25 and 3 82 kg on 20 slope respectively indicating that the cumulative sediment yield on grassed slope increased with the increase of biochar application and the sediment loss of grassed slope with 3 biochar was relatively close to 0 biochar but the application of 6 biochar exacerbated the sediment loss of grassed slope it was speculated that 3 biochar might be the critical biochar application close to 0 biochar for sediment loss in loessial grassed slope and 6 was the excessive biochar application more interestingly for bare slope the cumulative runoff generation under 0 and 3 biochar application increased with the increase of slope angle while there was no obvious trend under 6 biochar however for grassed slope the cumulative runoff generation under 0 and 3 biochar decreased with the increase of slope angle while the runoff showed an increasing tendency under 6 biochar moreover the cumulative sediment yield of bare slope increased with the increase of slope angle under the same biochar application while no obvious trend in grassed slope was observed the cumulative sediment yield increased in 3 biochar grassed slope but decreased in 0 biochar with the increase of slope angle and the cumulative sediment yield of 20 grassed slope with 6 biochar application was obviously larger than that recorded for other slopes 3 4 runoff nitrogen characteristics the cumulative tn losses of 0 biochar ck m1 3 biochar m2 m3 and 6 biochar m4 m5 were 0 28 0 65 and 1 49 g on 10 bare slope 0 33 0 87 and 1 14 g on 15 bare slope and 0 44 0 87 and 1 48 g on 20 bare slope respectively fig 4 indicating that there was no conspicuous increase in tn loss when the application of biochar increased from 0 to 6 on bare slope although the cumulative tn loss under 6 biochar was obviously higher than that of 0 and 3 biochar on the above three bare slopes in comparison the cumulative tn loss of 0 biochar m6 m7 3 biochar m8 m9 and 6 biochar m10 m11 were 1 00 0 68 and 1 52 g on 10 grassed slope 0 67 0 94 and 1 56 g on 15 grassed slope and 0 44 0 65 and 2 80 g on 20 grassed slope respectively indicating that the cumulative tn loss of 10 grassed slopes decreased at first and then increased with the increase of biochar application while the cumulative tn loss of 15 and 20 grassed slopes increased slowly at first and then increased rapidly with the increase of biochar application therefore the combination of grass and 3 biochar could effectively reduce tn loss under 10 slope and even 15 and 20 slopes but the combination of grass and 6 biochar increased the risk of tn loss in 10 15 and 20 slopes the cumulative dn losses of 0 biochar ck m1 3 biochar m2 m3 and 6 biochar m4 m5 were 0 11 0 18 and 0 48 g on 10 bare slope these were 0 24 0 49 and 0 34 g on 15 bare slope and 0 2 0 34 and 0 52 g on 20 bare slope respectively fig 4 indicating that the loss of dn decreased first and then increased with the increase of biochar application at 10 slope and increased with the increase of biochar application at 15 and 20 slopes respectively overall the application of biochar on 10 15 and 20 slopes increases the risk of dn loss on bare slope in comparison the cumulative dn loss of 0 biochar m6 m7 3 biochar m8 m9 and 6 biochar m10 m11 were 0 71 0 45 and 0 57 g on 10 grassed slope 0 38 0 61 and 0 89 g on 15 grassed slope and 0 31 0 46 and 1 82 g on 20 grassed slope respectively indicating that the cumulative dn losses increased with the increase of biochar application on grassed slope the cumulative pn losses of 0 biochar ck m1 3 biochar m2 m3 and 6 biochar m4 m5 were 0 16 0 47 and 1 01 g on 10 bare slope 0 09 0 38 and 0 80 g on 15 bare slope and 0 24 0 53 and 0 96 g on 20 bare slope respectively fig 4 indicating that the cumulative pn loss of different bare slopes all increased with the increase of biochar application specifically the pn loss of bare slope with 3 biochar presented an obvious increasing trend compared with 0 biochar while the pn loss of bare slope with 6 biochar increased dramatically in comparison the cumulative tn loss of 0 biochar m6 m7 3 biochar m8 m9 and 6 biochar m10 m11 were 0 29 0 24 and 0 95 g on 10 grassed slope 0 29 0 32 and 0 67 g on 15 grassed slope and 0 13 0 19 and 0 98 g on 20 grassed slope respectively indicating that the cumulative pn loss of different grassed slopes was first stable and then increased with the increase of biochar application specifically the pn loss of grassed slope with 3 biochar was close to that of 0 while the pn loss of grassed slope with 6 biochar increased to a large extent compared with bare slope 3 biochar combined with grass can serve as a promising soil management practice to mitigate pn loss with an average reduction rate of 75 18 it was speculated that 3 might be the critical biochar addition of pn loss close to 0 in grassed slope while 6 belonged to excessive biochar addition moreover the cumulative pn loss of grassed slope with 0 and 3 biochar application increased first and then decreased with the increase of slope angle while that under 6 biochar application decreased first and then increased with the increase of slope angle 3 5 dissolved and particulate nitrogen fractions the pn tn ratios under most of the combinations were more than 50 on 10 15 and 20 bare slopes at 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity fig 5 indicating that the runoff n of the bare slope was mainly in particulate fractions and the average pn tn ratio of 10 15 and 20 bare slopes decreased from 65 58 to 50 15 and then increased to 60 46 with the increase of slope angle notably configuring cross ridge on 6 biochar bare slope might aggravate soil erosion with the increase of slope angle thus increasing the risk of pn loss and the ratio of pn tn in other words the effects of cross ridge easily failed to reduce the pn tn ratio on bare steepness slope with 6 biochar in comparison the pn tn ratios under most of the combinations were less than 50 on 10 15 and 20 grassed slopes at 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity indicating that the runoff n on grassed slope was mainly in dissolved fractions the average pn tn ratios of 10 15 and 20 slopes were 45 99 40 50 and 33 52 respectively indicating that the ratio of pn tn decreased with the increase of slope angle on grassed slopes the average pn tn ratios of 0 biochar ck m1 3 biochar m2 m3 and 6 biochar m4 m5 were 71 74 57 63 and 67 39 respectively under 10 15 and 20 bare slopes while the average pn tn ratios of 0 biochar m6 m7 3 biochar m8 m9 and 6 biochar m10 m11 were respectively 33 55 33 01 and 44 24 under 10 15 and 20 grassed slopes compared with bare slope grass could generally reduce the loss of pn and decrease the pn tn ratio under different biochar applications however the effect of horizontal ridge and 6 biochar on bare slopes easily failed to reduce the ratio of pn tn while configuring the horizontal ridge on 0 or 3 biochar grassed slopes reduced the ratio of pn tn effectively 4 discussion 4 1 sediment reduction the gradual downward trends of sediment yield rate on 10 and 15 bare slopes are closely related to the processes of sheet and rill erosion under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity fig 2 specifically the loose particles and soil chemical materials in the topsoil were relatively rich in the first few simulated rainfalls and a large amount of soil aggregates and loose soil particles were damaged detached and transported from bare soil surfaces under the action of raindrop splash and runoff scouring which significantly increased the sediment yield rate in the early stage of rainfall song et al 2019 however soil particles would be compacted tightly by the continuous strike of raindrops with the extension of rainfall duration ekwue and seepersad 2015 and the infiltration path of rainwater could be blocked by clay soils to form the surface crust of soil wu et al 2018b which weakens the kinetic energy of runoff to carry and transport sediment such that the sediment yield rate on 10 bare slope declines rapidly and then stabilizes moreover the sediment yield rate of bare slope fluctuates greatly within the first 20 min of rainfall indicating that the erosion process of slope surface is more instable and even severe during the early period of the rainstorm wu et al 2018a therefore the different management strategies to limit soil erosion should be focused on in the early stage of rainstorm runoff j q zhang et al 2019 j l zhang et al 2019 the sediment flux of grassed slope is always less than that of bare slope except m10 6 biochar conventional flat planting grassed slope this is because the most effective way to control erosion is to keep the soil surface covered either with growing plants or residues from past crops li et al 2021 specifically grass cover can reduce the splash erosion capacity of raindrops by preventing the direct contact of rainwater on the soil surface shin et al 2019 and water droplets are intercepted and their height and speed are reduced resulting in the lower impact power and energy for eroding zhou et al 2019 moreover grass can also reduce the velocity and volume of the surface runoff retention by creating surface roughness nicosia et al 2020 thus increasing infiltration and improving soil water holding capacity wang et al 2016 for instance increasing grass cover m8 and m10 on 3 and 6 biochar bare slopes m2 and m4 can reduce sediment loss to a certain extent fig 6 and the reduction rates are 88 49 and 16 91 on 10 slope respectively indicating that the combination of grass and biochar especially 3 biochar can effectively reduce risks of slope erosion under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity however the sediment reduction performance of grass can be greatly weakened with the increase in biochar content from 3 to 6 indicating that plant responses to biochar additions to soils may be very varied and 6 biochar may have decreased the normal growth of perennial ryegrass liu et al 2018 this is consistent with the results by wu et al 2018c that 3 15 biochar content presented the best runoff and sediment control effect on 3 black soil runoff plot in northeast china decreasing tillage and leaving residues on the soil surface decreased evaporation and increased the amount of water stored in the soil zhang et al 2021 for instance increasing cross ridge m9 and m11 on 10 grassed slopes with 3 and 6 biochar m8 and m10 can reduce sediment loss to a certain extent fig 6 at reduction rates of 46 57 and 91 57 respectively compared with that on 10 bare slope indicating that the sediment reduction performance of cross ridge on grassed slope could be further strengthened with the increase of biochar content compared with conventional flat planting j q zhang et al 2019 j l zhang et al 2019 moreover the appropriate biochar content 3 in the case of m8 and m9 helped stabilize the slope surface of soils and the sediment retention effect of ryegrass canopy stems and roots li et al 207 however as slope steepness increased the excessive biochar application 6 m10 and m11 on 20 grassed slope destroyed the root system inhibited the normal growth of perennial ryegrass and also led to the enhancement of soil water repellency yu et al 2018 thus degrading soil structure increasing the volume and velocity of runoff intensifying the ability of the water to detach and transport particles and finally resulting in a dramatic increase of tn loss chu et al 2014 the above results are consistent with previous studies reporting that biochar addition of 1 or 3 reduced soil loss rates while addition of 7 biochar increased the risk of soil and tn losses li et al 2020 4 2 mitigation mechanism of runoff nitrogen similarly taking 15 slope as an example figs 7 and 8 increasing grass planting m8 and m9 on 3 biochar bare slopes m2 and m3 can reduce tn loss to a certain extent but with the increase of biochar content from 3 m4 and m5 to 6 m10 and m11 the performance of grass in reducing tn loss is not effective indicating that biochar might have an optimal threshold range in soil improvement and runoff nutrient control chen et al 2015 however increasing horizontal ridge m11 on the basis of grassed slope m10 can effectively reduce the risk of tn loss caused by excessive biochar application at all three slopes this is because grass keeps the soil surface covered and the combination of cross ridge and grass can intercept and store surface runoff thereby allowing more time for the water to infiltrate the soil thus protecting soil from being detached by raindrop and transported by runoff adam sigler et al 2020 meanwhile grass cover and cross ridge also reduce the connectivity of flowpaths within the plot which also contributes to relatively lower runoff and erosion at the outlet of the plot vannoppen et al 2015 meanwhile compared with 15 slopes increasing slope angle to 20 further aggravated soil erosion and tn loss fig 3 regardless of conventional flat planting or cross ridge grassed slopes both with 6 biochar m10 and m11 this is because the velocity of surface runoff increases with the increase of slope angle han et al 2021 then rill erosion begins as water flowing across the soil surface concentrates into small rivulets creating small channels s wang et al 2020 z q wang et al 2020 and degraded loose soil particles easily roll down and move because more of the slope steepness effect comes from erosion by surface runoff than by raindrop impact wu et al 2017 furthermore soils on steep slopes tend to be drier than in flatter areas because of increased runoff osman 2018 the splashing and scouring of initial rainstorms on loose soils led to the huge loss of dissolved and particulate n in the pathways of runoff and sediment wu et al 2018a thus generating an initial peak value of slope erosion and tn loss concentration more significantly the initial tn loss concentration of m11 6 biochar cross ridge planting grassed slope is much greater than that of m5 6 biochar cross ridge planting bare slope on 20 slopes and its slope surface is scoured and damaged more seriously than m5 fig 9 this is because the excessive biochar application 6 led to the increment of biological fixation of n and the decrease of plant available n contents wei et al 2018 which was not conducive to the growth of perennial ryegrass and caused the grass root rot hu et al 2019 the immature development of ryegrass rotten roots inevitably play a positive role in enhancing the anti erosion ability of soil especially for the cross ridge grassed slopes with 6 biochar it might however negatively impact soil conservation fang 2021 for instance wei et al 2018 found that the inhibition effect of biochar on soil erosion was the largest when its content reached 50 t hm 2 but the amount of n loss associated with eroded soil would double when the biochar content exceeded this level 4 3 surface pathways of nitrogen loss both pn and dn may be transported in surface runoff although the dominated n fractions usually change with agricultural management practices hatfield and follett 2008 overall grass could effectively reduce the loss of pn and decrease the pn tn ratio under different management scenarios at the plot scale e g the dn fractions exceeded 50 and increased with slope angle in grassed slope 54 01 59 50 and 66 48 this is because grass planting can increase rainwater infiltration and reduce runoff yield wu et al 2020 at the same time it intensifies the interaction between runoff and surface soil accelerates the release of soil n to runoff and increases the proportion of dn in runoff w wang et al 2019 g wang et al 2019 significantly the continuous impact of raindrops on unprotected soil can degrade soil structure poorly structured soil has little pore space for air and water because the soil aggregates are packed tightly dexter 2002 which slows down the water infiltration rate causes ponding in low lying sites or result in runoff and increases the loss potential of dissolved n guo et al 2019 moreover the drying rewetting alternation caused by consecutive rainstorm meets the moderate water conditions required for ammonia volatilization loss and soil water evaporation can promote the movement of soluble n on the soil surface thus increasing the rainstorm runoff loss of soluble n zhu 1997 more importantly with the increase of slope angle the overland flow accelerates and the dissolved n is brought downstream by runoff because of the lack of sufficient time for the water to infiltrate the soil ebrahimian et al 2012 however hillslope and catchment scale studies are necessary to trace the fate of n once mobilized along this pathway luo et al 2021 this is because it is still not clear to what extent particular n fractions once mobilized are modified before they reach the stream or at what distance the n source area is from the stream and whether mobilized n actually reaches it for instance xi et al 2021 found that the loss of n in beishahe watershed occurs mainly in particulate fractions 69 6 in pn and 30 4 in dn but the characteristics of n loss in this watershed are not consistent with the middle and lower reaches of hanjiang river with 5 7 66 7 pn and 33 3 94 3 dn shi et al 2002 this is because the driving mechanism of runoff sediment and nutrient loss on different scales differs greatly under the synthetic interaction of physical and anthropogenic factors such as climate topography soil land use type vegetation and human activities gong et al 2019 the effect of biochar application on the surface pathways of nutrient loss was complex ali et al 2020 first the concentration of tn loss especially for pn from 3 biochar grassed slope was relatively low under the rainfall intensity of 60 mm h 1 this is because 3 biochar may be the appropriate application amount which can not only increase the number of soil microorganisms improve soil ph value and the activities of soil enzymes and increase porosity and macroaggregates y wu et al 2018 x l wu et al 2018 but also increase soil nutrient supply capacity and promote soil infiltration performance and the absorption of available n by plants chen et al 2020 second the growth of lolium perenne under 6 biochar is poor because the excessive soil c n ratio owing to the high volatile matter in biochar reduced n fixed by soil inhibited soil n cycling and led to the decrease of n absorption by roots when the biochar content increased from 3 to 6 third the undeveloped root system of perennial ryegrass due to excessive biochar further aggravated the risks of sediment and pn loss this is because the poor development of perennial ryegrass had a negative effect on the biological aggregation of soil particles ye et al 2012 which changed soil physical structure decreased soil consistence accelerated soil nitrification process and also increased no3 n content in soil hui et al 2014 moreover the physical chemical and biological effects of biochar on crop and soil change considerably with the increase of application time for instance jones et al 2012 found that the crop yield did not increase in the first two years after applying biochar to farmland but the n content in crops increased effectively in the second year 4 4 paired samples t test grass cross ridge biochar and slope angle were selected as the four primary factors to conduct the paired t test of five environmental hydrology indicator including tn dn pn sediment and runoff under same subject two conditions of loessial bare and grassed sloping lands we designed 70 paired t tests and adopted a 05 level of significance as we used a small sample i most significant differences were observed between the eighteen paired dn samples n 18 p 0 01 and runoff samples n 18 p 0 05 for different treatments in bare and grassed slopes while there were no significant differences between the eighteen paired pn samples n 18 p 0 05 sediment samples n 18 p 0 01 and tn samples n 18 p 0 01 indicating that the effect of grass planting on dn and runoff was higher than that of sediment tn and pn under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity this is because stems and leaves of grass slow the rate of water flow across the surface decreasing the kinetic energy and allowing more time for the water and soil information to exchange thus decreasing runoff detachment and transportation and increasing the risk of dn loss harrington and harrington 2014 ii however only dn samples presented significant difference between cross ridge and conventional flat planting in bare and grassed slopes n 18 p 0 01 indicating that the cross ridge did not show evident interception effect on eroded soil particles under grassed slopes and 0 3 biochar level while cross ridge and grass planting allows more time for the water to infiltrate the soil intensifies the interaction between runoff and surface soil accelerates the release of soil n to runoff and increases the proportion of dn in runoff w wang et al 2019 g wang et al 2019 iii the different contents of biochar varied significantly under different treatments that is there were twelve paired samples with significant differences for bare slopes as follows six tn samples between 0 and 3 biochar n 6 p 0 01 six tn samples between 3 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six tn samples between 0 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 01 six dn samples between 0 and 3 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six dn samples between 0 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six pn samples between 0 and 3 biochar n 6 p 0 01 six pn samples between 3 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six pn samples between 0 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 01 six sediment samples between 0 and 3 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six sediment samples between 0 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 01 six runoff samples between 0 and 3 biochar n 6 p 0 01 and six runoff samples between 0 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 in comparison there were six paired samples with significant differences for grassed slopes as follows six tn samples between 3 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six tn samples between 0 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six pn samples between 3 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six pn samples between 0 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six sediment samples between 0 and 3 biochar n 6 p 0 05 and six runoff samples between 0 and 3 biochar n 6 p 0 05 the above statistical analysis reconfirmed that excessive biochar could aggravate tn and sediment loss regardless of the slopes being bare or grassed while grass planting weakened the number of significant differences between different biochar contents and the probability of significant difference between different biochar contents in bare slopes was higher than grassed slopes under different treatments moreover dn and pn levels under 0 biochar content were much closer to those under 3 biochar content under the grassed slope than to those under bare slope iv for 30 designed t tests of 10 15 and 20 slopes there were only three cases with significant differences between the three different slopes e g six pn samples n 6 p 0 05 and six sediment samples n 6 p 0 05 between 15 and 20 bare slope six sediment samples between 10 and 20 bare slope n 6 p 0 05 indicating that the increase of slope angle has the most significant impact on sediment yield compared with other environmental hydrology indicators especially when the bare slope rises to steep slope this is because the increase in erosion is linear with the increase in steepness and wetting and drying cycles decrease erodibility sun et al 2021 5 conclusions laboratory studies with simulated consecutive rainstorms with the controlled conditions of biochar planting modes grass antecedent soil moisture rainfall intensity and slope angle were innovatively adopted to investigate the surface pathways of runoff n and the optimal configuration mechanism of agricultural management practices in sloping lands biochar within the range of 0 3 can be combined with cross ridge on the grassed slope to reduce sediment and n loss through intercepting the surface pathways associated with soil erosion but it is not recommended to employ biochar and cross ridge independently or in combination on bare slope runoff n on bare slopes occurs mainly in particulate fraction while on grassed slopes it occurs mainly in dissolved fraction with the variation in particulate n fractions depending largely on different physical factors such as precipitation the soil infiltration capacity of the soil surface and different underlying surfaces no matter the scale agricultural management practices should focus on the reduction of pollutants delivery from slope runoff processes however it is difficult to quantify the impact of specific changes in agricultural interventions at watershed scale owing to lags in effects variations in rainfall and overlapping practices and more importantly sizing the capacities of the appropriate bmps for large storms and steep slopes is not only expensive but also ineffective for pollution control these findings aim to help conserve soil and develop sustainable agriculture in ways that are ecologically

9721,many options for reducing nitrogen n losses from agriculture rely on changing the surface pathways of n runoff in one way or another but the runoff n mechanism by agricultural interventions such as biochar grass and cross ridge is not well understood herein 12 artificial simulated rainstorms by three biochars 0 3 and 6 two planting modes conventional flat planting cross ridge and two underlying surfaces bare grass were designed to investigate the surface pathways of n loss and possible tradeoffs in loessial sloping lands under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity results indicate that i 3 and 6 biochar application can aggravate soil erosion on bare slope but planting grass on 0 or 3 biochar bare slope has good reduction effects on sediment and n loss while 6 belongs to excessive biochar on grassed slopes ii grass planting may decrease the loss fractions of particulate nitrogen pn more obviously than bare slope because it decreases the kinetic energy of raindrops slows the rate of water flow and improves the shear strength of soils with deep penetrating roots configuring cross ridge with 0 or 3 biochar on grassed slope can reduce pn fraction obviously but the interception of cross ridge on bare slope is limited and easy to fail iii the hydrological pathways transporting various n fractions vary greatly owing to the interaction of biochar grass and cross ridge runoff n from 10 15 and 20 bare slope materializes mainly in particulate fractions 65 58 50 15 and 60 46 while from grassed slope it occurs mainly in dissolved fractions 54 01 59 50 and 66 48 these findings may help provide new insights needed to enhance soil health and maintain agroecosystem sustainability through decreasing n losses via sloping farmland management in loess hilly and gully regions keywords particulate nitrogen dissolved nitrogen grass biochar cross ridge artificial simulated rainfall 1 introduction nitrogen n is often applied as a fertilizer to maintain adequate soil levels for crop production addy et al 2020 but n losses through surface runoff not only increase the cost of production but also increase the environmental risk of surface and ground water contamination hatfield and follett 2008 previous studies regarding the variability in n transport in cropping systems show that the loss of n varies greatly under different hydrological and underlying surface conditions yan et al 2014 however these research mainly focus on reducing the loss of n in runoff erosion leaching and denitrification by single management practice chu et al 2014 there are few studies on the effect of various agricultural interventions such as biochar grass and planting modes on runoff n processes wu et al 2018b understanding the hydrological pathways transporting the various n fractions is a main challenge in developing appropriate management practices for the sustainability of sloping farmland which is also the key knowledge gap between the possible tradeoffs of runoff n fractions and the targeted conservation practices in the loess plateau rainfed agroecosystems to prevent excess losses of n into the surrounding environment it is important to curtail transport processes runoff erosion leaching and gaseous losses so that applied and residual n sources within the soil crop system are not lost but remain where needed for crop use malik et al 2020 best management practices bmps are methods and practices for preventing or reducing diffuse pollution to a level compatible with water quality goals briak et al 2019 bmps can be classified as structural vegetative or management and each class is somewhat more effective in controlling certain types of diffuse pollution than others uniyal et al 2020 for instance biochar has characteristics of a large number of organic functional groups rich pore structure large specific surface area strong adsorption and stability sun et al 2017 which can be used as an important soil amendment product to increase soil organic matter and improve soil ecosystems s wang et al 2020 z q wang et al 2020 when selecting bmps it is important that the pollutants and the forms in which they are transported are known mtibaa et al 2018 it is also important to realize that bmps are not necessarily synonymous with resource management systems or conservation treatments igras and creed 2020 however there is relatively little information comparing different environmentally friendly bmp combinations for limiting n migration yoder et al 2020 thus it is of great practical significance to explore the effective configuration of agricultural management practices on n and on sediment reduction yu et al 2018 which is of vital importance for the linkage between changes in agricultural practices and effects in n transport control of loessial sloping farmland precipitation drives the processes that generate diffuse pollution rajapakse et al 2010 at present the methods to obtain soil n or p loss data mainly include laboratory or field studies under simulated rainfall and runoff plots under natural rainfall imdad and rafique 2019 unlike natural rainfall the use of rainfall simulators in fields or laboratories can eliminate many interference factors it has many advantages in controlling drop size intensity test conditions length and width to runoff flume fast results standardization etc wu et al 2021b more importantly it is essential to clearly define the issue to be investigated and the accuracy of the required answer when choosing a measurement system todisco et al 2012 therefore laboratory studies with simulated rainstorms were designed to quantify the surface pathways of n loss and the effects of agricultural management practices on the possible tradeoffs of particulate and dissolved n fractions from loessial sloping lands this is critical to testing hypotheses regarding the roles of agricultural interventions such as biochar grass and cross ridge in the surface pathways of n loss and in developing effective management strategies for mitigating unacceptably high n inputs to receiving waters the objectives of this study are to i quantify the effects of various agricultural interventions such as biochar grass and cross ridge on particulate and dissolved n fractions of loessial sloping lands under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity ii elucidate the mechanism of biochar grass and cross ridge on the surface pathways of runoff nitrogen and possible tradeoffs iii optimize the design of targeted and sustainable agricultural interventions to minimize n losses in overland flow our findings may provide scientific guidance for further understanding the mechanism of n reduction in sloping farmlands and optimizing appropriate countermeasures for different n loss pathways in the rain fed agroecosystems of the loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 runoff flume and simulated rainfall three groups of runoff flumes with variable slope 10 15 and 20 were designed 2 m length 1 m width 0 45 m height each of which are divided into two parts from the middle and conventional flat planting and horizontal ridge planting were set separately fig 1 the v shaped outlet is installed in one short side of the runoff flume and the 10 cm free plate is installed in the other three sides of the runoff flume to prevent soil from splashing out under the strike of raindrops and small circular holes are evenly drilled at the bottom of the runoff flume to facilitate the free downward leakage of soil moisture the simulated rainfall was conducted in the artificial simulated rainfall hall of the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau from may to october 2019 the side spray automatic rainfall simulation system with the rainfall height of 16 m was adopted in this study to make all rainfall raindrops reach the reasonable terminal speed the range of rainfall intensity in the system is 40 260 mm h 1 the rainfall uniformity is 80 and the maximum rainfall duration is 12 h zheng and zhao 2004 according to the statistical probability of maximum rainfall in different periods the rainstorm with maximum rainfall of 60 mm in 60 min easily occurs on the loess plateau an et al 2021 therefore 60 mm h 1 was selected as the designed rainfall intensity in this study and the total rainfall volume was set as 90 mm in each rainstorm event the corresponding rainfall duration was 90 min two repetitions with a total of 12 rainstorm events were determined in this rainfall test table 1 there were 6 treatments for each rainstorm event and a total of 72 scenarios before each rainfall five point method was used to calibrate rainfall intensity and ensure that the rainfall uniformity reached 80 then the rainstorm test was conducted when the measured soil moisture was approximately 10 2 2 biochar perennial ryegrass and tested loessial soil biochar used in this experiment comprising the sawdust black carbon obtained from apple branch by pyrolysis at 600 using a particle size mesh of 80 400 was provided by shaanxi yixin bioenergy technology development co ltd wu et al 2021a perennial ryegrass a perennial herb with well developed fibrous roots thin stems and hollow upright and linear leaves was sown by drilling method with the planting density of 20 g m 2 and row spacing of 10 cm according to the local growth and distribution of local grass in ansai county so that the grass coverage was basically the same in each flume approximately 80 the tested loessial soil was collected from ansai county yan an city subsequent to its retrieval the soil was dried by natural air and debris were removed through a 10 mm sieve the physicochemical properties of the tested loessial soil are as follows antecedent soil moisture is 6 8 ph value is 7 6 soil particle compositions are 11 62 clay 0 002 mm 65 1 silt 0 002 0 05 mm and 23 74 sand 0 05 mm the original tn content of the loessial soil is 0 43 g kg 1 but needed to be controlled at 1 4 g kg 1 in this test the chemical fertilizer was dissolved by the required amount of hydrating water and was evenly sprayed on the soil by a sprayer to replenish n and maintain the initial soil water content of about 10 wang et al 2014 after that 0 3 and 6 biochars mass percent were each mixed with soil by an electric mixer then sealed and left for 24 h to form the tested fertile soil for standby after the soil was mixed evenly the runoff flume for filling the tested soil was adjusted to the level the layered loading method was adopted to ensure the soil bulk density of the tested soil reaches 1 2 0 2 g cm 3 han et al 2011 first we covered it with permeable gauze to ensure uniform infiltration of water and 5 cm thick natural fine sand was layered at the flume bottom then the rest were filled with a thickness of 10 cm per layer with a total of 4 layers for the runoff flume with horizontal ridge measures the size of the horizontal ridge is 5 cm ridge height 10 cm ridge width and 10 cm ridge spacing 2 3 runoff testing and statistical analyses the time when the water flows in a continuous form from the v shaped outlet of runoff flume was recorded as the initial runoff generation time the sampling method was once every 1 min interval in the first 20 min and then once every 10 min until the end of rainfall the sampling time was 1 min at the end of the test the volume and weight of water samples in each bucket were weighed and 50 ml runoff samples were taken from each bucket with polyethylene bottles runoff samples were taken back to the laboratory for chemical analysis the remaining water samples were dried in the oven 120 c then weighed and the amount of sediment yield in proportion was calculated total nitrogen tn and dissolved total nitrogen dn which is operationally defined as n that can pass through 0 45 µm membranes were both measured by uv spectrophotometry method combined with alkaline potassium persulfate digestion and centrifugation gb11893 89 finally the particulate total nitrogen pn concentration was calculated by subtracting dn concentration from tn concentration excel 2019 was used for data statistics and chart making and paired samples t test student s t test based on spss 23 0 statistical product and service solutions software were employed to determine significant differences between the means of two samples 3 results 3 1 sediment yield processes the sediment yield process of ck m5 on the 10 bare slope is similar to that of 15 bare slope fig 2 that is the sediment yield rate increases first and then decreases at the initial stage of runoff generation and then tends to be stable after 20 min but the only difference is that the fluctuation of sediment yield on 10 bare slope lasts longer the uniform convergence of sediment yield rate in each treatment decreases gradually in the later stage of rainfall with the increase of slope gradient for instance the sediment yield rate of m2 m5 at 20 bare slope does not decrease all the time but grows wavily in the later stage of rainfall this can be attributed to the fact that the temporary crust soil on the slope with 3 and 6 biochar is relatively loose owing to the physicochemical properties of biochar which is easily damaged by the developed rill erosion under steep slope the initial sediment yield amount of ck m5 was 7 78 3 02 25 62 4 23 36 61 and 6 73 g at 10 slope respectively and the decreasing order was m4 m2 ck m5 m3 m1 indicating that the horizontal ridge could effectively intercept sediment at the initial stage of runoff generation because the initial sediment yield amount of horizontal ridge was less than that of conventional flat planting under the same biochar application moreover the initial sediment yield amount increased with the increase of biochar content under the same tillage method indicating that increasing the biochar content from 3 to 6 increased the risk of soil erosion of bare slope compared with the bare slope the variation ranges of sediment yield rate of 10 15 and 20 grassed slopes m6 m9 m11 except m10 are all less than those of ck m5 and the variation range also fluctuates slightly with the increase of slope angle indicating that ryegrass planting can effectively mitigate the adverse impact of soil erosion caused by steep slope under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity however the sediment yield rate of m10 increased dramatically with the increase of slope angle and was even higher than that of m4 at 20 slope indicating that the effect of grassed slope with high dosage of biochar on slope erosion control was very poor and even an aggravating risk of erosion potential 3 2 tn loss processes tn loss concentration under different management practices at three slopes of 10 15 and 20 first decreased and then stabilized with the extension of rainfall duration fig 3 on the 10 slope tn loss concentration of m4 m5 m10 and m11 was relatively high during the whole rainfall period and that of m4 was higher than m5 and m10 was higher than that of m11 indicating that horizontal ridge has better performance on reducing runoff and sediment than conventional flat planting and 6 biochar may be the excessive biochar that can aggravate n loss on the 15 slope although the tn loss concentrations of m4 and m5 were still relatively high the tn loss concentration of m10 was higher than that of the bare slope and the initial tn loss concentration of m10 was 88 54 mg l 1 3 67 times that of m6 and 16 07 times that of ck however tn loss concentration of grassed slope with 3 biochar was lower than that of bare slope i e the tn loss concentrations of m8 and m9 were 22 53 mg l 1 and 15 59 mg l 1 respectively while tn loss concentrations of m3 and m4 were 30 98 and 19 71 mg l 1 indicating that grass can reduce the risk of tn loss caused by steepness slope and biochar addition 3 but the effect of the grassed slope with 6 biochar on reducing tn loss may be weakened or even fail on the 20 slope although the tn loss concentrations of m4 and m5 were still higher than that of other bare slopes tn loss concentrations of m10 and m11 were higher than that of bare slope and the initial tn loss concentration of m10 was 171 67 mg l 1 which is 2 72 times than that of m4 the initial tn loss concentration of m11 was 128 86 mg l 1 which is 1 71 times than that of m5 tn loss trend of bare slope with 3 and 6 biochar was much higher than that of 0 biochar under 20 slope indicating that 3 and 6 biochar could aggravate the risk of tn loss on bare slope with the increase of slope gradient tn loss trend of 3 biochar was similar to that of 0 biochar under ryegrass slope indicating that grass could reduce the potential of tn loss caused by steepness slope and 3 biochar further 3 biochar under grassed slope may be the critical biochar content for tn loss similar to 0 biochar and 6 biochar may be excessive in biochar content because n loss increased sharply when the biochar content increased from 3 to 6 6 biochar 3 biochar 0 biochar whereas both 3 and 6 biochar exhibit excessive biochar content under bare slope 6 biochar 3 biochar 0 biochar therefore the combination of horizontal ridge and 0 biochar or 3 biochar under grassed slope were helpful to reduce n loss for the slope with excessive biochar application grass combined with horizontal ridge could decrease the risk of n loss under gentle slope 3 3 sediment yield characteristics the cumulative sediment yield of 0 biochar ck m1 3 biochar m2 m3 and 6 biochar m4 m5 were 0 16 0 54 and 1 47 kg on 10 bare slope 0 17 1 77 and 1 9 kg on 15 bare slope and 0 68 3 16 and 2 66 kg on 20 bare slope respectively fig 4 indicating that the application of biochar might increase the risk of sediment loss of bare slope however the horizontal ridge m3 m5 on the bare slope with biochar application m2 m4 can effectively prevent and control sediment loss but the effect of horizontal ridge on sediment reduction decreases with the increase of biochar content that is the sediment reduction rate of m3 is higher 66 68 than that of m5 53 84 on 10 bare slope in comparison the cumulative sediment yield of 0 biochar ck m1 3 biochar m2 m3 and 6 biochar m4 m5 were 0 09 0 13 and 0 9 kg on 10 grassed slope 0 06 0 15 and 0 61 kg on 15 slope and 0 02 0 25 and 3 82 kg on 20 slope respectively indicating that the cumulative sediment yield on grassed slope increased with the increase of biochar application and the sediment loss of grassed slope with 3 biochar was relatively close to 0 biochar but the application of 6 biochar exacerbated the sediment loss of grassed slope it was speculated that 3 biochar might be the critical biochar application close to 0 biochar for sediment loss in loessial grassed slope and 6 was the excessive biochar application more interestingly for bare slope the cumulative runoff generation under 0 and 3 biochar application increased with the increase of slope angle while there was no obvious trend under 6 biochar however for grassed slope the cumulative runoff generation under 0 and 3 biochar decreased with the increase of slope angle while the runoff showed an increasing tendency under 6 biochar moreover the cumulative sediment yield of bare slope increased with the increase of slope angle under the same biochar application while no obvious trend in grassed slope was observed the cumulative sediment yield increased in 3 biochar grassed slope but decreased in 0 biochar with the increase of slope angle and the cumulative sediment yield of 20 grassed slope with 6 biochar application was obviously larger than that recorded for other slopes 3 4 runoff nitrogen characteristics the cumulative tn losses of 0 biochar ck m1 3 biochar m2 m3 and 6 biochar m4 m5 were 0 28 0 65 and 1 49 g on 10 bare slope 0 33 0 87 and 1 14 g on 15 bare slope and 0 44 0 87 and 1 48 g on 20 bare slope respectively fig 4 indicating that there was no conspicuous increase in tn loss when the application of biochar increased from 0 to 6 on bare slope although the cumulative tn loss under 6 biochar was obviously higher than that of 0 and 3 biochar on the above three bare slopes in comparison the cumulative tn loss of 0 biochar m6 m7 3 biochar m8 m9 and 6 biochar m10 m11 were 1 00 0 68 and 1 52 g on 10 grassed slope 0 67 0 94 and 1 56 g on 15 grassed slope and 0 44 0 65 and 2 80 g on 20 grassed slope respectively indicating that the cumulative tn loss of 10 grassed slopes decreased at first and then increased with the increase of biochar application while the cumulative tn loss of 15 and 20 grassed slopes increased slowly at first and then increased rapidly with the increase of biochar application therefore the combination of grass and 3 biochar could effectively reduce tn loss under 10 slope and even 15 and 20 slopes but the combination of grass and 6 biochar increased the risk of tn loss in 10 15 and 20 slopes the cumulative dn losses of 0 biochar ck m1 3 biochar m2 m3 and 6 biochar m4 m5 were 0 11 0 18 and 0 48 g on 10 bare slope these were 0 24 0 49 and 0 34 g on 15 bare slope and 0 2 0 34 and 0 52 g on 20 bare slope respectively fig 4 indicating that the loss of dn decreased first and then increased with the increase of biochar application at 10 slope and increased with the increase of biochar application at 15 and 20 slopes respectively overall the application of biochar on 10 15 and 20 slopes increases the risk of dn loss on bare slope in comparison the cumulative dn loss of 0 biochar m6 m7 3 biochar m8 m9 and 6 biochar m10 m11 were 0 71 0 45 and 0 57 g on 10 grassed slope 0 38 0 61 and 0 89 g on 15 grassed slope and 0 31 0 46 and 1 82 g on 20 grassed slope respectively indicating that the cumulative dn losses increased with the increase of biochar application on grassed slope the cumulative pn losses of 0 biochar ck m1 3 biochar m2 m3 and 6 biochar m4 m5 were 0 16 0 47 and 1 01 g on 10 bare slope 0 09 0 38 and 0 80 g on 15 bare slope and 0 24 0 53 and 0 96 g on 20 bare slope respectively fig 4 indicating that the cumulative pn loss of different bare slopes all increased with the increase of biochar application specifically the pn loss of bare slope with 3 biochar presented an obvious increasing trend compared with 0 biochar while the pn loss of bare slope with 6 biochar increased dramatically in comparison the cumulative tn loss of 0 biochar m6 m7 3 biochar m8 m9 and 6 biochar m10 m11 were 0 29 0 24 and 0 95 g on 10 grassed slope 0 29 0 32 and 0 67 g on 15 grassed slope and 0 13 0 19 and 0 98 g on 20 grassed slope respectively indicating that the cumulative pn loss of different grassed slopes was first stable and then increased with the increase of biochar application specifically the pn loss of grassed slope with 3 biochar was close to that of 0 while the pn loss of grassed slope with 6 biochar increased to a large extent compared with bare slope 3 biochar combined with grass can serve as a promising soil management practice to mitigate pn loss with an average reduction rate of 75 18 it was speculated that 3 might be the critical biochar addition of pn loss close to 0 in grassed slope while 6 belonged to excessive biochar addition moreover the cumulative pn loss of grassed slope with 0 and 3 biochar application increased first and then decreased with the increase of slope angle while that under 6 biochar application decreased first and then increased with the increase of slope angle 3 5 dissolved and particulate nitrogen fractions the pn tn ratios under most of the combinations were more than 50 on 10 15 and 20 bare slopes at 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity fig 5 indicating that the runoff n of the bare slope was mainly in particulate fractions and the average pn tn ratio of 10 15 and 20 bare slopes decreased from 65 58 to 50 15 and then increased to 60 46 with the increase of slope angle notably configuring cross ridge on 6 biochar bare slope might aggravate soil erosion with the increase of slope angle thus increasing the risk of pn loss and the ratio of pn tn in other words the effects of cross ridge easily failed to reduce the pn tn ratio on bare steepness slope with 6 biochar in comparison the pn tn ratios under most of the combinations were less than 50 on 10 15 and 20 grassed slopes at 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity indicating that the runoff n on grassed slope was mainly in dissolved fractions the average pn tn ratios of 10 15 and 20 slopes were 45 99 40 50 and 33 52 respectively indicating that the ratio of pn tn decreased with the increase of slope angle on grassed slopes the average pn tn ratios of 0 biochar ck m1 3 biochar m2 m3 and 6 biochar m4 m5 were 71 74 57 63 and 67 39 respectively under 10 15 and 20 bare slopes while the average pn tn ratios of 0 biochar m6 m7 3 biochar m8 m9 and 6 biochar m10 m11 were respectively 33 55 33 01 and 44 24 under 10 15 and 20 grassed slopes compared with bare slope grass could generally reduce the loss of pn and decrease the pn tn ratio under different biochar applications however the effect of horizontal ridge and 6 biochar on bare slopes easily failed to reduce the ratio of pn tn while configuring the horizontal ridge on 0 or 3 biochar grassed slopes reduced the ratio of pn tn effectively 4 discussion 4 1 sediment reduction the gradual downward trends of sediment yield rate on 10 and 15 bare slopes are closely related to the processes of sheet and rill erosion under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity fig 2 specifically the loose particles and soil chemical materials in the topsoil were relatively rich in the first few simulated rainfalls and a large amount of soil aggregates and loose soil particles were damaged detached and transported from bare soil surfaces under the action of raindrop splash and runoff scouring which significantly increased the sediment yield rate in the early stage of rainfall song et al 2019 however soil particles would be compacted tightly by the continuous strike of raindrops with the extension of rainfall duration ekwue and seepersad 2015 and the infiltration path of rainwater could be blocked by clay soils to form the surface crust of soil wu et al 2018b which weakens the kinetic energy of runoff to carry and transport sediment such that the sediment yield rate on 10 bare slope declines rapidly and then stabilizes moreover the sediment yield rate of bare slope fluctuates greatly within the first 20 min of rainfall indicating that the erosion process of slope surface is more instable and even severe during the early period of the rainstorm wu et al 2018a therefore the different management strategies to limit soil erosion should be focused on in the early stage of rainstorm runoff j q zhang et al 2019 j l zhang et al 2019 the sediment flux of grassed slope is always less than that of bare slope except m10 6 biochar conventional flat planting grassed slope this is because the most effective way to control erosion is to keep the soil surface covered either with growing plants or residues from past crops li et al 2021 specifically grass cover can reduce the splash erosion capacity of raindrops by preventing the direct contact of rainwater on the soil surface shin et al 2019 and water droplets are intercepted and their height and speed are reduced resulting in the lower impact power and energy for eroding zhou et al 2019 moreover grass can also reduce the velocity and volume of the surface runoff retention by creating surface roughness nicosia et al 2020 thus increasing infiltration and improving soil water holding capacity wang et al 2016 for instance increasing grass cover m8 and m10 on 3 and 6 biochar bare slopes m2 and m4 can reduce sediment loss to a certain extent fig 6 and the reduction rates are 88 49 and 16 91 on 10 slope respectively indicating that the combination of grass and biochar especially 3 biochar can effectively reduce risks of slope erosion under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity however the sediment reduction performance of grass can be greatly weakened with the increase in biochar content from 3 to 6 indicating that plant responses to biochar additions to soils may be very varied and 6 biochar may have decreased the normal growth of perennial ryegrass liu et al 2018 this is consistent with the results by wu et al 2018c that 3 15 biochar content presented the best runoff and sediment control effect on 3 black soil runoff plot in northeast china decreasing tillage and leaving residues on the soil surface decreased evaporation and increased the amount of water stored in the soil zhang et al 2021 for instance increasing cross ridge m9 and m11 on 10 grassed slopes with 3 and 6 biochar m8 and m10 can reduce sediment loss to a certain extent fig 6 at reduction rates of 46 57 and 91 57 respectively compared with that on 10 bare slope indicating that the sediment reduction performance of cross ridge on grassed slope could be further strengthened with the increase of biochar content compared with conventional flat planting j q zhang et al 2019 j l zhang et al 2019 moreover the appropriate biochar content 3 in the case of m8 and m9 helped stabilize the slope surface of soils and the sediment retention effect of ryegrass canopy stems and roots li et al 207 however as slope steepness increased the excessive biochar application 6 m10 and m11 on 20 grassed slope destroyed the root system inhibited the normal growth of perennial ryegrass and also led to the enhancement of soil water repellency yu et al 2018 thus degrading soil structure increasing the volume and velocity of runoff intensifying the ability of the water to detach and transport particles and finally resulting in a dramatic increase of tn loss chu et al 2014 the above results are consistent with previous studies reporting that biochar addition of 1 or 3 reduced soil loss rates while addition of 7 biochar increased the risk of soil and tn losses li et al 2020 4 2 mitigation mechanism of runoff nitrogen similarly taking 15 slope as an example figs 7 and 8 increasing grass planting m8 and m9 on 3 biochar bare slopes m2 and m3 can reduce tn loss to a certain extent but with the increase of biochar content from 3 m4 and m5 to 6 m10 and m11 the performance of grass in reducing tn loss is not effective indicating that biochar might have an optimal threshold range in soil improvement and runoff nutrient control chen et al 2015 however increasing horizontal ridge m11 on the basis of grassed slope m10 can effectively reduce the risk of tn loss caused by excessive biochar application at all three slopes this is because grass keeps the soil surface covered and the combination of cross ridge and grass can intercept and store surface runoff thereby allowing more time for the water to infiltrate the soil thus protecting soil from being detached by raindrop and transported by runoff adam sigler et al 2020 meanwhile grass cover and cross ridge also reduce the connectivity of flowpaths within the plot which also contributes to relatively lower runoff and erosion at the outlet of the plot vannoppen et al 2015 meanwhile compared with 15 slopes increasing slope angle to 20 further aggravated soil erosion and tn loss fig 3 regardless of conventional flat planting or cross ridge grassed slopes both with 6 biochar m10 and m11 this is because the velocity of surface runoff increases with the increase of slope angle han et al 2021 then rill erosion begins as water flowing across the soil surface concentrates into small rivulets creating small channels s wang et al 2020 z q wang et al 2020 and degraded loose soil particles easily roll down and move because more of the slope steepness effect comes from erosion by surface runoff than by raindrop impact wu et al 2017 furthermore soils on steep slopes tend to be drier than in flatter areas because of increased runoff osman 2018 the splashing and scouring of initial rainstorms on loose soils led to the huge loss of dissolved and particulate n in the pathways of runoff and sediment wu et al 2018a thus generating an initial peak value of slope erosion and tn loss concentration more significantly the initial tn loss concentration of m11 6 biochar cross ridge planting grassed slope is much greater than that of m5 6 biochar cross ridge planting bare slope on 20 slopes and its slope surface is scoured and damaged more seriously than m5 fig 9 this is because the excessive biochar application 6 led to the increment of biological fixation of n and the decrease of plant available n contents wei et al 2018 which was not conducive to the growth of perennial ryegrass and caused the grass root rot hu et al 2019 the immature development of ryegrass rotten roots inevitably play a positive role in enhancing the anti erosion ability of soil especially for the cross ridge grassed slopes with 6 biochar it might however negatively impact soil conservation fang 2021 for instance wei et al 2018 found that the inhibition effect of biochar on soil erosion was the largest when its content reached 50 t hm 2 but the amount of n loss associated with eroded soil would double when the biochar content exceeded this level 4 3 surface pathways of nitrogen loss both pn and dn may be transported in surface runoff although the dominated n fractions usually change with agricultural management practices hatfield and follett 2008 overall grass could effectively reduce the loss of pn and decrease the pn tn ratio under different management scenarios at the plot scale e g the dn fractions exceeded 50 and increased with slope angle in grassed slope 54 01 59 50 and 66 48 this is because grass planting can increase rainwater infiltration and reduce runoff yield wu et al 2020 at the same time it intensifies the interaction between runoff and surface soil accelerates the release of soil n to runoff and increases the proportion of dn in runoff w wang et al 2019 g wang et al 2019 significantly the continuous impact of raindrops on unprotected soil can degrade soil structure poorly structured soil has little pore space for air and water because the soil aggregates are packed tightly dexter 2002 which slows down the water infiltration rate causes ponding in low lying sites or result in runoff and increases the loss potential of dissolved n guo et al 2019 moreover the drying rewetting alternation caused by consecutive rainstorm meets the moderate water conditions required for ammonia volatilization loss and soil water evaporation can promote the movement of soluble n on the soil surface thus increasing the rainstorm runoff loss of soluble n zhu 1997 more importantly with the increase of slope angle the overland flow accelerates and the dissolved n is brought downstream by runoff because of the lack of sufficient time for the water to infiltrate the soil ebrahimian et al 2012 however hillslope and catchment scale studies are necessary to trace the fate of n once mobilized along this pathway luo et al 2021 this is because it is still not clear to what extent particular n fractions once mobilized are modified before they reach the stream or at what distance the n source area is from the stream and whether mobilized n actually reaches it for instance xi et al 2021 found that the loss of n in beishahe watershed occurs mainly in particulate fractions 69 6 in pn and 30 4 in dn but the characteristics of n loss in this watershed are not consistent with the middle and lower reaches of hanjiang river with 5 7 66 7 pn and 33 3 94 3 dn shi et al 2002 this is because the driving mechanism of runoff sediment and nutrient loss on different scales differs greatly under the synthetic interaction of physical and anthropogenic factors such as climate topography soil land use type vegetation and human activities gong et al 2019 the effect of biochar application on the surface pathways of nutrient loss was complex ali et al 2020 first the concentration of tn loss especially for pn from 3 biochar grassed slope was relatively low under the rainfall intensity of 60 mm h 1 this is because 3 biochar may be the appropriate application amount which can not only increase the number of soil microorganisms improve soil ph value and the activities of soil enzymes and increase porosity and macroaggregates y wu et al 2018 x l wu et al 2018 but also increase soil nutrient supply capacity and promote soil infiltration performance and the absorption of available n by plants chen et al 2020 second the growth of lolium perenne under 6 biochar is poor because the excessive soil c n ratio owing to the high volatile matter in biochar reduced n fixed by soil inhibited soil n cycling and led to the decrease of n absorption by roots when the biochar content increased from 3 to 6 third the undeveloped root system of perennial ryegrass due to excessive biochar further aggravated the risks of sediment and pn loss this is because the poor development of perennial ryegrass had a negative effect on the biological aggregation of soil particles ye et al 2012 which changed soil physical structure decreased soil consistence accelerated soil nitrification process and also increased no3 n content in soil hui et al 2014 moreover the physical chemical and biological effects of biochar on crop and soil change considerably with the increase of application time for instance jones et al 2012 found that the crop yield did not increase in the first two years after applying biochar to farmland but the n content in crops increased effectively in the second year 4 4 paired samples t test grass cross ridge biochar and slope angle were selected as the four primary factors to conduct the paired t test of five environmental hydrology indicator including tn dn pn sediment and runoff under same subject two conditions of loessial bare and grassed sloping lands we designed 70 paired t tests and adopted a 05 level of significance as we used a small sample i most significant differences were observed between the eighteen paired dn samples n 18 p 0 01 and runoff samples n 18 p 0 05 for different treatments in bare and grassed slopes while there were no significant differences between the eighteen paired pn samples n 18 p 0 05 sediment samples n 18 p 0 01 and tn samples n 18 p 0 01 indicating that the effect of grass planting on dn and runoff was higher than that of sediment tn and pn under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity this is because stems and leaves of grass slow the rate of water flow across the surface decreasing the kinetic energy and allowing more time for the water and soil information to exchange thus decreasing runoff detachment and transportation and increasing the risk of dn loss harrington and harrington 2014 ii however only dn samples presented significant difference between cross ridge and conventional flat planting in bare and grassed slopes n 18 p 0 01 indicating that the cross ridge did not show evident interception effect on eroded soil particles under grassed slopes and 0 3 biochar level while cross ridge and grass planting allows more time for the water to infiltrate the soil intensifies the interaction between runoff and surface soil accelerates the release of soil n to runoff and increases the proportion of dn in runoff w wang et al 2019 g wang et al 2019 iii the different contents of biochar varied significantly under different treatments that is there were twelve paired samples with significant differences for bare slopes as follows six tn samples between 0 and 3 biochar n 6 p 0 01 six tn samples between 3 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six tn samples between 0 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 01 six dn samples between 0 and 3 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six dn samples between 0 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six pn samples between 0 and 3 biochar n 6 p 0 01 six pn samples between 3 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six pn samples between 0 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 01 six sediment samples between 0 and 3 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six sediment samples between 0 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 01 six runoff samples between 0 and 3 biochar n 6 p 0 01 and six runoff samples between 0 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 in comparison there were six paired samples with significant differences for grassed slopes as follows six tn samples between 3 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six tn samples between 0 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six pn samples between 3 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six pn samples between 0 and 6 biochar n 6 p 0 05 six sediment samples between 0 and 3 biochar n 6 p 0 05 and six runoff samples between 0 and 3 biochar n 6 p 0 05 the above statistical analysis reconfirmed that excessive biochar could aggravate tn and sediment loss regardless of the slopes being bare or grassed while grass planting weakened the number of significant differences between different biochar contents and the probability of significant difference between different biochar contents in bare slopes was higher than grassed slopes under different treatments moreover dn and pn levels under 0 biochar content were much closer to those under 3 biochar content under the grassed slope than to those under bare slope iv for 30 designed t tests of 10 15 and 20 slopes there were only three cases with significant differences between the three different slopes e g six pn samples n 6 p 0 05 and six sediment samples n 6 p 0 05 between 15 and 20 bare slope six sediment samples between 10 and 20 bare slope n 6 p 0 05 indicating that the increase of slope angle has the most significant impact on sediment yield compared with other environmental hydrology indicators especially when the bare slope rises to steep slope this is because the increase in erosion is linear with the increase in steepness and wetting and drying cycles decrease erodibility sun et al 2021 5 conclusions laboratory studies with simulated consecutive rainstorms with the controlled conditions of biochar planting modes grass antecedent soil moisture rainfall intensity and slope angle were innovatively adopted to investigate the surface pathways of runoff n and the optimal configuration mechanism of agricultural management practices in sloping lands biochar within the range of 0 3 can be combined with cross ridge on the grassed slope to reduce sediment and n loss through intercepting the surface pathways associated with soil erosion but it is not recommended to employ biochar and cross ridge independently or in combination on bare slope runoff n on bare slopes occurs mainly in particulate fraction while on grassed slopes it occurs mainly in dissolved fraction with the variation in particulate n fractions depending largely on different physical factors such as precipitation the soil infiltration capacity of the soil surface and different underlying surfaces no matter the scale agricultural management practices should focus on the reduction of pollutants delivery from slope runoff processes however it is difficult to quantify the impact of specific changes in agricultural interventions at watershed scale owing to lags in effects variations in rainfall and overlapping practices and more importantly sizing the capacities of the appropriate bmps for large storms and steep slopes is not only expensive but also ineffective for pollution control these findings aim to help conserve soil and develop sustainable agriculture in ways that are ecologically

9722,the 2025 goal of the chesapeake bay program is to reduce agriculture s nitrogen n loading by 20 from 2014 values cover cropping is an important best management practice for recycling and conserving n in cropping systems that might otherwise be lost to groundwater via leaching and runoff the reduction of n leaching by winter cover crops depends largely on precipitation timing of planting and the selection of the appropriate crop species we compared nitrate nitrogen no3 n leaching losses among forage radish raphanus sativus l cereal rye secale cereal l a forage radish cereal rye mixture and no cover control replicated field trials were conducted at the university of maryland central maryland research and education center over 2016 2018 we collected porewater from 60 cm below the ground surface using porous cup lysimeters following rainfall events and used no3 n concentrations paired with the hydrus 1 d soil moisture model to compare n leaching losses in kg n ha 1 among cover crop treatments we show that mean soil porewater no3 n concentrations were higher by 5x in the no cover control compared to rye and radish rye treatments p 0 0001 overall n leaching losses kg n ha 1 were highest in the no cover control plots p 0 0001 but the majority of n leaching losses in rye plots occurred during the fall while the majority of radish n leaching losses occurred during the winter and spring after they winter killed the rye and radish rye mixtures reduced n leaching losses by 80 in both years understanding how different cover crop species affect n leaching losses can help us design cropping systems to minimize n losses to the chesapeake bay especially as climate change alters rainfall patterns across the region keywords cover crops cereal rye forage radish nitrate nitrogen leaching hydrus 1 introduction 1 1 cover crops and nitrogen nitrogen n loss from agricultural fields via leaching and runoff has an impact on the health of the chesapeake bay watershed kemp et al 2005 lassaletta et al 2014 nitrate nitrogen no3 n losses from agriculture are highest during the late fall through mid spring in the mid atlantic us dinnes et al 2002 cover crops planted in the fall and grown throughout the spring capture surplus n left on fields after the cash crop harvest and reduce n losses to water bodies chatterjee and clay 2017 dinnes et al 2002 meisinger et al 1991 quemada et al 2013 thapa et al 2018a tonitto et al 2006 tully and ryals 2017 in addition to reductions in n leaching losses cover crops provide a suite of agroecosystem services such as weed suppression soil carbon sequestration reduction in runoff and erosion alleviation of soil compaction improved microbial properties and soil aggregate formation blanco canqui et al 2015 tully and ryals 2017 here we focus on quantifying reductions in n leaching losses under different cover crop species farmers can manage cover crops for the magnitude of the benefits provided to the agroecosystem by altering planting date termination timing termination method and cover crop species planted blanco canqui et al 2015 chatterjee and clay 2017 thapa et al 2018a 2018b species selection such as the sowing of a grass and or brassica is an important management decision for example the taproot of the brassica species forage radish raphanus sativus l grows quickly alleviates soil compaction and rapidly scavenges residual soil n that may reduce n leaching losses in the fall dean and weil 2009 white and weil 2011 forage radish roots may reach 1 m in depth in 43 days and the fine roots can grow as deep as 2 m chen and weil 2009 in addition to the quick establishment of forage radish another benefit is that it winter kills when exposed to air temperatures below 4 c for several days lawley et al 2012 winter kill of forage radish eliminates the need for and cost of agrochemicals as well as the labor and fuel needed for terminating cover crops weil and kremen 2007 however there is a potential risk of n leaching in the spring via the channel remaining as the taproot degrades after forage radish winter kills and the ground thaws dean and weil 2009 grasses such as cereal rye secale cereal l grow slowly in the fall are winter hardy and are effective at scavenging residual soil n and suppressing n leaching from winter to spring meisinger et al 1991 thapa et al 2018a the roots of cereal rye may take 69 days to reach 1 m about 40 longer than forage radish kristensen and thorup kristensen 2004 compared to forage radish cereal rye has a thinner more fibrous root structure which allows it to widely explore the upper portions of the soil profile chen and weil 2009 kristensen and thorup kristensen 2004 additionally these fibrous roots can increase soil organic matter and improve the water holding capacity of the surface soil blanco canqui et al 2015 chatterjee and clay 2017 thus many believe that the mixture of forage radish and cereal rye may optimize agroecosystem services provisioning due to the combined benefits of both species blanco canqui et al 2015 thapa et al 2018b 1 2 measuring and modeling nitrogen leaching losses accurately estimating n leaching losses from cover crop mixtures requires data on soil solution chemistry and drainage past a defined lower boundary in the soil to date researchers have adopted several methods to quantify n leaching including 1 installation of porous cup lysimeters also called tension or ceramic cup lysimeters 2 drainage lysimeters also known as monoliths 3 subsurface drains or pans or 4 periodic soil collection and extraction of mineral soil n lamba et al 2013 meisinger and ricigliano 2017 russo et al 2017 vanek and drinkwater 2013 among these methods drainage lysimeters and subsurface drains or pans are labor and cost intensive lamba et al 2013 and require a large sampling area to obtain a field representative sample netto et al 1999 pampolino et al 2000 soil no3 n concentrations from extractions may provide an indirect estimate of no3 n leaching and require multiple collections but are sensitive to changes in soil texture and precipitation porous cup lysimeters can be easily installed with a soil probe sampled daily and minimize soil disturbance compared to other instruments russo et al 2017 tully and weil 2014 because installation of porous cup lysimeters cause minimal soil disturbance they are useful for conducting research on farms or small research plots however porous cup lysimeters may only sample macropore flow and overestimate soil solution concentrations porous cup lysimeters may also miss capturing diluted solution that passes through micropore drainage pathways russo et al 2017 van der laan et al 2014 soil solution no3 n concentrations and simulated drainage rates can be used to estimate no3 n leaching in a soil hydraulic model ajdary et al 2007 perego et al 2012 russo et al 2017 van der laan et al 2014 the hydrus 1 d šimůnek et al 2016 is a commonly used public domain hydraulic modeling program used for the analysis of water flow and solute transport through variably saturated porous media the hydrus 1 d program numerically solves the richards equation richards 1931 to simulate infiltration and redistribution of water soil hydraulic models provide an understanding of the complex interactions that occur among precipitation level of nutrient application level of crop root uptake crop yield erosion runoff and leaching ajdary et al 2007 however to use these models correctly they require calibration for soil texture crop species meteorological and atmospheric conditions 1 3 study objectives the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the effect of cover crop species and mixtures on solution no3 n concentrations over their growing season and 2 use a soil water simulation model hydrus 1 d specifically calibrated for our medium textured soils to estimate drainage and n leaching losses by individual cover crop species and in combination we hypothesize that cereal rye and forage radish mixtures would be more effective at reducing n leaching loss in both the fall and the spring than either species alone we tested our hypothesis by estimating n leaching losses over the course of two growing seasons in a radish rye mixture radish and rye monocultures and a no cover control this research combines field data with mathematical modeling to broaden our understanding of the role cover crop species can have in reducing n leaching losses in a typical mid atlantic cropping system 2 methods 2 1 study sites

phosphonomethyl glycine in early june of both study years table 1 porous cup lysimeters 22 mm diameter soil solution access tubes irrometer riverside california usa were installed at 60 cm below the ground surface following planting table 1 although porous cup lysimeters use tension to collect soil solution and may sample macropore dominated flow leading to an overestimation of soil solution no3 n russo et al 2017 they minimally disturb the soil and therefore are ideal for small plot research experiments such as the one described here four lysimeters were installed in each plot two in cover crop rows and two between the rows total of 32 and 64 lysimeters installed in year 1 and 2 respectively table 1 to install the lysimeters we bored a hole to 60 cm using a 23 8 mm diameter probe we made a soil slurry using bottled water and soil from the lowest depth of each plot the slurry was poured into the hole before inserting the lysimeter to ensure good soil contact lysimeters were sealed at the soil surface with a bentonite sand mixture to avoid preferential flow of water down the sides of the tube pilot studies confirmed that soil solution collection was only possible following rain events that were 6 mm or greater thus soil solution was only collected following rain events of this size which we monitored using weather data from a nearby 1 2 km meteorological tower located at the beltsville agricultural research center in beltsville md each day before sampling lysimeters were purged of any water and an internal pressure of 60 to 70 kpa was applied soil solutions were collected filtered whatman no 42 2 5 µm and stored in a freezer at 20 c until further analysis the soil solutions were analyzed on a lachat quikchem 8500 hach co loveland co for ammonium nh4 n and no3 n using the sodium salicylate us epa 1983 and cadmium reduction fisherman and friedman 1989 methods respectively samples analyzed for nh4 n were either at or below the method detection limit therefore we focus on no3 n if no3 n concentrations exceeded the highest calibration standard within the detectable range of the colorimeter they were diluted with deionized water usually 1 2 and reanalyzed soil volumetric water content and temperature data were collected continuously every 10 min throughout the cover crop growing season using time domain reflectometers tdrs true tdr 310s acclima meridian idaho usa during the first study year 2016 2017 tdrs were installed at three depths 0 10 20 30 and 50 60 cm on 14 feb 2017 and removed on 24 may 2017 in two of the four blocks total of 18 tdrs in year 1 we found little moisture variability at 50 60 cm so in the second study year 2017 2018 tdrs were only installed at 0 10 and 10 20 cm on 28 oct 2017 and removed on 5 jun 2018 total of 24 tdrs in all four of the blocks during both study years the tdrs were installed in only the radish rye and the no cover control plots these data on volumetric water content were used to calculate infiltration volume in the radish rye and no cover control plots data reported in fig s2 and s3 we then used data on percent cover to estimate the water balance in the radish rye mixture plot 2 3 calculating infiltration we used the tdr vwc data to calculate net infiltration of water as runoff was observed at the site but not measured our method is a better estimate of net infiltration than using rainfall only following a rain event 0 0254 cm minimum amount recorded by rain gauge for a given hour we summed the total profile volumetric water content year 1 0 60 cm and year 2 0 20 cm at the plot level using tdr data then we calculated the hourly water contents for each hour of the rain event and for 7 h following the termination of the rain event we calculated the differences between each hour and differences 0 cm were considered indicative of downward water movement into the profile e g water entering the measured profile and deemed infiltration in cm only hourly differences of 2 5 cm or less were summed to reduce the variability due to high rainfall events high rainfall events greater than 2 5 cm of rain per hour were relatively rare and the relationship between infiltration and rainfall became non linear at higher rainfall amounts this was because the measurement interval for water content was 10 min and because water contents were not changing greatly the tdr did not capture the steady state infiltration rates occurring at higher rainfall amounts the sum of these differences was recorded as total infiltration for that rain event starr and timlin 2004 we used linear univariate regression of total infiltration as calculated above for each rain event vs total rainfall for that event weather station data with no intercept to calculate net infiltration accounting for runoff as a function of rainfall for each plot due to the reasons given above if the total rainfall for an event was greater than 4 cm it was excluded from the regression we selected this method of accounting for runoff instead of other available methods e g soil conservation service curve number method usda scs 1985 because it allowed us to use our field based measurements e g tdr vwc data rather than coefficients assigned to different hydrologic groups and cover types e g no measured data because steady state movement of water in the profile is not detected by the tdr measurements this method can underestimate infiltration however the 10 min measurement intervals will minimize this error 2 4 modeling drainage using hydrus to calculate drainage volume cm3 cm 2 we used a public domain finite element water movement and solute transport model hydrus 1 d for analysis of one dimensional water flow šimůnek et al 2016 the model is being used to augment the tdr data in order to better calculate drainage through the use of hydrus 1 d we can separate the components of evapotranspiration in the tdr data during periods of decreasing water contents the model uses as input hourly measurements of solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and temperature to calculate evapotranspiration using a modified penman monteith equation šimůnek et al 2016 these data came from a nearby 1 2 km meteorological tower at the beltsville agricultural research center to calculate hourly drainage rates we input hourly estimated net infiltration as described above as precipitation into hydrus 1 d we used infiltration calculated from the tdr data as the input parameter for our drainage model rather than precipitation as we determined this was the most robust method for estimating and removing water lost to runoff tables s3 4 thus we ran the model without runoff hydrus 1 d separates evaporation from transpiration using crop height given as input and a root water uptake submodel the root water uptake submodel requires data on plant height and rooting depth through time to calculate hourly transpiration measuring rooting depth in situ would have been destructive to our small no till research plots therefore we interpolated field measurements of cover crop height throughout the growing season to calculate hourly heights we estimated daily root depth for rye and radish following kristensen and thorup kristensen 2004 we assumed the growth rate for radish roots increased linearly until the winter kill event whereas the growth rate for rye roots increased linearly during the fall and plateaued in the winter due to dormancy and then recommenced in the spring in year 1 2016 2017 we determined that radish winter killed between 9 and 11 dec 2016 when air temperatures dipped below 4 c in year 2 2017 2018 we determined that radish winter killed between 5 and 7 jan 2018 when soil temperatures dipped below 4 c we set a maximum rooting depth of 60 cm for both radish and rye as that was the mean depth to a root limiting clay layer in the studied soils we assumed there was no plant cover or root growth in the no cover plots for modeling purposes as very little weed cover was observed in those plots the soil profile geometry for our model consisted of four soil materials at 0 15 15 30 30 45 and 45 60 cm hydrus 1 d uses the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 to calculate the water retention for each soil depth which we calibrated using our measured volumetric water content vwc data in year 1 the hydraulic model began on 3 jan 2017 first soil solution collection date due to low rainfall and the modeled volumetric water contents were calibrated using 10 weeks 20 mar 30 may 2017 of measured continuous every 10 min vwc values from 0 to 10 and 20 30 cm from two of the four blocks fig 1 in year 2 the hydraulic model began on 1 oct 2017 and the modeled vwc were calibrated to fit 18 weeks 31 oct 21 dec 2017 and 21 mar 5 jun 2018 of measured continuous vwc at 0 10 and 10 20 cm from all four blocks fig 2 we compared the measured to the modeled vwc and adjusted theta saturation θs theta residual θr alpha α and n to fit the modeled to the measured vwc at the block level tables s3 and s4 theta saturation is the soil water content near saturation of the pores with water θr is the water content below which liquid water movement is minimal and n and α alpha determine the slope of the water retention curve at various soil water potentials another important parameter for calibration is the relative permeability k sat which we determined using data from the web soil survey for each of the four soil materials by soil depth at our sites soil survey staff 2020c using these input parameters hydrus calculated hourly drainage volume for the monoculture plots we then used data on percent cover e g rows of radish and rows of rye and drainage in the radish and rye monocultures to calculate the estimated hourly radish rye drainage volume eq 1 table 1 eq 1 radish rye mixture drainage rows of radish total rows radish drainage rows of rye total rows rye drainage finally we calculated seasonal drainage from the sum of hourly drainage values 2 5 calculation of n leaching loss as we could only collect soil solution following rainfall events 6 mm we used linear interpolation to estimate the no3 n concentration on days for which we did not have a measured concentration approxfun stats package 3 5 3 r core team 2019 the modeled daily soil drainage volumes were multiplied by the daily no3 n concentrations scaled to kg ha 1 and summed across seasons to provide final estimates of n leaching losses 2 6 study limitations and assumptions a runoff study was attempted but due to multiple complications and instrument error we decided not to measure runoff directly but used information from the tdr probes because we did not have information on soil water potentials below the 60 cm control zone with the tdr probes we could not measure steady state movement of water from the bottom of the profile the conductivity of this layer is very low so it was likely that water movement past 60 cm was slow such that there was not significant vertical drainage during a rainfall event that lasted as much as 10 h in addition the one dimensional model does not capture any lateral movement of water flow which could have resulted in differences in water budgets due to run on and runoff there were no tdr probes installed in the radish rye mixture we used a weighted average approach to calculate the drainage in the mixture based on the radish rye distribution described in eq 1 the canopies of the rye and radish crops were not were coexistent the canopy of each crop was largely active during different times the radish was dominant during the fall and late winter sep to dec while the rye canopy was dominant in the late winter and spring dec to apr as a result radish covered the soil approximately 30 40 of the time while the rye covered the soil the other 60 70 a similar ratio to the mix and reinforcing the estimated distribution 2 7 statistical approach to examine the overall effect of cover crop species on soil solution no3 n concentrations we used a linear mixed effect model lmer package for r bates et al 2013 with cover crop treatment and collection date as the main effects and block as a random effect years were analyzed separately to examine the effect of cover crop species on soil solution no3 n concentrations within a season e g fall winter spring we used another linear mixed effect model with cover crop treatment as the main effect and block as a random effect seasons were defined using the equinox and solstice for fall 23 sep 20 dec winter 21 dec 20 mar and spring 21 mar 21 june tukey post hoc tests were used to examine pairwise comparisons among cover crop treatments multcomp hothorn et al 2008 in year 1 the tdrs were only installed in two blocks so we were unable to statistically determine differences in cumulative growing season n leaching losses kg n ha 1 however in year 2 tdrs were installed in every block total of four which allowed us to examine the effect of cover crop treatment on cumulative growing season drainage and n leaching losses to test for the effect of cover crop treatment across the entire cover crop growing season we used a linear mixed effects model with cover crop treatment as a main effect and block as a random effect we also examined seasonal differences in n leaching among the cover crop treatments using the same linear mixed effect model design as above tukey post hoc tests were used to examine pairwise comparisons among cover crop treatments multcomp hothorn et al 2008 if data were not normally distributed concentration and leaching data were transformed using a box cox transformation to satisfy the assumptions of the statistical models box and cox 1964 differences were considered significant at p 0 05 all data were analyzed in the r environment for pc r core team 2020 3 results 3 1 cover crops altered evapotranspiration and drainage modeled cumulative transpiration jan jun 2017 tracked plant growth and was highest in the cereal rye treatment in year 1 9 9 cm fig 1c but in year 2 the radish treatment initially had highest cumulative transpiration 2 5 cm until the winter kill event in late jan 2018 fig 1d when it leveled off cereal rye had the highest cumulative transpiration until termination in the spring through summer of year 2 21 mar 5 june 2018 6 4 cm fig 1d we assumed negligible observable plant growth in no cover control plots and thus the highest evaporation fig 1a and b and zero transpiration fig 1c and d in the no cover control plots across both years therefore cumulative evapotranspiration et was highest in the rye and radish rye plots across the growing season in both years fig 1e and f because soil water measurements in the first study year did not start until january of the following year 2017 we did not have tdr data to estimate water use in radish in the fall of 2016 thus cumulative transpiration for radish in that year would have been underestimated as more water infiltrated in year 2 than year 1 estimates of cumulative drainage were higher in year 2 past the 60 cm depth fig 2 and table 3 although not significant in year 1 estimated cumulative drainage tended to be higher in the radish treatment 38 2 cm in year 2 cumulative drainage was significantly higher in the control treatment 51 4 cm than any other treatment and radish was significantly higher than rye and the radish rye mixture p 0 0002 fig 2 table 3 in year 2 there was no difference among treatments in the fall but differences in drainage emerged among the treatments in the winter and spring fig 2 table 3 3 2 soil solution no3 n concentrations through time soil solution nh4 n concentrations were at or below the method detection limit across the duration of the study thus we only focus on no3 n concentrations in year 1 2016 2017 soil solution no3 n concentrations varied significantly throughout the year in all cover crop treatments p 0 0001 ranging from 0 to 82 mg no3 n l 1 fig s4a overall concentrations under rye and radish rye were significantly lower than under radish alone and no cover control p 0 0001 table 4 in year 1 soil solution was only collected in the winter and spring of 2017 due to minimal precipitation and drought conditions in the fall of 2016 table 4 in the winter of 2017 soil solution no3 n concentrations were highest under the control and radish than the other treatments p 0 0001 table 4 in the spring of 2017 year 1 soil solution no3 n concentrations were highest under the control than in all other treatments p 0 0001 table 4 soil solution no3 n concentrations in the spring were also higher under radish than rye p 0 04 mean annual soil solution no3 n concentrations in year 2 2017 2018 varied significantly throughout the year in all cover crop treatments p 0 001 fig s4b and were significantly lower under radish rye and radish rye than the no cover control p 0 0001 table 5 in the fall of 2017 soil solution no3 n concentrations were lowest under the radish than all other treatments p 0 0008 in the winter and spring of 2018 soil solution no3 n concentrations differed significantly by treatment p 0 0001 in both cases with the highest concentrations under the no cover control compared to all other treatments soil solution no3 n concentrations were also significantly higher under the radish treatments compared to the rye alone and radish rye p 0 0001 in both the winter and spring 3 3 estimated n leaching losses in year 1 estimated cumulative n leaching losses decreased in the order no cover control radish radish rye rye table 5 and fig 3 there were no significant differences detected among the treatments estimated cumulative n leaching losses in kg ha 1 under rye radish rye and radish were 86 80 and 13 lower respectively than under the no cover control table 5 we estimated high rates of leaching losses under the radish in both the winter and spring following winter kill rye and radish rye leaching losses were slightly higher in the winter when rye biomass was small and declined in the spring and summer when rye transpiration increased due to increased biomass and leaf area index fig 3 in year 2 total cumulative n leaching losses were significantly higher under the no cover control than under any other treatment p 0 0001 table 5 and fig 3 estimated cumulative n leaching losses under rye radish rye and radish were 94 92 and 85 lower respectively than under the no cover control table 5 in year 2 the majority of the estimated n leaching losses under rye and radish rye occurred in the winter 6 1 and 5 0 kg n ha 1 respectively but dropped to 0 2 kg n ha 1 or less in the spring table 5 fig 3 on the other hand n leaching losses under radish were lowest in the fall before winter kill 0 9 kg n ha 1 and highest in the winter after the january winter kill 9 0 kg n ha 1 table 5 fig 3 more specifically in the fall and winter n leaching losses were significantly higher under the no cover control than the cover crop treatments p 0 014 and p 0 0001 respectively in the spring n leaching losses decreased in the order no cover control radish rye radish rye p 0 001 for all comparisons table 5 fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 cover crops altered evapotranspiration and drainage cover crops can alter the amount of water moving down through the soil profile by modifying evaporation and transpiration rates brill and neal 1950 dabney 1998 kaspar et al 2001 for example if soils are bare or germination is poor evaporation will dominate but transpiration will dominate under a healthy cover crop stand fig 1a and b cumulative et was higher in the rye and radish rye plots as greater biomass led to higher transpiration rates compared to the control and radish alone table s5 overall estimated cumulative drainage was similar among all the treatments ranging from 25 to 38 cm in year 1 and 42 52 cm in year 2 table 3 however the high drainage in the radish plots was likely because the radish root system may create taproot channels that can increase water flow especially in the spring after forage radish winter kills and the ground thaws dean and weil 2009 drainage was also highest in the control plots in both years and significantly so in year 2 as the lack of weed growth limited transpiration meisinger et al 1991 4 2 cover crops altered soil solution no3 n concentrations through time in the fall of 2016 year 1 exceptional drought conditions reduced the volume of soil solution collections national drought resilience partnership ndrp 2020a in the fall of 2017 year 2 soil solution no3 n concentrations were lower under radish than all other treatments as the radish accumulated more n in its tissues in the fall than rye alone dean and weil 2009 table s6 mean soil solution no3 n concentrations were much higher under radish in year 1 10 0 mg l 1 than year 2 3 8 mg l 1 due to differences in planting date between the two years table 4 in year 1 the radish had 52 days to establish and grow whereas in year 2 the radish had 107 days to establish and grow leading to lower biomass accumulation in year 1 0 6 mg ha 1 than year 2 3 0 mg ha 1 table s5 a similar pattern was found in a global meta analysis which indicated that n leaching losses under cover crops are significantly lower than a no cover control if the cover crops can accumulate 4 mg ha 1 of aboveground biomass before termination thapa et al 2018a unlike radish planting later in the fall did not impact the rye s ability to reduce the soil solution no3 n concentrations in either mixture or monoculture since most of rye s growth occurs from late winter to spring soil solution no3 n concentrations in the radish rye mixture followed similar patterns to the rye monoculture further the radish rye mixtures had low mean soil solution no3 n concentrations across the study period 3 mg no3 n l 1 table 4 in both years despite doubling the radish seeding rates in the mixture year 1 2 8 kg ha 1 radish seed year 2 4 5 kg ha 1 radish seed table 1 and planting densities year 1 1 row rye to 1 row radish year 2 2 rows rye to 1 row radish table 1 this suggests that overall the effects of rye on leaching supersede those of radish however in regions with high levels of rainfall in the fall or with increasing intensity of storms with climate change as is predicted in many areas hsiang et al 2017 rojas et al 2019 taylor et al 2012 radish may play an important role in lowering soil solution no3 n concentrations in the fall 4 3 cover crops reduce estimated leaching compared to no cover control most of the studies investigating n leaching losses of cover crops include monocultures e g brassicas grasses and legumes or grass legume mixtures to our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the efficacy of grass brassica mixtures in reducing n leaching losses compared to their monoculture counterparts or a no cover control in year 2 we show that planting cover crops reduced n leaching losses by at least 85 compared to the no cover control we found that n leaching losses from radish rye mixtures were comparable to rye monoculture in years where the brassica can establish early a mixture with radish or other brassica may slightly reduce n leaching losses even compared to a rye or other grass monoculture unlike other studies we found relatively high n leaching losses from radish monocultures after winter kill early jan to late may for example constantin et al 2010 found that n leaching losses were smaller under radish 11 15 kg n ha 1 than rye 39 kg n ha 1 however they planted radish well before winter kill in early august to late september due to the timing of weather events in year 1 of our study we were unable to plant cover crops until mid october which led to poor radish establishment and thus higher leaching losses under radish alone 53 5 kg n ha 1 than rye alone 8 3 kg n ha 1 table 5 in year 2 we were able to plant cover crops by mid september and calculated lower n leaching losses under radish across the study period 18 3 kg n ha 1 but still higher than rye and radish rye mixtures 8 6 kg n ha 1 table 5 thus the timing of radish planting in the fall appears to be an important driver of n leaching losses whether in monoculture or a mixture further even though cover crops were planted after the ideal date in year 1 the rye and radish rye mixtures were still capable of drawing n leaching losses down by at least 80 compared to the no cover control in year 2 when all the cover crops were planted on time rye alone and radish rye mixtures reduced n leaching losses by over 93 compared to the no cover control indicating that mixtures may provide reliable n leaching reductions despite climate variability in mid atlantic cropping systems it is important to note that we applied n fertilizer to the surface in the fall before planting cover crops rather than following a corn harvest which would have meant that residual n was at a deeper soil depth dean and weil 2009 the application of n on the soil surface may have led to an advantage for rye over radish because of differences in rooting depths dean and weil 2009 kristensen and thorup kristensen 2004 on similar soils no3 n leaching losses under rye monocultures ranged from 2 to 124 kg n ha 1 brandi dohrn et al 1997 feaga et al 2010 meisinger and ricigliano 2017 compared to 8 10 kg n ha 1 in this study suggesting that our estimated n leaching losses are on the low end however differences in planting and termination dates beckwith et al 2006 heinrich et al 2014 kaspar et al 2001 precipitation constantin et al 2010 feaga et al 2010 residual soil n levels and farm management brandi dohrn et al 1997 could explain why our n leaching losses were low compared to the other studies interestingly our estimated n leaching losses are extremely high under the no cover control in year 2 123 kg n ha 1 similar to the amount of n we added to surface soils to simulate high levels of residual soil n 140 kg n ha 1 as previously mentioned we assumed zero transpiration from the no cover plots although we acknowledge that any weeds would transpire small amounts of water throughout the study period still drainage rates were not particularly high in the no cover plots compared to the cover crop plots rather the high rate of n loss was clearly driven by the exceptionally high soil solution no3 n concentrations under no cover plots across all seasons of note the increase in cumulative precipitation and drainage from year 1 to year 2 fig s1 did not impact the ability of the rye monoculture or the radish rye mixture to reduce estimated n leaching which remained around 9 kg n ha 1 across the study period table 5 our data suggest that if a farmer is trying to suppress n leaching losses forage radish can be a viable option but should probably be planted in mixture with a grass indeed the forage radish can provide a suite of agroecosystem benefits such as fast fall growth and biotillage to reduce soil compaction dean and weil 2009 white and weil 2011 thus radish should not be overlooked as a potentially beneficial cover crop however radish planted in mixtures will more consistently reduce n leaching losses across a wide range of management practices and climates 5 conclusions cover crop mixtures and monocultures reduced estimated n leaching losses compared to a no control the ability of radish to suppress n leaching largely depended on when it was planted and when it winter killed monoculture radish planted early in the fall suppressed n leaching losses during the fall and winter months rye however was more effective than radish at reducing leaching in the spring as it continued to grow and transpire water following the winter months the radish rye mixture more consistently reduced no3 n concentrations than either species planted in monoculture but performed similarly to rye monocultures in terms of n leaching losses which were at least 80 lower than a no cover control in both study years thus our work indicates that radish rye cover crop mixtures could reduce n leaching losses across a range of climates in the mid atlantic region table 2 declaration of competing

9722,the 2025 goal of the chesapeake bay program is to reduce agriculture s nitrogen n loading by 20 from 2014 values cover cropping is an important best management practice for recycling and conserving n in cropping systems that might otherwise be lost to groundwater via leaching and runoff the reduction of n leaching by winter cover crops depends largely on precipitation timing of planting and the selection of the appropriate crop species we compared nitrate nitrogen no3 n leaching losses among forage radish raphanus sativus l cereal rye secale cereal l a forage radish cereal rye mixture and no cover control replicated field trials were conducted at the university of maryland central maryland research and education center over 2016 2018 we collected porewater from 60 cm below the ground surface using porous cup lysimeters following rainfall events and used no3 n concentrations paired with the hydrus 1 d soil moisture model to compare n leaching losses in kg n ha 1 among cover crop treatments we show that mean soil porewater no3 n concentrations were higher by 5x in the no cover control compared to rye and radish rye treatments p 0 0001 overall n leaching losses kg n ha 1 were highest in the no cover control plots p 0 0001 but the majority of n leaching losses in rye plots occurred during the fall while the majority of radish n leaching losses occurred during the winter and spring after they winter killed the rye and radish rye mixtures reduced n leaching losses by 80 in both years understanding how different cover crop species affect n leaching losses can help us design cropping systems to minimize n losses to the chesapeake bay especially as climate change alters rainfall patterns across the region keywords cover crops cereal rye forage radish nitrate

sowing of a grass and or brassica is an important management decision for example the taproot of the brassica species forage radish raphanus sativus l grows quickly alleviates soil compaction and rapidly scavenges residual soil n that may reduce n leaching losses in the fall dean and weil 2009 white and weil 2011 forage radish roots may reach 1 m in depth in 43 days and the fine roots can grow as deep as 2 m chen and weil 2009 in addition to the quick establishment of forage radish another benefit is that it winter kills when exposed to air temperatures below 4 c for several days lawley et al 2012 winter kill of forage radish eliminates the need for and cost of agrochemicals as well as the labor and fuel needed for terminating cover crops weil and kremen 2007 however there is a potential risk of n leaching in the spring via the channel remaining as the taproot degrades after forage radish winter kills and the ground thaws dean and weil 2009 grasses such as cereal rye secale cereal l grow slowly in the fall are winter hardy and are effective at scavenging residual soil n and suppressing n leaching from winter to spring meisinger et al 1991 thapa et al 2018a the roots of cereal rye may take 69 days to reach 1 m about 40 longer than forage radish kristensen and thorup kristensen 2004 compared to forage radish cereal rye has a thinner more fibrous root structure which allows it to widely explore the upper portions of the soil profile chen and weil 2009 kristensen and thorup kristensen 2004 additionally these fibrous roots can increase soil organic matter and improve the water holding capacity of the surface soil blanco canqui et al 2015 chatterjee and clay 2017 thus many believe that the mixture of forage radish and cereal rye may optimize agroecosystem services provisioning due to the combined benefits of both species blanco canqui et al 2015 thapa et al 2018b 1 2 measuring and modeling nitrogen leaching losses accurately estimating n leaching losses from cover crop mixtures requires data on soil solution chemistry and drainage past a defined lower boundary in the soil to date researchers have adopted several methods to quantify n leaching including 1 installation of porous cup lysimeters also called tension or ceramic cup lysimeters 2 drainage lysimeters also known as monoliths 3 subsurface drains or pans or 4 periodic soil collection and extraction of mineral soil n lamba et al 2013 meisinger and ricigliano 2017 russo et al 2017 vanek and drinkwater 2013 among these methods drainage lysimeters and subsurface drains or pans are labor and cost intensive lamba et al 2013 and require a large sampling area to obtain a field representative sample netto et al 1999 pampolino et al 2000 soil no3 n concentrations from extractions may provide an indirect estimate of no3 n leaching and require multiple collections but are sensitive to changes in soil texture and precipitation porous cup lysimeters can be easily installed with a soil probe sampled daily and minimize soil disturbance compared to other instruments russo et al 2017 tully and weil 2014 because installation of porous cup lysimeters cause minimal soil disturbance they are useful for conducting research on farms or small research plots however porous cup lysimeters may only sample macropore flow and overestimate soil solution concentrations porous cup lysimeters may also miss capturing diluted solution that passes through micropore drainage pathways russo et al 2017 van der laan et al 2014 soil solution no3 n concentrations and simulated drainage rates can be used to estimate no3 n leaching in a soil hydraulic model ajdary et al 2007 perego et al 2012 russo et al 2017 van der laan et al 2014 the hydrus 1 d šimůnek et al 2016 is a commonly used public domain hydraulic modeling program used for the analysis of water flow and solute transport through variably saturated porous media the hydrus 1 d program numerically solves the richards equation richards 1931 to simulate infiltration and redistribution of water soil hydraulic models provide an understanding of the complex interactions that occur among precipitation level of nutrient application level of crop root uptake crop yield erosion runoff and leaching ajdary et al 2007 however to use these models correctly they require calibration for soil texture crop species meteorological and atmospheric conditions 1 3 study objectives the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the effect of cover crop species and mixtures on solution no3 n concentrations over their growing season and 2 use a soil water simulation model hydrus 1 d specifically calibrated for our medium textured soils to estimate drainage and n leaching losses by individual cover crop species and in combination we hypothesize that cereal rye and forage radish mixtures would be more effective at reducing n leaching loss in both the fall and the spring than either species alone we tested our hypothesis by estimating n leaching losses over the course of two growing seasons in a radish rye mixture radish and rye monocultures and a no cover control this research combines field data with mathematical modeling to broaden our understanding of the role cover crop species can have in reducing n leaching losses in a typical mid atlantic cropping system 2 methods 2 1 study sites this study was conducted near laurel maryland at the university of maryland central maryland research and education center umd cmrec 39 01 40 n 76 50 14 w from 2016 to 2018 in 1988 the land was converted from pasture into research plots the site has been cropped continuously under no till management since that time the soils at the study site are a russett christiana complex where the russett surface soil is classified as loam or sandy loam and the christiana surface soil is classified as silt loam tables s1 and s2 soil bulk density at the site ranges from 1 3 to 1 8 g cm 3 depending on the soil texture and depth high bulk density at about 60 cm limits root activity to the surface soil layers the site receives an average of 1192 mm annual rainfall has a mean minimum temperature of 8 2 c and a mean maximum temperature of 19 c national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2020b in year 1 the site received 520 mm of rain across the cover crop growing season 1 oct 2016 5 jun 2017 table 1 fig s1 over the simulation period in year 1 3 jan 2017 27 may 2017 the site received 389 mm of rain fig s1 in year 2 the site received 659 mm across the cover crop growing season 22 sep 2017 5jun 2018 table 1 fig s1 the simulation and crop growing seasons were the same in the second year 2 2 experimental design experimental plots were established in a randomized complete block design with four cover crop treatments 1 forage radish raphanus sativus 2 cereal rye secale cereal 3 forage radish cereal rye mixture and 4 no cover control weeds only lamium amplexicaule l and cerastium arvense l the previous summer cash crop was corn zea mays and plots received 140 kg n ha 1 as surface application before planting to mimic high levels of residual soil n left after poor growing conditions and low cash crop yield cover crops were planted using a no till grain drill at 17 8 cm row spacing plots were 3 1 10 7 m with a 0 31 m buffer between each plot cereal rye was seeded at 126 kg ha 1 and forage radish at 9 kg ha 1 in both years the radish rye mixture was seeded at 2 8 63 kg ha 1 radish rye in year 1 and at 4 5 84 kg ha 1 radish rye in year 2 table 1 using a no till grain drill forage radish were winter killed in mid december to late mid january both years table 1 cereal rye was terminated using 0 9 kg ha 1 a e of glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine in early june of both study years table 1 porous cup lysimeters 22 mm diameter soil solution access tubes irrometer riverside california usa were installed at 60 cm below the ground surface following planting table 1 although porous cup lysimeters use tension to collect soil solution and may sample macropore dominated flow leading to an overestimation of soil solution no3 n russo et al 2017 they minimally disturb the soil and therefore are ideal for small plot research experiments such as the one described here four lysimeters were installed in each plot two in cover crop rows and two between the rows total of 32 and 64 lysimeters installed in year 1 and 2 respectively table 1 to install the lysimeters we bored a hole to 60 cm using a 23 8 mm diameter probe we made a soil slurry using bottled water and soil from the lowest depth of each plot the slurry was poured into the hole before inserting the lysimeter to ensure good soil contact lysimeters were sealed at the soil surface with a bentonite sand mixture to avoid preferential flow of water down the sides of the tube pilot studies confirmed that soil solution collection was only possible following rain events that were 6 mm or greater thus soil solution was only collected following rain events of this size which we monitored using weather data from a nearby 1 2 km meteorological tower located at the beltsville agricultural research center in beltsville md each day before sampling lysimeters were purged of any water and an internal pressure of 60 to 70 kpa was applied soil solutions were collected filtered whatman no 42 2 5 µm and stored in a freezer at 20 c until further analysis the soil solutions were analyzed on a lachat quikchem 8500 hach co loveland co for ammonium nh4 n and no3 n using the sodium salicylate us epa 1983 and cadmium reduction fisherman and friedman 1989 methods respectively samples analyzed for nh4 n were either at or below the method detection limit therefore we focus on no3 n if no3 n concentrations exceeded the highest calibration standard within the detectable range of the colorimeter they were diluted with deionized water usually 1 2 and reanalyzed soil volumetric water content and temperature data were collected continuously every 10 min throughout the cover crop growing season using time domain reflectometers tdrs true tdr 310s acclima meridian idaho usa during the first study year 2016 2017 tdrs were installed at three depths 0 10 20 30 and 50 60 cm on 14 feb 2017 and removed on 24 may 2017 in two of the four blocks total of 18 tdrs in year 1 we found little moisture variability at 50 60 cm so in the second study year 2017 2018 tdrs were only installed at 0 10 and 10 20 cm on 28 oct 2017 and removed on 5 jun 2018 total of 24 tdrs in all four of the blocks during both study years the tdrs were installed in only the radish rye and the no cover control plots these data on volumetric water content were used to calculate infiltration volume in the radish rye and no cover control plots data reported in fig s2 and s3 we then used data on percent cover to estimate the water balance in the radish rye mixture plot 2 3 calculating infiltration we used the tdr vwc data to calculate net infiltration of water as runoff was observed at the site but not measured our method is a better estimate of net infiltration than using rainfall only following a rain event 0 0254 cm minimum amount recorded by rain gauge for a given hour we summed the total profile volumetric water content year 1 0 60 cm and year 2 0 20 cm at the plot level using tdr data then we calculated the hourly water contents for each hour of the rain event and for 7 h following the termination of the rain event we calculated the differences between each hour and differences 0 cm were considered indicative of downward water movement into the profile e g water entering the measured profile and deemed infiltration in cm only hourly differences of 2 5 cm or less were summed to reduce the variability due to high rainfall events high rainfall events greater than 2 5 cm of rain per hour were relatively rare and the relationship between infiltration and rainfall became non linear at higher rainfall amounts this was because the measurement interval for water content was 10 min and because water contents were not changing greatly the tdr did not capture the steady state infiltration rates occurring at higher rainfall amounts the sum of these differences was recorded as total infiltration for that rain event starr and timlin 2004 we used linear univariate regression of total infiltration as calculated above for each rain event vs total rainfall for that event weather station data with no intercept to calculate net infiltration accounting for runoff as a function of rainfall for each plot due to the reasons given above if the total rainfall for an event was greater than 4 cm it was excluded from the regression we selected this method of accounting for runoff instead of other available methods e g soil conservation service curve number method usda scs 1985 because it allowed us to use our field based measurements e g tdr vwc data rather than coefficients assigned to different hydrologic groups and cover types e g no measured data because steady state movement of water in the profile is not detected by the tdr measurements this method can underestimate infiltration however the 10 min measurement intervals will minimize this error 2 4 modeling drainage using hydrus to calculate drainage volume cm3 cm 2 we used a public domain finite element water movement and solute transport model hydrus 1 d for analysis of one dimensional water flow šimůnek et al 2016 the model is being used to augment the tdr data in order to better calculate drainage through the use of hydrus 1 d we can separate the components of evapotranspiration in the tdr data during periods of decreasing water contents the model uses as input hourly measurements of solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and temperature to calculate evapotranspiration using a modified penman monteith equation šimůnek et al 2016 these data came from a nearby 1 2 km meteorological tower at the beltsville agricultural research center to calculate hourly drainage rates we input hourly estimated net infiltration as described above as precipitation into hydrus 1 d we used infiltration calculated from the tdr data as the input parameter for our drainage model rather than precipitation as we determined this was the most robust method for estimating and removing water lost to runoff tables s3 4 thus we ran the model without runoff hydrus 1 d separates evaporation from transpiration using crop height given as input and a root water uptake submodel the root water uptake submodel requires data on plant height and rooting depth through time to calculate hourly transpiration measuring rooting depth in situ would have been destructive to our small no till research plots therefore we interpolated field measurements of cover crop height throughout the growing season to calculate hourly heights we estimated daily root depth for rye and radish following kristensen and thorup kristensen 2004 we assumed the growth rate for radish roots increased linearly until the winter kill event whereas the growth rate for rye roots increased linearly during the fall and plateaued in the winter due to dormancy and then recommenced in the spring in year 1 2016 2017 we determined that radish winter killed between 9 and 11 dec 2016 when air temperatures dipped below 4 c in year 2 2017 2018 we determined that radish winter killed between 5 and 7 jan 2018 when soil temperatures dipped below 4 c we set a maximum rooting depth of 60 cm for both radish and rye as that was the mean depth to a root limiting clay layer in the studied soils we assumed there was no plant cover or root growth in the no cover plots for modeling purposes as very little weed cover was observed in those plots the soil profile geometry for our model consisted of four soil materials at 0 15 15 30 30 45 and 45 60 cm hydrus 1 d uses the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 to calculate the water retention for each soil depth which we calibrated using our measured volumetric water content vwc data in year 1 the hydraulic model began on 3 jan 2017 first soil solution collection date due to low rainfall and the modeled volumetric water contents were calibrated using 10 weeks 20 mar 30 may 2017 of measured continuous every 10 min vwc values from 0 to 10 and 20 30 cm from two of the four blocks fig 1 in year 2 the hydraulic model began on 1 oct 2017 and the modeled vwc were calibrated to fit 18 weeks 31 oct 21 dec 2017 and 21 mar 5 jun 2018 of measured continuous vwc at 0 10 and 10 20 cm from all four blocks fig 2 we compared the measured to the modeled vwc and adjusted theta saturation θs theta residual θr alpha α and n to fit the modeled to the measured vwc at the block level tables s3 and s4 theta saturation is the soil water content near saturation of the pores with water θr is the water content below which liquid water movement is minimal and n and α alpha determine the slope of the water retention curve at various soil water potentials another important parameter for calibration is the relative permeability k sat which we determined using data from the web soil survey for each of the four soil materials by soil depth at our sites soil survey staff 2020c using these input parameters hydrus calculated hourly drainage volume for the monoculture plots we then used data on percent cover e g rows of radish and rows of rye and drainage in the radish and rye monocultures to calculate the estimated hourly radish rye drainage volume eq 1 table 1 eq 1 radish rye mixture drainage rows of radish total rows radish drainage rows of rye total rows rye drainage finally we calculated seasonal drainage from the sum of hourly drainage values 2 5 calculation of n leaching loss as we could only collect soil solution following rainfall events 6 mm we used linear interpolation to estimate the no3 n concentration on days for which we did not have a measured concentration approxfun stats package 3 5 3 r core team 2019 the modeled daily soil drainage volumes were multiplied by the daily no3 n concentrations scaled to kg ha 1 and summed across seasons to provide final estimates of n leaching losses 2 6 study limitations and assumptions a runoff study was attempted but due to multiple complications and instrument error we decided not to measure runoff directly but used information from the tdr probes because we did not have information on soil water potentials below the 60 cm control zone with the tdr probes we could not measure steady state movement of water from the bottom of the profile the conductivity of this layer is very low so it was likely that water movement past 60 cm was slow such that there was not significant vertical drainage during a rainfall event that lasted as much as 10 h in addition the one dimensional model does not capture any lateral movement of water flow which could have resulted in differences in water budgets due to run on and runoff there were no tdr probes installed in the radish rye mixture we used a weighted average approach to calculate the drainage in the mixture based on the radish rye distribution described in eq 1 the canopies of the rye and radish crops were not were coexistent the canopy of each crop was largely active during different times the radish was dominant during the fall and late winter sep to dec while the rye canopy was dominant in the late winter and spring dec to apr as a result radish covered the soil approximately 30 40 of the time while the rye covered the soil the other 60 70 a similar ratio to the mix and reinforcing the estimated distribution 2 7 statistical approach to examine the overall effect of cover crop species on soil solution no3 n concentrations we used a linear mixed effect model lmer package for r bates et al 2013 with cover crop treatment and collection date as the main effects and block as a random effect years were analyzed separately to examine the effect of cover crop species on soil solution no3 n concentrations within a season e g fall winter spring we used another linear mixed effect model with cover crop treatment as the main effect and block as a random effect seasons were defined using the equinox and solstice for fall 23 sep 20 dec winter 21 dec 20 mar and spring 21 mar 21 june tukey post hoc tests were used to examine pairwise comparisons among cover crop treatments multcomp hothorn et al 2008 in year 1 the tdrs were only installed in two blocks so we were unable to statistically determine differences in cumulative growing season n leaching losses kg n ha 1 however in year 2 tdrs were installed in every block total of four which allowed us to examine the effect of cover crop treatment on cumulative growing season drainage and n leaching losses to test for the effect of cover crop treatment across the entire cover crop growing season we used a linear mixed effects model with cover crop treatment as a main effect and block as a random effect we also examined seasonal differences in n leaching among the cover crop treatments using the same linear mixed effect model design as above tukey post hoc tests were used to examine pairwise comparisons among cover crop treatments multcomp hothorn et al 2008 if data were not normally distributed concentration and leaching data were transformed using a box cox transformation to satisfy the assumptions of the statistical models box and cox 1964 differences were considered significant at p 0 05 all data were analyzed in the r environment for pc r core team 2020 3 results 3 1 cover crops altered evapotranspiration and drainage modeled cumulative transpiration jan jun 2017 tracked plant growth and was highest in the cereal rye treatment in year 1 9 9 cm fig 1c but in year 2 the radish treatment initially had highest cumulative transpiration 2 5 cm until the winter kill event in late jan 2018 fig 1d when it leveled off cereal rye had the highest cumulative transpiration until termination in the spring through summer of year 2 21 mar 5 june 2018 6 4 cm fig 1d we assumed negligible observable plant growth in no cover control plots and thus the highest evaporation fig 1a and b and zero transpiration fig 1c and d in the no cover control plots across both years therefore cumulative evapotranspiration et was highest in the rye and radish rye plots across the growing season in both years fig 1e and f because soil water measurements in the first study year did not start until january of the following year 2017 we did not have tdr data to estimate water use in radish in the fall of 2016 thus cumulative transpiration for radish in that year would have been underestimated as more water infiltrated in year 2 than year 1 estimates of cumulative drainage were higher in year 2 past the 60 cm depth fig 2 and table 3 although not significant in year 1 estimated cumulative drainage tended to be higher in the radish treatment 38 2 cm in year 2 cumulative drainage was significantly higher in the control treatment 51 4 cm than any other treatment and radish was significantly higher than rye and the radish rye mixture p 0 0002 fig 2 table 3 in year 2 there was no difference among treatments in the fall but differences in drainage emerged among the treatments in the winter and spring fig 2 table 3 3 2 soil solution no3 n concentrations through time soil solution nh4 n concentrations were at or below the method detection limit across the duration of the study thus we only focus on no3 n concentrations in year 1 2016 2017 soil solution no3 n concentrations varied significantly throughout the year in all cover crop treatments p 0 0001 ranging from 0 to 82 mg no3 n l 1 fig s4a overall concentrations under rye and radish rye were significantly lower than under radish alone and no cover control p 0 0001 table 4 in year 1 soil solution was only collected in the winter and spring of 2017 due to minimal precipitation and drought conditions in the fall of 2016 table 4 in the winter of 2017 soil solution no3 n concentrations were highest under the control and radish than the other treatments p 0 0001 table 4 in the spring of 2017 year 1 soil solution no3 n concentrations were highest under the control than in all other treatments p 0 0001 table 4 soil solution no3 n concentrations in the spring were also higher under radish than rye p 0 04 mean annual soil solution no3 n concentrations in year 2 2017 2018 varied significantly throughout the year in all cover crop treatments p 0 001 fig s4b and were significantly lower under radish rye and radish rye than the no cover control p 0 0001 table 5 in the fall of 2017 soil solution no3 n concentrations were lowest under the radish than all other treatments p 0 0008 in the winter and spring of 2018 soil solution no3 n concentrations differed significantly by treatment p 0 0001 in both cases with the highest concentrations under the no cover control compared to all other treatments soil solution no3 n concentrations were also significantly higher under the radish treatments compared to the rye alone and radish rye p 0 0001 in both the winter and spring 3 3 estimated n leaching losses in year 1 estimated cumulative n leaching losses decreased in the order no cover control radish radish rye rye table 5 and fig 3 there were no significant differences detected among the treatments estimated cumulative n leaching losses in kg ha 1 under rye radish rye and radish were 86 80 and 13 lower respectively than under the no cover control table 5 we estimated high rates of leaching losses under the radish in both the winter and spring following winter kill rye and radish rye leaching losses were slightly higher in the winter when rye biomass was small and declined in the spring and summer when rye transpiration increased due to increased biomass and leaf area index fig 3 in year 2 total cumulative n leaching losses were significantly higher under the no cover control than under any other treatment p 0 0001 table 5 and fig 3 estimated cumulative n leaching losses under rye radish rye and radish were 94 92 and 85 lower respectively than under the no cover control table 5 in year 2 the majority of the estimated n leaching losses under rye and radish rye occurred in the winter 6 1 and 5 0 kg n ha 1 respectively but dropped to 0 2 kg n ha 1 or less in the spring table 5 fig 3 on the other hand n leaching losses under radish were lowest in the fall before winter kill 0 9 kg n ha 1 and highest in the winter after the january winter kill 9 0 kg n ha 1 table 5 fig 3 more specifically in the fall and winter n leaching losses were significantly higher under the no cover control than the cover crop treatments p 0 014 and p 0 0001 respectively in the spring n leaching losses decreased in the order no cover control radish rye radish rye p 0 001 for all comparisons table 5 fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 cover crops altered evapotranspiration and drainage cover crops can alter the amount of water moving down through the soil profile by modifying evaporation and transpiration rates brill and neal 1950 dabney 1998 kaspar et al 2001 for example if soils are bare or germination is poor evaporation will dominate but transpiration will dominate under a healthy cover crop stand fig 1a and b cumulative et was higher in the rye and radish rye plots as greater biomass led to higher transpiration rates compared to the control and radish alone table s5 overall estimated cumulative drainage was similar among all the treatments ranging from 25 to 38 cm in year 1 and 42 52 cm in year 2 table 3 however the high drainage in the radish plots was likely because the radish root system may create taproot channels that can increase water flow especially in the spring after forage radish winter kills and the ground thaws dean and weil 2009 drainage was also highest in the control plots in both years and significantly so in year 2 as the lack of weed growth limited transpiration meisinger et al 1991 4 2 cover crops altered soil solution no3 n concentrations through time in the fall of 2016 year 1 exceptional drought conditions reduced the volume of soil solution collections national drought resilience partnership ndrp 2020a in the fall of 2017 year 2 soil solution no3 n concentrations were lower under radish than all other treatments as the radish accumulated more n in its tissues in the fall than rye alone dean and weil 2009 table s6 mean soil solution no3 n concentrations were much higher under radish in year 1 10 0 mg l 1 than year 2 3 8 mg l 1 due to differences in planting date between the two years table 4 in year 1 the radish had 52 days to establish and grow whereas in year 2 the radish had 107 days to establish and grow leading to lower biomass accumulation in year 1 0 6 mg ha 1 than year 2 3 0 mg ha 1 table s5 a similar pattern was found in a global meta analysis which indicated that n leaching losses under cover crops are significantly lower than a no cover control if the cover crops can accumulate 4 mg ha 1 of aboveground biomass before termination thapa et al 2018a unlike radish planting later in the fall did not impact the rye s ability to reduce the soil solution no3 n concentrations in either mixture or monoculture since most of rye s growth occurs from late winter to spring soil solution no3 n concentrations in the radish rye mixture followed similar patterns to the rye monoculture further the radish rye mixtures had low mean soil solution no3 n concentrations across the study period 3 mg no3 n l 1 table 4 in both years despite doubling the radish seeding rates in the mixture year 1 2 8 kg ha 1 radish seed year 2 4 5 kg ha 1 radish seed table 1 and planting densities year 1 1 row rye to 1 row radish year 2 2 rows rye to 1 row radish table 1 this suggests that overall the effects of rye on leaching supersede those of radish however in regions with high levels of rainfall in the fall or with increasing intensity of storms with climate change as is predicted in many areas hsiang et al 2017 rojas et al 2019 taylor et al 2012 radish may play an important role in lowering soil solution no3 n concentrations in the fall 4 3 cover crops reduce estimated leaching compared to no cover control most of the studies investigating n leaching losses of cover crops include monocultures e g brassicas grasses and legumes or grass legume mixtures to our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the efficacy of grass brassica mixtures in reducing n leaching losses compared to their monoculture counterparts or a no cover control in year 2 we show that planting cover crops reduced n leaching losses by at least 85 compared to the no cover control we found that n leaching losses from radish rye mixtures were comparable to rye monoculture in years where the brassica can establish early a mixture with radish or other brassica may slightly reduce n leaching losses even compared to a rye or other grass monoculture unlike other studies we found relatively high n leaching losses from radish monocultures after winter kill early jan to late may for example constantin et al 2010 found that n leaching losses were smaller under radish 11 15 kg n ha 1 than rye 39 kg n ha 1 however they planted radish well before winter kill in early august to late september due to the timing of weather events in year 1 of our study we were unable to plant cover crops until mid october which led to poor radish establishment and thus higher leaching losses under radish alone 53 5 kg n ha 1 than rye alone 8 3 kg n ha 1 table 5 in year 2 we were able to plant cover crops by mid september and calculated lower n leaching losses under radish across the study period 18 3 kg n ha 1 but still higher than rye and radish rye mixtures 8 6 kg n ha 1 table 5 thus the timing of radish planting in the fall appears to be an important driver of n leaching losses whether in monoculture or a mixture further even though cover crops were planted after the ideal date in year 1 the rye and radish rye mixtures were still capable of drawing n leaching losses down by at least 80 compared to the no cover control in year 2 when all the cover crops were planted on time rye alone and radish rye mixtures reduced n leaching losses by over 93 compared to the no cover control indicating that mixtures may provide reliable n leaching reductions despite climate variability in mid atlantic cropping systems it is important to note that we applied n fertilizer to the surface in the fall before planting cover crops rather than following a corn harvest which would have meant that residual n was at a deeper soil depth dean and weil 2009 the application of n on the soil surface may have led to an advantage for rye over radish because of differences in rooting depths dean and weil 2009 kristensen and thorup kristensen 2004 on similar soils no3 n leaching losses under rye monocultures ranged from 2 to 124 kg n ha 1 brandi dohrn et al 1997 feaga et al 2010 meisinger and ricigliano 2017 compared to 8 10 kg n ha 1 in this study suggesting that our estimated n leaching losses are on the low end however differences in planting and termination dates beckwith et al 2006 heinrich et al 2014 kaspar et al 2001 precipitation constantin et al 2010 feaga et al 2010 residual soil n levels and farm management brandi dohrn et al 1997 could explain why our n leaching losses were low compared to the other studies interestingly our estimated n leaching losses are extremely high under the no cover control in year 2 123 kg n ha 1 similar to the amount of n we added to surface soils to simulate high levels of residual soil n 140 kg n ha 1 as previously mentioned we assumed zero transpiration from the no cover plots although we acknowledge that any weeds would transpire small amounts of water throughout the study period still drainage rates were not particularly high in the no cover plots compared to the cover crop plots rather the high rate of n loss was clearly driven by the exceptionally high soil solution no3 n concentrations under no cover plots across all seasons of note the increase in cumulative precipitation and drainage from year 1 to year 2 fig s1 did not impact the ability of the rye monoculture or the radish rye mixture to reduce estimated n leaching which remained around 9 kg n ha 1 across the study period table 5 our data suggest that if a farmer is trying to suppress n leaching losses forage radish can be a viable option but should probably be planted in mixture with a grass indeed the forage radish can provide a suite of agroecosystem benefits such as fast fall growth and biotillage to reduce soil compaction dean and weil 2009 white and weil 2011 thus radish should not be overlooked as a potentially beneficial cover crop however radish planted in mixtures will more consistently reduce n leaching losses across a wide range of management practices and climates 5 conclusions cover crop mixtures and monocultures reduced estimated n leaching losses compared to a no control the ability of radish to suppress n leaching largely depended on when it was planted and when it winter killed monoculture radish planted early in the fall suppressed n leaching losses during the fall and winter months rye however was more effective than radish at reducing leaching in the spring as it continued to grow and transpire water following the winter months the radish rye mixture more consistently reduced no3 n concentrations than either species planted in monoculture but performed similarly to rye monocultures in terms of n leaching losses which were at least 80 lower than a no cover control in both study years thus our work indicates that radish rye cover crop mixtures could reduce n leaching losses across a range of climates in the mid atlantic region table 2 declaration of competing

least limiting water range llwr is a range in soil water content not limiting root growth which integrates the effect of soil water retention aeration and penetration resistance this study aimed to assess the effect of different long term fertilization treatments on llwr in the surface layer of a vertisol soil samples were taken from six long term fertilization treatments including no fertilization control inorganic fertilization npk inorganic fertilization plus low amount of straw npkls inorganic fertilization plus high amount of straw npkhs inorganic fertilization plus pig manure npkpm and inorganic fertilization plus cow manure npkcm for measuring llwr results showed that in comparison with the control the manure treatments npkpm and npkcm increased soil organic carbon content soc more pronounced than the straw treatments npkls and npkhs however the water stable aggregates wsa0 25 in the manure treatments was much smaller than the straw treatments soil water content at field capacity θ fc was significantly higher in the manure treatments npkpm and npkcm than the other treatments however soil water content at soil penetration resistance of 3 mpa θ pr was significantly lower in the straw treatments than in the manure treatments the llwr in the manure treatments had sharper decline with bulk density than the other treatments in comparison with the control and npk treatments the straw treatments significantly increased the llwr but manure treatments did not probably resulting from positive relation between soc and penetration resistance at a given soil water content and less favorable effect of the manures on soil aggregation than the straw the s index was significantly increased by the npkcm treatment relative to the control and positively correlated with the soc the variation of wsa0 25 instead of soc could explain the change of llwr under different fertilization treatments effectively these observations imply that the llwr could assess the effect of organic fertilizations on soil physical quality more comprehensively keywords least limiting water range s index organic fertilizations water stable aggregates 1 introduction soil physical conditions which are variable with soil use and management have direct and indirect effects on the availability and uptake of water nutrients and air for plant growth reynolds et al 2009 lu et al 2014 many studies have found that some soil physical properties e g soil bulk density soil water content and penetration resistance have good correlations with crop growth reynolds et al 2002 ball et al 2007 however some studies revealed that these parameters independently cannot explain the variations in crop performance and soil processes sufficiently dexter 2004a mueller et al 2009 probably because many soil physical properties are highly interacted with each other keller et al 2015 for example soil penetration resistance is greatly dependent on bulk density water content and clay content dexter et al 2007 gao et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 thus root growth may be limited by two or more soil physical properties together letey 1985 hence a comprehensive indicator least limiting water range llwr which integrates soil water content aeration and mechanical resistance was proposed by da silva et al 1994 for better characterizing soil functions least limiting water range llwr defined as the range of soil water content in which limitations associated with matric potential aeration and mechanical resistance are minimal for crop growth and has been widely used for soil physical quality assessment wu et al 2003 leão et al 2006 safadoust et al 2014 the llwr is generally smaller and more sensitive to soil management practices than the total available water taw which ignores restrictions of soil aeration at the wet end and soil mechanical resistance at the dry end for plant growth asgarzadeh et al 2010 li et al 2020 previous works suggested that llwr is a useful soil physical index for evaluating plant growth and grain yield under different management practices benjamin and karlen 2014 ferreira et al 2017 li et al 2020 reported that llwr of the soils in the 0 5 cm 5 10 cm and 10 20 cm soil layers could better explain the variation of maize zea mays l yield than other soil physical indexes under a rainfed long term tillage management we also revealed that llwr in the 10 20 cm soil depth was significantly related to wheat triticum aestivum l yield in a recent work wang et al 2021 thus in recent years many studies have been carried out to investigate impacts of various management practices on soil physical quality assessed by llwr safadoust et al 2014 ferreira et al 2017 de oliveira et al 2019 de lima et al 2020 successful management practices result in a wider llwr while a narrower llwr usually results from unfavorable soil managements da silva and kay 1997 safadoust et al 2014 tormena et al 1999 revealed that conventional tillage was an effective management for increasing llwr relative to no tillage due to decreasing soil penetration resistance for tropical soils with very high clay content 80 however long term conventional tillage by machinery also has detrimental influences on soil physical properties such as soil compaction in plough pan where soil llwr was considerably decreased peigné et al 2018 de lima et al 2021 ferreira et al 2017 showed that llwr was reduced to a value of zero under wheel tracks and was unfavorable to root growth cover cropping as a sustainable agricultural management has been reported to be beneficial for increasing llwr fidalski et al 2010 chen et al 2014 de oliveira et al 2019 it is well known that organic amendments can enhance soil organic carbon content soc and consequently improve soil water retention blanco canqui and lal 2007 zhou et al 2020 which are all closely related with llwr however the effect of organic fertilizations on llwr has been rarely studied up to now da silva and kay 1997 documented that the soil with higher soc presented greater llwr because of much lower bulk density verma and sharma 2008 reported that long term organic amendments increased the water content at 10 air filled porosity and reduced the water content at which penetration resistance reached 2 mpa then increased non limiting water range which is similar with llwr however benjamin and karlen 2014 illustrated that llwr increased by increasing soc at a lower bulk density 1 20 g cm 3 but in the case of higher bulk density the opposite is true 1 30 g cm 3 furthermore it has been shown that organic manure additions may have negative effect on soil aggregation in dry regions likely due to accumulation of dispersing na introduced by manures guo et al 2019a and may increase soil penetration resistance or bulk density in some cases de smet et al 1991 busscher et al 2011 yu et al 2020 which may be not beneficial for improving llwr therefore it is still unclear how organic fertilizations affect llwr and further studies are needed in this study we aimed to illustrate the effect of long term different organic fertilizations on llwr in the surface layer of a vertisol we hypothesized that long term organic fertilizations can improve llwr through increasing organic carbon content in this study to test this hypothesis llwr under different fertilization treatments were determined factors that may influence llwr including clay content soc bulk density penetration resistance and wsa0 25 were determined and their relationships with llwr taw and s index the slope of the soil water retention curve at the inflection point were also analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experiment design a long term continuous field fertilization experiment was initiated in 1982 at the mengcheng agro ecological experimental station in mengcheng anhui province china 33 13 n 116 35 e elevation 24 m the site is located in the south part of the huang huai hai plain fig s1 and has a sub humid warm temperate continental monsoon climate the data collected from 1987 to 2016 in mengcheng meteorological station 33 17 n 116 33 e showed that mean annual air temperature rainfall and potential evaporation measured with an evaporation pan with 0 3 m2 area were 15 9 c 933 mm and 1402 mm respectively in this region fig 1 china meteorological data service centre the rainfall and evaporation had a strong seasonal variation with the majority 664 mm and 835 mm respectively occurring from may to september the soil derived from fluvio lacustrine sediments is classified as a vertisol according to the usda soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2015 the clay minerals of soil are dominated by 2 1 expansible montmorillonite 24 31 in clay resulting in high shrinkage capacity the long term fertilization experiment was under a winter wheat october june and summer soybean glycine max l merr june october cropping system except during the period from 1993 to 1997 when soybean was replaced by maize arranging in a randomized complete block design the varieties of wheat and soybean used by local farmers were selected for this experiment which were changed every 5 10 year in recent years the variety of wheat was yannong 19 and sowed with a seeding rate of 187 5 kg ha 1 and the soybean of zhonghuang 13 variety was sowed with a space of 20 cm 25 cm the irrigation was only performed after wheat sowing when unexpected drought occurred in some years six treatments were applied 1 control no fertilization 2 npk only npk fertilizers application 3 npkls npk fertilizers plus low amount of wheat straw 3750 kg ha 1 application 4 npkhs npk fertilizers plus high amount of wheat straw 7500 kg ha 1 application 5 npkpm npk fertilizers plus pig manure 15 000 kg ha 1 application 6 npkcm npk fertilizers plus cow manure 30 000 kg ha 1 application on average the water contents for wheat straw pig and cow manures were 33 3 48 0 and 58 3 respectively and the c n p and k contents of dry base were 399 5 5 1 2 and 11 5 g kg 1 for wheat straw 367 17 9 0 and 9 0 g kg 1 for pig manure 380 8 0 4 0 and 4 0 g kg 1 for cow manure respectively guo et al 2018 2019b all the treatments except the control had the same application rate of npk fertilizers which was 180 kg ha 1 n 90 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 135 kg ha 1 k2o respectively at the start of the wheat season the npk and organic amendments were manually applied in the corresponding treatments before carrying out a moldboard plough to a depth of about 20 cm using a small tractor at an appropriate soil water content no fertilizers were applied during the soybean growing season and the soybean was directly sowed after the wheat harvest the crop residues were removed after harvest with stubble and root biomass left in the field each treatment had four replicates with plot size of 75 m2 15 m 5 m 2 2 soil sampling soil samples were collected in the long term fertilization experiment in october 2016 after the harvest of soybean three undisturbed core samples were taken with pvc rings internal diameter of 4 6 cm and height of 5 0 cm at the 3 8 cm depth for each plot each fertilization treatment had 12 samples therefore a total of 72 undisturbed soil cores were collected these soil cores were sealed with plastic film and transported to the laboratory carefully in order to avoid any disturbance or evaporation disturbed soil samples from 0 15 cm soil depth for the measurement of basic properties were collected adjacent to each sampling location of soil cores 2 3 some basic soil properties unlike a previous study of zhou et al 2020 reporting soil particle size distribution in the same experiment measured with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer we measured soil particle size distribution by a pipette method in this study yi 2009 soil organic carbon soc g kg 1 was determined by oxidation with potassium dichromate in a heated oil bath lu 2000 the aggregate size distribution of the studied soil was reported by a previous study of guo et al 2018 which was determined by a wet sieving technique described as elliott 1986 method a set of three sieves with 2 0 0 25 0 053 mm openings were used to obtain four aggregate size classes and then the percentage of water stable aggregates greater than 0 25 mm wsa0 25 was calculated 2 4 least limiting water range and total available water the undisturbed core samples were saturated and then drained in a sandbox at matric potentials of 2 4 and 8 kpa and in a pressure plate at 10 33 100 500 and 1500 kpa klute 2018 soil penetration resistance pr mpa was measured under the above matric suctions using a microcomputer control electronic universal testing machine fitted with a 0 05 n entrance force shenzhen new sansi measurement technology co ltd shenzhen china a conical steel needle with a 2 mm diameter and a 60 angle was inserted vertically into the soil column down to a depth of 40 mm at a speed of 10 mm min 1 each core was measured three times at different locations the core samples were then oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to measure soil bulk density bd g cm 3 and soil moisture was also calculated the model proposed by da silva and kay 1997 was used to fit the relation between soc matric potential bulk density and soil water content for pooled data of all the treatments 1 ln θ a 0 a 1 ln soc a 2 ln bd b 0 b 1 ln soc b 2 ln bd ln ψ where a 0 a 1 a 2 b 0 b 1 and b 2 are model fitting parameters θ cm3 cm 3 is volumetric water content ψ kpa is matric potential then the soil strength pedo transfer function regarding the relationship between soc θ and pr was established for all the treatments using the model of busscher 1990 and da silva and kay 1997 2 ln pr c 0 c 1 soc d 0 d 1 soc ln θ e 0 ln bd where c 0 c 1 d 0 d 1 and e 0 are model fitting parameters then the water content at air filled porosity of 10 θ afp cm3 cm 3 was calculated by 3 θ afp 1 bd pd 0 1 where the pd is the particle density which was taken as 2 65 g cm 3 following previous studies hati et al 2007 wang et al 2021 least limiting water range llwr was determined for each sample by the method proposed by da silva et al 1994 critical values for crop growth were associated with the soil water content at field capacity θ fc 33 kpa cm3 cm 3 or at air filled porosity of 10 θ afp cm3 cm 3 for the upper limit and the soil water content of permanent wilting point θ pwp 1500 kpa cm3 cm 3 or soil penetration resistance at 3 mpa θ pr cm3 cm 3 for the lower limit de lima et al 2020 for each sample θ fc and θ pwp were calculated according to the eq 1 with measured bulk density and soc similarly θ pr and θ afp for each sample were obtained following the eqs 2 and 3 respectively the upper limit θ upper is the smaller one of θ fc and θ afp the lower limit θ lower is the higher one of θ pwp and θ pr and the llwr was calculated by 4 llwr θ upper θ lower the total available water taw was considered as the difference between the soil water contents at field capacity and permanent wilting point 5 taw θ fc θ pwp 2 5 s index the s index is defined as the slope of the soil water retention curve which must be plotted as the water potential against the gravimetric water content according to dexter 2004a the data of soil water retention curve of the studied soil for each treatment was reported by a previous study of zhou et al 2020 and was used to calculate s index in this study although the samples in zhou et al 2020 were collected in june 2015 after harvest of wheat a year earlier than the sampling date of the samples in this study the soc was quite similar in these two years as illustrated in dexter 2004a the s index is mostly determined by soc thus we assumed that the s index was same in 2015 and 2016 for each treatment in this experiment the relationship between soil gravimetric water content and soil matric potential was fitted by the following model van genuchten 1980 6 θ g θ gs θ gr 1 α ψ n m θ gr where α n and m are model fitting parameters ψ kpa is matric potential θ g g g 1 is gravimetric water content θ gs g g 1 and θ gr g g 1 are saturated gravimetric water content and residual gravimetric water content respectively the adjusted coefficient of determination r2 of fitting model used for each soil sample was greater than 0 99 then the s index was calculated based on the following equation 7 s n θ gs θ gr 2 n 1 n 1 1 n 2 2 6 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was performed to assess the effects of different treatments on soil basic properties physical restriction thresholds llwr taw and s index means were compared by least significant difference lsd at the p 0 05 level the soil water pedo transfer function and soil strength pedo transfer function were fitted with nonlinear regression analysis pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship among clay content soc bd wsa0 25 llwr taw and s index all the above analysis were performed using spss 19 0 statistical package 3 results 3 1 soil basic properties all the fertilization treatments had significantly higher soc than the control table 1 the manure treatments npkcm and npkpm presented the greatest soc followed by straw treatments and the npk treatment the organic fertilization treatments significantly decreased the bulk density relative to the control and npk treatment compared with the control the npk treatment significantly reduced the wsa0 25 however all the organic fertilization treatments increased the wsa0 25 but npkcm treatment not statistically significant the straw treatments improved the wsa0 25 more pronounced than the manure treatments relative to the control 3 2 critical restriction thresholds the high adjusted coefficient of determination r 2 values showed that the eqs 1 and 2 can fit the soil water pedo transfer function r 2 0 960 and soil strength pedo transfer function r 2 0 908 respectively very well table 2 and fig s2 the fitted coefficients in the eqs 1 and 2 indicated that both soil water content and penetration resistance were positively related with soc and bulk density in general for each treatment the θ afp decreased and the θ fc θ pwp and θ pr increased with increasing bulk density in which θ pr increased more sharply with bulk density than the θ fc and θ pwp fig 2 the θ fc was always the upper limit of llwr in all the treatments the θ pr was the lower limit of llwr in the control npk and npkcm treatments while the θ pr was replaced by the θ pwp as the lower limit only at a very low bulk density approximately 1 18 g cm 3 in the npkls npkhs and npkpm treatments the mean values of θ fc and θ pwp were all in the order of the manure treatments npkpm and npkcm the straw treatments npkls and npkhs the npk and control treatments table 3 the manure treatments presented significantly higher θ fc and θ pwp than the other treatments the θ pr was significantly higher in the manure treatments than the other treatments except the npk treatment while the lowest θ pr was observed in the straw treatments table 3 3 3 least limiting water range total available water and s index the llwr generally decreased with increasing bulk density even though there was a slight increase at low bulk density 1 18 g cm 3 for the npkls npkhs and npkpm treatments fig 3 the bulk density range varied greatly among the treatments leading to different llwr the llwr decreased more sharply in the npkpm and npkcm treatments than other four treatments resulting in lower llwr when the bulk density was higher than 1 26 g cm 3 and 1 15 g cm 3 respectively table 3 shows that mean llwr in the straw treatments rather than the manure treatments was significantly higher than the control and npk treatments for each treatment the taw was much greater than the llwr table 3 the npk and manure treatments significantly increased the taw than the control but the straw treatments did not the s index increased with the increasing soc however only the npkcm treatment 0 0438 presented a significantly higher s index than the control 0 0340 table 3 3 4 relationship among the mean values of soil basic properties critical thresholds llwr taw and s index the θ afp θ fc θ pwp θ pr and s index were all positively correlated with the soc for all the treatments table 4 p 0 05 the θ afp was negatively correlated with the bulk density p 0 05 in contrast the llwr had little relation with the soc and bulk density but it was positively related with the wsa0 25 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 effect of long term fertilizations on soc and wsa0 25 it has been observed that long term continuous organic amendments have strong influence on soc and aggregate stability in many previous studies haynes and naidu 1998 rasool et al 2008 peng et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 however the influence may be varied with different organic amendments in comparison with the control treatment the increase of soc in the manure treatments npkpm and npkcm was more pronounced than that in the straw treatments npkls and npkhs in this study table 1 the result can be explained by higher carbon input rate of organic amendments in the manure treatments than in the straw treatments 2 00 2 86 and 4 75 t c ha 1 yr 1 for the npkhs npkpm and npkcm treatments respectively as the soc sequestration rate in each treatment was positively correlated with carbon input rate hua et al 2014 guo et al 2019b furthermore for the unit mass of manure more recalcitrant c was contained in the decomposed manure at a molecular level which was more beneficial for sequestrating more soc guo et al 2019b however the wsa0 25 in the manure treatments was much lower than that in the straw treatments which was opposite to the variation of soc table 1 the result was inconsistent with many previous studies blair et al 2006 benbi and senapati 2010 yan et al 2013 guo et al 2018 and guo et al 2019a inferred that manure applications introduced a large amount of dispersing agents such as exchangeable na which may exert negative effect on soil aggregation although the manure applications greatly increased binding agents the differences in soc and wsa0 25 between the manure and straw treatments may influence the performance of llwr in these treatments as soc and wsa0 25 are usually related with soil water retention and soil strength nciizah and wakindiki 2012 zhou et al 2020 4 2 effect of long term fertilizations on physical restriction thresholds the upper limit for the llwr was θ fc for all the treatments over the entire bulk density range in this study fig 2 similar result was also observed by other studies cecagno et al 2016 probably because the topsoil in each treatment was well aerated due to relatively low bulk density 1 26 g cm 3 on average the θ pr was generally observed as the lower limit for the llwr in this study fig 2 which was consistent with some previous researches olibone et al 2010 ramos et al 2015 de oliveira et al 2019 the results indicated that soil penetration resistance firstly became the restricting factor for crop growth as soil water content decreased the positive relation between θ fc θ pwp and bulk density for each treatment table 2 and fig 2 may be explained by that increase of bulk density under same level of soc results in shifts of larger pores to medium and small pores which retain more soil water alaoui et al 2011 for all the treatments θ fc and θ pwp presented significantly positive relationship with soc table 4 and the organic fertilization treatments significantly increased θ fc relative to the control table 3 p 0 05 which agreed well with some previous studies blanco canqui and lal 2007 safadoust et al 2014 blanco canqui et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 suggested that the increase of water retention was attributed to improved soil aggregation and pore structure due to organic fertilization blanco canqui and lal 2007 indicated that higher specific surface area and water absorption capacity of soil organic matter is beneficial for greater water retention it was interesting that the manure treatments presented significantly larger θ pr than the other treatments except the npk treatment although it had the lowest bulk density and highest soc table 3 the coefficients in the soil strength pedo transfer function table 2 illustrated that soil penetration resistance was positively related with soc at a given soil water content which meant that the soil water content for the critical penetration resistance limit 3 mpa in this study increased with increasing soc table 4 da silva and kay 1997 also observed similar result and attributed the result to decreased water potential with the increasing soc for a given water content which would have resulted in an increase in effective stress and consequently soil penetration resistance however the lowest θ pr was observed for the straw treatments which can be explained by significantly lower soc than the manure treatments and relatively lower bulk density than the control and npk treatments tables 1 and 3 in addition manure treatments were much less favorable for soil aggregation than the straw treatments table 1 a decrease in aggregate stability resulted in more dispersed particles which pack and contact closer hence may be associated with an increase in soil penetration resistance nciizah and wakindiki 2012 4 3 effect of long term fertilizations on least limiting water range our result showed that straw treatments but not manure treatments significantly increased the llwr relative to the control and npk treatments table 3 mishra et al 2015 also observed that crop residue retention significantly increased llwr in the 0 15 cm soil layer under a cotton and wheat rotation system this result partially supported our hypothesis that long term organic fertilizations can improve llwr and clarified that the impacts of organic fertilization on llwr were variable the higher llwr in the npkls and npkhs treatments may be partially ascribed to lower bulk density due to addition of straw relative to the control and npk treatments table 1 because the llwr was negatively related to the bulk density for each treatment in this study fig 3 and in many previous studies ferreira et al 2017 de oliveira et al 2019 moura et al 2021 although the npkpm and npkcm treatments presented lower bulk density and higher soc the llwr in the two treatments decreased more sharply with increasing bulk density than the other treatments fig 3 similar result was also reported by benjamin and karlen 2014 who observed that the llwr decreased more sharply with bulk density as soc increased this result was likely related to lower limit of the llwr θ pr which was higher in the npkpm and npkcm treatments than the other treatments probably due to increased soil strength at a given water content and less favorable aggregate stability as mentioned above the llwr was significantly correlated with the wsa0 25 rather than the soc and bulk density for all the treatments table 4 to our knowledge this is the first time of reporting a good relationship between llwr and aggregate stability the wsa0 25 was also lower in the npkpm and npkcm treatments than the npkls and npkhs treatments table 1 which was similar to the llwr the result clarified that llwr is a good indicator for characterizing soil structural stability and is sensitive to fertilization management 4 4 comparison between s index and llwr according to dexter 2004a s index 0 035 was the boundary between poor and good soil physical quality our result suggested that the npkpm npkcm and npkhs treatments resulted in good soil structure while the control treatment presented relatively poor soil structure the likely explanation of this was attributed to higher soc and lower bulk density resulting from organic fertilization table 1 as the s index was significantly correlated with soc table 3 xu et al 2017 also reported that s index increased with increasing soc the increase of soc was beneficial for improving soil structural pores and water retention zhou et al 2017 resulting in higher s index dexter 2004a the s index is a measure of soil microstructure that can be used an indicator of soil physical quality dexter 2004b bengough et al 2006 concluded that s index requires fewer parameters than llwr and more suited than llwr for a measure of soil physical quality however in this study the s index only revealed positive effect of organic fertilizations on soil physical quality without manifesting negative effect of manure addition tables 1 3 and 4 compared to s index llwr is a more integrated approach by including soil aeration water availability and mechanical strength da silva et al 1994 the llwr reflected both the positive effect of organic fertilization and the negative effect of manure addition on soil physical quality in this study tables 3 and 4 thus llwr was more comprehensive and sensitive to organic fertilizations than s index 5 conclusions in this study the impact of organic fertilizations on soil physical quality in the plough layer was evaluated using llwr the results indicated that the θ fc was the upper limit for the llwr which was significantly higher in the manure treatments than the other treatments compared with the control the manure treatment significantly increased θ pr which was generally represented as the lower limit for llwr the llwr decreased with increasing bulk density for each treatment while sharper decrease was observed in the manure treatments than other treatments the llwr was significantly improved by the straw treatments but not by the manure treatments relative to the control and npk treatments the variation of llwr among different fertilizations can be explained by wsa0 25 very well overall our results illustrated that llwr rather than s index is a sensitive indicator to assess the effect of different organic

least limiting water range llwr is a range in soil water content not limiting root growth which integrates the effect of soil water retention aeration and penetration resistance this study aimed to assess the effect of different long term fertilization treatments on llwr in the surface layer of a vertisol soil samples were taken from six long term fertilization treatments including no fertilization control inorganic fertilization npk inorganic fertilization plus low amount of straw npkls inorganic fertilization plus high amount of straw npkhs inorganic fertilization plus pig manure npkpm and inorganic fertilization plus cow manure npkcm for measuring llwr results showed that in comparison with the control the manure treatments npkpm and npkcm increased soil organic carbon content soc more pronounced than the straw treatments npkls and npkhs however the water stable aggregates wsa0 25 in the manure treatments was much smaller than the straw treatments soil water content at field capacity θ fc was significantly higher in the manure treatments npkpm and npkcm than the other treatments however soil water content at soil penetration resistance of 3 mpa θ pr was significantly lower in the straw treatments than in the manure treatments the llwr in the manure treatments had sharper decline with bulk density than the other treatments in comparison with the control and npk treatments the straw treatments significantly increased the llwr but manure treatments did not probably resulting from positive relation between soc and penetration resistance at a given soil water content and less favorable effect of the manures on soil aggregation than the straw the s index was significantly increased by the npkcm treatment relative to the control and positively correlated with the soc the variation of wsa0 25 instead of soc could explain the change of llwr under different fertilization treatments effectively these observations imply that the llwr could assess the effect of organic fertilizations on soil physical quality more comprehensively keywords least limiting water range s index organic fertilizations water stable aggregates 1 introduction soil physical conditions which are variable with soil use and management have direct and indirect effects on the availability and uptake of water nutrients and air for plant growth reynolds et al 2009 lu et al 2014 many studies have found that some soil physical properties e g soil bulk density soil water content and penetration resistance have good correlations with crop growth reynolds et al 2002 ball et al 2007 however some studies revealed that these parameters independently cannot explain the variations in crop performance and soil processes sufficiently dexter 2004a mueller et al 2009 probably because many soil physical properties are highly interacted with each other keller et al 2015 for example soil penetration resistance is greatly dependent on bulk density water content and clay content dexter et al 2007 gao et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 thus root growth may be limited by two or more soil physical properties together letey 1985 hence a comprehensive indicator least limiting water range llwr which integrates soil water content aeration and mechanical resistance was proposed by da silva et al 1994 for better characterizing soil functions least limiting water range llwr defined as the range of soil water content in which limitations associated with matric potential aeration and mechanical resistance are minimal for crop growth and has been widely used for soil physical quality assessment wu et al 2003 leão et al 2006 safadoust et al 2014 the llwr is generally smaller and more sensitive to soil management practices than the total available water taw which ignores restrictions of soil aeration at the wet end and soil mechanical resistance at the dry end for plant growth asgarzadeh et al 2010 li et al 2020 previous works suggested that llwr is a useful soil physical index for evaluating plant growth and grain yield under different management practices benjamin and karlen 2014 ferreira et al 2017 li et al 2020 reported that llwr of the soils in the 0 5 cm 5 10 cm and 10 20 cm soil layers could better explain the variation of maize zea mays l yield than other soil physical indexes under a rainfed long term tillage management we also revealed that llwr in the 10 20 cm soil depth was significantly related to wheat triticum aestivum l yield in a recent work wang et al 2021 thus in recent years many studies have been carried out to investigate impacts of various management practices on soil physical quality assessed by llwr safadoust et al 2014 ferreira et al 2017 de oliveira et al 2019 de lima et al 2020 successful management practices result in a wider llwr while a narrower llwr usually results from unfavorable soil managements da silva and kay 1997 safadoust et al 2014 tormena et al 1999 revealed that conventional tillage was an effective management for increasing llwr relative to no tillage due to decreasing soil penetration resistance for tropical soils with very high clay content 80 however long term conventional tillage by machinery also has detrimental influences on soil physical properties such as soil compaction in plough pan where soil llwr was considerably decreased peigné et al 2018 de lima et al 2021 ferreira et al 2017 showed that llwr was reduced to a value of zero under wheel tracks and was unfavorable to root growth cover cropping as a sustainable agricultural management has been reported to be beneficial for increasing llwr fidalski et al 2010 chen et al 2014 de oliveira et al 2019 it is well known that organic amendments can enhance soil organic carbon content soc and consequently improve soil water retention blanco canqui and lal 2007 zhou et al 2020 which are all closely related with llwr however the effect of organic fertilizations on llwr has been rarely studied up to now da silva and kay 1997 documented that the soil with higher soc presented greater llwr because of much lower bulk density verma and sharma 2008 reported that long term organic amendments increased the water content at 10 air filled porosity and reduced the water content at which penetration resistance reached 2 mpa then increased non limiting water range which is similar with llwr however benjamin and karlen 2014 illustrated that llwr increased by increasing soc at a lower bulk density 1 20 g cm 3 but in the case of higher bulk density the opposite is true 1 30 g cm 3 furthermore it has been shown that organic manure additions may have negative effect on soil aggregation in dry regions likely due to accumulation of dispersing na introduced by manures guo et al 2019a and may increase soil penetration resistance or bulk density in some cases de smet et al 1991 busscher et al 2011 yu et al 2020 which may be not beneficial for improving llwr therefore it is still unclear how organic fertilizations affect llwr and further studies are needed in this study we aimed to illustrate the effect of long term different organic fertilizations on llwr in the surface layer of a vertisol we hypothesized that long term organic fertilizations can improve llwr through increasing organic carbon content in this study to test this hypothesis llwr under different fertilization treatments were determined factors that may influence llwr including clay content soc bulk density penetration resistance and wsa0 25 were determined and their relationships with llwr taw and s index the slope of the soil water retention curve at the inflection point were also analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experiment design a long term continuous field fertilization experiment was initiated in 1982 at the mengcheng agro ecological experimental station in mengcheng anhui province china 33 13 n 116 35 e elevation 24 m the site is located in the south part of the huang huai hai plain fig s1 and has a sub humid warm temperate continental monsoon climate the data collected from 1987 to 2016 in mengcheng meteorological station 33 17 n 116 33 e showed that mean annual air temperature rainfall and potential evaporation measured with an evaporation pan with 0 3 m2 area were 15 9 c 933 mm and 1402 mm respectively in this region fig 1 china meteorological data service centre the rainfall and evaporation had a strong seasonal variation with the majority 664 mm and 835 mm respectively occurring from may to september the soil derived from fluvio lacustrine sediments is classified as a vertisol according to the usda soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2015 the clay minerals of soil are dominated by 2 1 expansible montmorillonite 24 31 in clay resulting in high shrinkage capacity the long term fertilization experiment was under a winter wheat october june and summer soybean glycine max l merr june october cropping system except during the period from 1993 to 1997 when soybean was replaced by maize arranging in a randomized complete block design the varieties of wheat and soybean used by local farmers were selected for this experiment which were changed every 5 10 year in recent years the variety of wheat was yannong 19 and sowed with a seeding rate of 187 5 kg ha 1 and the soybean of zhonghuang 13 variety was sowed with a space of 20 cm 25 cm the irrigation was only performed after wheat sowing when unexpected drought occurred in some years six treatments were applied 1 control no fertilization 2 npk only npk fertilizers application 3 npkls npk fertilizers plus low amount of wheat straw 3750 kg ha 1 application 4 npkhs npk fertilizers plus high amount of wheat straw 7500 kg ha 1 application 5 npkpm npk fertilizers plus pig manure 15 000 kg ha 1 application 6 npkcm npk fertilizers plus cow manure 30 000 kg ha 1 application on average the water contents for wheat straw pig and cow manures were 33 3 48

respectively guo et al 2018 2019b all the treatments except the control had the same application rate of npk fertilizers which was 180 kg ha 1 n 90 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 135 kg ha 1 k2o respectively at the start of the wheat season the npk and organic amendments were manually applied in the corresponding treatments before carrying out a moldboard plough to a depth of about 20 cm using a small tractor at an appropriate soil water content no fertilizers were applied during the soybean growing season and the soybean was directly sowed after the wheat harvest the crop residues were removed after harvest with stubble and root biomass left in the field each treatment had four replicates with plot size of 75 m2 15 m 5 m 2 2 soil sampling soil samples were collected in the long term fertilization experiment in october 2016 after the harvest of soybean three undisturbed core samples were taken with pvc rings internal diameter of 4 6 cm and height of 5 0 cm at the 3 8 cm depth for each plot each fertilization treatment had 12 samples therefore a total of 72 undisturbed soil cores were collected these soil cores were sealed with plastic film and transported to the laboratory carefully in order to avoid any disturbance or evaporation disturbed soil samples from 0 15 cm soil depth for the measurement of basic properties were collected adjacent to each sampling location of soil cores 2 3 some basic soil properties unlike a previous study of zhou et al 2020 reporting soil particle size distribution in the same experiment measured with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer we measured soil particle size distribution by a pipette method in this study yi 2009 soil organic carbon soc g kg 1 was determined by oxidation with potassium dichromate in a heated oil bath lu 2000 the aggregate size distribution of the studied soil was reported by a previous study of guo et al 2018 which was determined by a wet sieving technique described as elliott 1986 method a set of three sieves with 2 0 0 25 0 053 mm openings were used to obtain four aggregate size classes and then the percentage of water stable aggregates greater than 0 25 mm wsa0 25 was calculated 2 4 least limiting water range and total available water the undisturbed core samples were saturated and then drained in a sandbox at matric potentials of 2 4 and 8 kpa and in a pressure plate at 10 33 100 500 and 1500 kpa klute 2018 soil penetration resistance pr mpa was measured under the above matric suctions using a microcomputer control electronic universal testing machine fitted with a 0 05 n entrance force shenzhen new sansi measurement technology co ltd shenzhen china a conical steel needle with a 2 mm diameter and a 60 angle was inserted vertically into the soil column down to a depth of 40 mm at a speed of 10 mm min 1 each core was measured three times at different locations the core samples were then oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to measure soil bulk density bd g cm 3 and soil moisture was also calculated the model proposed by da silva and kay 1997 was used to fit the relation between soc matric potential bulk density and soil water content for pooled data of all the treatments 1 ln θ a 0 a 1 ln soc a 2 ln bd b 0 b 1 ln soc b 2 ln bd ln ψ where a 0 a 1 a 2 b 0 b 1 and b 2 are model fitting parameters θ cm3 cm 3 is volumetric water content ψ kpa is matric potential then the soil strength pedo transfer function regarding the relationship between soc θ and pr was established for all the treatments using the model of busscher 1990 and da silva and kay 1997 2 ln pr c 0 c 1 soc d 0 d 1 soc ln θ e 0 ln bd where c 0 c 1 d 0 d 1 and e 0 are model fitting parameters then the water content at air filled porosity of 10 θ afp cm3 cm 3 was calculated by 3 θ afp 1 bd pd 0 1 where the pd is the particle density which was taken as 2 65 g cm 3 following previous studies hati et al 2007 wang et al 2021 least limiting water range llwr was determined for each sample by the method proposed by da silva et al 1994 critical values for crop growth were associated with the soil water content at field capacity θ fc 33 kpa cm3 cm 3 or at air filled porosity of 10 θ afp cm3 cm 3 for the upper limit and the soil water content of permanent wilting point θ pwp 1500 kpa cm3 cm 3 or soil penetration resistance at 3 mpa θ pr cm3 cm 3 for the lower limit de lima et al 2020 for each sample θ fc and θ pwp were calculated according to the eq 1 with measured bulk density and soc similarly θ pr and θ afp for each sample were obtained following the eqs 2 and 3 respectively the upper limit θ upper is the smaller one of θ fc and θ afp the lower limit θ lower is the higher one of θ pwp and θ pr and the llwr was calculated by 4 llwr θ upper θ lower the total available water taw was considered as the difference between the soil water contents at field capacity and permanent wilting point 5 taw θ fc θ pwp 2 5 s index the s index is defined as the slope of the soil water retention curve which must be plotted as the water potential against the gravimetric water content according to dexter 2004a the data of soil water retention curve of the studied soil for each treatment was reported by a previous study of zhou et al 2020 and was used to calculate s index in this study although the samples in zhou et al 2020 were collected in june 2015 after harvest of wheat a year earlier than the sampling date of the samples in this study the soc was quite similar in these two years as illustrated in dexter 2004a the s index is mostly determined by soc thus we assumed that the s index was same in 2015 and 2016 for each treatment in this experiment the relationship between soil gravimetric water content and soil matric potential was fitted by the following model van genuchten 1980 6 θ g θ gs θ gr 1 α ψ n m θ gr where α n and m are model fitting parameters ψ kpa is matric potential θ g g g 1 is gravimetric water content θ gs g g 1 and θ gr g g 1 are saturated gravimetric water content and residual gravimetric water content respectively the adjusted coefficient of determination r2 of fitting model used for each soil sample was greater than 0 99 then the s index was calculated based on the following equation 7 s n θ gs θ gr 2 n 1 n 1 1 n 2 2 6 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was performed to assess the effects of different treatments on soil basic properties physical restriction thresholds llwr taw and s index means were compared by least significant difference lsd at the p 0 05 level the soil water pedo transfer function and soil strength pedo transfer function were fitted with nonlinear regression analysis pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship among clay content soc bd wsa0 25 llwr taw and s index all the above analysis were performed using spss 19 0 statistical package 3 results 3 1 soil basic properties all the fertilization treatments had significantly higher soc than the control table 1 the manure treatments npkcm and npkpm presented the greatest soc followed by straw treatments and the npk treatment the organic fertilization treatments significantly decreased the bulk density relative to the control and npk treatment compared with the control the npk treatment significantly reduced the wsa0 25 however all the organic fertilization treatments increased the wsa0 25 but npkcm treatment not statistically significant the straw treatments improved the wsa0 25 more pronounced than the manure treatments relative to the control 3 2 critical restriction thresholds the high adjusted coefficient of determination r 2 values showed that the eqs 1 and 2 can fit the soil water pedo transfer function r 2 0 960 and soil strength pedo transfer function r 2 0 908 respectively very well table 2 and fig s2 the fitted coefficients in the eqs 1 and 2 indicated that both soil water content and penetration resistance were positively related with soc and bulk density in general for each treatment the θ afp decreased and the θ fc θ pwp and θ pr increased with increasing bulk density in which θ pr increased more sharply with bulk density than the θ fc and θ pwp fig 2 the θ fc was always the upper limit of llwr in all the treatments the θ pr was the lower limit of llwr in the control npk and npkcm treatments while the θ pr was replaced by the θ pwp as the lower limit only at a very low bulk density approximately 1 18 g cm 3 in the npkls npkhs and npkpm treatments the mean values of θ fc and θ pwp were all in the order of the manure treatments npkpm and npkcm the straw treatments npkls and npkhs the npk and control treatments table 3 the manure treatments presented significantly higher θ fc and θ pwp than the other treatments the θ pr was significantly higher in the manure treatments than the other treatments except the npk treatment while the lowest θ pr was observed in the straw treatments table 3 3 3 least limiting water range total available water and s index the llwr generally decreased with increasing bulk density even though there was a slight increase at low bulk density 1 18 g cm 3 for the npkls npkhs and npkpm treatments fig 3 the bulk density range varied greatly among the treatments leading to different llwr the llwr decreased more sharply in the npkpm and npkcm treatments than other four treatments resulting in lower llwr when the bulk density was higher than 1 26 g cm 3 and 1 15 g cm 3 respectively table 3 shows that mean llwr in the straw treatments rather than the manure treatments was significantly higher than the control and npk treatments for each treatment the taw was much greater than the llwr table 3 the npk and manure treatments significantly increased the taw than the control but the straw treatments did not the s index increased with the increasing soc however only the npkcm treatment 0 0438 presented a significantly higher s index than the control 0 0340 table 3 3 4 relationship among the mean values of soil basic properties critical thresholds llwr taw and s index the θ afp θ fc θ pwp θ pr and s index were all positively correlated with the soc for all the treatments table 4 p 0 05 the θ afp was negatively correlated with the bulk density p 0 05 in contrast the llwr had little relation with the soc and bulk density but it was positively related with the wsa0 25 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 effect of long term fertilizations on soc and wsa0 25 it has been observed that long term continuous organic amendments have strong influence on soc and aggregate stability in many previous studies haynes and naidu 1998 rasool et al 2008 peng et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 however the influence may be varied with different organic amendments in comparison with the control treatment the increase of soc in the manure treatments npkpm and npkcm was more pronounced than that in the straw treatments npkls and npkhs in this study table 1 the result can be explained by higher carbon input rate of organic amendments in the manure treatments than in the straw treatments 2 00 2 86 and 4 75 t c ha 1 yr 1 for the npkhs npkpm and npkcm treatments respectively as the soc sequestration rate in each treatment was positively correlated with carbon input rate hua et al 2014 guo et al 2019b furthermore for the unit mass of manure more recalcitrant c was contained in the decomposed manure at a molecular level which was more beneficial for sequestrating more soc guo et al 2019b however the wsa0 25 in the manure treatments was much lower than that in the straw treatments which was opposite to the variation of soc table 1 the result was inconsistent with many previous studies blair et al 2006 benbi and senapati 2010 yan et al 2013 guo et al 2018 and guo et al 2019a inferred that manure applications introduced a large amount of dispersing agents such as exchangeable na which may exert negative effect on soil aggregation although the manure applications greatly increased binding agents the differences in soc and wsa0 25 between the manure and straw treatments may influence the performance of llwr in these treatments as soc and wsa0 25 are usually related with soil water retention and soil strength nciizah and wakindiki 2012 zhou et al 2020 4 2 effect of long term fertilizations on physical restriction thresholds the upper limit for the llwr was θ fc for all the treatments over the entire bulk density range in this study fig 2 similar result was also observed by other studies cecagno et al 2016 probably because the topsoil in each treatment was well aerated due to relatively low bulk density 1 26 g cm 3 on average the θ pr was generally observed as the lower limit for the llwr in this study fig 2 which was consistent with some previous researches olibone et al 2010 ramos et al 2015 de oliveira et al 2019 the results indicated that soil penetration resistance firstly became the restricting factor for crop growth as soil water content decreased the positive relation between θ fc θ pwp and bulk density for each treatment table 2 and fig 2 may be explained by that increase of bulk density under same level of soc results in shifts of larger pores to medium and small pores which retain more soil water alaoui et al 2011 for all the treatments θ fc and θ pwp presented significantly positive relationship with soc table 4 and the organic fertilization treatments significantly increased θ fc relative to the control table 3 p 0 05 which agreed well with some previous studies blanco canqui and lal 2007 safadoust et al 2014 blanco canqui et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 suggested that the increase of water retention was attributed to improved soil aggregation and pore structure due to organic fertilization blanco canqui and lal 2007 indicated that higher specific surface area and water absorption capacity of soil organic matter is beneficial for greater water retention it was interesting that the manure treatments presented significantly larger θ pr than the other treatments except the npk treatment although it had the lowest bulk density and highest soc table 3 the coefficients in the soil strength pedo transfer function table 2 illustrated that soil penetration resistance was positively related with soc at a given soil water content which meant that the soil water content for the critical penetration resistance limit 3 mpa in this study increased with increasing soc table 4 da silva and kay 1997 also observed similar result and attributed the result to decreased water potential with the increasing soc for a given water content which would have resulted in an increase in effective stress and consequently soil penetration resistance however the lowest θ pr was observed for the straw treatments which can be explained by significantly lower soc than the manure treatments and relatively lower bulk density than the control and npk treatments tables 1 and 3 in addition manure treatments were much less favorable for soil aggregation than the straw treatments table 1 a decrease in aggregate stability resulted in more dispersed particles which pack and contact closer hence may be associated with an increase in soil penetration resistance nciizah and wakindiki 2012 4 3 effect of long term fertilizations on least limiting water range our result showed that straw treatments but not manure treatments significantly increased the llwr relative to the control and npk treatments table 3 mishra et al 2015 also observed that crop residue retention significantly increased llwr in the 0 15 cm soil layer under a cotton and wheat rotation system this result partially supported our hypothesis that long term organic fertilizations can improve llwr and clarified that the impacts of organic fertilization on llwr were variable the higher llwr in the npkls and npkhs treatments may be partially ascribed to lower bulk density due to addition of straw relative to the control and npk treatments table 1 because the llwr was negatively related to the bulk density for each treatment in this study fig 3 and in many previous studies ferreira et al 2017 de oliveira et al 2019 moura et al 2021 although the npkpm and npkcm treatments presented lower bulk density and higher soc the llwr in the two treatments decreased more sharply with increasing bulk density than the other treatments fig 3 similar result was also reported by benjamin and karlen 2014 who observed that the llwr decreased more sharply with bulk density as soc increased this result was likely related to lower limit of the llwr θ pr which was higher in the npkpm and npkcm treatments than the other treatments probably due to increased soil strength at a given water content and less favorable aggregate stability as mentioned above the llwr was significantly correlated with the wsa0 25 rather than the soc and bulk density for all the treatments table 4 to our knowledge this is the first time of reporting a good relationship between llwr and aggregate stability the wsa0 25 was also lower in the npkpm and npkcm treatments than the npkls and npkhs treatments table 1 which was similar to the llwr the result clarified that llwr is a good indicator for characterizing soil structural stability and is sensitive to fertilization management 4 4 comparison between s index and llwr according to dexter 2004a s index 0 035 was the boundary between poor and good soil physical quality our result suggested that the npkpm npkcm and npkhs treatments resulted in good soil structure while the control treatment presented relatively poor soil structure the likely explanation of this was attributed to higher soc and lower bulk density resulting from organic fertilization table 1 as the s index was significantly correlated with soc table 3 xu et al 2017 also reported that s index increased with increasing soc the increase of soc was beneficial for improving soil structural pores and water retention zhou et al 2017 resulting in higher s index dexter 2004a the s index is a measure of soil microstructure that can be used an indicator of soil physical quality dexter 2004b bengough et al 2006 concluded that s index requires fewer parameters than llwr and more suited than llwr for a measure of soil physical quality however in this study the s index only revealed positive effect of organic fertilizations on soil physical quality without manifesting negative effect of manure addition tables 1 3 and 4 compared to s index llwr is a more integrated approach by including soil aeration water availability and mechanical strength da silva et al 1994 the llwr reflected both the positive effect of organic fertilization and the negative effect of manure addition on soil physical quality in this study tables 3 and 4 thus llwr was more comprehensive and sensitive to organic fertilizations than s index 5 conclusions in this study the impact of organic fertilizations on soil physical quality in the plough layer was evaluated using llwr the results indicated that the θ fc was the upper limit for the llwr which was significantly higher in the manure treatments than the other treatments compared with the control the manure treatment significantly increased θ pr which was generally represented as the lower limit for llwr the llwr decreased with increasing bulk density for each treatment while sharper decrease was observed in the manure treatments than other treatments the llwr was significantly improved by the straw treatments but not by the manure treatments relative to the control and npk treatments the variation of llwr among different fertilizations can be explained by wsa0 25 very well overall our results illustrated that llwr rather than s index is a sensitive indicator to assess the effect of different organic

9724,saline water irrigation can alleviate the deficiency of agricultural freshwater resources especially in arid regions however saline water may lead to soil salinization and affect crop quality a water salt regulation wsr irrigation method has been developed to avoid soil salinization to investigate the effect of saline water irrigation on crop quality while maintaining soil salinity balance we conducted a field experiment on tomatoes under the wsr method in the arid region of northwest china from 2018 to 2019 five treatments with electrical conductivity eci of 0 5 ds m 3 1 ds m 4 7 ds m 6 2 ds m and 7 8 ds m were designed where eci indicates salinities of irrigation water we applied the wsr method for all five treatments to maintain the soil matric potential smp above 20 kpa at a depth of 20 cm below drip emitters the results from three aspects quality yield and soil salinity are as follows i saline water irrigation can improve tomato quality as evidenced by increasing the content of soluble solids reducing sugar organic acid and vitamin c when eci ranged from 4 7 ds m to 7 8 ds m the sugar acid ratio was in the appropriate scope 7 4 9 8 ii the commercial yield and total yield declined by 4 8 and 4 4 as the eci increased 1 ds m iii the soil salinity can be kept balanced under the wsr method after a 2 year experiment when the eci of saline water did not exceed 4 7 ds m therefore in similar arid areas with a lack of freshwater resources saline water of 4 7 ds m under the wsr method can be used to irrigate field grown tomatoes compensating for the reduced yield by improving quality keywords water salt regulation saline water drip irrigation tomato quality 1 introduction in the arid regions of northwest china agriculture is facing freshwater deficiency caused by low precipitation and high evaporation losses ma et al 2005 chen 2014 nevertheless there are abundant saline water resources underneath these regions for instance the amount of bitter saline water with an electrical conductivity of 2 1 ds m is 2 4 billion m3 in gansu province accounting for 8 3 of its total water resources wang et al 2009 consequently saline water irrigation can be an effective way to alleviate freshwater deficiency with a long term irrational irrigation method such as traditional furrow irrigation flood irrigation or alternating supply of fresh and saline water adopted saline water irrigation will cause soluble salts to cumulate in the soil malash et al 2005 studied the effects of different irrigation methods including drip irrigation furrow irrigation mixed saline water and freshwater irrigation on tomato growth and yield in the nile delta egypt the result showed that soluble salts at the root zone of the furrow irrigation method were higher than that in drip irrigation the soluble salts will affect the soil s physicochemical properties such as reduced infiltration rates hydraulic conductivity and soil water potential which can lead to secondary salinization oster and schroer 1979 shainberg and levy 1992 homaee 1999 kitamura et al 2006 meanwhile salt accumulation in the root zone makes it difficult for the crop roots to absorb water the resulting water stress closes the stomata weakens photosynthesis and ultimately affects crop growth rhoades et al 1992 ismail and burrage 1994 baath et al 2017 several researchers have proposed various saline irrigation methods to prevent excessive soil salinization and ensure crop yield hamdy 1993 oster 1994 malash et al 2005 the methods include leaching salts by freshwater rotating irrigation with freshwater and saline water or mixing saline water with freshwater however these irrigation methods are mainly used in areas with good salt drainage conditions or adequate rainfall drip irrigation is considered the most effective irrigation method for saline water utilization goldberg et al 1976 kang 1998 it provides a uniform continuous and high frequency water supply to the soil facilitating salt leaching from crop roots a research group from the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research igsnrr cas established a water salt regulation wsr method wan et al 2007 2010 chen et al 2009 kang et al 2009 2012 its main guideline was to control the threshold of soil matric potential smp at a depth of 20 cm directly below the emitter controlling smp can effectively compensate for the reduced soil infiltration potential due to the high salinity of irrigation water thereby maintaining the total water potential to ensure the available water for plants the wsr method can mitigate soil salinity accumulation and crop yield reduction caused by saline water irrigation several studies have been conducted in arid semi arid and humid areas under the wsr method wan et al 2007 2010 applied saline water eci 1 1 4 9 ds m to irrigate the tomato and found that the salinity in the 0 90 cm soil profile did not increase significantly after three years of irrigation kang et al 2009 2010 and chen et al 2009 discovered that soil salinity could sustain balance even with high saline water of 10 9 ds m yield reductions of tomatoes cucumber oil sunflower and waxy corn were only 6 7 7 5 1 7 and 1 4 per 1 ds m eci increase these yield reductions were lower than those reported by the us saline soil laboratory e g 10 tomato yield reduction per 1 ds m eci increase maas and hoffman 1977 maas 1986 these studies have shown that the wsr method can effectively leach soil salt with the increase of the saline water irrigation period the soil salinity can also maintain balance tomato is an essential crop with high nutritional value producing high quality tomatoes is not only a concern for farmers but also a hot topic for researchers several studies have confirmed that saline water irrigation can improve tomato quality by changing the flavor nutrition storage and other quality indicators campos et al 2006 zhai et al 2015 el mogy et al 2018 li et al 2019 abdel gawad et al 2005 demonstrated that the total sugar and total soluble solids contents of tomato fruit under saline water 1 2 7 5 ds m irrigation were higher than non saline water irrigation 1 ds m wang et al 2014 conducted saline water drip irrigated experiments on tomatoes in northwest china they found that the content of soluble solids organic acid and vitamin c in tomato fruit increased with rising salinity despite decreased tomato yield a number of studies have explored the effect of saline water irrigation on tomato quality however long term saline water irrigation may lead to soil salt accumulation and there is still a lack of research on the effect under the conditions of maintaining the soil salt balance to fill this gap we conducted a field experiment under the wsr method in a typical arid region of gansu china the wsr method is used to maintain the soil salt balance focusing on tomato quality we also analyzed tomato yield economic efficiency and salinity threshold of irrigation water the main objectives were 1 to analyze the effect of irrigation water salinity eci on tomato quality under the wsr method 2 to explore an optimal salinity threshold of irrigation water for producing high quality tomatoes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted for two successive years 2018 2019 at the jinchang farmland water cycle and precision irrigation experimental station institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research cas the experimental station is located in gansu province an arid region of northwest china 38 36 n 102 23 e 1400 m above sea level and appertains to the temperate continental arid climate zone the average annual temperature in this arid region is 9 4 c and the precipitation is 120 mm per annum chiefly concentrating from june to august besides the potential evaporation is 2722 mm namely about 23 times precipitation table 1 lists the soil properties of the tested field in march 2018 the soil types at all depths were silty sandy loams the average value depth weighted in 0 100 cm of available k available p total n organic matter were 114 0 mg kg 3 8 mg kg 0 8 g kg 16 2 g kg

experimental design four saline water treatments were set up with different eci 3 1 ds m 4 7 ds m 6 2 ds m 7 8 ds m and local freshwater eci 0 5 ds m was used as a control check ck the four saline water treatments were obtained by mixing the local freshwater 0 5 ds m and the underground salinity water eci 14 1 ds m the eci of mixed irrigation water was measured with an instrument of water quality multiparameter ysi 6050000 usa table 2 shows the chemical properties of the irrigation water in five treatments tomatoes were double row planted in a zigzag pattern around each drip tape drip tape emitter discharge of 1 38 l h at 0 1 mpa operating pressure was placed on the center of double row plantings plantings were spaced 20 cm apart per tape and emitter spacing was 30 cm fig 1 the planting density was approximately 57 165 plants ha the soil of each treatment was covered with white polyethylene plastic mulch before planting the layout of drip tapes in a single mulch is shown in fig 2 during two plant seasons the tomato cultivar and dates of transplanting harvest irrigation are shown in table 3 tomato solanum lycopersicum hezuo no 918 seedlings were transplanted to the field in 2018 3 may and 2019 4 may 2 3 irrigation every treatment was equipped with a gravity drip irrigation unit consisting of drip irrigation tapes and a bucket with a volume of about 300 l the bucket was installed at the height of 0 8 m above the ground after tomato transplanting the first freshwater irrigation was applied until the wetted radius was about 10 cm along the horizontal plane around emitters following the rejuvenation period of the tomato the seedlings were irrigated with saline water at the same time an electronic vacuum tensiometer was placed at 20 cm depth below the emitter to measure the soil matric potential smp we recorded the readings of the tensiometer at 8 00 a m and 3 00 p m each day the threshold of smp was set according to the type of crop for tomatoes the recommended smp threshold was 20 kpa chen et al 2009 wan et al 2007 we started irrigation when the smp was lower than 20 kpa the amount of water per irrigation was 8 mm once the smp reached 10 kpa irrigation was stopped if the smp record were still lower than 10 kpa after the first irrigation another 8 mm water would be irrigated 2 4 fertilization and agronomic practices all treatments utilized drip fertigation fertilizer calculations were dependent on 80 of the actual use by local farmers feng et al 2017 the calculation was built on 100 days for the entire tomato reproductive period a top dressing of pure n p2o5 and k2o were about 216 kg ha 48 kg ha and 240 kg ha for the actual growth of tomatoes cumulative application of urea n 46 potassium dihydrogen phosphate p2o5 52 k2o 34 potassium sulfate k2o 50 were about 463 kg ha 92 kg ha and 417 kg ha respectively the fertilizer application method and amount were the same for both experiment seasons precaution of disease and pest was taken in the early stage of the fruit set and applied appropriately meantime the side branches of the tomato plant were removed in time for the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons furthermore all tomato plants retained five fruit ears after topping in 2019 2 5 observation and sampling method 2 5 1 weather data precipitation data were provided by automatic weather stations vantagepro2 davis

study was determined by the following equation 1 sar n a 1 2 c a 2 m g 2 where the unit of ion concentration was mmol l 2 5 3 fruit quality indicators fruits were harvested from the middle three plastic mulches in each treatment throughout the tomato fruiting period fifteen tomatoes of similar size uniform color and ripeness were randomly collected five fruit samples were selected as replicates of each mulch 1 diameter and single weight of fruit the diameter of tomatoes average of the longitudinal and transverse diameter was measured with an electronic digital caliper dl91150 deli

for appraising the variance in the average plant measurements for each treatment each treatment was replicated nine times to assess quality indicators and yield of tomatoes the weighted average of the method was used to calculate the mean value of soil indicators the figures were plotted by originpro version 2020 originlab corporation northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 rainfall and irrigation 3 1 1 rainfall as displayed in fig 3 the total rainfall of the tomato growing season was 118 6 mm in 2018 and 105 6 mm in 2019 the tomato growth during the experiment period can be divided into three stages seeding stage stage i from 3 may to 10 june flowering and fruit setting stage stage ii from 11 june to 15 july and fruiting stage stage iii from 16 july to 10 september the rainfall distribution of the three stage in 2018 was 10 8 mm 18 0 mm and 89 9 mm accounting for 9 1 15 2 and 75 7 of the total rainfall whereas in 2019 was 25 4 mm 31 8 mm and 48 4 mm accounting for 24 1 30 1 and 45 8 respectively there were seven effective rainfall events 4 2 mm during the tomato growing seasons the effective rainfall was 71 2 mm in 2018 and 78 4 mm in 2019 in particular the effective rainfall during the fruiting stage in 2018 was 61 2 mm which relieved irrigation pressure 3 1 2 irrigation in 2018 the total irrigation amount for the five treatments was 507 mm 501 mm 564 mm 469 mm and 505 mm as shown in fig 3a the irrigation amount of st1 st4 treatments consisted of 232 mm 249 mm 254 mm and 244 mm freshwater stage i as well as 269 mm 315 mm 215 mm and 262 mm saline water stage ii iii in the second year 2019 year the total irrigation amount of the ck st1 st4 treatments were 686 mm 581 mm 591 mm 563 mm and 529 mm for ck st4 treatments the irrigation amount contained 125 mm 135 mm 137 mm 156 mm and 152 mm freshwater stage i along with 446 mm 454 mm 408 mm and 377 mm saline water stage ii iii there may be two reasons why the cumulative irrigation of 4 7 ds m was higher than that of ck in 2018 i the first reason may be the late start of saline water irrigation in 2018 to find a suitable saline water source in the first year since tomatoes under salt stress would consume less water than freshwater irrigation the cumulative irrigation amount of 4 7 ds m should be lower than ck however the opposite was confirmed in 2018 which may be due to tomatoes delayed response to salt stress ii the second reason may be that the 4 7 ds m treatment has better infiltration ability and higher salt leaching efficiency than ck tomatoes treated with 4 7 ds m would consume extra water to infiltrate into the soil to leach salt the irrigation amount in 2019 was generally more than that in 2018 which may be related to the vigorous growth and higher yields of tomatoes in the second year as illustrated in fig 3b irrigation with saline water at 3 1 ds m 4 7 ds m 6 2 ds m and 7 8 ds m during 2019 stage ii and iii resulted in 20 6 19 2 27 4 and 32 9 water saving during stage iii the difference in irrigation water amount between treatments i e the distance of the five lines in fig 3b gradually increased among the five lines the ck treatment increased the fastest to sum up irrigation amount tended to decrease with the increasing salinity of irrigation water eci approximately 19 5 mm decrease for each 1 ds m increase of eci saline water irrigation in stages ii and iii resulted in water savings of 19 33 108 185 mm compared with the treatment of ck it may be related to the water consumption reduction under salt stress the reduction in irrigation is consistent with a finding in a semi humid region of china wan et al 2007 demonstrated that applying saline water to tomato cultivation can save freshwater for irrigation 3 2 the salinity of soil ec e fig 4 presents the salinity distribution of soil profile at the initial and end of each year at the end of the 2018 experiment the mean soil salinity ece ec of the saturated soil extract at the 0 10 cm depth for saline water treatments did not increase significantly however their mean ece at 10 50 cm depth increased remarkably the average ece of 0 100 cm for ck st4 treatments was 1 1 ds m 2 2 ds m 2 8 ds m 3 0 ds m 3 4 ds m respectively compared with the first soil sample on 3rd june 2018 30 days after the start of freshwater irrigation and 36 days before saline water irrigation they increased by 9 4 155 4 221 6 250 6 and 289 9 meantime the mean ece at the end of the experiment is positively related to the eci the mean ece increased even with freshwater irrigation which may be induced by fertigation table 4 shows the average ece in the tomato root zone 0 40 cm and profile 0 100 cm for the initial and end of the experiment in 2018 2019 at the end of the second year experiment 2019 the mean ece of the ck st4 treatments at 0 100 cm depth were 4 3 ds m 3 5 ds m 2 2 ds m 3 2 ds m and 4 7 ds m when eci ranges from 3 1 to 6 2 ds m the increment in average salinity of root zone and soil profile in 2019 was negative the experiment end value minus the initial value in 2019 while the increment in average salinity in 2018 was positive the mean salinity in the entire soil profile for the st1 st3 treatments was no saline ece 4 ds m is non saline soil richards 1954 these results showed that after two years of saline drip irrigation ece did not continue to increase but remained stable however the average ece of the soil profile for ck treatment increased this increase may be related to the moderate infiltration of local freshwater chemicals refer to table 2 in addition it may also be related to the higher initial ece 3 68 ds m in the second year experiment and the spatial variability of the soil 3 3 the quality of tomatoes 3 3 1 flavor of tomatoes fig 5 illustrates the changes of tomato flavor indicators between two years such as soluble solids reducing sugar organic acid and sugar acid ratio the contents of soluble solids reducing sugar and organic acid increased with eci electrical conductivity of irrigation water the three contents of the saline water treatments were significantly p 0 05 higher than those of the freshwater treatment 0 5 ds m however the sugar acid ratio under saline water irrigation was lower than that of freshwater treatment the sugar acid ratio is defined as the ratio of reducing sugar to organic acids the soluble solids content of tomatoes increased by 6 1 21 3 19 2 and 41 1 with saline irrigation of 3 1 ds m 4 7 ds m 6 2 ds m and 7 8 ds m compared to the 0 5 ds m treatment meanwhile the reducing sugar content increased by 11 7 14 7 25 8 and 17 1 in 2018 and 10 4 14 4 19 2 and 41 1 in 2019 respectively fig 5d shows that the sugar acid ratio tends to decrease with the increase of eci throughout the fruiting stage when eci 4 7 ds m fig 5c the organic acid content of the saline water treatments was significantly p 0 05 higher than that of the freshwater treatment compared with the freshwater treatment irrigation with 3 1 ds m 4 7 ds m 6 2 ds m and 7 8 ds m saline water increased the organic acid content by 14 4 6 7 35 7 and 28 0 in 2018 and increased by 23 0 37 4 24 6 and 62 8 in 2019 the salt stress of tomatoes is why organic acid content in saline water treatment is higher than ck plants exposed to salt stress will undergo a series of morphological and structural changes accompanied by changes in metabolism and function some special products are produced such as organic acids to adjust cell osmotic pressure the organic acid content did not increase strictly with the increase of eci such as 6 2 ds m treatment in 2019 this unstrict increase in organic acid may be related to the tomato growth condition and the low average soil salinity in the root zone refer to fig 13 in general the eci had a significant effect on flavor quality indicators throughout the fruiting stage fig 6 shows that as the salinity of irrigation water increases by 1 ds m the flavor indicators such as soluble solids reducing sugar and organic acid in tomato fruit increased by 5 3 3 2 and 8 6 at the same time the sugar acid ratio decreased by 4 4 3 3 2 nutrition of tomatoes fig 7a demonstrates that the vitamin c content of tomatoes has a gradually increasing trend with the increase of eci from 2018 to 2019 compared with the freshwater treatment 0 5 ds m irrigation with saline water of 3 1 ds m 4 7 ds m 6 2 ds m and 7 8 ds m resulted in 16 9 30 1 58 3 and 44 3 increase of vitamin c content in 2018 and 8 9 20 0 19 5 and 36 3 increase in 2019 as eci 4 7 ds m the vitamin c content was significantly p 0 05 higher than freshwater treatment and increased by more than 30 fig 7b presents the variation of lycopene content among treatments in 2019 the lycopene content increased by 10 0 8 2 16 7 and 2 9 for 3 1 7 8 ds m treatments compared with the freshwater treatment therefore the salinity of irrigation water can increase the lycopene content to some extent nevertheless the higher eci of irrigation water the more severe salt stress in tomatoes and the more detrimental the lycopene synthesis fig 8 shows that as the salinity of irrigation water increases the vitamin c content increases and for every 1 ds m increase in eci the vitamin c content increases by 6 this increasing trend is because salt stress changes the metabolic processes in tomatoes such as increasing the content of vitamin c and lycopene this change will help tomatoes reduce the adverse effects of increased osmotic pressure cuartero and fernández muñoz 1998 however there is no significant linear relationship between lycopene and eci 3 3 3 appearance of tomatoes as shown in fig 9 the appearance indicators of tomatoes i e single fruit weight and fruit diameter had a declined trend with an increasing eci the differences in single fruit weight and fruit diameter between the saline water and freshwater treatments were insignificant p 0 05 when eci 4 7 ds m those two appearance indicators of tomatoes decreased significantly p 0 05 once eci exceeded 4 7 ds m fig 10 shows the quadratic correlation relationships between tomato appearance indicators and eci single fruit weight and fruit diameter increased slightly with the increase of eci until they reached the maximum value at 1 8 ds m and 2 ds m and then it decreased when the salt in the environment exceeds the tomato tolerance threshold the size and structure of the fruit will be affected the fruit stops growing and matures prematurely which can alleviate the adverse effects of salt stress to a certain extent 3 3 4 firmness of tomatoes as displayed in table 5 tomato firmness did not differ significantly p 0 05 among treatments throughout the growing season however for each of the five treatments tomato firmness tended to increase and then decrease at different growth stages and reached a maximum at the full fruiting stage 12 august to 28 august in the two year experiment the firmness of tomatoes in the same harvest period in 2019 was higher which may be due to the relatively early time of saline water irrigation this year refer to table 3 therefore the response of firmness to salinity stress was more pronounced besides the higher fruit firmness in 2019 may also be due to the high soil salinity content in the root zone refer to table 4 tomato plants were subjected to salinity stress in the soil and therefore the firmness also increased el mogy et al 2018 3 4 tomato yield irrigation water salinity eci had a significant p 0 05 impact on tomato yield including commercial yield and total yield both of which revealed a decreasing trend with the increase of eci fig 11 nevertheless there was no significant p 0 05 difference in tomato yield between saline water treatments and freshwater treatment when eci did not exceed 4 7 ds m in 2018 compared with the freshwater treatment p 0 05 as well as that in 2019 when eci was below 6 2 ds m in 2018 tomatoes had a high bad fruit rate 16 8 27 9 which may be related to a severe problem with insect pests however in the second year the bad fruit rate was only 5 0 18 4 for those irrigated with saline water 3 1 7 8 ds m due to early pesticide spraying the bad fruit rate of tomatoes under the 6 2 ds m treatment was lower than in the first experimental year and only 3 2 higher than the freshwater treatment in that year fig 12a shows the relative commercial yield of tomatoes under different treatments over two years compared with the freshwater treatment the commercial yield of tomatoes irrigated with the eci at 3 1 7 8 ds m declined by 0 2 1 5 28 9 and 25 0 in 2018 and decreased by 13 0 13 5 15 5 and 47 7 in 2019 furthermore the results fig 12b present that the total tomato yield decreased by 5 6 29 6 and 27 5 for 4 7 7 8 ds m treatments in 2018 but increased by 0 8 for 3 1 ds m treatment than freshwater treatment in 2019 the total tomato yield decreased by 11 7 11 0 12 6 and 38 2 compared with freshwater treatment in addition the regression relationship displayed that commercial yield and total yield were declined by 4 8 and 4 4 as the eci increased 1 ds m 4 discussion 4 1 the optimal threshold of eci for producing high quality tomatoes in order to produce high quality tomatoes for economic benefits the optimal threshold of eci should be determined by three aspects i e tomato quality tomato yield and soil salination tomato quality includes various aspects such as tomato flavor nutrition and appearance soluble solids reducing sugar and organic acid play a crucial role in tomato flavor velterop and vos 2001 an increase in eci can promote reducing sugar accumulation malundo et al 1995 abdel gawad et al 2005 for the sugar acid ratio an optimal threshold 7 10 has an excellent flavor ding et al 2017 in this study when irrigated with saline water of 3 1 7 8 ds m the sugar acid ratio of tomatoes was 7 4 9 8 indicating a good flavor vitamin c is an essential nutrient for humans with an excellent antioxidant function kader 1986 li et al 2019 the vitamin c content was significantly p 0 05 higher than the freshwater treatment when the eci 4 7 ds m this finding is consistent with li et al 2019 who confirmed that the saline water treatments 3 0 ds m lead to higher vitamin c content than irrigated continuously with freshwater single fruit weight and fruit diameter are important appearance indicators for tomato quality for this research the single fruit weight and fruit diameter were no significant p 0 05 difference between saline water treatments and freshwater treatment when eci 4 7 ds m however both appearance indicators of tomatoes in case the salinity exceeded 4 7 ds m were significantly p 0 05 decreased similarly the decrease was reported by zhai et al 2015 in addition a diminish in single fruit weight and fruit diameter also contributes to a decrease in crop yield katerji et al 1998 although the salinity increase of irrigation water can improve tomato quality some researchers reported that the salinity increase was generally accompanied by a decreased yield maas and hoffman 1977 bustan et al 2004 zhai et al 2015 we demonstrated the reduction rate of yield e g the commercial yield and total yield as the eci increased was separately declined by 4 8 and 4 4 this result disagrees with that of experiments in a semi humid area which showed that the saline water irrigation had little effect on tomato yield as the eci 4 9 ds m and a slope of 6 7 decreased on tomato yield per 1 ds m when 4 9 eci 10 9 ds m wan et al 2007 chen et al 2009 this distinction is mainly due to the highest eci in this study being 7 8 ds m lower than the highest value 10 9 ds m of eci in the above semi humid area the movement of salt in the soil is a complex process that includes physical chemical and biological factors affected by many factors such as salinity of irrigation water rainfall plant transpiration water consumption soil surface evaporation and spatial variability of soil salinity soil salinity is always in a dynamic process of accumulation and leaching zheng et al 2010 in this study at the end of the first year of saline water irrigation the soil salinity of the plant root zone and soil profile soil salinity increased with irrigation water salinity eci at the end of the second year the soil salinity with eci being 3 1 6 2 ds m did not increase significantly even lower than the initial salinity value of the experiment that year this result was coherent with chen et al 2009 who conducted experiments with saline water 1 1 4 9 ds m drip irrigation in the semi humid area however soil salinity increased in both ck and st4 treatments there may be several reasons for the soil salinity change in different treatments for the 2019 year i at the beginning of the experiment in 2019 the background value of ece was relatively high 3 68 ds m this phenomenon was due to the plowing of all plots before the start of the second year after plowing all experiment plots had the same soil salinity ii the saline water of appropriate concentration was conducive to salt leaching some research indicated that the increase of irrigation water salinity could change the soil structure and increase the effective pores of the soil thereby enhancing the infiltration performance of the soil to a certain extent homaee 1999 huang et al 2011 the most robust soil infiltration capacity was when the irrigation water salinity was around 3 g l 5 0 ds m shi et al 2005 however too high a salt concentration will cause the soil porosity to decrease and even produce soil crusts oster and schroer 1979 reducing the infiltration rate feigin et al 1991 the lowest average soil salinity of 4 7 ds m treatment may be related to its strong infiltration capacity and high salt leaching efficiency freshwater treatment moderately affects infiltration refer to table 2 and the salt leaching rate was low which may be one of the reasons for the high average soil salinity in addition the ck treated tomatoes have vigorous growth high yields and large water requirements therefore most of the irrigation water is absorbed and consumed by the tomato plants and less irrigation water infiltrates into the soil and the salt leaching efficiency is low iii the salt ions brought by fertilization increase the soil salinity just like the increase from 0 86 ds m to 1 1 ds m in the 2018 experiment iv it may also be related to the location of the soil samples and high spatial variability along soil profiles under saline water drip irrigation was also an important reason wan et al 2007 in general it can be inferred that under the water salt regulation wsr method the soil salinity in arid regions could also be kept balanced with increasing experiment years when the eci was 3 1 6 2 ds m 4 2 relationship between soil salinity and tomato quality in addition to irrigation water salinity eci the soil salinity in the root zone also impacts crop quality cramer et al 2001 and yield steppuhn et al 2005 most plant roots are mainly distributed at a depth of 0 40 cm where also the root system absorbs water bassoi et al 2003 kang and wan 2005 wan and kang 2006 wang et al 2007 in this study the tomato root zone represents a 0 40 cm depth range away from the dripper from 0 to 35 cm the soil salinity was indicated by the ece electric conductivity of the saturated soil extract the average electric conductivity in the root zone was denoted by ec e which is a weighted average in time at the same time we used linear fitting to analyze the relationship between the quality data of the tomato fruiting period with ec e in the two year experiment the quality indicators of flavor i e reducing sugar organic acid and sugar acid ratio and nutrition vitamin c had a significant p 0 05 relationship with the ec e fig 13 three indicators including reducing sugar organic acid and vitamin c increased linearly with the increase of ec e as the ec e increased by 1 ds m the three indicators increased by 0 3 0 07 and 0 02 mg g while the sugar acid ratio of tomatoes decreased by 1 3 as shown in fig 13b the sugar acid ratio is defined as the reducing sugar content divided by the organic acid content since reducing sugar and organic acid increase at different rates with increasing salinity the sugar acid ratio increases quadratically linearly with the salt content hence there is a trend of falling first and then remaining stable or rising slightly furthermore using salinity water with eci 4 7 ds m the ec e of 0 40 cm depth was no more than 4 ds m non saline soil the total yield and the commercial yield dropped by less than 11 0 and 13 5 fig 14 the economic benefit of tomatoes was guaranteed and the safety of the soil environment was ensured 5 conclusions a two year field experiment was conducted in the arid area of northwest china the water salt regulation wsr method which controls the soil matric potential threshold at a depth of 20 cm straightly below the emitter to 20 kpa was used to irrigate tomatoes with saline water to evaluate the effect of irrigation water salinity eci on tomato quality the results showed that the content of several quality indicators i e soluble solids reducing sugar organic acid and vitamin c in the treatment with eci 4 7 ds m was significantly higher than that in the freshwater treatment and the sugar acid ratio was appropriate 7 4 9 8 in addition the tomato yield decreased with the increased eci and the commercial yield and total yield decreased by 4 8 and 4 4 for each increase of 1 ds m the soil salinity at 0 40 cm depth did not exceed 4 ds m non saline soil when irrigating with eci 4 7 ds m inferring that the soil salinity maintained balance under the wsr method according to the experiment results in arid areas lacking freshwater resources based on reasonable field management measures such as mulching proper irrigation flow plant spacing it is recommended to use 4 7 ds m of saline water to irrigate field grown tomatoes under the wsr method in this way the reduction of yield may be compensated by improving the quality declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

9724,saline water irrigation can alleviate the deficiency of agricultural freshwater resources especially in arid regions however saline water may lead to soil salinization and affect crop quality a water salt regulation wsr irrigation method has been developed to avoid soil salinization to investigate the effect of saline water irrigation on crop quality while maintaining soil salinity balance we conducted a field experiment on tomatoes under the wsr method in the arid region of northwest china from 2018 to 2019 five treatments with electrical conductivity eci of 0 5 ds m 3 1 ds m 4 7 ds m 6 2 ds m and 7 8 ds m were designed where eci indicates salinities of irrigation water we applied the wsr method for all five treatments to maintain the soil matric potential smp above 20 kpa at a depth of 20 cm below drip emitters the results from three aspects quality yield and soil salinity are as follows i saline water irrigation can improve tomato quality as evidenced by increasing the content of soluble solids reducing sugar organic acid and vitamin c when eci ranged from 4 7 ds m to 7 8 ds m the sugar acid ratio was in the appropriate scope 7 4 9 8 ii the commercial yield and total yield declined by 4 8 and 4 4 as the eci increased 1 ds m iii the soil salinity can be kept balanced under the wsr method after a 2 year experiment when the eci of saline water did not exceed 4 7 ds m therefore in similar arid areas with a lack of freshwater resources saline water of 4 7 ds m under the wsr method can be used to irrigate field grown tomatoes compensating for the reduced yield by improving quality keywords water salt regulation saline water drip irrigation tomato quality 1 introduction in the arid regions of northwest china agriculture is facing freshwater deficiency caused by low precipitation and high evaporation losses ma et al 2005 chen 2014 nevertheless there are abundant saline water resources underneath these regions for instance the amount of bitter saline water with an electrical conductivity of 2 1 ds m is 2 4 billion m3 in gansu province accounting for 8 3 of its total water resources wang et al 2009 consequently saline water irrigation can be an effective way to alleviate freshwater deficiency with a long term irrational irrigation method such as traditional furrow irrigation flood irrigation or alternating supply of fresh and saline water adopted saline water irrigation will cause soluble salts to cumulate in the soil malash et al 2005 studied the effects of different irrigation methods including drip irrigation furrow irrigation mixed saline water and freshwater irrigation on tomato growth and yield in the nile delta egypt the result showed that soluble salts at the root zone of the furrow irrigation method were higher than that in drip irrigation the soluble salts will affect the soil s physicochemical properties such as reduced infiltration rates hydraulic conductivity and soil water potential which can lead to secondary salinization oster and schroer 1979 shainberg and levy 1992 homaee 1999 kitamura et al 2006 meanwhile salt accumulation in the root zone makes it difficult for the crop roots to absorb water the resulting water stress closes the stomata weakens photosynthesis and ultimately affects crop growth rhoades et al 1992 ismail and burrage 1994 baath et al 2017 several researchers have proposed various saline irrigation methods to prevent excessive soil salinization and ensure crop yield hamdy 1993 oster 1994 malash et al 2005 the methods include leaching salts by freshwater rotating irrigation with freshwater and saline water or mixing saline water with freshwater however these irrigation methods are mainly used in areas with good salt drainage conditions or adequate rainfall drip irrigation is considered the most effective irrigation method for saline water utilization goldberg et al 1976 kang 1998 it provides a uniform continuous and high frequency water supply to the soil facilitating salt leaching from crop roots a research group from the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research igsnrr cas established a water salt regulation wsr method wan et al 2007 2010 chen et al 2009 kang et al 2009 2012 its main guideline was to control the threshold of soil matric potential smp at a depth of 20 cm directly below the emitter controlling smp can effectively compensate for the reduced soil infiltration potential due to the high salinity of irrigation water thereby maintaining the total water potential to ensure the available water for plants the wsr method can mitigate soil salinity accumulation and crop yield reduction caused by saline water irrigation several studies have been conducted in arid semi arid and humid areas under the wsr method wan et al 2007 2010 applied saline water eci 1 1 4 9 ds m to irrigate the tomato and found that the salinity in the 0 90 cm soil profile did not increase significantly after three years of irrigation kang et al 2009 2010 and chen et al 2009 discovered that soil salinity could sustain balance even with high saline water of 10 9 ds m yield reductions of tomatoes cucumber oil sunflower and waxy corn were only 6 7 7 5 1 7 and 1 4 per 1 ds m eci increase these yield reductions were lower than those reported by the us saline soil laboratory e g 10 tomato yield reduction per 1 ds m eci increase maas and hoffman 1977 maas 1986 these studies have shown that the wsr method can effectively leach soil salt with the increase of the saline water irrigation period the soil salinity can also maintain balance tomato is an essential crop with high nutritional value producing high quality tomatoes is not only a concern for farmers but also a hot topic for researchers several studies have confirmed that saline water irrigation can improve tomato quality by changing the flavor nutrition storage and other quality indicators campos et al 2006 zhai et al 2015 el mogy et al 2018 li et al 2019 abdel gawad et al 2005 demonstrated that the total sugar and total soluble solids contents of tomato fruit under saline water 1 2 7 5 ds m irrigation were higher than non saline water irrigation 1 ds m wang et al 2014 conducted saline water drip irrigated experiments on tomatoes in northwest china they found that the content of soluble solids organic acid and vitamin c in tomato fruit increased with rising salinity despite decreased tomato yield a number of studies have explored the effect of saline water irrigation on tomato quality however long term saline water irrigation may lead to soil salt accumulation and there is still a lack of research on the effect under the conditions of maintaining the soil salt balance to fill this gap we conducted a field experiment under the wsr method in a typical arid region of gansu china the wsr method is used to maintain the soil salt balance focusing on tomato quality we also analyzed tomato yield economic efficiency and salinity threshold of irrigation water the main objectives were 1 to analyze the effect of irrigation water salinity eci on tomato quality under the wsr method 2 to explore an optimal salinity threshold of irrigation water for producing high quality tomatoes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted for two successive years 2018 2019 at the jinchang farmland water cycle

experimental design four saline water treatments were set up with different eci 3 1 ds m 4 7 ds m 6 2 ds m 7 8 ds m and local freshwater eci 0 5 ds m was used as a control check ck the four saline water treatments were obtained by mixing the local freshwater 0 5 ds m and the underground salinity water eci 14 1 ds m the eci of mixed irrigation water was measured with an instrument of water quality multiparameter ysi 6050000 usa table 2 shows the chemical properties of the irrigation water in five treatments tomatoes were double row planted in a zigzag pattern around each drip tape drip tape emitter discharge of 1 38 l h at 0 1 mpa operating pressure was placed on the center of double row plantings plantings were spaced 20 cm apart per tape and emitter spacing was 30 cm fig 1 the planting density was approximately 57 165 plants ha the soil of each treatment was covered with white polyethylene plastic mulch before planting the layout of drip tapes in a single mulch is shown in fig 2 during two plant seasons the tomato cultivar and dates of transplanting harvest irrigation are shown in table 3 tomato solanum lycopersicum hezuo no 918 seedlings were transplanted to the field in 2018 3 may and 2019 4 may 2 3 irrigation every treatment was equipped with a gravity drip irrigation unit consisting of drip irrigation tapes and a bucket with a volume of about 300 l the bucket was installed at the height of 0 8 m above the ground after tomato transplanting the first freshwater irrigation was applied until the wetted radius was about 10 cm along the horizontal plane around emitters following the rejuvenation period of the tomato the seedlings were irrigated with saline water at the same time an electronic vacuum tensiometer was placed at 20 cm depth below the emitter to measure the soil matric potential smp we recorded the readings of the tensiometer at 8 00 a m and 3 00 p m each day the threshold of smp was set according to the type of crop for tomatoes the recommended smp threshold was 20 kpa chen et al 2009 wan et al 2007 we started irrigation when the smp was lower than 20 kpa the amount of water per irrigation was 8 mm once the smp reached 10 kpa irrigation was stopped if the smp record were still lower than 10 kpa after the first irrigation another 8 mm water would be irrigated 2 4 fertilization and agronomic practices all treatments utilized

dressing of pure n p2o5 and k2o were about 216 kg ha 48 kg ha and 240 kg ha for the actual growth of tomatoes cumulative application of urea n 46 potassium dihydrogen phosphate p2o5 52 k2o 34 potassium sulfate k2o 50 were about 463 kg ha 92 kg ha and 417 kg ha respectively the fertilizer application method and amount were the same for both experiment seasons precaution of disease and pest was taken in the early stage of the fruit set and applied appropriately meantime the side branches of the tomato plant were removed in time for the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons furthermore all tomato plants retained five fruit ears after topping in 2019 2 5 observation and sampling method 2 5 1 weather data precipitation data were provided by automatic weather stations vantagepro2 davis instruments corp ca usa 2 5 2 soil salinity ec e and elements soils were sampled for each treatment before and after the experiment in 2018 and 2019 respectively the horizontal distance to drip tapes

method was used to calculate the mean value of soil indicators the figures were plotted by originpro version 2020 originlab corporation northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 rainfall and irrigation 3 1 1 rainfall as displayed in fig 3 the total rainfall of the tomato growing season was 118 6 mm in 2018 and 105 6 mm in 2019 the tomato growth during the experiment period can be divided into three stages seeding stage stage i from 3 may to 10 june flowering and fruit setting stage stage ii from 11 june to 15 july and fruiting stage stage iii from 16 july to 10 september the rainfall distribution of the three stage in 2018 was 10 8 mm 18 0 mm and 89 9 mm accounting for 9 1 15 2 and 75 7 of the total rainfall whereas in 2019 was 25 4 mm 31 8 mm and 48 4 mm accounting for 24 1 30 1 and 45 8 respectively there were seven effective rainfall events 4 2 mm during the tomato growing seasons the effective rainfall was 71 2 mm in 2018 and 78 4 mm in 2019 in particular the effective rainfall during the fruiting stage in 2018 was 61 2 mm which relieved irrigation pressure 3 1 2 irrigation in 2018 the total irrigation amount for the five treatments was 507 mm 501 mm 564 mm 469 mm and 505 mm as shown in fig 3a the irrigation amount of st1 st4 treatments consisted of 232 mm 249 mm 254 mm and 244 mm freshwater stage i as well as 269 mm 315 mm 215 mm and 262 mm saline water stage ii iii in the second year 2019 year the total irrigation amount of the ck st1 st4 treatments were 686 mm 581 mm 591 mm 563 mm and 529 mm for ck st4 treatments the irrigation amount contained 125 mm 135 mm 137 mm 156 mm and 152 mm freshwater stage i along with 446 mm 454 mm 408 mm and 377 mm saline water stage ii iii there may be two reasons why the cumulative irrigation of 4 7 ds m was higher than that of ck in 2018 i the first reason may be the late start of saline water irrigation in 2018 to find a suitable saline water source in the first year since tomatoes under salt stress would consume less water than freshwater irrigation the cumulative irrigation amount of 4 7 ds m should be lower than ck however the opposite was confirmed in 2018 which may be due to tomatoes delayed response to salt stress ii the second reason may be that the 4 7 ds m treatment has better infiltration ability and higher salt leaching efficiency than ck tomatoes treated with 4 7 ds m would consume extra water to infiltrate into the soil to leach salt the irrigation amount in 2019 was generally more than that in 2018 which may be related to the vigorous growth and higher yields of tomatoes in the second year as illustrated in fig 3b irrigation with saline water at 3 1 ds m 4 7 ds m 6 2 ds m and 7 8 ds m during 2019 stage ii and iii resulted in 20 6 19 2 27 4 and 32 9 water saving during stage iii the difference in irrigation water amount between treatments i e the distance of the five lines in fig 3b gradually increased among the five lines the ck treatment increased the fastest to sum up irrigation amount tended to decrease with the increasing salinity of irrigation water eci approximately 19 5 mm decrease for each 1 ds m increase of eci saline water irrigation in stages ii and iii resulted in water savings of 19 33 108 185 mm compared with the treatment of ck it may be related to the water consumption reduction under salt stress the reduction in irrigation is consistent with a finding in a semi humid region of china wan et al 2007 demonstrated that applying saline water to tomato cultivation can save freshwater for irrigation 3 2 the salinity of soil ec e fig 4 presents the salinity distribution of soil profile at the initial and end of each year at the end of the 2018 experiment the mean soil salinity ece ec of the saturated soil extract at the 0 10 cm depth for saline water treatments did not increase significantly however their mean ece at 10 50 cm depth increased remarkably the average ece of 0 100 cm for ck st4 treatments was 1 1 ds m 2 2 ds m 2 8 ds m 3 0 ds m 3 4 ds m respectively compared with the first soil sample on 3rd june 2018 30 days after the start of freshwater irrigation and 36 days before saline water irrigation they increased by 9 4 155 4 221 6 250 6 and 289 9 meantime the mean ece at the end of the experiment is positively related to the eci the mean ece increased even with freshwater irrigation which may be induced by fertigation table 4 shows the average ece in the tomato root zone 0 40 cm and profile 0 100 cm for the initial and end of the experiment in 2018 2019 at the end of the second year experiment 2019 the mean ece of the ck st4 treatments at 0 100 cm depth were 4 3 ds m 3 5 ds m 2 2 ds m 3 2 ds m and 4 7 ds m when eci ranges from 3 1 to 6 2 ds m the increment in average salinity of root zone and soil profile in 2019 was negative the experiment end value minus the initial value in 2019 while the increment in average salinity in 2018 was positive the mean salinity in the entire soil profile for the st1 st3 treatments was no saline ece 4 ds m is non saline soil richards 1954 these results showed that after two years of saline drip irrigation ece did not continue to increase but remained stable however the average ece of the soil profile for ck treatment increased this increase may be related to the moderate infiltration of local freshwater chemicals refer to table 2 in addition it may also be related to the higher initial ece 3 68 ds m in the second year experiment and the spatial variability of the soil 3 3 the quality of tomatoes 3 3 1 flavor of tomatoes fig 5 illustrates the changes of tomato flavor indicators between two years such as soluble solids reducing sugar organic acid and sugar acid ratio the contents of soluble solids reducing sugar and organic acid increased with eci electrical conductivity of irrigation water the three contents of the saline water treatments were significantly p 0 05 higher than those of the freshwater treatment 0 5 ds m however the sugar acid ratio under saline water irrigation was lower than that of freshwater treatment the sugar acid ratio is defined as the ratio of reducing sugar to organic acids the soluble solids content of tomatoes increased by 6 1 21 3 19 2 and 41 1 with saline irrigation of 3 1 ds m 4 7 ds m 6 2 ds m and 7 8 ds m compared to the 0 5 ds m treatment meanwhile the reducing sugar content increased by 11 7 14 7 25 8 and 17 1 in 2018 and 10 4 14 4 19 2 and 41 1 in 2019 respectively fig 5d shows that the sugar acid ratio tends to decrease with the increase of eci throughout the fruiting stage when eci 4 7 ds m fig 5c the organic acid content of the saline water treatments was significantly p 0 05 higher than that of the freshwater treatment compared with the freshwater treatment irrigation with 3 1 ds m 4 7 ds m 6 2 ds m and 7 8 ds m saline water increased the organic acid content by 14 4 6 7 35 7 and 28 0 in 2018 and increased by 23 0 37 4 24 6 and 62 8 in 2019 the salt stress of tomatoes is why organic acid content in saline water treatment is higher than ck plants exposed to salt stress will undergo a series of morphological and structural changes accompanied by changes in metabolism and function some special products are produced such as organic acids to adjust cell osmotic pressure the organic acid content did not increase strictly with the increase of eci such as 6 2 ds m treatment in 2019 this unstrict increase in organic acid may be related to the tomato growth condition and the low average soil salinity in the root zone refer to fig 13 in general the eci had a significant effect on flavor quality indicators throughout the fruiting stage fig 6 shows that as the salinity of irrigation water increases by 1 ds m the flavor indicators such as soluble solids reducing sugar and organic acid in tomato fruit increased by 5 3 3 2 and 8 6 at the same time the sugar acid ratio decreased by 4 4 3 3 2 nutrition of tomatoes fig 7a demonstrates that the vitamin c content of tomatoes has a gradually increasing trend with the increase of eci from 2018 to 2019 compared with the freshwater treatment 0 5 ds m irrigation with saline water of 3 1 ds m 4 7 ds m 6 2 ds m and 7 8 ds m resulted in 16 9 30 1 58 3 and 44 3 increase of vitamin c content in 2018 and 8 9 20 0 19 5 and 36 3 increase in 2019 as eci 4 7 ds m the vitamin c content was significantly p 0 05 higher than freshwater treatment and increased by more than 30 fig 7b presents the variation of lycopene content among treatments in 2019 the lycopene content increased by 10 0 8 2 16 7 and 2 9 for 3 1 7 8 ds m treatments compared with the freshwater treatment therefore the salinity of irrigation water can increase the lycopene content to some extent nevertheless the higher eci of irrigation water the more severe salt stress in tomatoes and the more detrimental the lycopene synthesis fig 8 shows that as the salinity of irrigation water increases the vitamin c content increases and for every 1 ds m increase in eci the vitamin c content increases by 6 this increasing trend is because salt stress changes the metabolic processes in tomatoes such as increasing the content of vitamin c and lycopene this change will help tomatoes reduce the adverse effects of increased osmotic pressure cuartero and fernández muñoz 1998 however there is no significant linear relationship between lycopene and eci 3 3 3 appearance of tomatoes as shown in fig 9 the appearance indicators of tomatoes i e single fruit weight and fruit diameter had a declined trend with an increasing eci the differences in single fruit weight and fruit diameter between the saline water and freshwater treatments were insignificant p 0 05 when eci 4 7 ds m those two appearance indicators of tomatoes decreased significantly p 0 05 once eci exceeded 4 7 ds m fig 10 shows the quadratic correlation relationships between tomato appearance indicators and eci single fruit weight and fruit diameter increased slightly with the increase of eci until they reached the maximum value at 1 8 ds m and 2 ds m and then it decreased when the salt in the environment exceeds the tomato tolerance threshold the size and structure of the fruit will be affected the fruit stops growing and matures prematurely which can alleviate the adverse effects of salt stress to a certain extent 3 3 4 firmness of tomatoes as displayed in table 5 tomato firmness did not differ significantly p 0 05 among treatments throughout the growing season however for each of the five treatments tomato firmness tended to increase and then decrease at different growth stages and reached a maximum at the full fruiting stage 12 august to 28 august in the two year experiment the firmness of tomatoes in the same harvest period in 2019 was higher which may be due to the relatively early time of saline water irrigation this year refer to table 3 therefore the response of firmness to salinity stress was more pronounced besides the higher fruit firmness in 2019 may also be due to the high soil salinity content in the root zone refer to table 4 tomato plants were subjected to salinity stress in the soil and therefore the firmness also increased el mogy et al 2018 3 4 tomato yield irrigation water salinity eci had a significant p 0 05 impact on tomato yield including commercial yield and total yield both of which revealed a decreasing trend with the increase of eci fig 11 nevertheless there was no significant p 0 05 difference in tomato yield between saline water treatments and freshwater treatment when eci did not exceed 4 7 ds m in 2018 compared with the freshwater treatment p 0 05 as well as that in 2019 when eci was below 6 2 ds m in 2018 tomatoes had a high bad fruit rate 16 8 27 9 which may be related to a severe problem with insect pests however in the second year the bad fruit rate was only 5 0 18 4 for those irrigated with saline water 3 1 7 8 ds m due to early pesticide spraying the bad fruit rate of tomatoes under the 6 2 ds m treatment was lower than in the first experimental year and only 3 2 higher than the freshwater treatment in that year fig 12a shows the relative commercial yield of tomatoes under different treatments over two years compared with the freshwater treatment the commercial yield of tomatoes irrigated with the eci at 3 1 7 8 ds m declined by 0 2 1 5 28 9 and 25 0 in 2018 and decreased by 13 0 13 5 15 5 and 47 7 in 2019 furthermore the results fig 12b present that the total tomato yield decreased by 5 6 29 6 and 27 5 for 4 7 7 8 ds m treatments in 2018 but increased by 0 8 for 3 1 ds m treatment than freshwater treatment in 2019 the total tomato yield decreased by 11 7 11 0 12 6 and 38 2 compared with freshwater treatment in addition the regression relationship displayed that commercial yield and total yield were declined by 4 8 and 4 4 as the eci increased 1 ds m 4 discussion 4 1 the optimal threshold of eci for producing high quality tomatoes in order to produce high quality tomatoes for economic benefits the optimal threshold of eci should be determined by three aspects i e tomato quality tomato yield and soil salination tomato quality includes various aspects such as tomato flavor nutrition and appearance soluble solids reducing sugar and organic acid play a crucial role in tomato flavor velterop and vos 2001 an increase in eci can promote reducing sugar accumulation malundo et al 1995 abdel gawad et al 2005 for the sugar acid ratio an optimal threshold 7 10 has an excellent flavor ding et al 2017 in this study when irrigated with saline water of 3 1 7 8 ds m the sugar acid ratio of tomatoes was 7 4 9 8 indicating a good flavor vitamin c is an essential nutrient for humans with an excellent antioxidant function kader 1986 li et al 2019 the vitamin c content was significantly p 0 05 higher than the freshwater treatment when the eci 4 7 ds m this finding is consistent with li et al 2019 who confirmed that the saline water treatments 3 0 ds m lead to higher vitamin c content than irrigated continuously with freshwater single fruit weight and fruit diameter are important appearance indicators for tomato quality for this research the single fruit weight and fruit diameter were no significant p 0 05 difference between saline water treatments and freshwater treatment when eci 4 7 ds m however both appearance indicators of tomatoes in case the salinity exceeded 4 7 ds m were significantly p 0 05 decreased similarly the decrease was reported by zhai et al 2015 in addition a diminish in single fruit weight and fruit diameter also contributes to a decrease in crop yield katerji et al 1998 although the salinity increase of irrigation water can improve tomato quality some researchers reported that the salinity increase was generally accompanied by a decreased yield maas and hoffman 1977 bustan et al 2004 zhai et al 2015 we demonstrated the reduction rate of yield e g the commercial yield and total yield as the eci increased was separately declined by 4 8 and 4 4 this result disagrees with that of experiments in a semi humid area which showed that the saline water irrigation had little effect on tomato yield as the eci 4 9 ds m and a slope of 6 7 decreased on tomato yield per 1 ds m when 4 9 eci 10 9 ds m wan et al 2007 chen et al 2009 this distinction is mainly due to the highest eci in this study being 7 8 ds m lower than the highest value 10 9 ds m of eci in the above semi humid area the movement of salt in the soil is a complex process that includes physical chemical and biological factors affected by many factors such as salinity of irrigation water rainfall plant transpiration water consumption soil surface evaporation and spatial variability of soil salinity soil salinity is always in a dynamic process of accumulation and leaching zheng et al 2010 in this study at the end of the first year of saline water irrigation the soil salinity of the plant root zone and soil profile soil salinity increased with irrigation water salinity eci at the end of the second year the soil salinity with eci being 3 1 6 2 ds m did not increase significantly even lower than the initial salinity value of the experiment that year this result was coherent with chen et al 2009 who conducted experiments with saline water 1 1 4 9 ds m drip irrigation in the semi humid area however soil salinity increased in both ck and st4 treatments there may be several reasons for the soil salinity change in different treatments for the 2019 year i at the beginning of the experiment in 2019 the background value of ece was relatively high 3 68 ds m this phenomenon was due to the plowing of all plots before the start of the second year after plowing all experiment plots had the same soil salinity ii the saline water of appropriate concentration was conducive to salt leaching some research indicated that the increase of irrigation water salinity could change the soil structure and increase the effective pores of the soil thereby enhancing the infiltration performance of the soil to a certain extent homaee 1999 huang et al 2011 the most robust soil infiltration capacity was when the irrigation water salinity was around 3 g l 5 0 ds m shi et al 2005 however too high a salt concentration will cause the soil porosity to decrease and even produce soil crusts oster and schroer 1979 reducing the infiltration rate feigin et al 1991 the lowest average soil salinity of 4 7 ds m treatment may be related to its strong infiltration capacity and high salt leaching efficiency freshwater treatment moderately affects infiltration refer to table 2 and the salt leaching rate was low which may be one of the reasons for the high average soil salinity in addition the ck treated tomatoes have vigorous growth high yields and large water requirements therefore most of the irrigation water is absorbed and consumed by the tomato plants and less irrigation water infiltrates into the soil and the salt leaching efficiency is low iii the salt ions brought by fertilization increase the soil salinity just like the increase from 0 86 ds m to 1 1 ds m in the 2018 experiment iv it may also be related to the location of the soil samples and high spatial variability along soil profiles under saline water drip irrigation was also an important reason wan et al 2007 in general it can be inferred that under the water salt regulation wsr method the soil salinity in arid regions could also be kept balanced with increasing experiment years when the eci was 3 1 6 2 ds m 4 2 relationship between soil salinity and tomato quality in addition to irrigation water salinity eci the soil salinity in the root zone also impacts crop quality cramer et al 2001 and yield steppuhn et al 2005 most plant roots are mainly distributed at a depth of 0 40 cm where also the root system absorbs water bassoi et al 2003 kang and wan 2005 wan and kang 2006 wang et al 2007 in this study the tomato root zone represents a 0 40 cm depth range away from the dripper from 0 to 35 cm the soil salinity was indicated by the ece electric conductivity of the saturated soil extract the average electric conductivity in the root zone was denoted by ec e which is a weighted average in time at the same time we used linear fitting to analyze the relationship between the quality data of the tomato fruiting period with ec e in the two year experiment the quality indicators of flavor i e reducing sugar organic acid and sugar acid ratio and nutrition vitamin c had a significant p 0 05 relationship with the ec e fig 13 three indicators including reducing sugar organic acid and vitamin c increased linearly with the increase of ec e as the ec e increased by 1 ds m the three indicators increased by 0 3 0 07 and 0 02 mg g while the sugar acid ratio of tomatoes decreased by 1 3 as shown in fig 13b the sugar acid ratio is defined as the reducing sugar content divided by the organic acid content since reducing sugar and organic acid increase at different rates with increasing salinity the sugar acid ratio increases quadratically linearly with the salt content hence there is a trend of falling first and then remaining stable or rising slightly furthermore using salinity water with eci 4 7 ds m the ec e of 0 40 cm depth was no more than 4 ds m non saline soil the total yield and the commercial yield dropped by less than 11 0 and 13 5 fig 14 the economic benefit of tomatoes was guaranteed and the safety of the soil environment was ensured 5 conclusions a two year field experiment was conducted in the arid area of northwest china the water salt regulation wsr method which controls the soil matric potential threshold at a depth of 20 cm straightly below the emitter to 20 kpa was used to irrigate tomatoes with saline water to evaluate the effect of irrigation water salinity eci on tomato quality the results showed that the content of several quality indicators i e soluble solids reducing sugar organic acid and vitamin c in the treatment with eci 4 7 ds m was significantly higher than that in the freshwater treatment and the sugar acid ratio was appropriate 7 4 9 8 in addition the tomato yield decreased with the increased eci and the commercial yield and total yield decreased by 4 8 and 4 4 for each increase of 1 ds m the soil salinity at 0 40 cm depth did not exceed 4 ds m non saline soil when irrigating with eci 4 7 ds m inferring that the soil salinity maintained balance under the wsr method according to the experiment results in arid areas lacking freshwater resources based on reasonable field management measures such as mulching proper irrigation flow plant spacing it is recommended to use 4 7 ds m of saline water to irrigate field grown tomatoes under the wsr method in this way the reduction of yield may be compensated by improving the quality declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
