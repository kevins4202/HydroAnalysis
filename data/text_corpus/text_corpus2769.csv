south africa school of molecular and cell biology university of the witwatersrand johannesburg 1 jan smuts avenue wits 2050 south africa corresponding author biological sulfate reduction offers prospects to co treat a variety of organic and inorganic waste effluents because of the ability of sulfate reducing bacteria srb to reduce sulfate to sulfide and generating alkalinity while using organic substrates for their metabolism srb are found in sulfate rich waters such as acid mine drainage amd amd does not contain enough organic substrates to sustain srb metabolism and growth commercial grade organic electron donors such as ethanol lactate and methanol have been used successfully in the treatment of amd but are costly to sustain long term treatment of amd this calls for the exploration of cheap and locally available organic substrates as alternatives this study therefore explores utilization of locally available industrial agricultural and domestic wastewaters in providing organic substrates for sulfate reduction in the treatment of amd the study leverages the ability of srb to use organic substrates while reducing sulfate to hydrogen sulfide organic substrates can be removed from the organic rich effluent through sulfate reduction while the biologically generated hydrogen sulfide can be used to precipitate dissolved metals biogenic alkalinity attenuates ph and hence amd can be made free of sulfate metals and acidity keywords acid mine drainage dissimilatory sulfate reduction pollution 1 introduction industrial domestic agricultural and mining wastes can cause damage to the environment if improperly discharged the damage may be because of air pollution from greenhouse gases land pollution as solid waste is dumped in waste heaps or water pollution where both organic and inorganic rich effluents are released into the ground and surface water without adequate treatment water pollution reduces the availability of fresh water for industrial agricultural domestic and recreational purposes many parts of the world have experienced insufficient water supplies at some time 1 2 world population increases call for more industrialization mechanisation and urbanisation to support the needs of the growing population this means more water is needed to support these activities as a result clean water shortages are projected in the near future 1 in south africa it is projected that by 2030 the demand for water will exceed the supply 3 therefore fresh water resources should be managed by preventing the dumping of untreated waste into the environment biological treatment of sulfate and or sulfate and metal rich effluent has been explored with various levels of success using sulfate reducing bacteria to reduce sulfate to sulfide in the presents of an electron donor in the process generating alkalinity the sulfide reacts with dissolved metals to form insoluble metal precipitates the alkalinity improves the ph in low ph sulfate rich waters 4 8 one of the major challenges determining the success of biological treatment processes is the organic feedstock for sulfate reduction a range of organic materials may provide the organic substrates the availability and degradability of the organic feedstock determines the success of the treatment process the costs of some feedstock such as ethanol lactate and hydrogen makes the application of biological treatment expensive there is therefore need to use cheap and locally available feedstock several organic rich waste streams can be cheap alternatives in the biological treatment of amd using dissimilatory sulfate reduction 9 10 this paper looks at the availability of organic rich industrial agricultural municipal and domestic waste as potential substrates for sulfate reduction in relation to their proximity to amd generating areas globally waste streams produced by the coal to liquid ctl technology focussing on fischer tropsch wastewater ftww are specifically examined ftww has a high chemical oxygen demand contributed by mainly short chain fatty acids and alcohols 11 sulfate reducing bacteria readily use short chain fatty acids and alcohols for dissimilatory sulfate reduction ctl plants using coal as their feed are usually located on or near coal mining plants which have the potential to produce large volumes of amd ctl plants produces large volumes of organic rich ftww ftww and amd waste streams can be combined and co treated using sulfate reduction this technology can be applied with other organic rich effluents generated from industries such as sugar processing winery and brewery pulp and paper tanning biodiesel domestic and many more using these locally based organic rich waste streams reduces the cost of both supply as these are waste material which require treatment and no transport is needed as these are found on or near coal mining plants this makes the use of ftww and or other organic rich industrial waste found in proximity to mining sites more practical and economical treatment options a major concern in using biological sulfate reduction for the treatment of amd and other sulfate rich wastewaters is the production of hydrogen sulfide which is toxic odorous and corrosive and may cause damage to infrastructure 12 feris and kotze 2015 13 in the treatment of amd this concern is partially addressed as some of the hydrogen sulfide is removed through metal sulfide precipitation excess sulfide can be removed as sulfur through partial oxidation under controlled oxygen concentrations in an aerobic sulfur oxidising reactor 14 in the absence of metals sulfide accumulates resulting in severe inhibition of the treatment process and in some cases leading to process failure 15 mechanisms are needed to reduce the concentration of sulfide in the reactors which may be in the form of diluting the sulfate rich wastewater another value addition in the biological treatment of amd is the possibility of selectively recovering metals under controlled conditions 1 1 acid mine drainage acid mine drainage is prevalent in mostly mining areas because of both active and closed mining activities 12 16 17 mining activities expose sulfide containing rocks to oxygen and water 18 21 other activities such as excavations for infrastructure construction also have the effect of exposing sulfide containing rocks to the elements the exposed sulfide is oxidised to sulfate in chemical reactions which are greatly enhanced by the activities of bacteria 22 10 23 25 iron sulfide pyrite is the major contributor of amd in the presence of oxygen and water pyrite is oxidised to sulfate metals are mobilised and acidity is formed 26 21 27 pyrite oxidation is a multistep process involving an oxygen independent reaction and an oxygen dependant reaction 27 the overall stoichiometric equation for the formation of amd is as shown in equation 1 1 fes2 3 75o2 3 5h2o fe oh 3 2so4 2 4h energy in nature the reactions involved in the formation of amd occur slowly and water has the ability to buffer both the acidity and soluble metal ions mining activities amplify these reactions by exposing large surface area of sulfidic rocks resulting in the production of large volumes of amd overwhelming the natural buffering capacity of natural water streams 16 28 29 the reactions produce acidity which contributes in solubilising and hence mobilising metal ions like iron zinc radium lead uranium and many more 26 16 all these oxidation products result in an effluent with high concentration of dissolved heavy metals sulfate and a very low ph 12 17 30 31 resulting in adverse impact on the environment 1 2 impacts of amd on the ecosystem amd introduces non biodegradable heavy metals elevated concentrations of sulfate as well as high acidity to ground water and receiving surface water 32 24 33 34 the metals tend to bio accumulate affecting the health of animals and potentially humans 12 35 36 metals such as fe3 precipitates as fe oh 3 in water bodies producing a yellow orange coloration of the water which affects the ecosystems food chains and webs as light is blocked for photosynthetic aquatic organisms 13 37 the coating of the stream surfaces by metal hydroxides precipitates reduces habitat viability 38 the acidity is also not suitable for aquatic life and usually results in streams devoid of life 39 affected soils are rendered useless to agricultural activities as both the high acidity and elevated metal concentrations affect the animal and plant life sulfate concentrations in amd are high although sulfate is considered non toxic and benign it causes dehydration and catharsis at concentrations above 1000 ppm if it is ingested high sulfate levels causes the release of phosphates leading to eutrophication 23 hydrogen sulfide the product of sulfate reduction is odorous and corrosive the corrosive nature of hydrogen sulfide threatens infrastructure 40 all these factors justify the proper management of amd before releasing it to the environment 1 3 management of amd the best technique to manage amd is to prevent its formation by minimizing contact between sulfide ore with oxygen water and or oxidising bacteria 23 26 41 42 prevention measures have not been consistently applied making treatment the only option available after amd formation many mining countries require amd to be treated to meet local standards before being discharged many technologies have been used for amd treatment these technologies maybe physico chemical or biological and are further classified as active or passive depending on both capital labour and operational costs 12 22 active treatment processes are usually highly successful in terms of the product they however require long term continuous commitment chemical treatment involves the precipitation of dissolved metal ions as metal hydroxides and attenuation of acidity is due to chemical neutralisation many chemicals are used including lime caustic soda soda ash ammonia and sodium hydroxide 26 43 25 each chemical is suited to particular site and effluent conditions the precipitation of metals as hydroxide produces a sludge that will require further disposal 43 iron exchange membrane filtration and reverse osmosis are also used to remove dissolved metals from amd all these methods are examples of active treatment and have high chemical energy skilled labour and maintenance needs 28 26 and these are unfavourable to implement in terms of cost chemicals such as sodium hydroxide require careful handling as they are hazardous while ammonia in excess may create problems like nitrification and eutrophication in receiving water bodies 26 passive treatment systems are self operating and need little or no human intervention after the operation is initiated 28 these technologies include constructed wetlands bioreactors and limestone drains in anaerobic wetlands and bioreactors the net acidity is removed through the formation of hydrogen sulfide produced from metabolic activity of iron and sulfate reducing bacteria 26 biological metal precipitation is also a result of the activities of srb which generate hydrogen sulfide which reacts with dissolved metals to form insoluble metal sulfide precipitates 44 45 20 25 46 47 srb require simple organic substrates for the reduction of sulfates to sulfides by a process called dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr organic matter is oxidised to bicarbonate ions hco3 the energy produced in the reaction is used for the growth and development of srb 26 17 30 48 2 so4 2 2ch2o h2s 2hco3 the h2s produced in equation 2 reacts with dissolved metal ions to form insoluble precipitates in the form of metal sulfides equation 3 while the carbonate help precipitates metals as carbonates the carbonate also helps in removing acidity from the amd equation 4 45 49 3 hs m2 ms s h 4 hco3 h co2 h2o ch2o in equation 2 represents short chain organic molecules 30 m2 in equation 2 represent dissolved divalent metal ions and ms is the metal sulfide precipitate these reactions together with the neutralising effect of carbonate are responsible for removing acidity and reducing the concentration of both dissolved metals and sulfates 20 30 48 21 metal sulfide precipitates are more stable than metal hydroxides and are easier to dewater because they tend to form colloidal particles 17 active biological treatment systems also use srb with the subsequent removal of sulfate precipitation of metals as both sulfides and carbonates and the neutralisation of acidity due to biogenic carbonate active treatment systems are usually continuous and involve one or more reactors 20 active biological treatment processes require less space and allows precise process controls modifications and are highly predictable 20 sulfate reducing bioreactors have been used with different levels of success though they are efficient in the treatment of amd the choice of the biodegradable organic material used and the environmental conditions determines the success of the process 46 48 many organic substrates have been used in the treatment of amd from agricultural wastes that are mainly cellulosic to industrial and domestic wastes 50 sulfate reducing bacteria cannot use cellulose directly and require cellulose degraders and fermenters to provide simple organic material such as glucose ethanol lactate and acetate 20 43 51 52 the rate limiting step in the treatment of amd using cellulose as the organic substrate is the cellulose degradation which is slow and this encourages the growth of competitors lignocellulosic material is therefore suitable for low flow passive treatment systems to speed up the rate of amd treatment in bioreactors the substrates should be provided in simple forms to encourage the growth of srb many simple organic substrates such as ethanol lactate and methanol have been used successfully in the treatment of amd hiibel et al 25 showed that ethanol based substrates result in enrichment of srb 70 relative to lignocellulose bioreactors 2 3 the lignocellulose reactor promoted the growth of cellulose degraders and there was a large population of fermentative bacteria in comparison to ethanol based reactors in active bioreactors where continuous operation is required liquid or gaseous substrates for biological sulfate reduction are usually preferred as solids should be regularly replenished 4 cited in 46 the use of simple organic substrates for biological sulfate reduction reduces the complexity of the microbial community and improves the rate of treatment as long as the cod sulfate ratio is favourable for sulfate reduction kaksonen et al 2004 cited in bratkova et al 17 showed that the stoichiometric cod so4 2 ratio of 0 67 was adequate to attain 60 sulfate removal with an initial concentration of 2000 mg l sulfate in a fluidised bed reactor inoculated with srb capable of oxidising ethanol completely to carbon dioxide the disadvantage of using simple substrates is that they tend to be used quickly hence the need to be continuously fed this increases the operational and maintenance costs 25 the costs of bioremediation of amd increases if commercial products such as ethanol lactate and glucose are used as feedstock for biological sulfate reduction it is therefore necessary to find inexpensive and locally available sources of substrates many industrial processes produce large volumes of waste streams rich in simple organics most of these waste streams are treated aerobically with no chance of any carbon recovery as the organic carbon is lost as carbon dioxide these organic wastes can be harnessed and used in anaerobic sulfate reducing bioreactors making it possible to co treat organic and inorganic wastewaters with the potential production of value added products such as sulfur and metals some industrial activities that produce wastes rich in simple organics are found near areas where large amounts of amd are produced using these organic rich waste materials lowers the cost of treatment as the need for transportation is reduced in this paper therefore we sought to identify industrial processes that produce organic wastes and are situated close to or on mining sites that produce large volumes of amd 1 4 organic pollutants as potential substrates for sulfate reduction anaerobic treatment of high organic content industrial wastewater has been focusing on the generation of methane and the possibility of energy generation 53 sulfate reduction can be an alternative technology in the treatment of organic waste organic wastes from industries such as gas to liquid gtl dairy brewing distilleries tanneries and sugar mills have enough cod to support biological sulfate reduction some of these wastes are generated on sites or close to sites that generate large volumes of amd for example most gtl plants are located on coalmines sulfate reducing bacteria are able to utilise a number of both organic and inorganic material for their energy needs srb can use contaminants such as petroleum hydrocarbon constituents like alcohols simple sugars short chain fatty acids alkenes benzene and toluene they are also able to directly use halogenated compounds as a source of carbon the ability of srb to utilize a wide range of organic substrates as well as hydrocarbons as their carbon and energy source has a potential use in the bioremediation of industrial agricultural and domestic waste rich in organic pollutants 35 this allows for the co treatment of organic rich waste streams and amd according to hussain et al 35 the approach leads to attenuation of three categories of pollutants which are metals sulfate and agro industrial hydrocarbon wastes 1 5 industrial processes producing organic rich effluent situated on or near mining sites industrial and domestic applications of water have the potential to release organic pollutants into the environment these involve the x to fuel sugar cane processing brewery and wine making cotton processing tanning oily waters biodiesel and pulp and paper industries as well as domestic wastewater these organic rich wastewater streams are potential substrates for sulfate reduction 1 6 fischer tropsch process the decrease in oil resources availability and the increase in energy demand especially in liquid fuels has generated interest in technologies for the production of synthetic liquid fuels 54 synthetic fuels can be generated through several pathways that can be the direct liquefaction of carbon in a solvent at high temperatures or indirectly through gasification into carbon monoxide and hydrogen feedstocks in these processes are coal natural gas or biomass because of its abundancy across the world and its relatively low cost price coal is the best prospect for the production of liquid fuels 55 1 7 the conversion of x to liquid fuel synthetic fuel processes are classified based on the feed that is employed 56 the gas to liquid gtl uses natural gas the coal to liquid ctl uses coal and the biomass to liquid btl uses biomass as the feedstock 57 all these processes produce precursors for synthetic crude oil and synthetic gas which is used to produce useful hydrocarbons and oxygenated products such as liquid transportation fuels including diesel fuel gasoline and chemicals such as alkenes using a process called the fischer tropsch ft process 58 59 franz fischer and hans tropsch developed the ft process in 1920 60 during the second world war 1936 germans commissioned an ft plant to augment its fuel supplies subsequent ft plant operations were initiated in texas 1940 was eventually shut down due to operational costs south africa sasol 1 in sasolsburg 1950 s and sasol 2 1980 3 1982 gtl plant in mossel bay 1993 currently there are many plants in various stages of development in the world table 2 60 in the ctl process oxygen is blended with coal and steam at high temperatures and pressure to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas sulfurous compounds are also produced and need to be removed to avoid catalyst poisoning and to produce zero sulfur fuels 61 carbon dioxide is one of the major by products of the ft process the carbon dioxide emitted may be captured and stored underground or utilized 61 62 the hydrogen and carbon monoxide gases are converted to liquid hydrocarbon fuel using a metal based catalyst in the ft process 63 the production of liquid fuels using ft process is classified into high temperature ft htft and low temperature ft ltft process 64 the ltft operates at temperatures between 220 250 c and maximizes the production of paraffins olefins and alcohols while the htft process operates at 300 350 c and produces mainly fractions with higher molecular weight thus maximising the gasoline fractions 60 56 65 1 8 the production of ftww during cooling in the ft process water is condensed with hydrocarbons and oxygenates to produce oil and aqueous products the short chain polar oxygenates dissolve in the aqueous product and are refined separately from the oil product 56 the vast amounts of water produced makes water one of the major products from the fischer tropsch process equation 5 the water contains 7 10 of syncrude in the htft and around 3 in the ltft process the aqueous product in the htft process has small amounts of methanol while methanol is a major compound in the ltft aqueous product 56 5 nco 2nh2 ch2 n nh2o some of the dissolved compounds are separated from the aqueous phase the remaining water still contain significant amounts of short chain fatty acids scfa and alcohols c1 c6 and other organic contaminants table 1 66 these cannot be separated economically from the water 67 this organic rich stream is called fischer tropsch wastewater ftww ftww has a very high chemical oxygen demand cod in the range of 18000 30000 mg l table 1 66 the cod needs to be removed before discharge or reuse of the waste stream 1 9 current treatment technologies 1 9 1 aerobic treatment of ftww most gtl plants in operation have been using the activated sludge method for the treatment of the organic rich ftww sasol has been using aerobic treatment to treat gtl and ctl effluents in oryx gtl qatar and synfuels secunda facilities 68 in most cases the ftww is treated in combination with two other waste streams from the ft process these are oily sewers originating from plant drainage and stripped gas liquor that comes from the gasification condensate 67 the treatment is aerobic and energy intensive increasing the cost of treatment the aerobic treatment treats the effluent by using aerobic microorganisms to convert the organic material into carbon dioxide and water leading to no carbon recovery 69 this process produces a large amount of sludge which requires further treatment before disposal 53 70 1 9 2 anaerobic treatment of ftww anaerobic technologies use microorganisms that can live without oxygen these organisms live in environments like sediment layers on floors of lakes dams and oceans 69 the anaerobic treatment occurs in closed vessels in the absence of oxygen and produces methane gas and biomass 70 biogas is used as an energy source for electricity production sasol has recently developed an anaerobic membrane bioreactor technology anmbr for the treatment of ftww this technology removes the organics from the wastewater while providing biogas as a by product for power generation 68 other anaerobic technologies tried at least on a laboratory scale and successfully evaluated include up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb fixed bed systems fluidized bed reactors and baffled reactors anaerobic digestion yields methane carbon dioxide and sludge as by products the methane can be recovered and used as a fuel or energy source another advantage of the anaerobic treatment technology is that it provides about 80 less waste sludge than the aerobic process 67 1 10 ftww as a substrate for sulfate reduction the organics from ftww are mainly due to short chain fatty acids and alcohols table 1 85 percent of the cod is made of alcohols mainly methanol and ethanol methanol and ethanol have been used separately or in combination with other organic molecules to treat sulfate rich wastewater streams the high percentage of ethanol and methanol makes ftww a suitable substrate for dsr though micronutrients need to be provided externally to provide for microbial growth magowo et al 71 used ftww as the electron donor for the dissimilatory sulfate reduction with the subsequent removal of sulfate from amd to levels within recommended standards for domestic use total removal of cod from ftww was observed and enough alkalinity was generated to improve the ph of the acidic effluent to above neutral the suitability of individual constituents of ftww such as methanol and ethanol to sustain sulfate reduction was assessed by greben et al 72 who obtained sulfate removal rates of 6 6 g so4 l d using ethanol methanol was shown not to be suitable as it favoured methanogenesis rather than sulfidogenesis these results were supported by the findings of eger et al 73 who showed that ethanol was more effective for sulfidogenesis than methanol other components of ftww that have been evaluated separately and successfully for biological sulfate reduction include formic acid propionic acid butanol propanol and acetic acid 74 some constituents of ftww that are potential substrates for biological sulfate reduction include alkanes alkenes alicyclic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons 35 75 anderson and lovley 76 used srb to remove benzene from contaminated ground water with the subsequent removal of 53 of sulfate from the water because of its richness in organic substrate that can be used for sulfate reduction ftww can be used to support a diverse group of sulfate reducers hence increasing the efficiency of sulfate reduction 1 11 location of gtl and oil plants in the world the ft process may best benefit those countries with large reserves of coal but still rely on imports for liquid fuels ctl plants are usually built at the mine mouth with adjacent reservoirs of at least 500 mt of coal depending on the plant capacity 60 according to world coal institute 2017 coal is mined in over 50 countries in the world and is present in over 70 the mining activities potentially generate large amounts of low ph metal and sulfate rich effluent if these wastes are disposed without treating them to meet the local standards for disposal the balance in the ecosystem will be adversely affected combining and co treating these two waste streams is a possibility simultaneously removing sulfates and dissolved metals from amd as well as the cod from the ftww 1 12 global location of ctl plants 1 12 1 south africa sasol south africa has been producing liquid fuels and chemicals from coal using the fischer tropsch ft based gas to liquid gtl technology since 1955 world coal institute 2017 this technology was expanded in the 1970s to counter trade sanctions on oil supplies to the apartheid regime 61 at present approximately 30 of liquid fuels such as gasoline and diesel comes from the gtl technology with daily production capacities exceeding 160 000 barrels this leads to the production of large volumes of wastewater 29 ml d ftww produced at secunda 77 78 according to world coal institute 2017 sasol has produced in excess of 1 5 billion barrels of synthetic fuel and chemical products since it started operating in 1955 and has a market in over 90 countries around the world and remains at present the largest ctl plant in the world 60 sasol has plants in secunda and sasolburg these are both regions were large volumes of amd are produced due to the legacy and ongoing coal mining activities 1 12 2 china the shenhua group in china have been operating a direct coal liquefaction plant in erdos inner mongolia china since 2008 world coal institute 2017 the plant has an operational capacity of 50 000 barrels per day other operating ctl projects in china includes the yitai ctl plant in ordos zhungeer which started operating in 2009 using ft technology the yitai plants has a capacity of 160 000 mt a of ft liquids the jincheng methanol to gasoline mtg plant which produces 300 000 t a methanol from the mtg process and has been operating since 2009 the shanxi lu an ctl plant started operating in 2014 producing 160 000 mt a of ft liquids many other projects are still in the planning stages in china while some are still to be commissioned all these projects are projected to produce large volume of waste effluent from both the mining and the ctl activities 1 12 3 usa the usa is one of the largest consumer of oil in the world and imports most of its needs it is thus necessary for the usa to apply ctl technology to alleviate its energy concern world coal org 2017 usa has vast coal reserves though the usa has not been applying this technology feasibility studies have been on going to harness this technology in several sites see table 2 the ctl technology is also being considered in india germany botswana mongolia new zealand philippines and indonesia 61 the operating and proposed plants are shown in table 2 all these plants are will be located on or close to coal mining operations as they require large amounts of coal for ctl processes there is the potential to produce large volumes of amd from sulfide rich coal mining operations the ctl process produces large volumes of ftww which is rich in organics both these waste streams are produced in proximity to each other making it possible to co treat the waste streams without the need for transportation 1 13 sugar cane processing waste sugar is one of the most important agro based products in the economies of many countries with 1 91 billion tonnes produced annually 79 sugarcane is a renewable natural agricultural resource it is a source of sugar biofuels bioelectricity fibre fertilizer as well as employment 80 81 sugar cane is a tropical plant and therefore mainly grown in tropical countries while countries with cooler climates produce beet sugar 80 the un food and agricultural organisation fao puts the number of sugar cane growing countries to exceed 100 brazil india china thailand and pakistan are the main producers 80 south africa is ranked in the top 15 out of approximately 120 sugar producing countries in the word sugarcane processing produces large amounts of both solid and liquid wastes the liquid waste from sugarcane is rich in cod composed mainly of carbohydrates the wastewater also contains nutrients oils grease chlorides sulfates nitrates heavy metals as well as both suspended and dissolved solids table 3 the solid waste such as bagasse contain substantial amounts of sugar of at least 2 5 of the dry weight other constituents include minerals carbohydrates and lignocellulosic material 82 83 it is estimated that india alone produces at least 40 million tonnes of bagasse per year 83 the liquid waste is generated mainly from the sugar cane mills and from ethanol production from molasses and the subsequent distillation processes according to bhatnagar et al 79 a tonne of sugar requires 20 30 tonnes of water to be processed much of this water is drained as wastewater making sugar cane processing a major contributor in the pollution of water streams 1 14 current treatment techniques of cane processing waste disposal of untreated effluent from sugar processing plants results in the pollution of water bodies and soils this may lead to the depletion of oxygen due to the oxidation of the organic material leading to the death of aquatic organisms the wastes also affect water by increasing the amounts of dissolved salts metals suspended and dissolved solids the colour of the wastewater reduces the quality and quantity of sunlight penetrating affected bodies thereby reducing the amount of oxygen produced by photosynthesis thus depriving oxygen to aquatic life 84 other effects of cane processing waste are shown in table 4 the treatment of cane processing water involves an initial screening to remove large suspended solids followed by settling to remove grease and oil which float to the top and small solids which go to the bottom of the settling tank the dissolved organics are removed by either aerobic or anaerobic digestion or a combination of the two anaerobic treatment can be used to generate methane for process energy adsorption on activated carbon is mainly used to remove colour and specific organic pollutants while strong oxidants such as ozone and chlorine are used to oxidise the organic components during the chemical treatment of sugar processing waste 84 rais and sheoran 85 gave a description of several treatment options used including both anaerobic and aerobic biological treatment adsorption coagulation and flocculation oxidation by ozone membrane treatment and electro dialysis tawari and sahu 86 used electrochemical and chemical processes with copper as an electrode for the treatment of sugar industry wastewater their results show an 81 and 83 5 removal of cod and colour respectively the cost of electrodes and chemicals might be prohibitive to allow for sugarcane waste treatment on a large scale vinasse is a by product generated from bioethanol production has a low ph high cod sulfate phosphate and colour 87 espana gamoa et al 2012 the cod in vinasse is made of small quantities of non fermented sugars and high concentrations of organic substances such as dextrins starch organic acids and amino acids 88 in brazil alone an estimated 20 billion litres of vinasse was produced in 2015 16 with one litre of ethanol producing 13 7 litres of vinasse 89 vinasse has been used mainly for fertirrigation using it as a liquid fertilizer while reducing the water input for plant growth of the sugar cane fields 90 91 in some countries or regions for example sao paulo in brazil the use of vinasse for fertirrigation is regulated depending on the potassium content of the soil other states forbid vinasse disposal in the liquid form near environmental protection areas while other regions recommend the use of diluted vinasse to promote soil irrigation 91 this is because the application of vinasse can lead to temporary or definitive degradation of soil and contaminants of ground water increased methane and nitrogen oxide emissions depending on the type of soil 89 92 94 the solid sugarcane waste such as bagasse is mainly used as boiler feed for process energy bagasse is also used in bioethanol production in the production of paper and as feedstock for livestock 95 sugarcane bagasse contains percentage by weight moisture 50 fibre composed of cellulose pentosans and lignin 47 7 and soluble solids mainly sugars 2 3 95 large amounts of bagasse are produced that exceed the requirements for power generation resulting in improper disposal such as burning 96 due to the high volumes of waste material produced it is necessary that adequate treatment and disposal should be exercised 1 15 sugarcane waste as potential feedstock for the treatment of acid mine drainage the sulfate load in the acid mine drainage can be removed by biological sulfate reduction using sulfate reducing bacteria with the subsequent precipitation and potential recovery of metals as metal sulfide precipitates the organic feed for sulfate reduction may be obtained from the cod from cane processing waste excess hydrogen sulfide and organics are then removed in a subsequent aerobic plant 97 hussain and qazi 50 obtained sulfate removal rates of 4 66 mg l day 1 using sugarcane bagasse as a substrate for biological sulfate reduction naidu et al 98 have set up a pilot treatment system in emalahleni south africa for the treatment of amd using sugarcane bagasse in combination with basic oxygen furnace bof steel slag after their lab scale plant produced good results maree and strydom 99 used molasses under continuous flow conditions to remove sulfate and metals from wastewater and obtained average sulfate removal efficiency of 89 in a 90 day period with residual heavy metal concentrations reduced to below detection limits they suggested that molasses sugars are fermented to products such as lactate or pyruvate these lactate and pyruvate are then used as the carbon source during the biological reduction of sulfate to sulfide the sulfide reacts with dissolved metals to form metal sulfide precipitates while the biogenic alkalinity neutralizes the acidity annachhater and suktrakoolvait 100 obtained satisfactory removal of both sulfate and cod using molasses as the sole organic source for biological sulfate reduction hussain et al 101 assessed the suitability of using molasses for biological sulfate reduction in a 20 day trial period and concluded that molasses can be used as a growth substrate by sulfate reducing bacteria grubb et al 95 obtained above 90 reductions in dissolved cu pb and zn with the subsequent enhancement of ph using bagasse as the feedstock for biological sulfate reduction the successful implementation of the co treatment of these two effluents depends on their proximity to each other the distance influences the complexity and cost of transportation to the processing plant these costs may be significantly reduced if the plants producing the waste streams are close to each other in this section we look at cane processing plants that are close to amd producing areas in the view of the potential co treatment of the two waste streams the mpumalanga and kwazulu natal regions in south africa are associated with most of the coal mining activities in the country these regions have the potential to produce vast amounts of amd the mpumalanga and kwazulu natal regions are also large producers and processers of sugar cane which brings the possibility of the combined treatment of sugarcane processing waste and amd using biological sulfate reduction in brazil many sugar and ethanol plants are located close to mining areas especially in such areas as santa catarina parana sao paulo rio grande da sol and other southernmost parts 102 103 an opportunity therefore is present to use sugar cane processing waste as a feedstock in the treatment of amd this technology can be extended to other countries where amd producing areas are close to areas producing organic rich industrial and agricultural waste an example is the san felippe tailing dam in quiruvilca peru that contaminates the rio moche river which passes through trujillo which is the centre of the peruvian sugar industry whose major by product sugarcane bagasse can be used as an energy and carbon source for biological treatment of amd 95 china thailand and pakistan are some of the major cane processing countries with the potential to produce large volumes of amd from mining activities it is therefore convenient for such countries to use biological sulfate reduction in the treatment of sulfate rich waste such as amd using electron donors from industrial and agricultural wastes 1 16 brewery and winery waste water wine and beer are the most popular beverages in the world with global annual production of 250 million and 1 34 billion hectolitres respectively 104 beer and wine production generate huge amounts of wastewater 105 masi et al 2015 estimate the amount of wastewater generated from every litre of wine produced to be around 1 6 2 0 litres the ratio of fresh water beer wastewater for each m3 of beer produced are 4 11 1 2 8 m3 106 beer is produced from the fermentation of sugar usually obtained from the hydrolysis of seed starch and other starch containing material such as potatoes enzymes from malted barley are used for the hydrolysis and the principal product is glucose the sugars are then fermented with or without yeast to produce ethanol wastewater from the brewing process has high concentration of cod from 2000 to 6000 mg l table 5 3 most of the organic substances mainly from dissolved carbohydrates and ethanol in the wastewater are biodegradable most of the suspended solids are from spent grain and yeast 104 106 brewery and winery wastewater is generated mainly from the cooling of cookers and fermentation units washing cleaning of tanks packaging equipment and floors 106 many breweries simply dump their wastewater into the environment without proper treatment in some cases the brewery effluent joins and is co treated with municipal waste through the traditional municipal wastewater treatment processes 3 106 this may exert pressure to the sewer treatment facilities as the high concentration of pollutants could create detrimental environmental and economic interests including corrosion and increased emissions of odorous and other gases 106 current treatment methods for brewery waste include anaerobic treatment followed by aerobic digestion 3 anaerobic digestion can be used to convert the organic material to methane which can be used for the provision of energy 3 the high cod in wine effluents is similar to that in the brewery effluent as both effluents are generated from similar processes the cod is composed mainly of sugars starch ethanol and volatile fatty acids with ethanol contributing 90 of the organic load 107 108 with acetic acid being the next significant contributor 108 treatment technologies for treating brewery and wine wastewater such as anaerobic digesters aerobic digesters sequencing batch reactors and rotating biological contactors have been applied 108 in spain italy france and germany constructed wetlands have been successfully used since the 1990 s 107 the alcohols and acids in brewery and winery as well as distillery wastewater can be used as electron donors in the biological treatment of acid mine drainage using sulfate reduction this can be done passively in sulfate reducing bioreactors or constructed wetlands where the two waste streams can be mixed at appropriate ratios to allow the complete removal of cod sulfate and dissolved metals as well as ph attenuation costa et al 109 used winery waste containing ethanol for the treatment of amd in a sulfidogenic bioreactor their results proved that winery waste could be used for the treatment of amd as they obtained 90 sulfate 61 91 iron and 97 zinc and copper removal efficiencies the feasibility of the co treatment process is however determined by the distance between the sites of production between the two effluents with shorter distance favoured as transport costs to treatment plants are reduced in south africa for example the nearest wine farm is in excess of 1000 km from the nearest source of amd 23 making treatment using wine waste not viable on the other hand breweries may be found close to potentially amd generating mining areas in some mining towns creating an opportunity for the co treatment of these two waste streams 1 17 domestic wastewater domestic wastewater is generated from communal activities it is composed of excreta human body waste water used for flushing personal washing laundry food preparation cleaning of kitchen and utensils 110 domestic wastewater has a high cod concentration from carbohydrates proteins and fats in many developing countries untreated domestic wastewater is discharged into the environment leading to pollution threatening human health and aquatic life 110 111 many countries in the developing world have experienced outbreaks of diseases from faecal contamination of drinking water because of poor management of domestic wastewater usually the cost of technology for treatment is given as the reason not to treat wastewater when treatment is available it is usually through waste stabilisation ponds and activated sludge plants 111 the need for aeration in activated sludge increase the costs of treatment large amounts of sludge as well as carbon dioxide greenhouse gas are produced biological sulfate reduction offers a low cost treatment solution to communities close to mining areas where amd is prevalent the amd and the domestic wastewater can be combined anaerobic conditions created for biological sulfate reduction to occur resulting in the removal of organics from the domestic wastewater and metals and sulfate from amd the hydrogen sulfide produced during dsr kills some of the disease causing microbes found in municipal wastewater van den berg et al 10 used synthetic medium simulating domestic wastewater for the passive treatment of amd using biological sulfate reduction and obtained 60 8 and 96 sulfate and cod removal respectively biological sulfate reduction using domestic waste as the carbon source has been successfully applied in the rhodes biosure process developed at environmental biotechnology rhodes university ebru the biosure process uses primary sludge from a waste water treatment plant as the sole carbon source for sulfate reduction 112 and is in operation at grootvlei mine in springs on the eastern rand in the gauteng province of south africa 113 the biosure process treats an amd stream with a sulfate load of 2000 mg l with above 67 sulfate and 72 cod removal 114 according to ochieng et al 28 the rhodes biosure process is the most cost effective biological treatment option developed for removing sulfates from amd without the addition of external chemicals the two waste streams ensure improved water quality before being discharged into the bleskbokspruit river the biosure process produces less sludge which is stable and safe to handle mining towns can take advantage of this technology that couples the treatment of amd to that of their domestic effluent to treat both waste streams 1 18 abattoirs effluent abattoirs are used for meat processing for human consumption abattoirs use large volumes of water for their processing operations producing large volumes of wastewater the wastewater contains large amounts of protein and fat 115 116 according to the guidelines for abattoir waste 116 a typical wastewater from a red meat processing abattoir has a ph range from 5 7 8 4 contains 2380 8942 mg l cod 189 3330 mg l suspended solids and 0 71 2 4 mg l total kjeldahl nitrogen wastewater from abattoirs is usually washed down the drain into the municipal system increasing the organic load of municipal water treatment because of the high organic strength of the abattoir effluent systems 116 low cost onsite treatment systems should be implemented to reduce the organic strength of abattoir effluent before discharging into the municipal system biological sulfate reduction offers a low cost treatment for the high organic strength waste stream in areas where amd is prevalent in order for the cod from abattoirs to be used for biological sulfate reduction hydrolytic microbes which breaks down proteins and fats into simple compounds such as organic acids and alcohols 115 need to be incorporated in the treatment process to provide simple substrates that are readily used by srb 1 19 other agricultural and cellulosic wastes solid agricultural waste is composed mainly of hemicellulose cellulose and lignin lignocellulosic material is the most abundant renewable resource in the world they are also cheap and renewable in nature 31 various lignocellulosic wastes are obtained from agricultural activities after harvesting and processing of crops these materials are usually considered low value and are disposed by burning or composting westernsee et al 2018 estimates that for every tonne of maize wheat sugar cane or sunflower seeds an estimated tonne of dry residue is also produced leading to the production of 12 2 mt year agricultural residue and 9 14 mt year lignocellulosic residue in south africa lignocellulosic waste and agricultural residues have been identified as a potential substrate for the treatment of amd using biological sulfate reduction 21 117 these waste materials can be used in their natural form or modified by chemical or physical processes yeneneh et al 118 used chemical modification to improve the effectiveness of rice husks and sugar cane bagasse in removing metals from amd magowo et al 117 showed that milling switch grass greatly improved efficiency in remediating amd the lignocellulose is hydrolysed by cellulolytic bacteria to produce sugars the sugars are fermented to organic acids and alcohols the organic acids and alcohols are then used by sulfate reducing bacteria for biological sulfate reduction with the subsequent precipitation of metals as sulfides 21 119 the cellulosic substrates need to be replenished periodically to ensure substrate availability lignocellulose contain numerous reactive groups such as phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups which are able to bind to metals and removing them from contaminated water 117 the abundance of these agricultural wastes in regions where amd is generated determines their suitability for application 120 discussed the potential of using cassava peel for the treatment of amd in mozambique they concluded that this was a viable option due to the abundancy of cassava in mozambique the treatment of amd using lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock for dsr has been coupled with the possibility of producing important biomolecules at least on a laboratory scale these products are formed from monomeric sugars released from lignocellulosic biomass following pre treatment with amd and subsequent enzyme hydrolysis steps 31 117 1 20 proposed technologies for the co treatment of amd and organic waste two main active biological technologies the thiopaq and the biosulfide processes have been applied in the treatment of amd and can be adapted for the co treatment of amd and organic waste the choice of the treatment technology is site specific and depends on various parameters including the quality of the amd topology flow rate and must also consider environmental regulatory and social factors 121 the thiopaq process has two distinct microbial populations and processes fig 1 in the anaerobic process srb consumes organic material while reducing sulfate to hydrogen sulfide the hydrogen sulfide reacts with dissolved metals forming insoluble metal sulfides in the subsequent aerobic process excess hydrogen sulfide is converted to elemental sulfur by sulfur oxidizing bacteria 122 the removal of sulfide as sulfur is preferred as it removes odours the corrosive potential of the effluent and above all prevents the complete oxidation of sulfide to sulfate 71 123 sulfur is a non corrosive solid which form precipitates that can easily be removed from the bioreactors 71 the thiopaq process has been successfully operated at budelco zinc mine in the netherlands and at pueblo gold mine in the dominican republic the biosulfide process fig 2 has been successfully operated at the kennecott uttah copper mine in the usa it is composed of a biological process were hydrogen sulfide is generated through sulfate reduction and a chemical circuit were dissolved metals reacts with the hydrogen sulfide to form metal sulfide precipitates 18 122 the application of these processes have an advantage due to the recovery of valuable material such as metals and sulfur however due to high construction and operational requirements they might not be suitable for remote sites 124 in cases where there are capital constraints we recommend the use of single bioreactor systems to lower the capital and operational costs the use of single reactor system might entail using acid and metal tolerant sulfidogens in the treatment of low ph and high metal concentration amd 125 in remote mining areas were the organic substrate need to be transported for long distance to the amd generating sites the use of simple passive biological systems were solid substrates are used as electron donors for sulfate reduction is more applicable the solid organic substrates including agricultural residue or plant material organic compost animal manure 126 127 are slowly used by srb and may be able to sustain biological sulfate reduction in the long term these substrates can be incorporated in passive systems such as permeable reactive barriers and anaerobic wetlands were the amd passes through the reactive bed alternatively the soluble organic material can be mixed with or injected into the source of the amd 128 the organic matter stimulate the activity of hydrolytic fermentative and sulfate reducing microorganisms and also act as support media for bacterial growth 22 123 127 the decomposition of the organic rich waste material potentially lower sulfide oxidation due to the consumption of large amounts of oxygen during decomposition thereby preventing further formation of amd 129 long term efficiencies can be enhanced through mixing of easily biodegradable substrates such as cow manure with long term degradable substrates such as lignocellulosic material 130 when the acidity in the amd is excessive the organic matter in the reactive bed can be supplemented by alkaline substrates such as limestone 22 in areas were the organic substrates are not available the mineral transporters may bring the organic waste on their return journeys instead of returning to the mines with empty trucks 2 conclusion many industrial agricultural and domestic processes produce organic rich wastes that can be used successfully in providing the electrons for biological sulfate reduction in the treatment of amd using srb most importantly the factor to consider is the distance between the two waste amd and organic waste as it affects the cost of treatment due to transport costs costs are also reduced in the treatment process as the need for aeration is reduced as the process is anaerobic the amount of sludge produced in using dsr for the treatment of amd is low and easier to handle hydrogen sulfide produced can be used to precipitate metals thereby reducing the odorous effect of hydrogen sulfide on the environment biological sulfate reduction offers the opportunity for selective metal recovery thereby adding value to the process biological sulfate reduction therefore offers a cheap opportunity for the co treatment of a variety of organic rich wastewaters and amd this stems from the ability of srb to use a wide range of organic substrates for their growth and energy requirements in this way organic and inorganic contaminants are removed from the wastewaters and ph is improved through biogenic alkalinity contributing towards the provision of clean water declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the university of the witwatersrand postgraduate merit

prospects to co treat a variety of organic and inorganic waste effluents because of the ability of sulfate reducing bacteria srb to reduce sulfate to sulfide and generating alkalinity while using organic substrates for their metabolism srb are found in sulfate rich waters such as acid mine drainage amd amd does not contain enough organic substrates to sustain srb metabolism and growth commercial grade organic electron donors such as ethanol lactate and methanol have been used successfully in the treatment of amd but are costly to sustain long term treatment of amd this calls for the exploration of cheap and locally available organic substrates as alternatives this study therefore explores utilization of locally available industrial agricultural and domestic wastewaters in providing organic substrates for sulfate reduction in the treatment of amd the study leverages the ability of srb to use organic substrates while reducing sulfate to hydrogen sulfide organic substrates can be removed from the organic rich effluent through sulfate reduction while the biologically generated hydrogen sulfide can be used to precipitate dissolved metals biogenic alkalinity attenuates ph and hence amd can be made free of sulfate metals and acidity keywords acid mine drainage dissimilatory sulfate reduction pollution 1 introduction industrial domestic agricultural and mining wastes can cause damage to the environment if improperly discharged the damage may be because of air pollution from greenhouse gases land pollution as solid waste is dumped in waste heaps or water pollution where both organic and inorganic rich effluents are released into the ground and surface water without adequate treatment water pollution reduces the availability of fresh water for industrial agricultural domestic and recreational purposes many parts of the world have experienced insufficient water supplies at some time 1 2 world population increases call for more industrialization mechanisation and urbanisation to support the needs of the growing population this means more water is needed to support these activities as a result clean water shortages are projected in the near future 1 in south africa it is projected that by 2030 the demand for water will exceed the supply 3 therefore fresh water resources should be managed by preventing the dumping of untreated waste into the environment biological treatment of sulfate and or sulfate and metal rich effluent has been explored with various levels of success using sulfate reducing bacteria to reduce sulfate to sulfide in the presents of an electron donor in the process generating alkalinity the sulfide reacts with dissolved metals to form insoluble metal precipitates the alkalinity improves the ph in low ph sulfate rich waters 4 8 one of the major challenges determining the success of biological treatment processes is the organic feedstock for sulfate reduction a range of organic materials may provide the organic substrates the availability and degradability of the organic feedstock determines the success of the treatment process the costs of some feedstock such as ethanol lactate and hydrogen makes the application of biological treatment expensive there is therefore need to use cheap and locally available feedstock several organic rich waste streams can be cheap alternatives in the biological treatment of amd using dissimilatory sulfate reduction 9 10 this paper looks at the availability of organic rich industrial agricultural municipal and domestic waste as potential substrates for sulfate reduction in relation to their proximity to amd generating areas globally waste streams produced by the coal to liquid ctl technology focussing on fischer tropsch wastewater ftww are specifically examined ftww has a high chemical oxygen demand contributed by mainly short chain fatty acids and alcohols 11 sulfate reducing bacteria readily use short chain fatty acids and alcohols for dissimilatory sulfate reduction ctl plants using coal as their feed are usually located on or near coal mining plants which have the potential to produce large volumes of amd ctl plants produces large volumes of organic rich ftww ftww and amd waste streams can be combined and co treated using sulfate reduction this technology can be applied with other organic rich effluents generated from industries such as sugar processing winery and brewery pulp and paper tanning biodiesel domestic and many more using these locally based organic rich waste streams reduces the cost of both supply as these are waste material which require treatment and no transport is needed as these are found on or near coal mining plants this makes the use of ftww and or other organic rich industrial waste found in proximity to mining sites more practical and economical treatment options a major concern in using biological sulfate reduction for the treatment of amd and other sulfate rich wastewaters is the production of hydrogen sulfide which is toxic odorous and corrosive and may cause damage to infrastructure 12 feris and kotze 2015 13 in the treatment of amd this concern is partially addressed as some of the hydrogen sulfide is removed through metal sulfide precipitation excess sulfide can be removed as sulfur through partial oxidation under controlled oxygen concentrations in an aerobic sulfur oxidising reactor 14 in the absence of metals sulfide accumulates resulting in severe inhibition of the treatment process and in some cases leading to process failure 15 mechanisms are needed to reduce the concentration of sulfide in the reactors which may be in the form of diluting the sulfate rich wastewater another value addition in the biological treatment of amd is the possibility of selectively recovering metals under controlled conditions 1 1 acid mine drainage acid mine drainage is prevalent in mostly mining areas because of both active and closed mining activities 12 16 17 mining activities expose sulfide containing rocks to oxygen and water 18 21 other activities such as excavations for infrastructure construction also have the effect of exposing sulfide containing rocks to the elements the exposed sulfide is oxidised to sulfate in chemical reactions which are greatly enhanced by the activities of bacteria 22 10 23 25 iron sulfide pyrite is the major contributor of amd in the presence of oxygen and water pyrite is oxidised to sulfate metals are mobilised and acidity is formed 26 21 27 pyrite oxidation is a multistep process involving an oxygen independent reaction and an oxygen dependant reaction 27 the overall stoichiometric equation for the formation of amd is as shown in equation 1 1 fes2 3 75o2 3 5h2o fe oh 3 2so4 2 4h energy in nature the reactions involved in the formation of amd occur slowly and water has the ability to buffer both the acidity and soluble metal ions mining activities amplify these reactions by exposing large surface area of sulfidic rocks resulting in the production of large volumes of amd overwhelming the natural buffering capacity of natural water streams 16 28 29 the reactions produce acidity which contributes in solubilising and hence mobilising metal ions like iron zinc radium lead uranium and many more 26 16 all these oxidation products result in an effluent with high concentration of dissolved heavy metals sulfate and a very low ph 12 17 30 31 resulting in adverse impact on the environment 1 2 impacts of amd on the ecosystem amd introduces non biodegradable heavy metals elevated concentrations of sulfate as well as high acidity to ground water and receiving surface water 32 24 33 34 the metals tend to bio accumulate affecting the health of animals and potentially humans 12 35 36 metals such as fe3 precipitates as fe oh 3 in water bodies producing a yellow orange coloration of the water which affects the ecosystems food chains and webs as light is blocked for photosynthetic aquatic organisms 13 37 the coating of the stream surfaces by metal hydroxides precipitates reduces habitat viability 38 the acidity is also not suitable for aquatic life and usually results in streams devoid of life 39 affected soils are rendered useless to agricultural activities as both the high acidity and elevated metal concentrations affect the animal and plant life sulfate concentrations in amd are high although sulfate is considered non toxic and benign it causes dehydration and catharsis at concentrations above 1000 ppm if it is ingested high sulfate levels causes the release of phosphates leading to eutrophication 23 hydrogen sulfide the product of sulfate reduction is odorous and corrosive the corrosive nature of hydrogen sulfide threatens infrastructure 40 all these factors justify the proper management of amd before releasing it to the environment 1 3 management of amd the best technique to manage amd is to prevent its formation by minimizing contact between sulfide ore with oxygen water and or oxidising bacteria 23 26 41 42 prevention measures have not been consistently applied making treatment the only option available after amd formation many mining countries require amd to be treated to meet local standards before being discharged many technologies have been used for amd treatment these technologies maybe physico chemical or biological and are further classified as active or passive depending on both capital labour and operational costs 12 22 active treatment processes are usually highly successful in terms of the product they however require long term continuous commitment chemical treatment involves the precipitation of dissolved metal ions as metal hydroxides and attenuation of acidity is due to chemical neutralisation many chemicals are used including lime caustic soda soda ash ammonia and sodium hydroxide 26 43 25 each chemical is suited to particular site and effluent conditions the precipitation of metals as hydroxide produces a sludge that will require further disposal 43 iron exchange membrane filtration and reverse osmosis are also used to remove dissolved metals from amd all these methods are examples of active treatment and have high chemical energy skilled labour and maintenance needs 28 26 and these are unfavourable to implement in terms of cost chemicals such as sodium hydroxide require careful handling as they are hazardous while ammonia in excess may create problems like nitrification and eutrophication in receiving water bodies 26 passive treatment systems are self operating and need little or no human intervention after the operation is initiated 28 these technologies include constructed wetlands bioreactors and limestone drains in anaerobic wetlands and bioreactors the net acidity is removed through the formation of hydrogen sulfide produced from metabolic activity of iron and sulfate reducing bacteria 26 biological metal precipitation is also a result of the activities of srb which generate hydrogen sulfide which reacts with dissolved metals to form insoluble metal sulfide precipitates 44 45 20 25 46 47 srb require simple organic substrates for the reduction of sulfates to sulfides by a process called dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr organic matter is oxidised to bicarbonate ions hco3 the energy produced in the reaction is used for the growth and development of srb 26 17 30 48 2 so4 2 2ch2o h2s 2hco3 the h2s produced in equation 2 reacts with dissolved metal ions to form insoluble precipitates in the form of metal sulfides equation 3 while the carbonate help precipitates metals as carbonates the carbonate also helps in removing acidity from the amd equation 4 45 49 3 hs m2 ms s h 4 hco3 h co2 h2o ch2o in equation 2 represents short chain organic molecules 30 m2 in equation 2 represent dissolved divalent metal ions and ms is the metal sulfide precipitate these reactions together with the neutralising effect of carbonate are responsible for removing acidity and reducing the concentration of both dissolved metals and sulfates 20 30 48 21 metal sulfide precipitates are more stable than metal hydroxides and are easier to dewater because they tend to form colloidal particles 17 active biological treatment systems also use srb with the subsequent removal of sulfate precipitation of metals as both sulfides and carbonates and the neutralisation of acidity due to biogenic carbonate active treatment systems are usually continuous and involve one or more reactors 20 active biological treatment processes require less space and allows precise process controls modifications and are highly predictable 20 sulfate reducing bioreactors have been used with different levels of success though they are efficient in the treatment of amd the choice of the biodegradable organic material used and the environmental conditions determines the success of the process 46 48 many organic substrates have been used in the treatment of amd from agricultural wastes that are mainly cellulosic to industrial and domestic wastes 50 sulfate reducing bacteria cannot use cellulose directly and require cellulose degraders and fermenters to provide simple organic material such as glucose ethanol lactate and acetate 20 43 51 52 the rate limiting step in the treatment of amd using cellulose as the organic substrate is the cellulose degradation which is slow and this encourages the growth of competitors lignocellulosic material is therefore suitable for low flow passive treatment systems to speed up the rate of amd treatment in bioreactors the substrates should be provided in simple forms to encourage the growth of srb many simple organic substrates such as ethanol lactate and methanol have been used successfully in the treatment of amd hiibel et al 25 showed that ethanol based substrates result in enrichment of srb 70 relative to lignocellulose bioreactors 2 3 the lignocellulose reactor promoted the growth of cellulose degraders and there was a large population of fermentative bacteria in comparison to ethanol based reactors in active bioreactors where continuous operation is required liquid or gaseous substrates for biological sulfate reduction are usually preferred as solids should be regularly replenished 4 cited in 46 the use of simple organic substrates for biological sulfate reduction reduces the complexity of the microbial community and improves the rate of treatment as long as the cod sulfate ratio is favourable for sulfate reduction kaksonen et al 2004 cited in bratkova et al 17 showed that the stoichiometric cod so4 2 ratio of 0 67 was adequate to attain 60 sulfate removal with an initial concentration of 2000 mg l sulfate in a fluidised bed reactor inoculated with srb capable of oxidising ethanol completely to carbon dioxide the disadvantage of using simple substrates is that they tend to be used quickly hence the need to be continuously fed this increases the operational and maintenance costs 25 the costs of bioremediation of amd increases if commercial products such as ethanol lactate and glucose are used as feedstock for biological sulfate reduction it is therefore necessary to find inexpensive and locally available sources of substrates many industrial processes produce large volumes of waste streams rich in simple organics most of these waste streams are treated aerobically with no chance of any carbon recovery as the organic carbon is lost as carbon dioxide these organic wastes can be harnessed and used in anaerobic sulfate reducing bioreactors making it possible to co treat organic and inorganic wastewaters with the potential production of value added products such as sulfur and metals some industrial activities that produce wastes rich in simple organics are found near areas where large amounts of amd are produced using these organic rich waste materials lowers the cost of treatment as the need for transportation is reduced in this paper therefore we sought to identify industrial processes that produce organic wastes and are situated close to or on mining sites that produce large volumes of amd 1 4 organic pollutants as potential substrates for sulfate reduction anaerobic treatment of high organic content industrial wastewater has been focusing on the generation of methane and the possibility of energy generation 53 sulfate reduction can be an alternative technology in the treatment of organic waste organic wastes from industries such as gas to liquid gtl dairy brewing distilleries tanneries and sugar mills have enough cod to support biological sulfate reduction some of these wastes are generated on sites or close to sites that generate large volumes of amd for example most gtl plants are located on coalmines sulfate reducing bacteria are able to utilise a number of both organic and inorganic material for their energy needs srb can use contaminants such as petroleum hydrocarbon constituents like alcohols simple sugars short chain fatty acids alkenes benzene and toluene they are also able to directly use halogenated compounds as a source of carbon the ability of srb to utilize a wide range of organic substrates as well as hydrocarbons as their carbon and energy source has a potential use in the bioremediation of industrial agricultural and domestic waste rich in organic pollutants 35 this allows for the co treatment of organic rich waste streams and amd according to hussain et al 35 the approach leads to attenuation of three categories of pollutants which are metals sulfate and agro industrial hydrocarbon wastes 1 5 industrial processes producing organic rich effluent situated on or near mining sites industrial and domestic applications of water have the potential to release organic pollutants into the environment these involve the x to fuel sugar cane processing brewery and wine making cotton processing tanning oily waters biodiesel and pulp and paper industries as well as domestic wastewater these organic rich wastewater streams are potential substrates for sulfate reduction 1 6 fischer tropsch process the decrease in oil resources availability and the increase in energy demand especially in liquid fuels has generated interest in technologies for the production of synthetic liquid fuels 54 synthetic fuels can be generated through several pathways that can be the direct liquefaction of carbon in a solvent at high temperatures or indirectly through gasification into carbon monoxide and hydrogen feedstocks in these processes are coal natural gas or biomass because of its abundancy across the world and its relatively low cost price coal is the best prospect for the production of liquid fuels 55 1 7 the conversion of x to liquid fuel synthetic fuel processes are classified based on the feed that is employed 56 the gas to liquid gtl uses natural gas the coal to liquid ctl uses coal and the biomass to liquid btl uses biomass as the feedstock 57 all these processes produce precursors for synthetic crude oil and synthetic gas which is used to produce useful hydrocarbons and oxygenated products such as liquid transportation fuels including diesel fuel gasoline and chemicals such as alkenes using a process called the fischer tropsch ft process 58 59 franz fischer and hans tropsch developed the ft process in 1920 60 during the second world war 1936 germans commissioned an ft plant to augment its fuel supplies subsequent ft plant operations were initiated in texas 1940 was eventually shut down due to operational costs south africa sasol 1 in sasolsburg 1950 s and sasol 2 1980 3 1982 gtl plant in mossel bay 1993 currently there are many plants in various stages of development in the world table 2 60 in the ctl process oxygen is blended with coal and steam at high temperatures and pressure to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas sulfurous compounds are also produced and need to be removed to avoid catalyst poisoning and to produce zero sulfur fuels 61 carbon dioxide is one of the major by products of the ft process the carbon dioxide emitted may be captured and stored underground or utilized 61 62 the hydrogen and carbon monoxide gases are converted to liquid hydrocarbon fuel using a metal based catalyst in the ft process 63 the production of liquid fuels using ft process is classified into high temperature ft htft and low temperature ft ltft process 64 the ltft operates at temperatures between 220 250 c and maximizes the production of paraffins olefins and alcohols while the htft process operates at 300 350 c and produces mainly fractions with higher molecular weight thus maximising the gasoline fractions 60 56 65 1 8 the production of ftww during cooling in the ft process water is condensed with hydrocarbons and oxygenates to produce oil and aqueous products the short chain polar oxygenates dissolve in the aqueous product and are refined separately from the oil product 56 the vast amounts of water produced makes water one of the major products from the fischer tropsch process equation 5 the water contains 7 10 of syncrude in the htft and around 3 in the ltft process the aqueous product in the htft process has small amounts of methanol while methanol is a major compound in the ltft aqueous product 56 5 nco 2nh2 ch2 n nh2o some of the dissolved compounds are separated from the aqueous phase the remaining water still contain significant amounts of short chain fatty acids scfa and alcohols c1 c6 and other organic contaminants table 1 66 these cannot be separated economically from the water 67 this organic rich stream is called fischer tropsch wastewater ftww ftww has a very high chemical oxygen demand cod in the range of 18000 30000 mg l table 1 66 the cod needs to be removed before discharge or reuse of the waste stream 1 9 current treatment technologies 1 9 1 aerobic treatment of ftww most gtl plants in operation have been using the activated sludge method for the treatment of the organic rich ftww sasol has been using aerobic treatment to treat gtl and ctl effluents in oryx gtl qatar and synfuels secunda facilities 68 in most cases the ftww is treated in combination with two other waste streams from the ft process these are oily sewers originating from plant drainage and stripped gas liquor that comes from the gasification condensate 67 the treatment is aerobic and energy intensive increasing the cost of treatment the aerobic treatment treats the effluent by using aerobic microorganisms to convert the organic material into carbon dioxide and water leading to no carbon recovery 69 this process produces a large amount of sludge which requires further treatment before disposal 53 70 1 9 2 anaerobic treatment of ftww anaerobic technologies use microorganisms that can live without oxygen these organisms live in environments like sediment layers on floors of lakes dams and oceans 69 the anaerobic treatment occurs in closed vessels in the absence of oxygen and produces methane gas and biomass 70 biogas is used as an energy source for electricity production sasol has recently developed an anaerobic membrane bioreactor technology anmbr for the treatment of ftww this technology removes the organics from the wastewater while providing biogas as a by product for power generation 68 other anaerobic technologies tried at least on a laboratory scale and successfully evaluated include up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb fixed bed systems fluidized bed reactors and baffled reactors anaerobic digestion yields methane carbon dioxide and sludge as by products the methane can be recovered and used as a fuel or energy source another advantage of the anaerobic treatment technology is that it provides about 80 less waste sludge than the aerobic process 67 1 10 ftww as a substrate for sulfate reduction the organics from ftww are mainly due to short chain fatty acids and alcohols table 1 85 percent of the cod is made of alcohols mainly methanol and ethanol methanol and ethanol have been used separately or in combination with other organic molecules to treat sulfate rich wastewater streams the high percentage of ethanol and methanol makes ftww a suitable substrate for dsr though micronutrients need to be provided externally to provide for microbial growth magowo et al 71 used ftww as the electron donor for the dissimilatory sulfate reduction with the subsequent removal of sulfate from amd to levels within recommended standards for domestic use total removal of cod from ftww was observed and enough alkalinity was generated to improve the ph of the acidic effluent to above neutral the suitability of individual constituents of ftww such as methanol and ethanol to sustain sulfate reduction was assessed by greben et al 72 who obtained sulfate removal rates of 6 6 g so4 l d using ethanol methanol was shown not to be suitable as it favoured methanogenesis rather than sulfidogenesis these results were supported by the findings of eger et al 73 who showed that ethanol was more effective for sulfidogenesis than methanol other components of ftww that have been evaluated separately and successfully for biological sulfate reduction include formic acid propionic acid butanol propanol and acetic acid 74 some constituents of ftww that are potential substrates for biological sulfate reduction include alkanes alkenes alicyclic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons 35 75 anderson and lovley 76 used srb to remove benzene from contaminated ground water with the subsequent removal of 53 of sulfate from the water because of its richness in organic substrate that can be used for sulfate reduction ftww can be used to support a diverse group of sulfate reducers hence increasing the efficiency of sulfate reduction 1 11 location of gtl and oil plants in the world the ft process may best benefit those countries with large reserves of coal but still rely on imports for liquid fuels ctl plants are usually built at the mine mouth with adjacent reservoirs of at least 500 mt of coal depending on the plant capacity 60 according to world coal institute 2017 coal is mined in over 50 countries in the world and is present in over 70 the mining activities potentially generate large amounts of low ph metal and sulfate rich effluent if these wastes are disposed without treating them to meet the local standards for disposal the balance in the ecosystem will be adversely affected combining and co treating these two waste streams is a possibility simultaneously removing sulfates and dissolved metals from amd as well as the cod from the ftww 1 12 global location of ctl plants 1 12 1 south africa sasol south africa has been producing liquid fuels and chemicals from coal using the fischer tropsch ft based gas to liquid gtl technology since 1955 world coal institute 2017 this technology was expanded in the 1970s to counter trade sanctions on oil supplies to the apartheid regime 61 at present approximately 30 of liquid fuels such as gasoline and diesel comes from the gtl technology with daily production capacities exceeding 160 000 barrels this leads to the production of large volumes of wastewater 29 ml d ftww produced at secunda 77 78 according to world coal institute 2017 sasol has produced in excess of 1 5 billion barrels of synthetic fuel and chemical products since it started operating in 1955 and has a market in over 90 countries around the world and remains at present the largest ctl plant in the world 60 sasol has plants in secunda and sasolburg these are both regions were large volumes of amd are produced due to the legacy and ongoing coal mining activities 1 12 2 china the shenhua group in china have been operating a direct coal liquefaction plant in erdos inner mongolia china since 2008 world coal institute 2017 the plant has an operational capacity of 50 000 barrels per day other operating ctl projects in china includes the yitai ctl plant in ordos zhungeer which started operating in 2009 using ft technology the yitai plants has a capacity of 160 000 mt a of ft liquids the jincheng methanol to gasoline mtg plant which produces 300 000 t a methanol from the mtg process and has been operating since 2009 the shanxi lu an ctl plant started operating in 2014 producing 160 000 mt a of ft liquids many other projects are still in the planning stages in china while some are still to be commissioned all these projects are projected to produce large volume of waste effluent from both the mining and the ctl activities 1 12 3 usa the usa is one of the largest consumer of oil in the world and imports most of its needs it is thus necessary for the usa to apply ctl technology to alleviate its energy concern world coal org 2017 usa has vast coal reserves though the usa has not been applying this technology feasibility studies have been on going to harness this technology in several sites see table 2 the ctl technology is also being considered in india germany botswana mongolia new zealand philippines and indonesia 61 the operating and proposed plants are shown in table 2 all these plants are will be located on or close to coal mining operations as they require large amounts of coal for ctl processes there is the potential to produce large volumes of amd from sulfide rich coal mining operations the ctl process produces large volumes of ftww which is rich in organics both these waste streams are produced in proximity to each other making it possible to co treat the waste streams without the need for transportation 1 13 sugar cane processing waste sugar is one of the most important agro based products in the economies of many countries with 1 91 billion tonnes produced annually 79 sugarcane is a renewable natural agricultural resource it is a source of sugar biofuels bioelectricity fibre fertilizer as well as employment 80 81 sugar cane is a tropical plant and therefore mainly grown in tropical countries while countries with cooler climates produce beet sugar 80 the un food and agricultural organisation fao puts the number of sugar cane growing countries to exceed 100 brazil india china thailand and pakistan are the main producers 80 south africa is ranked in the top 15 out of approximately 120 sugar producing countries in the word sugarcane processing produces large amounts of both solid and liquid wastes the liquid waste from sugarcane is rich in cod composed mainly of carbohydrates the wastewater also contains nutrients oils grease chlorides sulfates nitrates heavy metals as well as both suspended and dissolved solids table 3 the solid waste such as bagasse contain substantial amounts of sugar of at least 2 5 of the dry weight other constituents include minerals carbohydrates and lignocellulosic material 82 83 it is estimated that india alone produces at least 40 million tonnes of bagasse per year 83 the liquid waste is generated mainly from the sugar cane mills and from ethanol production from molasses and the subsequent distillation processes according to bhatnagar et al 79 a tonne of sugar requires 20 30 tonnes of water to be processed much of this water is drained as wastewater making sugar cane processing a major contributor in the pollution of water streams 1 14 current treatment techniques of cane processing waste disposal of untreated effluent from sugar processing plants results in the pollution of water bodies and soils this may lead to the depletion of oxygen due to the oxidation of the organic material leading to the death of aquatic organisms the wastes also affect water by increasing the amounts of dissolved salts metals suspended and dissolved solids the colour of the wastewater reduces the quality and quantity of sunlight penetrating affected bodies thereby reducing the amount of oxygen produced by photosynthesis thus depriving oxygen to aquatic life 84 other effects of cane processing waste are shown in table 4 the treatment of cane processing water involves an initial screening to remove large suspended solids followed by settling to remove grease and oil which float to the top and small solids which go to the bottom of the settling tank the dissolved organics are removed by either aerobic or anaerobic digestion or a combination of the two anaerobic treatment can be used to generate methane for process energy adsorption on activated carbon is mainly used to remove colour and specific organic pollutants while strong oxidants such as ozone and chlorine are used to oxidise the organic components during the chemical treatment of sugar processing waste 84 rais and sheoran 85 gave a description of several treatment options used including both anaerobic and aerobic biological treatment adsorption coagulation and flocculation oxidation by ozone membrane treatment and electro dialysis tawari and sahu 86 used electrochemical and chemical processes with copper as an electrode for the treatment of sugar industry wastewater their results show an 81 and 83 5 removal of cod and colour respectively the cost of electrodes and chemicals might be prohibitive to allow for sugarcane waste treatment on a large scale vinasse is a by product generated from bioethanol production has a low ph high cod sulfate phosphate and colour 87 espana gamoa et al 2012 the cod in vinasse is made of small quantities of non fermented sugars and high concentrations of organic substances such as dextrins starch organic acids and amino acids 88 in brazil alone an estimated 20 billion litres of vinasse was produced in 2015 16 with one litre of ethanol producing 13 7 litres of vinasse 89 vinasse has been used mainly for fertirrigation using it as a liquid fertilizer while reducing the water input for plant growth of the sugar cane fields 90 91 in some countries or regions for example sao paulo in brazil the use of vinasse for fertirrigation is regulated depending on the potassium content of the soil other states forbid vinasse disposal in the liquid form near environmental protection areas while other regions recommend the use of diluted vinasse to promote soil irrigation 91 this is because the application of vinasse can lead to temporary or definitive degradation of soil and contaminants of ground water increased methane and nitrogen oxide emissions depending on the type of soil 89 92 94 the solid sugarcane waste such as bagasse is mainly used as boiler feed for process energy bagasse is also used in bioethanol production in the production of paper and as feedstock for livestock 95 sugarcane bagasse contains percentage by weight moisture 50 fibre composed of cellulose pentosans and lignin 47 7 and soluble solids mainly sugars 2 3 95 large amounts of bagasse are produced that exceed the requirements for power generation resulting in improper disposal such as burning 96 due to the high volumes of waste material produced it is necessary that adequate treatment and disposal should be exercised 1 15 sugarcane waste as potential feedstock for the treatment of acid mine drainage the sulfate load in the acid mine drainage can be removed by biological sulfate reduction using sulfate reducing bacteria with the subsequent precipitation and potential recovery of metals as metal sulfide precipitates the organic feed for sulfate reduction may be obtained from the cod from cane processing waste excess hydrogen sulfide and organics are then removed in a subsequent aerobic plant 97 hussain and qazi 50 obtained sulfate removal rates of 4 66 mg l day 1 using sugarcane bagasse as a substrate for biological sulfate reduction naidu et al 98 have set up a pilot treatment system in emalahleni south africa for the treatment of amd using sugarcane bagasse in combination with basic oxygen furnace bof steel slag after their lab scale plant produced good results maree and strydom 99 used molasses under continuous flow conditions to remove sulfate and metals from wastewater and obtained average sulfate removal efficiency of 89 in a 90 day period with residual heavy metal concentrations reduced to below detection limits they suggested that molasses sugars are fermented to products such as lactate or pyruvate these lactate and pyruvate are then used as the carbon source during the biological reduction of sulfate to sulfide the sulfide reacts with dissolved metals to form metal sulfide precipitates while the biogenic alkalinity neutralizes the acidity annachhater and suktrakoolvait 100 obtained satisfactory removal of both sulfate and cod using molasses as the sole organic source for biological sulfate reduction hussain et al 101 assessed the suitability of using molasses for biological sulfate reduction in a 20 day trial period and concluded that molasses can be used as a growth substrate by sulfate reducing bacteria grubb et al 95 obtained above 90 reductions in dissolved cu pb and zn with the subsequent enhancement of ph using bagasse as the feedstock for biological sulfate reduction the successful implementation of the co treatment of these two effluents depends on their proximity to each other the distance influences the complexity and cost of transportation to the processing plant these costs may be significantly reduced if the plants producing the waste streams are close to each other in this section we look at cane processing plants that are close to amd producing areas in the view of the potential co treatment of the two waste streams the mpumalanga and kwazulu natal regions in south africa are associated with most of the coal mining activities in the country these regions have the potential to produce vast amounts of amd the mpumalanga and kwazulu natal regions are also large producers and processers of sugar cane which brings the possibility of the combined treatment of sugarcane processing waste and amd using biological sulfate reduction in brazil many sugar and ethanol plants are located close to mining areas especially in such areas as santa catarina parana sao paulo rio grande da sol and other southernmost parts 102 103 an opportunity therefore is present to use sugar cane processing waste as a feedstock in the treatment of amd this technology can be extended to other countries where amd producing areas are close to areas producing organic rich industrial and agricultural waste an example is the san felippe tailing dam in quiruvilca peru that contaminates the rio moche river which passes through trujillo which is the centre of the peruvian sugar industry whose major by product sugarcane bagasse can be used as an energy and carbon source for biological treatment of amd 95 china thailand and pakistan are some of the major cane processing countries with the potential to produce large volumes of amd from mining activities it is therefore convenient for such countries to use biological sulfate reduction in the treatment of sulfate rich waste such as amd using electron donors from industrial and agricultural wastes 1 16 brewery and winery waste water wine and beer are the most popular beverages in the world with global annual production of 250 million and 1 34 billion hectolitres respectively 104 beer and wine production generate huge amounts of wastewater 105 masi et al 2015 estimate the amount of wastewater generated from every litre of wine produced to be around 1 6 2 0 litres the ratio of fresh water beer wastewater for each m3 of beer produced are 4 11 1 2 8 m3 106 beer is produced from the fermentation of sugar usually obtained from the hydrolysis of seed starch and other starch containing material such as potatoes enzymes from malted barley are used for the hydrolysis and the principal product is glucose the sugars are then fermented with or without yeast to produce ethanol wastewater from the brewing process has high concentration of cod from 2000 to 6000 mg l table 5 3 most of the organic substances mainly from dissolved carbohydrates and ethanol in the wastewater are biodegradable most of the suspended solids are from spent grain and yeast 104 106 brewery and winery wastewater is generated mainly from the cooling of cookers and fermentation units washing cleaning of tanks packaging equipment and floors 106 many breweries simply dump their wastewater into the environment without proper treatment in some cases the brewery effluent joins and is co treated with municipal waste through the traditional municipal wastewater treatment processes 3 106 this may exert pressure to the sewer treatment facilities as the high concentration of pollutants could create detrimental environmental and economic interests including corrosion and increased emissions of odorous and other gases 106 current treatment methods for brewery waste include anaerobic treatment followed by aerobic digestion 3 anaerobic digestion can be used to convert the organic material to methane which can be used for the provision of energy 3 the high cod in wine effluents is similar to that in the brewery effluent as both effluents are generated from similar processes the cod is composed mainly of sugars starch ethanol and volatile fatty acids with ethanol contributing 90 of the organic load 107 108 with acetic acid being the next significant contributor 108 treatment technologies for treating brewery and wine wastewater such as anaerobic digesters aerobic digesters sequencing batch reactors and rotating biological contactors have been applied 108 in spain italy france and germany constructed wetlands have been successfully used since the 1990 s 107 the alcohols and acids in brewery and winery as well as distillery wastewater can be used as electron donors in the biological treatment of acid mine drainage using sulfate reduction this can be done passively in sulfate reducing bioreactors or constructed wetlands where the two waste streams can be mixed at appropriate ratios to allow the complete removal of cod sulfate and dissolved metals as well as ph attenuation costa et al 109 used winery waste containing ethanol for the treatment of amd in a sulfidogenic bioreactor their results proved that winery waste could be used for the treatment of amd as they obtained 90 sulfate 61 91 iron and 97 zinc and copper removal efficiencies the feasibility of the co treatment process is however determined by the distance between the sites of production between the two effluents with shorter distance favoured as transport costs to treatment plants are reduced in south africa for example the nearest wine farm is in excess of 1000 km from the nearest source of amd 23 making treatment using wine waste not viable on the other hand breweries may be found close to potentially amd generating mining areas in some mining towns creating an opportunity for the co treatment of these two waste streams 1 17 domestic wastewater domestic wastewater is generated from communal activities it is composed of excreta human body waste water used for flushing personal washing laundry food preparation cleaning of kitchen and utensils 110 domestic wastewater has a high cod concentration from carbohydrates proteins and fats in many developing countries untreated domestic wastewater is discharged into the environment leading to pollution threatening human health and aquatic life 110 111 many countries in the developing world have experienced outbreaks of diseases from faecal contamination of drinking water because of poor management of domestic wastewater usually the cost of technology for treatment is given as the reason not to treat wastewater when treatment is available it is usually through waste stabilisation ponds and activated sludge plants 111 the need for aeration in activated sludge increase the costs of treatment large amounts of sludge as well as carbon dioxide greenhouse gas are produced biological sulfate reduction offers a low cost treatment solution to communities close to mining areas where amd is prevalent the amd and the domestic wastewater can be combined anaerobic conditions created for biological sulfate reduction to occur resulting in the removal of organics from the domestic wastewater and metals and sulfate from amd the hydrogen sulfide produced during dsr kills some of the disease causing microbes found in municipal wastewater van den berg et al 10 used synthetic medium simulating domestic wastewater for the passive treatment of amd using biological sulfate reduction and obtained 60 8 and 96 sulfate and cod removal respectively biological sulfate reduction using domestic waste as the carbon source has been successfully applied in the rhodes biosure process developed at environmental biotechnology rhodes university ebru the biosure process uses primary sludge from a waste water treatment plant as the sole carbon source for sulfate reduction 112 and is in operation at grootvlei mine in springs on the eastern rand in the gauteng province of south africa 113 the biosure process treats an amd stream with a sulfate load of 2000 mg l with above 67 sulfate and 72 cod removal 114 according to ochieng et al 28 the rhodes biosure process is the most cost effective biological treatment option developed for removing sulfates from amd without the addition of external chemicals the two waste streams ensure improved water quality before being discharged into the bleskbokspruit river the biosure process produces less sludge which is stable and safe to handle mining towns can take advantage of this technology that couples the treatment of amd to that of their domestic effluent to treat both waste streams 1 18 abattoirs effluent abattoirs are used for meat processing for human consumption abattoirs use large volumes of water for their processing operations producing large volumes of wastewater the wastewater contains large amounts of protein and fat 115 116 according to the guidelines for abattoir waste 116 a typical wastewater from a red meat processing abattoir has a ph range from 5 7 8 4 contains 2380 8942 mg l cod 189 3330 mg l suspended solids and 0 71 2 4 mg l total kjeldahl nitrogen wastewater from abattoirs is usually washed down the drain into the municipal system increasing the organic load of municipal water treatment because of the high organic strength of the abattoir effluent systems 116 low cost onsite treatment systems should be implemented to reduce the organic strength of abattoir effluent before discharging into the municipal system biological sulfate reduction offers a low cost treatment for the high organic strength waste stream in areas where amd is prevalent in order for the cod from abattoirs to be used for biological sulfate reduction hydrolytic microbes which breaks down proteins and fats into simple compounds such as organic acids and alcohols 115 need to be incorporated in the treatment process to provide simple substrates that are readily used by srb 1 19 other agricultural and cellulosic wastes solid agricultural waste is composed mainly of hemicellulose cellulose and lignin lignocellulosic material is the most abundant renewable resource in the world they are also cheap and renewable in nature 31 various lignocellulosic wastes are obtained from agricultural activities after harvesting and processing of crops these materials are usually considered low value and are disposed by burning or composting westernsee et al 2018 estimates that for every tonne of maize wheat sugar cane or sunflower seeds an estimated tonne of dry residue is also produced leading to the production of 12 2 mt year agricultural residue and 9 14 mt year lignocellulosic residue in south africa lignocellulosic waste and agricultural residues have been identified as a potential substrate for the treatment of amd using biological sulfate reduction 21 117 these waste materials can be used in their natural form or modified by chemical or physical processes yeneneh et al 118 used chemical modification to improve the effectiveness of rice husks and sugar cane bagasse in removing metals from amd magowo et al 117 showed that milling switch grass greatly improved efficiency in remediating amd the lignocellulose is hydrolysed by cellulolytic bacteria to produce sugars the sugars are fermented to organic acids and alcohols the organic acids and alcohols are then used by sulfate reducing bacteria for biological sulfate reduction with the subsequent precipitation of metals as sulfides 21 119 the cellulosic substrates need to be replenished periodically to ensure substrate availability lignocellulose contain numerous reactive groups such as phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups which are able to bind to metals and removing them from contaminated water 117 the abundance of these agricultural wastes in regions where amd is generated determines their suitability for application 120 discussed the potential of using cassava peel for the treatment of amd in mozambique they concluded that this was a viable option due to the abundancy of cassava in mozambique the treatment of amd using lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock for dsr has been coupled with the possibility of producing important biomolecules at least on a laboratory scale these products are formed from monomeric sugars released from lignocellulosic biomass following pre treatment with amd and subsequent enzyme hydrolysis steps 31 117 1 20 proposed technologies for the co treatment of amd and organic waste two main active biological technologies the thiopaq and the biosulfide processes have been applied in the treatment of amd and can be adapted for the co treatment of amd and organic waste the choice of the treatment technology is site specific and depends on various parameters including the quality of the amd topology flow rate and must also consider environmental regulatory and social factors 121 the thiopaq process has two distinct microbial populations and processes fig 1 in the anaerobic process srb consumes organic material while reducing sulfate to hydrogen sulfide the hydrogen sulfide reacts with dissolved metals forming insoluble metal sulfides in the subsequent aerobic process excess hydrogen sulfide is converted to elemental sulfur by sulfur oxidizing bacteria 122 the removal of sulfide as sulfur is preferred as it removes odours the corrosive potential of the effluent and above all prevents the complete oxidation of sulfide to sulfate 71 123 sulfur is a non corrosive solid which form precipitates that can easily be removed from the bioreactors 71 the thiopaq process has been successfully operated at budelco zinc mine in the netherlands and at pueblo gold mine in the dominican republic the biosulfide process fig 2 has been successfully operated at the kennecott uttah copper mine in the usa it is composed of a biological process were hydrogen sulfide is generated through sulfate reduction and a chemical circuit were dissolved metals reacts with the hydrogen sulfide to form metal sulfide precipitates 18 122 the application of these processes have an advantage due to the recovery of valuable material such as metals and sulfur however due to high construction and operational requirements they might not be suitable for remote sites 124 in cases where there are capital constraints we recommend the use of single bioreactor systems to lower the capital and operational costs the use of single reactor system might entail using acid and metal tolerant sulfidogens in the treatment of low ph and high metal concentration amd 125 in remote mining areas were the organic substrate need to be transported for long distance to the amd generating sites the use of simple passive biological systems were solid substrates are used as electron donors for sulfate reduction is more applicable the solid organic substrates including agricultural residue or plant material organic compost animal manure 126 127 are slowly used by srb and may be able to sustain biological sulfate reduction in the long term these substrates can be incorporated in passive systems such as permeable reactive barriers and anaerobic wetlands were the amd passes through the reactive bed alternatively the soluble organic material can be mixed with or injected into the source of the amd 128 the organic matter stimulate the activity of hydrolytic fermentative and sulfate reducing microorganisms and also act as support media for bacterial growth 22 123 127 the decomposition of the organic rich waste material potentially lower sulfide oxidation due to the consumption of large amounts of oxygen during decomposition thereby preventing further formation of amd 129 long term efficiencies can be enhanced through mixing of easily biodegradable substrates such as cow manure with long term degradable substrates such as lignocellulosic material 130 when the acidity in the amd is excessive the organic matter in the reactive bed can be supplemented by alkaline substrates such as limestone 22 in areas were the organic substrates are not available the mineral transporters may bring the organic waste on their return journeys instead of returning to the mines with empty trucks 2 conclusion many industrial agricultural and domestic processes produce organic rich wastes that can be used successfully in providing the electrons for biological sulfate reduction in the treatment of amd using srb most importantly the factor to consider is the distance between the two waste amd and organic waste as it affects the cost of treatment due to transport costs costs are also reduced in the treatment process as the need for aeration is reduced as the process is anaerobic the amount of sludge produced in using dsr for the treatment of amd is low and easier to handle hydrogen sulfide produced can be used to precipitate metals thereby reducing the odorous effect of hydrogen sulfide on the environment biological sulfate reduction offers the opportunity for selective metal recovery thereby adding value to the process biological sulfate reduction therefore offers a cheap opportunity for the co treatment of a variety of organic rich wastewaters and amd this stems from the ability of srb to use a wide range of organic substrates for their growth and energy requirements in this way organic and inorganic contaminants are removed from the wastewaters and ph is improved through biogenic alkalinity contributing towards the provision of clean water declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the university of the witwatersrand postgraduate merit

13846,this work aims at comparing the response of activated sludge on the exposure either to aluminum oxide microparticles al2o3 mps or aluminum oxide nanoparticles al2o3 nps in the activated sludge system operating in the continuous mode it was for the first time made with regard to three issues composition of the microbial community morphology of activated sludge flocs and settling properties of the sludge it occurred that the addition of al2o3 mps or nps to activated sludge did not reduce either richness or diversity of the bacterial community proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in each activated sludge system studied however the presence of al2o3 mps or nps caused to the decrease of betaproteobacteria and the increase of alphaproteobacteria the most abundant genera identified in the control run i e without addition of al2o3 particles were kd1 23 caldilinea dechloromonas and pseudomonas whereas in the runs with al2o3 mps or nps these were caldilinea pseudomonas brevundimonas terracoccus or caldilinea rhodobacter dokdonella terracocus respectively it was found that al2o3 mps or nps contributed to the reduction of the denitrifying bacteria representing the genera dechloromonas and kd1 23 regarding the flocs morphology it occurred that al2o3 nps influenced it stronger than al2o3 mps did al2o3 nps made the activated sludge flocs bigger and more circular compared to those exposed to al2o3 mps or not exposed to any al2o3 particles these changes of flocs morphology influenced positively the settling properties of activated sludge and contributed to the limitation of sludge bulking keywords aluminum oxide bacterial community flocs morphology micro and nanoparticles 1 introduction activated sludge consists of the diverse groups of microorganisms mainly bacteria which take part in the removal of the variety of organic and inorganic compounds from wastewater being a complex community of microorganisms acclimated to various pollutants and changes of the environmental conditions they are relatively resistant to the impact of chemicals or materials that are released to the sewer systems and then appear in the biological parts of wastewater treatment plants wwtps as a result they are able to decompose microbiologically some pharmaceuticals detergents biocides and ultimately remove them from wastewater 1 2 new chemicals entering the market are usually studied towards their biodegradability and toxicity with the use of the standard tests including ready and inherent biodegradability tests and bacterial inhibition tests apart from them it is still important to evaluate the effect of new or newly recognized and widely applied compounds on activated sludge systems regarding the bacterial composition and biochemical activity activated sludge flocs morphology and sludge settleability and efficiency of wastewater treatment processes it allows to obtain more precise and practically useful data on biological wastewater treatment processes the development of nanotechnology in the last decades caused that much attention was paid to find the response of activated sludge systems to such mineral nanoparticles as titanium dioxide tio2 chromium oxide cr2o3 cerium oxide ceo2 silicon dioxide sio2 silver ag zinc oxide zno 3 8 according to our knowledge only few studies were performed on the influence of aluminum oxide nanoparticles al2o3 nps on activated sludge 9 10 at the same time al2o3 nps possess the excellent dielectric and abrasive properties and what is more they belong to the top nanomaterials taking their previous and predicted production into account 11 due to the unique physical and chemical properties the applicability of al2o3 nps increased and they have been being widely used in many fields 9 11 therefore there is a need to deliver new data about the impact of this nanomaterial al2o3 nps on biological wastewater treatment processes the studies carried out so far indicated that the presence of al2o3 nps in the activated sludge systems at the concentrations from 1 to 50 mg l 1 did not deteriorate the removal of organic compounds and phosphorus as well as nitrification and denitrification processes however the long term exposure to al2o3 nps at the concentration 50 mg l 1 decreased slightly the removal of total nitrogen but the biological phosphorus removal and synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates were not affected 9 al2o3 nps occurred to be less toxic towards bacteria than other nanomaterials like ag nps tio2 nps and sio2 nps 10 it was also shown that al2o3 nps adsorbed onto activated sludge flocs and changed their morphology 9 the presence of al2o3 nps at the concentrations up to 250 mg l 1 in the activated sludge system operating in the batch mode contributed to the increase of flocs size and circularity and as a consequence the settling properties of sludge were improved 12 few studies concerning the effect of al2o3 nps on activated sludge indicated that they did not deteriorate biochemical activity of bacterial community and might even positively influence activated sludge system mineral microparticles contributed to the changes of morphology particularly structure and consistency of activated sludge flocs too 13 it was shown that some of them e g keramsite microparticles improved the efficiency of biological wastewater treatment processes 14 despite this the impact of mineral microparticles including al2o3 mps on activated sludge has been hardly studied so far no studies were devoted to the changes in the microbial community of activated sludge exposed to al2o3 mps the objective of this study was to compare the response of activated sludge on the exposure to aluminum oxide al2o3 micro or nanoparticles in the activated sludge system operating in the continuous mode such comparison is a novel approach and has not been performed yet in this work three following issues were primarily addressed the composition of microbial community morphology of activated sludge flocs and settling properties of the sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 studied micro and nanomaterials aluminum oxide microparticles al2o3 mps and nanoparticles al2o3 nps were used in the experiments al2o3 nps were purchased from sigma aldrich germany while al2o3 mps were obtained from fluka usa according to the manufacturers data the particle size of al2o3 mps was on average 10 μm while the particle size of al2o3 nps was less than 50 nm the purity of both materials was 99 5 2 2 inoculum the inoculum namely activated sludge which was applied to perform biological wastewater treatment processes came from the aerated part of the biological reactor in the combined wastewater treatment plant wwtp in lodz poland the properties of this activated sludge were as follows the total suspended solids tss ranged from 3 4 to 4 1 g l 1 and volatile suspended solids vss from 2 6 to 3 3 g l 1 the values of sludge volume index svi were from 115 to 140 ml g tss 1 flocs could be classified as small or medium their mean equivalent diameter was from 85 to 104 μm and irregular their circularity ranged from 0 279 to 0 358 the average number of filamentous bacteria corresponded to category 2 of the classification formulated by eikelboom 15 2 3 laboratory activated sludge system the experiments were carried out in the laboratory activated sludge system in which the synthetic wastewater 300 mg peptone 100 mg sodium acetate 50 mg potassium monophosphate 50 mg sodium hydrocarbonate 50 mg ammonium hydrophosphate 5 mg magnesium sulphate and 5 mg sodium chloride per litre was treated the system possessed three parallel operating identical parts which consisted of the aeration chamber coupled with the individual clarifier the total working volume of each part was 7 4 l and the volume of the aeration chamber was 5 6 l the synthetic wastewater was pumped continuously to each aeration chamber at the constant volumetric flow rate equal to 0 15 l h 1 aeration flow rate was constant in each experimental run 0 321 lair l 1 min 1 the processes were made at the ambient temperature 21 1 c and the whole laboratory activated system was operated as it was previously described 16 the experiments comprised two stages each of them lasted fourteen days the first stage was aimed at the acclimation of activated sludge biomass taken from the combined wwtp in lodz poland to the composition of the synthetic municipal wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod of the influent and effluent were determined every two or three days in order to check the progress in the acclimation process 17 after one week the degree of cod removal was about 94 and remained on this level during next days indicating that activated sludge biomass was acclimated to the synthetic wastewater in the second stage of the experiments the appropriate amount of al2o3 particles was mixed with about 1 l of the acclimated activated sludge taken from the proper aeration chamber and then this suspension was gently transferred back to the same aeration chamber from which the sludge had been withdrawn to the first activated sludge system al2o3 mps were added to the second one al2o3 nps and the third one played the role of the control system without the addition of any mineral particles the final concentration of al2o3 mps or nps in the activated sludge systems was 250 mg l 1 in order to check the progress of the second stage of experiments the degree of removal of cod was determined every two or three days the values of degree of cod removal

al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps on process efficiency and macroscopic sludge properties biological wastewater treatment experiments in the laboratory activated sludge continuous system ran without any disturbances the presence of either al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps in the activated sludge system did not deteriorate the removal of organic compounds the values of cod removal were at the level of 93 in the control runs whereas in the experiments with al2o3 mps or nps they achieved on average the values of 90 or 92 respectively it remained in tune with the results obtained in other works dealing with the effect of mineral nanoparticles on the efficiency of organic matter removal from wastewater in activated sludge bioreactors 3 9 20 addition of al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps to activated sludge system did not change markedly the efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus removal the degree of tkn removal was at the level of 37 1 in the control runs while in the processes with al2o3 mps or nps it reached on average 37 8 or 42 5 respectively at the same time the removal of total phosphorus was 44 7 in the experiments without al2o3 particles whereas in the experiments with al2o3 mps or nps it was at the level of 42 3 or 45 8 respectively the relatively low values of nitrogen and phosphorus removal resulted from the construction of the laboratory activated sludge system see section 2 3 that was dedicated to remove organic carbon compounds primarily nevertheless the comparison of the values of degrees of nutrients removal between the experiments with and without addition of al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps allowed for the better evaluation of the effect of al2o3 particles on the efficiency of biological wastewater treatment processes in this context the obtained results showed that the presence of al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps in the activated sludge system did not cause to the adversary effects on nitrogen and phosphorus removal the similar phenomenon was observed by chen et al 9 with regard to nutrients removal in the activated sludge system exposed to al2o3 nps also huo et al 21 and qiu et al 3 found that silver nanoparticles ag nps did not significantly affect nitrification and denitrification processes regarding the settling properties of activated sludge in the control runs without al2o3 mps or nps the increase of svi on average from 92 to 145 ml g tss 1 was recorded fig 1 a the presence of al2o3 mps did not contribute to the decrease of the svi value so it did not improve the settling ability of activated sludge in the laboratory system studied fig 1a at the same time the presence of al2o3 nps stopped the increase of svi in the course of the experiment the values of svi remained stable and on average varied in the narrow range from 85 to 90 ml g tss 1 it correlated with the microscopic observations of activated sludge flocs morphology as the presence of al2o3 nps in the activated sludge system contributed to the highest increase in flocs size and circularity see section 3 2 it is known that the increase of flocs circularity as well as the increase of flocs size to a certain extent improves the settling properties of activated sludge flocs 15 cervantes avilés et al 4 also demonstrated that the addition of mineral particles i e zno nps improved the settling ability of activated sludge all in all the addition of al2o3 nps or other mineral nanoparticles to activated sludge system for the purpose of improvement of sludge settling properties should be considered in the future biomass concentration quantified by the determination of vss remained at the same level or slightly increased in all experiments irrespective of the addition of either al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps to the system fig 1b it indicated on the favorable conditions for biomass growth in the laboratory activated sludge system relatively the highest increase of biomass concentration by about 22 was observed in the experiment with al2o3 nps fig 1b 3 2 effect of al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps on flocs morphology the changes of sludge flocs morphology exposed to either al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps and not exposed to these mineral particles were determined in the activated sludge system operating in the continuous mode with regard to flocs size two morphological parameters i e the mean projected area and mean equivalent diameter were primarily used both of them increased in the experiments with the addition of al2o3 particles as well as in the control run without al2o3 mps or nps it indicated that the conditions of the performed experiments favored the growth of activated sludge flocs taking the mean projected area of flocs into account its relative increase was the highest in the test with al2o3 nps fig 2 a it was equal to 66 5 while in the control run and in the run with al2o3 mps it reached 27 4 and 29 1 respectively two latter values indicated that the increase of flocs size exposed to al2o3 mps and not exposed to any al2o3 particles was at similar level thus al2o3 mps added to the activated sludge bioreactor operating in the continuous mode did not contribute to the increase of flocs size more than it was observed in the control runs without any al2o3 particles unlike al2o3 mps al2o3 nps did it so the relative increase of the mean projected area of flocs when al2o3 nps were added was above twice higher than that in the control experiments regarding to the mean equivalent diameter of flocs it did not change significantly in the course of the control run and remained in the range from 143 to 144 μm fig 2a its relative change was at the level of 0 7 at the same time in the experiments with either al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps the mean equivalent diameter of flocs increased by 18 2 or 21 5 respectively similarly to the case of the mean projected area the highest increase of the mean equivalent diameter was observed in the experiments with al2o3 nps it confirmed that the presence of these mineral particles in activated sludge bioreactors favored the growth of flocs the distribution of the equivalent diameters of flocs was described by the log normal model with the satisfactory goodness of fit i e r2 ranged from 0 755 to 0 865 fig 3 it occurred that the equivalent diameters of flocs varied in the wide range from less than 10μm to above 1000 μm however in each experiment small flocs of diameter below 100 μm dominated the distributions of the equivalent diameters showed that in the experiments with the addition of al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps bigger flocs might have been formed than those in the processes without the addition of al2o3 particles the highest values of the equivalent diameter were up to 940 μm in the control run while in the processes with mineral particles they reached 1040 μm for al2o3 mps and 1350 μm for al2o3 nps in order to describe flocs shape two morphological parameters were determined i e circularity and convexity flocs convexity was not affected by the exposure to either al2o3 mps or nps whereas circularity of flocs was higher in the experiments with the addition of al2o3 particles than in the control runs fig 2b the relative change of the convexity did not exceed 2 9 fig 2b flocs circularity increased in the course of each experiment for example in the control run it increased from 0 339 to 0 379 while in the run with al2o3 nps it was from 0 343 to 0 394 these values indicated that flocs shapes were far from the ideal circle for which circularity is always equal to 1 the relative change in flocs circularity was the highest in the case of the run with al2o3 nps and equaled 14 6 it showed that al2o3 nps influenced stronger flocs circularity than al2o3 mps did the same phenomenon was previously observed in the batch system 12 it confirmed that smaller al2o3 particles of nanometer size stronger changed the shape of activated sludge flocs than bigger al2o3 microparticles did this phenomenon was most probably caused by the fact that nanoparticles could easier than microparticles penetrate into the internal regions of activated sludge flocs and as a result change their morphology both size and shape to a higher extent 3 3 overall responses of bacterial community to al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps high throughput sequencing was applied to identify the microbial community of activated sludge in the laboratory activated sludge system either exposed to al2o3 mps or nps or not exposed to these mineral particles the general results of this analysis were summarized in table 1 the good s coverage in all cases was higher or equal than 99 85 showing that the corresponding sequence library had covered the microbial community the microbial richness of the activated sludge subjected to the influence of al2o3 mps was approximately at the same level as it was found for the activated sludge coming from the control experiment in terms of the number of otus table 1 the presence of al2o3 nps in the activated sludge system contributed to the increase of the microbial richness the number of otus was about 36 higher in the experiment with al2o3 nps than in the control run table 1 the microbial diversity was described by the values of shannon and simpson indices that are commonly used to express the biodiversity of habitats in ecology as well the diversity of bacterial communities in activated sludge systems these both indices regarded species richness and evenness however the simpson index is thought to be less sensible to species richness 22 generally the higher values of shannon and simpson indices are the greater diversity is observed 22 the obtained values of shannon and simpson indices table 1 were at the similar levels to these determined in the experiments with titanium oxide nanoparticles tio2 nps made by li et al 5 these indices showed that the diversity of the bacterial community was affected by the presence of al2o3 particles in the activated sludge system studied particularly it concerned the presence of al2o3 nps table 1 the diversity of the bacterial community was greater in the processes with al2o3 mps or nps than in the control test li et al 5 also observed the increase of the microbial diversity when the tio2 nps were present in the activated sludge system literature data are not unambiguous in this area zhou and xu 7 did not find the unequivocal dependency between the addition of silver nanoparticles ag nps and microbial diversity of activated sludge biomass while wang et al 23 found that the presence of chromium oxide nanoparticles cr2o3 nps contributed to the reduction of microbial diversity 3 4 effect of al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps on microbial community of activated sludge the microbial community of activated sludge mainly consisted of bacteria 24 in this study the kingdom of bacteria made from 99 1 to 99 5 of all microorganisms at the phylum level six known phyla abundance 1 were identified in all activated sludge samples studied these were proteobacteria actinobacteria chloroflexi tm7 bacteroidetes and planctomycetes fig 4 a apart from them firmicutes were present 1 1 but only in activated sludge from the control run to the phylum firmicutes belongs mainly syntrophic bacteria clostridia or bacilli class degrading various volatile fatty acids vfa they were typically detected in anaerobic digesters as well as in activated sludge bioreactors 25 proteobacteria as it was also shown in other studies concerning the composition of activated sludge community 5 7 25 was the dominant phylum in all samples of activated sludge tested its contribution was the highest in the control run 66 1 while in the activated sludge exposed to either al2o3 mps or nps i e 63 9 or 58 9 respectively zhou and xu 7 observed even more significant decrease of the abundance of proteobacteria from 44 4 to 23 5 with the increase of ag nps concentration li et al 12 found the same tendency for the activated sludge exposed to various concentrations of tio2 nps the abundance of proteobacteria decreased from about 63 5 to 37 7 with the increase of tio2 nps concentration from 0 to 30 mg l 1 5 within the phylum proteobacteria the class betaproteobacteria was identified as the most abundant in the control run the presence of al2o3 particles in the activated sludge system caused to the decrease of betaproteobacteria and the increase of alphaproteobacteria fig 4b compared to alphaproteobacteria which are able to survive on a minimal amount of nutrients betaproteobacteria require a copious amount of organic compounds 26 in this study the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria decreased from 47 9 in the control run to 36 2 in the run with al2o3 mps and 37 1 in the run with al2o3 nps wang et al 23 found that the relative abundance of genera belonging to the class betaproteobacteria was significantly changed in the activated sludge exposed to cr2o3 nps it decreased in the case of ten genera while its increase was noticed in the case of only three genera at the same time li et al 5 observed the increase of the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria with the increase of tio2 nps concentration this discrepancy in the impact of nanoparticles on betaproteobacteria the most probably resulted from the chemical composition and the concentrations of nanomaterials used at the genus level the following differences in the bacterial community composition that resulted from the addition of al2o3 mps or nps to the activated sludge system were found the most abundant identified genera in the control run were kd1 23 caldilinea dechloromonas and pseudomonas whereas in the runs with al2o3 particles these were caldilinea pseudomonas brevundimonas and terracoccus for mps and caldilinea rhodobacter dokdonella and terracocus for nps fig 5 the common genus that was present in all samples of activated sludge was caldilinea the genus caldilinea belongs to the phylum chloroflexi these are filamentous bacteria that have been morphologically identified as eikelboom type 0803 according to kragelund et al 27 caldilinea play an important structural role in the sludge flocs formation and may appear in the foaming incidents the presence of either al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps in activated sludge system contributed to the reduction of bacteria representing the following genera dechloromonas alkalimonas kd1 23 sulfurospirillum and thiotrix fig 5 dechloromonas and kd1 23 are responsible for denitrification the members of genus dechloromonas were often detected in the activated sludge community 7 28 in the case of kd1 23 it was found that they could enhance soil denitrification 29 wang et al 30 observed the decrease of the number of denitrifiers in the activated sludge with the addition of mineral nanoparticles and it was the case in this work too wang et al 30 noticed the decline in the number of two dominant denitrifying bacteria i e flexibacter and acinetobacter in the activated sludge exposed to ceo2 nps in the other work wang et al 23 also found that the presence of cr2o3 nps reduced the relative abundance of some genera related to denitrification pseudomonas desulfovibrio hyphomicrobium li et al 5 claimed that the presence of tio2 nps promoted or in some cases inhibited the growth development and reproduction of denitrifying bacteria the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria e g dokdonella hyphomicrobium decreased with an increase of tio2 nps concentration whereas the relative abundance of comamonas and zoogloea connected with the denitrification processes increased at 60 mg l 1 tio2 nps in comparison to 0 mg l 1 tio2 nps 5 at the same time zhou and xu 7 demonstrated no effect of ag nps on the denitrifying bacteria they found that the abundance of the denitrifiers in the activated sludge system remained at the high level despite the exposure to ag nps 7 the results concerning the effect of mineral nanomaterials on denitrifying bacteria revealed that some of them might cause to the reduction of the relative abundance of selected denitrifiers it depends on the chemical composition of nanoparticles and the sensitivity of the given denitrifying bacteria to the specific nanomaterial as activated sludge is a complex community of bacteria the reduction of some genera of denitrifiers need not affect the denitrification processes regarding to the other aforementioned genera that were reduced in the processes with either al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps various thiotrix species belong to the bacteria that commonly occur in activated sludge while alkalimonas and sulfurospirillum have not been often detected in activated sludge systems thiotrix is a genus of filamentous sulfur oxidizing bacteria its species caused to filamentous bulking events in activated sludge systems in particular in dairy wastewater treatment plants 31 the reduction of thiotrix species by the addition of either al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps seems to be promising to prevent bulking events in wwtps alkalimonas is gram negative bacteria belonging to gammaproteobacteria that play an important role in biogeochemical cycles these bacteria are aerobic hydrolytics 32 sulfurospirillum are organohalide respiring epsilonproteobacteria this genus comprises versatile often microaerophilic bacteria growing on many various substrates 33 they are hydrogen producing bacteria of environmental importance since hydrogen is a major electron donor for prokaryotes in anoxic ecosystems 34 the abundance of one genus i e leucobacter was clearly higher in the processes with al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps alike than in the experiments without addition of these mineral particles fig 5 the genus leucobacter comprises the variety of gram positive aerobic non motile irregular rod shaped bacteria this genus belongs to actinobacteria and was for the first time characterized after the discovery of the species l komagatae in 1996 35 leucobacter are dispersed in the environments that are chromium rich including chromium rich wastewater treatment plants 36 but their growth is not limited by the presence of chromium https microbewiki kenyon edu index php leucobacter 4 conclusions the addition of either al2o3 mps or nps to the activated sludge system operating in the continuous mode reduces neither richness nor diversity of the bacterial community al2o3 nps contribute to the increase of the microbial richness which is proved by the higher number of otus by about 36 compared to the control experiment without al2o3 particles proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in the activated sludge exposed and not exposed to al2o3 particles its contribution was the highest in the control run 66 1 and slightly lower in the activated sludge exposed to al2o3 mps or nps i e 63 9 or 58 9 respectively the presence of al2o3 particles in activated sludge system causes to the decrease of betaproteobacteria and the increase of alphaproteobacteria contribution one of the most abundant identified common genera in the activated sludge exposed and not exposed to al2o3 particles was caldilinea that belongs to the phylum chloroflexi these are filamentous bacteria playing an important role in flocs formation both al2o3 mps and al2o3 nps contribute to the reduction of denitrifying bacteria representing the genera dechloromonas and kd1 23 the distributions of flocs size exposed and not exposed to either al2o3 mps or nps follow the log normal model and the flocs of equivalent diameter below 100 μm were the most frequent al2o3 nps influence stronger on flocs morphology than al2o3 mps do for activated sludge flocs exposed to al2o3 nps the highest relative increase of flocs size expressed by the mean projected area and equivalent diameter is observed so is the relative increase in flocs circularity the highest these changes of flocs morphology influence positively settling properties of activated sludge and contribute to the limitation of sludge bulking declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

13846,this work aims at comparing the response of activated sludge on the exposure either to aluminum oxide microparticles al2o3 mps or aluminum oxide nanoparticles al2o3 nps in the activated sludge system operating in the continuous mode it was for the first time made with regard to three issues composition of the microbial community morphology of activated sludge flocs and settling properties of the sludge it occurred that the addition of al2o3 mps or nps to activated sludge did not reduce either richness or diversity of the bacterial community proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in each activated sludge system studied however the presence of al2o3 mps or nps caused to the decrease of betaproteobacteria and the increase of alphaproteobacteria the most abundant genera identified in the control run i e without addition of al2o3 particles were kd1 23 caldilinea dechloromonas and pseudomonas whereas in the runs with al2o3 mps or nps these were caldilinea pseudomonas brevundimonas terracoccus or caldilinea rhodobacter dokdonella terracocus respectively it was found that al2o3 mps or nps contributed to the reduction of the denitrifying bacteria representing the genera dechloromonas and kd1 23 regarding the flocs morphology it occurred that al2o3 nps influenced it stronger than al2o3 mps did al2o3 nps made the activated sludge flocs bigger and more circular compared to those exposed to al2o3 mps or not exposed to any al2o3 particles these changes of flocs morphology influenced positively the settling properties of activated sludge and contributed to the limitation of sludge bulking keywords aluminum oxide bacterial community flocs morphology micro and nanoparticles 1 introduction activated sludge consists of the diverse groups of microorganisms mainly bacteria which take part in the removal of the variety of organic and inorganic compounds from wastewater being a complex community of microorganisms acclimated to various pollutants and changes of the environmental conditions they are relatively resistant to the impact of chemicals or materials that are released to the sewer systems and then appear in the biological parts of wastewater treatment plants wwtps as a result they are able to decompose microbiologically some pharmaceuticals detergents biocides and ultimately remove them from wastewater 1 2 new chemicals entering the market are usually studied towards their biodegradability and toxicity with the use of the standard tests including ready and inherent biodegradability tests and bacterial inhibition tests apart from them it is still important to evaluate the effect of new or newly recognized and widely applied compounds on activated sludge systems regarding the bacterial composition and biochemical activity activated sludge flocs morphology and sludge settleability and efficiency of wastewater treatment processes it allows to obtain more precise and practically useful data on biological wastewater treatment processes the development of nanotechnology in the last decades caused that much attention was paid to find the response of activated sludge systems to such mineral nanoparticles as titanium dioxide tio2 chromium oxide cr2o3 cerium oxide ceo2 silicon dioxide sio2 silver ag zinc oxide zno 3 8 according to our knowledge only few studies were performed on the influence of aluminum oxide nanoparticles al2o3 nps on activated sludge 9 10 at the same time al2o3 nps possess the excellent dielectric and abrasive properties and what is more they belong to the top nanomaterials taking their previous and predicted production into account 11 due to the unique physical and chemical properties the applicability of al2o3 nps increased and they have been being widely used in many fields 9 11 therefore there is a need to deliver new data about the impact of this nanomaterial al2o3 nps on biological wastewater treatment processes the studies carried out so far indicated that the presence of al2o3 nps in the activated sludge systems at the concentrations from 1 to 50 mg l 1 did not deteriorate the removal of organic compounds and phosphorus as well as nitrification and denitrification processes however the long term exposure to al2o3 nps at the concentration 50 mg l 1 decreased slightly the removal of total nitrogen but the biological phosphorus removal and synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates were not affected 9 al2o3 nps occurred to be less toxic towards bacteria than other nanomaterials like ag nps tio2 nps and sio2 nps 10 it was also shown that al2o3 nps adsorbed onto activated sludge flocs and changed their morphology 9 the presence of al2o3 nps at the concentrations up to 250 mg l 1 in the activated sludge system operating in the batch mode contributed to the increase of flocs size and circularity and as a consequence the settling properties of sludge were improved 12 few studies concerning the effect of al2o3 nps on activated sludge indicated that they did not deteriorate biochemical activity of bacterial community and might even positively influence activated sludge system mineral microparticles contributed to the changes of morphology particularly structure and consistency of activated sludge flocs too 13 it was shown that some of them e g keramsite microparticles improved the efficiency of biological wastewater treatment processes 14 despite this the impact of mineral microparticles including al2o3 mps on activated sludge has been hardly studied so far no studies were devoted to the changes in the microbial community of activated sludge exposed to al2o3 mps the objective of this study was to compare the response of activated sludge on the exposure to aluminum oxide al2o3 micro or nanoparticles in the activated sludge system operating in the continuous mode such comparison is a novel approach and has not been performed yet in this work three following issues were primarily addressed the composition of microbial community morphology of activated sludge flocs and settling properties of the sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 studied micro and nanomaterials aluminum oxide microparticles al2o3 mps and nanoparticles al2o3 nps were used in the experiments al2o3 nps were purchased from sigma aldrich germany while al2o3 mps were obtained from fluka usa according to the manufacturers data the particle size of al2o3 mps was on average 10 μm while the particle size of al2o3 nps was less than 50 nm the purity of both materials was 99 5 2 2 inoculum the inoculum namely activated sludge which was applied to perform biological wastewater treatment processes came from the aerated part of the biological reactor in the combined wastewater treatment plant wwtp in lodz poland the properties of this activated sludge were as follows the total suspended solids tss ranged from 3 4 to 4 1 g l 1 and volatile suspended solids vss from 2 6 to 3 3 g l 1 the values of sludge volume index svi were from 115 to 140 ml g tss 1 flocs could be classified as small or medium their mean equivalent diameter was from 85 to 104 μm and irregular their circularity ranged from 0 279 to 0 358 the average number of filamentous bacteria corresponded to category 2 of the classification formulated by eikelboom 15 2 3 laboratory activated sludge system the experiments were carried out in the laboratory activated sludge system in which the synthetic wastewater 300 mg peptone 100 mg sodium acetate 50 mg potassium monophosphate 50 mg sodium hydrocarbonate 50 mg ammonium hydrophosphate 5 mg magnesium sulphate and 5 mg sodium chloride per litre was treated the system possessed three parallel operating identical parts which consisted of the aeration chamber coupled with the individual clarifier the total working volume of each part was 7 4 l and the volume of the aeration chamber was 5 6 l the synthetic wastewater was pumped continuously to each aeration chamber at the constant volumetric flow rate equal to 0 15 l h 1 aeration flow rate was constant in each experimental run 0 321 lair l 1 min 1 the processes were made at the ambient temperature 21 1 c and the whole laboratory activated system was operated as it was previously described 16 the experiments comprised two stages each of them lasted fourteen days the first stage was aimed at the acclimation of activated sludge biomass taken from the combined wwtp in lodz poland to the composition of the synthetic municipal wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod of the influent and effluent were determined every two or three days in order to check the progress in the acclimation process 17 after one week the degree of cod removal was about 94 and remained on this level during next days indicating that activated sludge biomass was acclimated to the synthetic wastewater in the second stage of the experiments the appropriate amount of al2o3 particles was mixed with about 1 l of the acclimated activated sludge taken from the proper aeration chamber and then this suspension was gently transferred back to the same aeration chamber from which the sludge had been withdrawn to the first activated sludge system al2o3 mps were added to the second one al2o3 nps and the third one played the role of the control system without the addition of any mineral particles the final concentration of al2o3 mps or nps in the activated sludge systems was 250 mg l 1 in order to check the progress of the second stage of experiments the degree of removal of cod was determined every two or three days the values of degree of cod removal at the level of 94 2 5 indicated that the stability of the system was achieved then the activated sludge samples from each part of laboratory activated sludge system were subjected to the analyses the following physicochemical analyses in accordance with the standard methods 18 were made chemical oxygen demand cod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn total phosphorus tp total suspended solids tss volatile

al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps on process efficiency and macroscopic sludge properties biological wastewater treatment experiments in the laboratory activated sludge continuous system ran without any disturbances the presence of either al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps in the activated sludge system did not deteriorate the removal of organic compounds the values of cod removal were at the level of 93 in the control runs whereas in the experiments with al2o3 mps or nps they achieved on average the values of 90 or 92 respectively it remained in tune with the results obtained in other works dealing with the effect of mineral nanoparticles on the efficiency of organic matter removal from wastewater in activated sludge bioreactors 3 9 20 addition of al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps to activated sludge system did not change markedly the efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus removal the degree of tkn removal was at the level of 37 1 in the control runs while in the processes with al2o3 mps or nps it reached on average 37 8 or 42 5 respectively at the same time the removal of total phosphorus was 44 7 in the experiments without al2o3 particles whereas in the experiments with al2o3 mps or nps it was at the level of 42 3 or 45 8 respectively the relatively low values of nitrogen and phosphorus removal resulted from the construction of the laboratory activated sludge system see section 2 3 that was dedicated to remove organic carbon compounds primarily nevertheless the comparison of the values of degrees of nutrients removal between the experiments with and without addition of al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps allowed for the better evaluation of the effect of al2o3 particles on the efficiency of biological wastewater treatment processes in this context the obtained results showed that the presence of al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps in the activated sludge system did not cause to the adversary effects on nitrogen and phosphorus removal the similar phenomenon was observed by chen et al 9 with regard to nutrients removal in the activated sludge system exposed to al2o3 nps also huo et al 21 and qiu et al 3 found that silver nanoparticles ag nps did not significantly affect nitrification and denitrification processes regarding the settling properties of activated sludge in the control runs without al2o3 mps or nps the increase of svi on average from 92 to 145 ml g tss 1 was recorded fig 1 a the presence of al2o3 mps did not contribute to the decrease of the svi value so it did not improve the settling ability of activated sludge in the laboratory system studied fig 1a at the same time the presence of al2o3 nps stopped the increase of svi in the course of the experiment the values of svi remained stable and on average varied in the narrow range from 85 to 90 ml g tss 1 it correlated with the microscopic observations of activated sludge flocs morphology as the presence of al2o3 nps in the activated sludge system contributed to the highest increase in flocs size and circularity see section 3 2 it is known that the increase of flocs circularity as well as the increase of flocs size to a certain extent improves the settling properties of activated sludge flocs 15 cervantes avilés et al 4 also demonstrated that the addition of mineral particles i e zno nps improved the settling ability of activated sludge all in all the addition of al2o3 nps or other mineral nanoparticles to activated sludge system for the purpose of improvement of sludge settling properties should be considered in the future biomass concentration quantified by the determination of vss remained at the same level or slightly increased in all experiments irrespective of the addition of either al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps to the system fig 1b it indicated on the favorable conditions for biomass growth in the laboratory activated sludge system relatively the highest increase of biomass concentration by about 22 was observed in the experiment with al2o3 nps fig 1b 3 2 effect of al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps on flocs morphology the changes of sludge flocs morphology exposed to either al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps and not exposed to these mineral particles were determined in the activated sludge system operating in the continuous mode with regard to flocs size two morphological parameters i e the mean projected area and mean equivalent diameter were primarily used both of them increased in the experiments with the addition of al2o3 particles as well as in the control run without al2o3 mps or nps it indicated that the conditions of the performed experiments favored the growth of activated sludge flocs taking the mean projected area of flocs into account its relative increase was the highest in the test with al2o3 nps fig 2 a it was equal to 66 5 while in the control run and in the run with al2o3 mps it reached 27 4 and 29 1 respectively two latter values indicated that the increase of flocs size exposed to al2o3 mps and not exposed to any al2o3 particles was at similar level thus al2o3 mps added to the activated sludge bioreactor operating in the continuous mode did not contribute to the increase of flocs size more than it was observed in the control runs without any al2o3 particles unlike al2o3 mps al2o3 nps did it so the relative increase of the mean projected area of flocs when al2o3 nps were added was above twice higher than that in the control experiments regarding to the mean equivalent diameter of flocs it did not change significantly in the course of the control run and remained in the range from 143 to 144 μm fig 2a its relative change was at the level of 0 7 at the same time in the experiments with either al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps the mean equivalent diameter of flocs increased by 18 2 or 21 5 respectively similarly to the case of the mean projected area the highest increase of the mean equivalent diameter was observed in the experiments with al2o3 nps it confirmed that the presence of these mineral particles in activated sludge bioreactors favored the growth of flocs the distribution of the equivalent diameters of flocs was described by the log normal model with the satisfactory goodness of fit i e r2 ranged from 0 755 to 0 865 fig 3 it occurred that the equivalent diameters of flocs varied in the wide range from less than 10μm to above 1000 μm however in each experiment small flocs of diameter below 100 μm dominated the distributions of the equivalent diameters showed that in the experiments with the addition of al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps bigger flocs might have been formed than those in the processes without the addition of al2o3 particles the highest values of the equivalent diameter were up to 940 μm in the control run while in the processes with mineral particles they reached 1040 μm for al2o3 mps and 1350 μm for al2o3 nps in order to describe flocs shape two morphological parameters were determined i e circularity and convexity flocs convexity was not affected by the exposure to either al2o3 mps or nps whereas circularity of flocs was higher in the experiments with the addition of al2o3 particles than in the control runs fig 2b the relative change of the convexity did not exceed 2 9 fig 2b flocs circularity increased in the course of each experiment for example in the control run it increased from 0 339 to 0 379 while in the run with al2o3 nps it was from 0 343 to 0 394 these values indicated that flocs shapes were far from the ideal circle for which circularity is always equal to 1 the relative change in flocs circularity was the highest in the case of the run with al2o3 nps and equaled 14 6 it showed that al2o3 nps influenced stronger flocs circularity than al2o3 mps did the same phenomenon was previously observed in the batch system 12 it confirmed that smaller al2o3 particles of nanometer size stronger changed the shape of activated sludge flocs than bigger al2o3 microparticles did this phenomenon was most probably caused by the fact that nanoparticles could easier than microparticles penetrate into the internal regions of activated sludge flocs and as a result change their morphology both size and shape to a higher extent 3 3 overall responses of bacterial community to al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps high throughput sequencing was applied to identify the microbial community of activated sludge in the laboratory activated sludge system either exposed to al2o3 mps or nps or not exposed to these mineral particles the general results of this analysis were summarized in table 1 the good s coverage in all cases was higher or equal than 99 85 showing that the corresponding sequence library had covered the microbial community the microbial richness of the activated sludge subjected to the influence of al2o3 mps was approximately at the same level as it was found for the activated sludge coming from the control experiment in terms of the number of otus table 1 the presence of al2o3 nps in the activated sludge system contributed to the increase of the microbial richness the number of otus was about 36 higher in the experiment with al2o3 nps than in the control run table 1 the microbial diversity was described by the values of shannon and simpson indices that are commonly used to express the biodiversity of habitats in ecology as well the diversity of bacterial communities in activated sludge systems these both indices regarded species richness and evenness however the simpson index is thought to be less sensible to species richness 22 generally the higher values of shannon and simpson indices are the greater diversity is observed 22 the obtained values of shannon and simpson indices table 1 were at the similar levels to these determined in the experiments with titanium oxide nanoparticles tio2 nps made by li et al 5 these indices showed that the diversity of the bacterial community was affected by the presence of al2o3 particles in the activated sludge system studied particularly it concerned the presence of al2o3 nps table 1 the diversity of the bacterial community was greater in the processes with al2o3 mps or nps than in the control test li et al 5 also observed the increase of the microbial diversity when the tio2 nps were present in the activated sludge system literature data are not unambiguous in this area zhou and xu 7 did not find the unequivocal dependency between the addition of silver nanoparticles ag nps and microbial diversity of activated sludge biomass while wang et al 23 found that the presence of chromium oxide nanoparticles cr2o3 nps contributed to the reduction of microbial diversity 3 4 effect of al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps on microbial community of activated sludge the microbial community of activated sludge mainly consisted of bacteria 24 in this study the kingdom of bacteria made from 99 1 to 99 5 of all microorganisms at the phylum level six known phyla abundance 1 were identified in all activated sludge samples studied these were proteobacteria actinobacteria chloroflexi tm7 bacteroidetes and planctomycetes fig 4 a apart from them firmicutes were present 1 1 but only in activated sludge from the control run to the phylum firmicutes belongs mainly syntrophic bacteria clostridia or bacilli class degrading various volatile fatty acids vfa they were typically detected in anaerobic digesters as well as in activated sludge bioreactors 25 proteobacteria as it was also shown in other studies concerning the composition of activated sludge community 5 7 25 was the dominant phylum in all samples of activated sludge tested its contribution was the highest in the control run 66 1 while in the activated sludge exposed to either al2o3 mps or nps i e 63 9 or 58 9 respectively zhou and xu 7 observed even more significant decrease of the abundance of proteobacteria from 44 4 to 23 5 with the increase of ag nps concentration li et al 12 found the same tendency for the activated sludge exposed to various concentrations of tio2 nps the abundance of proteobacteria decreased from about 63 5 to 37 7 with the increase of tio2 nps concentration from 0 to 30 mg l 1 5 within the phylum proteobacteria the class betaproteobacteria was identified as the most abundant in the control run the presence of al2o3 particles in the activated sludge system caused to the decrease of betaproteobacteria and the increase of alphaproteobacteria fig 4b compared to alphaproteobacteria which are able to survive on a minimal amount of nutrients betaproteobacteria require a copious amount of organic compounds 26 in this study the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria decreased from 47 9 in the control run to 36 2 in the run with al2o3 mps and 37 1 in the run with al2o3 nps wang et al 23 found that the relative abundance of genera belonging to the class betaproteobacteria was significantly changed in the activated sludge exposed to cr2o3 nps it decreased in the case of ten genera while its increase was noticed in the case of only three genera at the same time li et al 5 observed the increase of the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria with the increase of tio2 nps concentration this discrepancy in the impact of nanoparticles on betaproteobacteria the most probably resulted from the chemical composition and the concentrations of nanomaterials used at the genus level the following differences in the bacterial community composition that resulted from the addition of al2o3 mps or nps to the activated sludge system were found the most abundant identified genera in the control run were kd1 23 caldilinea dechloromonas and pseudomonas whereas in the runs with al2o3 particles these were caldilinea pseudomonas brevundimonas and terracoccus for mps and caldilinea rhodobacter dokdonella and terracocus for nps fig 5 the common genus that was present in all samples of activated sludge was caldilinea the genus caldilinea belongs to the phylum chloroflexi these are filamentous bacteria that have been morphologically identified as eikelboom type 0803 according to kragelund et al 27 caldilinea play an important structural role in the sludge flocs formation and may appear in the foaming incidents the presence of either al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps in activated sludge system contributed to the reduction of bacteria representing the following genera dechloromonas alkalimonas kd1 23 sulfurospirillum and thiotrix fig 5 dechloromonas and kd1 23 are responsible for denitrification the members of genus dechloromonas were often detected in the activated sludge community 7 28 in the case of kd1 23 it was found that they could enhance soil denitrification 29 wang et al 30 observed the decrease of the number of denitrifiers in the activated sludge with the addition of mineral nanoparticles and it was the case in this work too wang et al 30 noticed the decline in the number of two dominant denitrifying bacteria i e flexibacter and acinetobacter in the activated sludge exposed to ceo2 nps in the other work wang et al 23 also found that the presence of cr2o3 nps reduced the relative abundance of some genera related to denitrification pseudomonas desulfovibrio hyphomicrobium li et al 5 claimed that the presence of tio2 nps promoted or in some cases inhibited the growth development and reproduction of denitrifying bacteria the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria e g dokdonella hyphomicrobium decreased with an increase of tio2 nps concentration whereas the relative abundance of comamonas and zoogloea connected with the denitrification processes increased at 60 mg l 1 tio2 nps in comparison to 0 mg l 1 tio2 nps 5 at the same time zhou and xu 7 demonstrated no effect of ag nps on the denitrifying bacteria they found that the abundance of the denitrifiers in the activated sludge system remained at the high level despite the exposure to ag nps 7 the results concerning the effect of mineral nanomaterials on denitrifying bacteria revealed that some of them might cause to the reduction of the relative abundance of selected denitrifiers it depends on the chemical composition of nanoparticles and the sensitivity of the given denitrifying bacteria to the specific nanomaterial as activated sludge is a complex community of bacteria the reduction of some genera of denitrifiers need not affect the denitrification processes regarding to the other aforementioned genera that were reduced in the processes with either al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps various thiotrix species belong to the bacteria that commonly occur in activated sludge while alkalimonas and sulfurospirillum have not been often detected in activated sludge systems thiotrix is a genus of filamentous sulfur oxidizing bacteria its species caused to filamentous bulking events in activated sludge systems in particular in dairy wastewater treatment plants 31 the reduction of thiotrix species by the addition of either al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps seems to be promising to prevent bulking events in wwtps alkalimonas is gram negative bacteria belonging to gammaproteobacteria that play an important role in biogeochemical cycles these bacteria are aerobic hydrolytics 32 sulfurospirillum are organohalide respiring epsilonproteobacteria this genus comprises versatile often microaerophilic bacteria growing on many various substrates 33 they are hydrogen producing bacteria of environmental importance since hydrogen is a major electron donor for prokaryotes in anoxic ecosystems 34 the abundance of one genus i e leucobacter was clearly higher in the processes with al2o3 mps or al2o3 nps alike than in the experiments without addition of these mineral particles fig 5 the genus leucobacter comprises the variety of gram positive aerobic non motile irregular rod shaped bacteria this genus belongs to actinobacteria and was for the first time characterized after the discovery of the species l komagatae in 1996 35 leucobacter are dispersed in the environments that are chromium rich including chromium rich wastewater treatment plants 36 but their growth is not limited by the presence of chromium https microbewiki kenyon edu index php leucobacter 4 conclusions the addition of either al2o3 mps or nps to the activated sludge system operating in the continuous mode reduces neither richness nor diversity of the bacterial community al2o3 nps contribute to the increase of the microbial richness which is proved by the higher number of otus by about 36 compared to the control experiment without al2o3 particles proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in the activated sludge exposed and not exposed to al2o3 particles its contribution was the highest in the control run 66 1 and slightly lower in the activated sludge exposed to al2o3 mps or nps i e 63 9 or 58 9 respectively the presence of al2o3 particles in activated sludge system causes to the decrease of betaproteobacteria and the increase of alphaproteobacteria contribution one of the most abundant identified common genera in the activated sludge exposed and not exposed to al2o3 particles was caldilinea that belongs to the phylum chloroflexi these are filamentous bacteria playing an important role in flocs formation both al2o3 mps and al2o3 nps contribute to the reduction of denitrifying bacteria representing the genera dechloromonas and kd1 23 the distributions of flocs size exposed and not exposed to either al2o3 mps or nps follow the log normal model and the flocs of equivalent diameter below 100 μm were the most frequent al2o3 nps influence stronger on flocs morphology than al2o3 mps do for activated sludge flocs exposed to al2o3 nps the highest relative increase of flocs size expressed by the mean projected area and equivalent diameter is observed so is the relative increase in flocs circularity the highest these changes of flocs morphology influence positively settling properties of activated sludge and contribute to the limitation of sludge bulking declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

13847,the aim of this work was to design a decentralized system for urine collection and fertilizer production within the city of cape town evaluating the effects of transportation logistics of source separated urine collection and treatment formed the main modelling portion of this objective it was determined that the decentralized approach to urine treatment exhibited several advantages over biological nutrient removal bnr at conventional wastewater treatment plants these advantages included lower greenhouse gas emissions and energy expenditure for a similar operating cost it was found that a positive net present value was achieved if the recovered fertilizer was sold at prices comparable to commercially available liquid fertilizers with similar nitrogen content moreover it was shown that if urine was collected from shopping malls in cape town the liquid fertilizer produced would only need to be sold at 1 57 l to breakeven over a five year period conversely it was found that there was only a market for about 10 of the recovered liquid fertilizer which could be sold as a niche fertilizer 10 5 l but the remaining 90 of recovered liquid fertilizer would only need to be sold at a bulk value of 0 67 l over a five year period to breakeven keywords fertilizer geospatial analysis last mile logistics phosphorus reverse osmosis 1 introduction it is estimated that the total phosphorus that could be recovered from urine is roughly 22 of the current global phosphorus demand 1 however the current philosophy pertaining to urine is typically centred around treatment and disposal as opposed to recovery and reuse 2 this becomes significant especially considering the value of urine 3 a shift in infrastructure and philosophy could see urine being treated separately rather than it being treated at wastewater treatment plants furthermore this could allow for recycling of source separated urine through decentralized treatment systems 3 decentralization of urine treatment is not a novel concept research has shown that decentralizing the treatment of urine offers lower greenhouse gas ghg emissions energy expenditure and operating costs in comparison to centralized wastewater treatment of equal quantities of urine 4 5 in addition the treatment of urine to recover nutrients potentially holds many financial benefits if sold commercially 6 7 furthermore a decrease in the influent nutrient load at wastewater treatment facilities could potentially allow for monetary savings regarding biological nutrient removal bnr 8 a shift in treatment philosophy that results in urine recycling rather than disposal can also save water 9 this is especially relevant in drought prone areas many benefits can potentially be achieved by decentralized urine treatment but barriers do exist barriers include the transportation logistics of urine from where it originates the economic feasibility of implementing decentralized treatment and the selection of appropriate urine treatment technologies urine is predominately water thus bulk transportation is limited by weight and volume to model a methodology for the logistics of a decentralized system it is useful to liken urine as being part of a supply chain distribution of goods from the location of production to retail outlets plays a pivotal role in any economic supply chain this phenomenon is referred to as last mile logistics and plays a complimentary role alongside transportation planning 10 however this requires geospatial analysis to accurately depict the characteristics of the infrastructure within any given study area geospatial analysis is a form of analytics that incorporates known geographical information to help in understanding patterns in human behaviour 10 this form of analysis finds significant applications for mobility and is typically done using databases known as geographic information systems gis 10 gis has previously been used to model last mile delivery and optimize supply chains for sustainability related research these studies incorporate upcycling of resources whereby waste products are transported from demand sources to recycling facilities hendrickson kavvada 11 used spatial analysis to model the last mile logistics of recycling batteries from electric vehicles similarly jenkins parker 12 used geospatial planning to analyse the supply chain potential and optimum location for biofuel production facilities research regarding the logistics of decentralized urine collection systems are limited but have been previously explored in a study conducted by kavvada tarpeh 6 the planning of transportation methods for nitrogen recovered from source separated urine from households was investigated geospatial and last mile logistics modelling was considered for a hypothetical system implemented in the city of san francisco united states of america it was determined that decentralizing urine treatment was desirable as it offered a lower operating cost lower unit energy expenditure and lower ghg emissions when compared to centralized wastewater management 6 it also displayed the potential to earn a profit but this was only the case when the potential sale of the nitrogen fertilizers produced was taken into consideration if the collection of source separated urine is considered for implementation different methods of urine collection are required there are typically two forms of no mix toilets urine diverting toilets udts and urine diverting dry toilets uddts 13 similar to conventional household toilets both consist of a pedestal and a cistern there are two compartments in these toilets one for urine collection and one for solid waste collection urine diverting dry toilets are completely waterless and can be used to collect solid waste and urine for composting and alternate forms of nutrient recovery 14 however the urine collection segment in udts are waterless while the waste collection segment is water based with regards to resource recovery it is advised that solid and liquid waste be completely separated to avoid cross contamination 13 15 alternate forms of urine collection are described by randall and naidoo 3 waterless urinals offer a simple solution for water conservation and urine collection however widespread access to urinals is primarily available to males this is due to the lack of sophistication regarding current female urinal models female urinals require more privacy than male urinals and also require users to adopt changes in their bathroom routines 16 in addition spontaneous precipitation caused by urine tends to occur in the sewage pipes connected to conventional waterless urinals these solid precipitates are known to cause blockages by excessive pipe scaling 17 however this scale is rich in phosphorus and other nutrients and could potentially be used as a fertilizer instead if urine is not allowed to enter drainage pipes 18 considering the resource recovery potential from the precipitated solids in urinal pipes a nutrient recovery urinal nru was constructed and tested at the university of cape town uct 19 in south africa urine was collected with the intention of maximum nutrient recovery a removable fertilizer producing urinal like this would mean no plumbing system would have to be retrofitted in addition these urinals are waterless thus saving on significant amounts of water 9 several methods of treating the collected urine have previously been reported such as struvite precipitation 1 20 ammonia stripping 21 22 nitrification 23 24 ion exchange 25 26 freeze concentration 27 28 and evaporation 29 30 however we focused on nutrient recovery from urine by alkaline stabilization and precipitation followed by volume reduction by reverse osmosis ro in this study using the nru alkaline stabilization is facilitated in each container by calcium hydroxide dosing and prevents the loss of nitrogen through ammonia volatilisation 31 the high operating ph 12 5 is expected to also help degrade pharmaceuticals but this should be investigated in future research the primary goal of this research was therefore to investigate the feasibility of a decentralized urine collection system using the novel nrus within the city of cape town this was evaluated by determining the effects of transportation and logistics of source separated urine in addition an evaluation of the monetary and environmental implications of this decentralized urine collection and treatment system in comparison to conventional wastewater treatment was also investigated 2 methodology 2 1 decentralized system description in the proposed decentralized urine collection and treatment system conventional water based urinals at shopping centres are retrofitted to become standalone nrus with a 25 l capacity storage tank attached to each urinal unit shopping centres were selected as the most desirable urine collection locations for this investigation as they are highly frequented and it is assumed that urinals already exist in the male restrooms female oriented urinals are not at a high enough level of sophistication for widespread public usage and furthermore the nru produced by flanagan and randall 19 was designed for male usage potential urine contributions by female users were therefore not considered for this research however wilsenach and van loosdrecht 32 and ekama wilsenach 33 indicate that separating between 50 and 90 of urine from wastewater streams could potentially remove the need for bnr at conventional wwtps therefore assuming that approximately 50 of the population males participated in this system could still have significant impacts on the monetary cost energy expenditure and ghg emissions of conventional wwtps it was assumed that the filled urinal containers were collected from each collection location once per week by truck and transported to a resource recovery facility rrf once at the rrf solid filtration of the collected urine occurs to separate the precipitated calcium phosphate ca p from the remaining liquid in solution the solid filtration is done not only to recover the ca p solid fertilizer but also to avoid clogging of the ro membranes the separated ca p is dried and the filtered liquid is concentrated by ro while also producing water 34 this concentrated liquid has a high nitrogen content and is classified as an inorganic liquid fertilizer finally the concentrated liquid and dried ca p is transported to a central packaging and distribution pad facility where it is sold to wholesalers as fertilizers the pad could be at the same location as the rrf a visual description of this system is shown in fig 1 2 2 study area and collection location description the city of cape town is a coastal city located near the southern most part of south africa the initial modelling step for this work involved identifying locations to be used as urine collection points a total of eight collection locations were used seven shopping malls and one university a map displaying the positions of the collection locations within the study area is shown in fig 2 2 3 design scenarios the proposed system was assessed based on four separate design scenarios each scenario incorporated either on site or off site solid filtration or a combination of the two followed by ro treatment each successive scenario featured an increase in the number of treatment facilities whereas only one central pad facility was utilized for all four scenarios the treated fertilizer was assumed to be packaged and transported to a wholesaler from the pad facility in each scenario the same quantity of urine was collected and treated in each scenario the more rrfs added the closer these facilities moved towards the collection locations based on optimized placement until an rrf was allocated to each location in the final scenario there were eight treatment facilities and this was likened to having the urine treated on site in each scenario urine collection containers from each location were collected once per week and replaced with an empty collection container with an appropriate amount of calcium hydroxide powder inside in scenario one there was only one rrf this central treatment facility also acted as the pad facility as both facilities were in the most central location with respect to the collection locations based on average distance in scenarios two three and four two four and eight rrfs were incorporated respectively the purpose of these scenarios was to determine the ideal level of decentralization required to minimize the ghg emissions energy and cost amongst the chosen design scenarios a summary of the chosen design scenarios is shown in table 1 2 4 resource recovery facility location optimization and vehicle routing with the coordinates of each collection location known the optimal location of the rrf and pad facilities were calculated using geospatial analysis the optimal transportation routes were modelled by solving the travelling salesman problem tsp the tsp considers the shortest possible route that is required to be taken to reach all locations within a network 35 the tsp was thus applied to the cape town road network it was assumed that in each scenario trips originated and ended at the pad facility this allowed for a detailed analysis on the financial and environmental effects of transportation on the proposed system a 4 ton truck was chosen as the form of transportation there were many limiting factors pertaining to the performance of the truck therefore several assumptions were incorporated during the logistics and transportation modelling of the proposed system the assumptions used to model these results are given in the supplementary information 2 5 economic and environmental analysis in the economic and environmental analysis the results obtained by flanagan and randall 19 and an estimation of the product produced from an ro and filtration process were scaled up to match the results from the transportation and logistics analysis the design calculations and assumptions are further expanded in detail in the supplementary information the economic and environmental viability of the proposed decentralized system was assessed based on the following indicators capital expenditure capex operating expenditure opex cost recovery of liquid and solid fertilizers net present cost npc net present value npv over an investment period of five years at a 10 discount rate water usage and conservation ghg emissions 2 5 1 capex estimations the components which contributed to the capex of each system were the provision of nrus by retrofitting existing urinal installations the trucks assumed to be purchased once off rental deposits for warehouse space and the ro units required for volume reduction the monetary scaling of ro units was assumed to be linear in relation to the quantity of urine treated moreover units of exact sizes for each scenario were assumed the nrus do not utilize any of the sewer connections within each building thus retrofitting costs pertaining to existing piping networks were not considered for the financial feasibility of this study but should be considered before actual implementation of such systems in the future 2 5 2 opex estimations the components identified as contributors to the opex of the system included labour energy requirements cost of calcium hydroxide for urine stabilization and rental expenses for treatment facilities and the packaging and distribution centres the operating and maintenance costs associated with a modified ludzack ettinger activated sludge mle as wastewater treatment plant was compared to that of the proposed decentralized system for direct reference with centralized bnr 2 5 3 cost recovery of liquid and solid fertilizers the selling price of calcium phosphate fertilizer was assumed from market prices for urine derived granular fertilizers however the selling price of a niche liquid fertilizer was calculated differently ten commercially available liquid based fertilizers were sourced and compared based on their nitrogen content the commercial fertilizers chosen included both fertilizers for ornamental vegetation and vegetation intended for human consumption a least square regression analysis on liquid fertilizer selling prices versus nitrogen content by weight was performed this was done to determine an appropriate selling price for the liquid fertilizer produced in the proposed system the economic evaluation did not include packaging and delivery costs associated with the sale of the finished products 2 5 4 npv npc the net present value or cost of installing and operating the entire system over a period of 5 years was determined to compare the monetary implications for each of the investigated scenarios a 5 year investment period was used to assess each scenario over a long term investment period a discount rate of 10 was used for this evaluation 2 5 5 greenhouse gas emissions greenhouse gas emissions were based on carbon dioxide co2 production from the electricity requirement for ro and fuel consumption of the trucks the co2 emissions were directly compared to those emitted by an mle as configuration for bnr at a conventional wastewater treatment plant 2 5 6 water savings the proposed system does not utilize a water based flushing system the potential impacts observed from converting to a waterless system were thus investigated this included an estimation of the quantity of water saved per annum as well as the water and sanitation and sewer system connection costs that would be applicable as per the city of cape town tariffs 36 in 2017 the city of cape town experienced a drought resulting from a water shortage 37 as a result the water tariffs imposed between then and the time of compiling this research have been inconsistent the tariffs used in the economic evaluation in this study represent the water sanitation and sewer connection tariffs for commercial use on 1 december 2018 36 2 5 7 sensitivity analysis potential variations in the factors which contribute to cost recovery and expenditure were considered this was done to determine which aspects contributed the most to the financial feasibility of the proposed system and how any potential negative effects could be alleviated the impacts experienced from varying the following aspects of each scenario were evaluated carrying capacity of the truck selling price of the liquid fertilizer product quantity of fertilizer sold 3 results discussion 3 1 transportation network and last mile logistics assessment the location of the optimized rrfs as well as the rrf allocated to each collection location are shown in fig 3 scenarios one and two incorporated fully off site urine treatment scenario three included a combination of off site and on site treatment and scenario four only incorporated on site treatment in scenarios where on site treatment was employed the truck was tasked with collecting the treated product and not the stabilized urine the priority when allocating the location for each of these rrfs was to minimize the overall distance from the collection locations to the rrfs while assuming spatial rationality each location is allocated to its nearest rrf in addition all scenarios were independent of one another for example the inclusion of two rrfs in scenario two did not consider the location of the one rrf used in scenario one each scenario essentially represented a hypothetical greenfield investigation flanagan and randall 19 found that approximately 11 g of solid calcium phosphate ca p can be recovered as a result of precipitation when 10 g of calcium hydroxide was added per litre of urine this ca p can be used as a fertilizer 38 furthermore it was estimated that if the volume of the remaining urine supernatant after ca p had precipitated were reduced by ro a liquid nitrogen based fertilizer with a 3 3 0 0 8 npk rating could potentially be retrieved since all the nitrogen would remain in solution as a result of the treatment process the existing water based urinals at each location were theoretically retrofitted to be nrus 19 so the quantity of ca p produced per kg of urine was scaled up in proportion to the quantity of collected urine these characteristics were required for the tsp route optimization the chosen transportation method envisioned for this simulation a 4 ton truck was weight restricted therefore the quantity and weight of stabilized urine required for collection at each collection location was a key aspect to consider these characteristics are shown in table 2 for the scaled up scenario it was found that 85 kg ca p could potentially be produced per week the results of the tsp on the cape town road network are displayed in fig 4 moreover the travel distances for each scenario are shown in table 4 each trip was modelled to start and end at the pad facility for each design scenario a 4 ton truck travelling at an average speed of 60 km hr 1 was employed in each of the four scenarios the travel time quoted in table 3 refers to the time that the truck spends on the road only however a loading time of 15 minutes per stop was assumed when calculating the truck driver wage in the economic feasibility calculations the positions of the rrfs were optimized for minimum average distance to shorten the total travelling distance in theory this is ideal as it decreases the total travel distance from the collection location to the rrfs when spatial rationality is assumed in reality the locations of these optimized sites may not have space provisions for the warehouses and treatment facilities envisioned actual optimization of realistic sites would require industrial real estate data and site specific trends however as this study deals with a hypothetical scenario this form of analysis was not conducted a single 4 ton truck was used to model the collection logistics for each scenario as seen in table 2 a maximum of roughly 7 5 m3 of urine was produced per week for the entire study area a 4 ton truck typically has a 20 m3 carrying capacity therefore urine volume constraints would not apply for transportation however the maximum quantity of urine produced is heavier than what was capable of being carried in one trip at 7 7 tons due to the chosen transportation mode being weight restricted the travel routes were required to be optimized to cater to the truck s capabilities one round trip was therefore not possible for the first and second design scenarios this was because the truck could not carry all the urine allocated to each respective rrf without offloading the additional weight because of the collected urinal containers in scenarios one and two at least one rrf was required to be visited more than once as displayed in fig 4 this subsequently increased the overall travel distance and travel time conversely if the carrying capacity were increased by using an 8 ton truck a 32 km and 1 km decrease was obtained in scenarios one and two respectively however the fuel consumption of an 8 ton truck at 3 33 km l 1 is double that of a 4 ton truck at approximately 6 66 km l 1 39 this increase in fuel consumption would roughly translate to a 10 l and a 16 l fuel consumption increase for scenarios one and two as well as a 25 kg co2 and 43 kg co2 increase in ghg emissions for scenarios one and two this is despite the 8 ton truck having a shorter travel distance in both scenarios likewise any increase in truck carrying capacity from 8 tons would have an increased negative effect for the same reasons when using a 4 ton truck scenarios three and four did not have problems pertaining to weight restrictions this was due to the increase in rrfs which offer increased opportunity to offload urine containers following collection this indicates that for more than two rrfs no benefit can be found from increasing the carrying capacity of the truck interestingly the travel distances for the 8 ton truck and the 4 ton truck increased and decreased respectively when increasing the number of rrfs from one to two this is because an 8 ton truck did not have weight restrictions in the case of one rrf but the total number of stops increased when two rrfs were employed this changed the required travelling routes and increased the travelling distance conversely the 4 ton truck experienced a decrease in weight restriction upon increasing the number of rrfs moreover the 4 ton truck experienced the same route changes as the 8 ton truck and a decrease in travel distance the difference in the travel distance between successive design scenarios decreased as the degree of decentralization increased the reasoning for this is the fact that the same quantity of urine is being transported in each scenario and weight restrictions only applied to scenarios one and two moreover although the number of rrfs increased the number of collection locations remained the same an increase in the number of collection locations would increase the required travel distance as new routes and increased weight restrictions would apply as economic environmental and time considerations are directly linked to travel distance an increase in collection locations would require a revision of the mode of transport as well 3 2 economic and environmental assessment the four design scenarios were evaluated based on their respective implementation costs the capital expenditure capex operating expenditure opex projected fertilizer sales recovered costs and net present value cost npv npc were taken into considerations the initial financial evaluations were done incorporating the use of a 4 ton truck this assessment was conducted under the assumption that the full potential of the proposed system is realised and all the produced fertilizer product is sold creating a source of income for each design scenario the same quantity of urine was treated to produce solid and liquid fertilizers a summary of the potential products retrieved from the proposed system from one year of operation is shown in fig 5 3 2 1 capex the parameters used to determine the initial capex of the project were the purchasing of nrus the deposit required for rental space the ro unit s required and the truck costs the capex for scenarios one two three and four were found to be 62 400 64 400 68 000 and 76 200 respectively it was apparent that the higher the degree of decentralization the higher the capital cost this increase was caused primarily by the increase in rental space required when the number of rrfs increased 3 2 2 opex operating costs for scenarios one two three and four were found to be 111 000 153 000 194 000 and 257 000 per year respectively a break down of these costs is displayed in fig 6 human labour rent and electricity were found to be the most significant components of the operating costs and increased as the number of rrfs increased the bnr operating and maintenance values included in fig 6 incorporated all labour electricity and processing expenses of an mle as system 40 moreover the bnr opex represents the equivalent amount of wastewater that would be treated in an mle as system if the collected urine in this study was diverted from entering the conventional sewage system the cost of the water that would be used per flush equivalent to the quantity of urine collected in the proposed system was considered when calculating the total cost of bnr at wwtps likewise the cost of the sewer connections equivalent to the urine collected by the system was also considered switching to a waterless urinal system would presumably lead to a decrease in flushes and further promote water conservation if any one of the design scenarios were to be implemented approximately 6840 m3 of water could be preserved per year equating to roughly 20 400 and 17 400 worth of water and sewer connection expenses respectively additionally 313 m3 of permeate water would be produced per year from urine treatment with ro literature indicates that ro treated wastewater 41 and urine 42 have applications in potable water production otherwise this recovered water could also potentially find use in other industries considering the recent water shortage in the city of cape town sustainable infrastructure that has applications in water conservation could aid in mitigating the effects of future water shortages for cost recovery it was assumed that the solid and liquid fertilizer produced in this system could enter the south african fertilizer market and be sold at prices which are competitive with established commercial fertilizers in this case the selling prices of the solid and liquid fertilizers would be 1 28 kg and 10 5 l from the proposed system it was estimated that a liquid fertilizer of 3 3 nitrogen by weight could potentially be produced from this combined treatment process approximately 78 4 m3 of liquid fertilizer and 4420 kg of ca p could potentially be retrieved by decentralizing urine treatment total fertilizer sales were found to be approximately 828 100 per year when considering the overall opex it was found that the potential net income of the system if all fertilizer is sold at the original design selling prices would be approximately 715 200 per year 3 2 3 greenhouse gas emissions and energy expenditure the ghg emissions of the proposed decentralized system were calculated based on carbon dioxide emissions the ghg emissions for scenarios one two three and four were found to be 3 381 kg co2 year 1 3 028 kg co2 year 1 2 900 kg co2 year 1 and 2 696 kg co2 year 1 the truck fuel emissions were the main contributor to ghg emissions in the decentralized system therefore as the number of rrfs increased causing a decrease in the travelling distance the carbon emissions of the system also decreased the ghg emissions of a conventional mle as system was found to be 9 846 kg co2 year 1 considering urine contributes approximately 80 of the total nitrogen in wastewater 8 the mass of carbon emissions per mass of nitrogen removed in an mle as system was used as a direct comparison to the proposed system additionally it was found that bnr energy expenditure for an equivalent mass of nitrogen in wastewater would be approximately 7548 kw h year 1 this represented an almost tenfold increase when compared to the 784 kw h year 1 energy expenditure for ro operation in the proposed decentralized system 3 2 4 net present value cost the npv of the system considering maximum fertilizer sales was evaluated over a 5 year investment period at an interest rate of 10 the comparison of the npv for each scenario is illustrated in fig 7 a positive net present value is realized for each scenario at maximum sales with scenario one exhibiting the highest npv of 2 65 million over a 5 year period scenario four exhibits the worst with an npv of 2 1 million for the same period the selling price of the recovered fertilizer product used in this research contributed significantly to the positive net present value achieved in the initial calculations the effect of varying this selling price was investigated more specifically the selling price that resulted in a net present value of zero was calculated this price was referred to as the break even selling price and is displayed in table 4 for each design scenario it was found that even if the liquid fertilizer selling price were decreased by up to 85 from 10 5 l to 1 57 l the proposed system was still capable of breaking even over an investment period of 5 years if one rrf was installed in the study area in the initial model calculations the ca p fertilizer accounted for just under 1 of the total income furthermore granular phosphorous based fertilizers derived from human urine have already been shown to be effective fertilizers 38 the ability of the recovered ca p to enter the south african fertilizer market at competitive prices was not questioned for this sensitivity analysis but should be considered for during actual implementation of such systems it was found that for scenarios one two three and four 15 20 25 and 33 of the liquid fertilizer would need to be sold to reach a break even point at the chosen design selling price approximate sales figures for liquid fertilizers were sourced from five local plant nurseries in cape town this was done to get an approximate estimate of the average quantity of liquid fertilizers sold per week it was found that roughly two litres of a popular liquid fertilizer brand are sold every week by these nurseries these approximate weekly sales values were applied to all the nurseries within cape town and evaluated over a five year investment period to determine how the npv was affected the abovementioned parameters represent the sale of approximately 10 of the fertilizer produced from the collected urine moreover it was found that at the design selling price a negative net present value was realised for all scenarios however if only this fraction of fertilizer is sold the remaining 90 of liquid fertilizer would only need to be sold at a bulk value as low as 0 67 l over five years to reach a break even point if one rrf is installed trucks with higher carrying capacities would directly increase the capex in each scenario an approximately 11 000 increase and a 30 500 increase would be observed if an 8 ton truck or a 14 ton truck were utilized respectively 43 likewise the operating costs of increasing the carrying capacity of the truck were higher for scenario one a 4 ton truck and an 8 ton truck would have a similar operating cost due to the larger distance travelled by the 4 ton truck as the required travelling distance between the two trucks types converges the 4 ton truck becomes the least expensive option a shorter travel distance was observed as the level of decentralization increased as expected this subsequently resulted in a decrease in co2 emissions from the truck despite this increasing the level of decentralization led to an increase in both capex and opex the differences in operating costs arose mainly due to an increase in the amount of rrfs which led to an increase in rental costs and operating personnel an argument could be made that rental costs would not have a significant contribution in the case of on site treatment provided that collection locations have pre existing and vacant floor space in this situation discounted rental rates could be negotiated in exchange for provision of recovered fertilizer if such a demand is applicable for example the urine produced by uct alone would be capable of providing approximately 48 of the nitrogen requirements for its rugby fields on the main campus per year however such detailed knowledge of each specific collection location is difficult to estimate it was found that transporting source separated urine in a 4 ton truck from highly frequented locations offers an appealing method of facilitating decentralization of urine treatment moreover from a financial perspective it was deduced that scenario one the implementation of one rrf was the best design scenario the plant nursery market was interrogated as a means for distribution because it was assumed that this is where the most appropriate sale opportunities would exist however it would be naïve to assume that urine derived liquid fertilizers would be capable of seamlessly entering the fertilizer market and competing with established commercially available fertilizers moreover if the recovered fertilizer were capable of being sold at competitive prices the sale quantities could be low due to several factors such as seasonal demand any decrease in sales would subsequently cause an increase in the break even selling price required if the realistic sales quantities are estimated to be 10 of the total liquid fertilizer produced the cost of production per litre of liquid fertilizer sold would be 38 higher than the initial design selling price from a financial perspective scaling down fertilizer production to a point where a profit is made may be advisable however alternate markets could be explored for maximum product distribution such as vineyards located nearby cape town south africa produces the seventh largest amount of wine globally according to the international organization of vine and wine oiv and has multiple geographic wine regions 44 the stellenbosch wine region which cape town is situated within constitutes roughly 16 of the total vineyard surface area in south africa according to the south african wine industry sawis 45 the total quantity of fertilizer produced from the proposed system per year 78 m3 of liquid fertilizer and 4420 kgs of ca p could provide approximately 0 3 0 01 and 0 2 of the nitrogen phosphorous and potassium required for the entire stellenbosch region per year importantly this is considering the potential contribution from only eight urine collection locations in cape town vineyards within and surrounding cape town thus offer potential for an alternative market to promote this liquid fertilizer as a bulk product the stellenbosch wine region annual npk fertilizer demands were calculated based on the vineyard nutrient requirements outlined by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations faoun 46 detailed calculations for the proposed system can be found in the supplementary information to assess the full potential of the proposed system the total amount of liquid and solid fertilizer that could be produced per year if all cape town residents used the nru was evaluated it was found that if all cape town residents women included urinated in an nru just once per week for one year approximately 46 2 and 28 of the stellenbosch wine region s annual nitrogen phosphorous and potassium requirements could be recovered as fertilizers this is shown in fig 8 the prospect of supplying recovered fertilizers to vineyards is helped by the fact that urine derived liquid fertilizers manufactured by urine nitrification and distillation are already available and being successfully used to fertilize vineyards in france 47 48 the proposed decentralized system and conventional bnr exhibited a similar operating cost per annum for the incorporation of one rrf as seen in fig 6 however lower ghg emissions and energy expenditure were observed when comparing any of the chosen design scenarios to wwtps furthermore research indicates that urine source separation can increase the life span of wwtps and treatment capacities by decreasing the influent nutrient load and the hydraulic load experienced 32 to put this research into perspective the effect that decentralized urine treatment would have on centralized wwtps was estimated considering the average nutrient compositions in urine and that urine constitutes approximately 80 of the nitrogen in wastewater streams 8 the total nitrogen in the influent at a wwtp is approximately 84 mg n l 1 an mle as configuration is capable of producing effluent quality with 10 mg n l 1 total nitrogen 40 by removing urine from wastewater streams approximately 17 mg n l 1 total nitrogen would enter wwtps decreased total nitrogen influent concentrations and a decrease in hydraulic load due to water conservation initiatives would presumably have a significant effect on conventional bnr and wwt in addition wilsenach and van loosdrecht 32 found that wwtps could become net energy producers if urine separation is implemented 4 conclusions human urine is a valuable resource with potential to produce many useful products the goal of this research was to investigate the recovery of resources from human urine within a densely populated modern city such as the city of cape town in south africa this work has shown that the collection of source separated urine for the purposes of resource recovery holds significant potential from a monetary and an environmental perspective it was shown that if urine was collected from shopping malls in cape town and treated using a combination of alkaline stabilization and volume reduction approximately 78 m3 of liquid fertilizer with a 3 3 0 0 8 npk rating could be produced per week in addition 4420 kg of solid ca p could be produced per week the liquid fertilizer produced would only need to be sold at 1 57 l to equate the total system expenditure to the total income over a five year period conversely it was found that there was only a market for about 10 of the recovered liquid fertilizer which could be sold as a niche fertilizer 10 5 l however in this scenario the remaining 90 of liquid fertilizer would only need to be sold at a bulk value of 0 67 l over a five year period to breakeven the combination of transportation planning and waste management could play an important role in future studies aiming to improve decentralized sanitation systems it is hoped that further research will be undertaken to improve niche methods of resource recovery and continue to work towards achieving the united nations sustainable development goals declaration of competing interest we do not have a conflict of interest with regards to our paper

information to this article 
13847,the aim of this work was to design a decentralized system for urine collection and fertilizer production within the city of cape town evaluating the effects of transportation logistics of source separated urine collection and treatment formed the main modelling portion of this objective it was determined that the decentralized approach to urine treatment exhibited several advantages over biological nutrient removal bnr at conventional wastewater treatment plants these advantages included lower greenhouse gas emissions and energy expenditure for a similar operating cost it was found that a positive net present value was achieved if the recovered fertilizer was sold at prices comparable to commercially available liquid fertilizers with similar nitrogen content moreover it was shown that if urine was collected from shopping malls in cape town the liquid fertilizer produced would only need to be sold at 1 57 l to breakeven over a five year period conversely it was found that there was only a market for about 10 of the recovered liquid fertilizer which could be sold as a niche fertilizer 10 5 l but the remaining 90 of recovered liquid fertilizer would only need to be sold at a bulk value of 0 67 l over a five year period to breakeven keywords fertilizer geospatial analysis last mile logistics phosphorus reverse osmosis 1 introduction it is estimated that the total phosphorus that could be recovered from urine is roughly 22 of the current global phosphorus demand 1 however the current philosophy pertaining to urine is typically centred around treatment and disposal as opposed to recovery and reuse 2 this becomes significant especially considering the value of urine 3 a shift in infrastructure and philosophy could see urine being treated separately rather than it being treated at wastewater treatment plants furthermore this could allow for recycling of source separated urine through decentralized treatment systems 3 decentralization of urine treatment is not a novel concept research has shown that decentralizing the treatment of urine offers lower greenhouse gas ghg emissions energy expenditure and operating costs in comparison to centralized wastewater treatment of equal quantities of urine 4 5 in addition the treatment of urine to recover nutrients potentially holds many financial benefits if sold commercially 6 7 furthermore a decrease in the influent nutrient load at wastewater treatment facilities could potentially allow for monetary savings regarding biological nutrient removal bnr 8 a shift in treatment philosophy that results in urine recycling rather than disposal can also save water 9 this is especially relevant in drought prone areas many benefits can potentially be achieved by decentralized urine treatment but barriers do exist barriers include the transportation logistics of urine from where it originates the economic feasibility of implementing decentralized treatment and the selection of appropriate urine treatment technologies urine is predominately water thus bulk transportation is limited by weight and volume to model a methodology for the logistics of a decentralized system it is useful to liken urine as being part of a supply chain distribution of goods from the location of production to retail outlets plays a pivotal role in any economic supply chain this phenomenon is referred to as last mile logistics and plays a complimentary role alongside transportation planning 10 however this requires geospatial analysis to accurately depict the characteristics of the infrastructure within any given study area geospatial analysis is a form of analytics that incorporates known geographical information to help in understanding patterns in human behaviour 10 this form of analysis finds significant applications for mobility and is typically done using databases known as geographic information systems gis 10 gis has previously been used to model last mile delivery and optimize supply chains for sustainability related research these studies incorporate upcycling of resources whereby waste products are transported from demand sources to recycling facilities hendrickson kavvada 11 used spatial analysis to model the last mile logistics of recycling batteries from electric vehicles similarly jenkins parker 12 used geospatial planning to analyse the supply chain potential and optimum location for biofuel production facilities research regarding the logistics of decentralized urine collection systems are limited but have been previously explored in a study conducted by kavvada tarpeh 6 the planning of transportation methods for nitrogen recovered from source separated urine from households was investigated geospatial and last mile logistics modelling was considered for a hypothetical system implemented in the city of san francisco united states of america it was determined that decentralizing urine treatment was desirable as it offered a lower operating cost lower unit energy expenditure and lower ghg emissions when compared to centralized wastewater management 6 it also displayed the potential to earn a profit but this was only the case when the potential sale of the nitrogen fertilizers produced was taken into consideration if the collection of source separated urine is considered for implementation different methods of urine collection are required there are typically two forms of no mix toilets urine diverting toilets udts and urine diverting dry toilets uddts 13 similar to conventional household toilets both consist of a pedestal and a cistern there are two compartments in these toilets one for urine collection and one for solid waste collection urine diverting dry toilets are completely waterless and can be used to collect solid waste and urine for composting and alternate forms of nutrient recovery 14 however the urine collection segment in udts are waterless while the waste collection segment is water based with regards to resource recovery it is advised that solid and liquid waste be completely separated to avoid cross contamination 13 15 alternate forms of urine collection are described by randall and naidoo 3 waterless urinals offer a simple solution for water conservation and urine collection however widespread access to urinals is primarily available to males this is due to the lack of sophistication regarding current female urinal models female urinals require more privacy than male urinals and also require users to adopt changes in their bathroom routines 16 in addition spontaneous precipitation caused by urine tends to occur in the sewage pipes connected to conventional waterless urinals these solid precipitates are known to cause blockages by excessive pipe scaling 17 however this scale is rich in phosphorus and other nutrients and could potentially be used as a fertilizer instead if urine is not allowed to enter drainage pipes 18 considering the resource recovery potential from the precipitated solids in urinal pipes a nutrient recovery urinal nru was constructed and tested at the university of cape town uct 19 in south africa urine was collected with the intention of maximum nutrient recovery a removable fertilizer producing urinal like this would mean no plumbing system would have to be retrofitted in addition these urinals are waterless thus saving on significant amounts of water 9 several methods of treating the collected urine have previously been reported such as struvite precipitation 1 20 ammonia stripping 21 22 nitrification 23 24 ion exchange 25 26 freeze concentration 27 28 and evaporation 29 30 however we focused on nutrient recovery from urine by alkaline stabilization and precipitation followed by volume reduction by reverse osmosis ro in this study using the nru alkaline stabilization is facilitated in each container by calcium hydroxide dosing and prevents the loss of nitrogen through ammonia volatilisation 31 the high operating ph 12 5 is expected to also help degrade pharmaceuticals but this should be investigated in future research the primary goal of this research was therefore to investigate the feasibility of a decentralized urine collection system using the novel nrus within the city of cape town this was evaluated by determining the effects of transportation and logistics of source separated urine in addition an evaluation of the monetary and environmental implications of this decentralized urine collection and treatment system in comparison to conventional wastewater treatment was also investigated 2 methodology 2 1 decentralized system description in the proposed decentralized urine collection and treatment system conventional water based urinals at shopping centres are retrofitted to become standalone nrus with a 25 l capacity storage tank attached to each urinal unit shopping centres were selected as the most desirable urine collection locations for this investigation as they are highly frequented and it is assumed that urinals already exist in the male restrooms female oriented urinals are not at a high enough level of sophistication for widespread public usage and furthermore the nru produced by flanagan and randall 19 was designed for male usage potential urine contributions by female users were therefore not considered for this research however wilsenach and van loosdrecht 32 and ekama wilsenach 33 indicate that separating between 50 and 90 of urine from wastewater streams could potentially remove the need for bnr at conventional wwtps therefore assuming that approximately 50 of the population males participated in this system could still have significant impacts on the monetary cost energy expenditure and ghg emissions of conventional wwtps it was assumed that the filled urinal containers were collected from each collection location once per week by truck and transported to a resource recovery facility rrf once at the rrf solid filtration of the collected urine occurs to separate the precipitated calcium phosphate ca p from the remaining liquid in solution the solid filtration is done not only to recover the ca p solid fertilizer but also to avoid clogging of the ro membranes the separated ca p is dried and the filtered liquid is concentrated by ro while also producing water 34 this concentrated liquid has a high nitrogen content and is classified as an inorganic liquid fertilizer finally the concentrated liquid and dried ca p is transported to a central packaging and distribution pad facility where it is sold to wholesalers as fertilizers the pad could be at the same location as the rrf a visual description of this system is shown in fig 1 2 2 study area and collection location description the city of cape town is a coastal city located near the southern most part of south africa the initial modelling step for this work involved identifying locations to be used as urine collection points a total of eight collection locations were used seven shopping malls and one university a map displaying the positions of the collection locations within the study area is shown in fig 2 2 3 design scenarios the proposed system was assessed based on four separate design scenarios each scenario incorporated either on site or off site solid filtration or a combination of the two followed by ro treatment each successive scenario featured an increase in the number of treatment facilities whereas only one central pad facility was utilized for all four scenarios the treated fertilizer was assumed to be packaged and transported to a wholesaler from the pad facility in each scenario the same quantity of urine was collected and treated in each scenario the more rrfs added the closer these facilities moved towards the collection locations based on optimized placement until an rrf was allocated to each location in the final scenario there were eight treatment facilities and this was likened to having the urine treated on site in each scenario urine collection containers from each location were collected once per week and replaced with an empty collection container with an appropriate amount of calcium hydroxide powder inside in scenario one there was only one rrf this central treatment facility also acted as the pad facility as both facilities were in the most central location with respect to the collection locations based on average distance in scenarios two three and four two four and eight rrfs were incorporated respectively the purpose of these scenarios was to determine the ideal level of decentralization required to minimize the ghg emissions energy and cost amongst the chosen design scenarios a summary of the chosen design scenarios is shown in table 1 2 4 resource recovery facility location optimization and vehicle routing with the coordinates of each collection location known the optimal location of the rrf and pad facilities were calculated using geospatial analysis the optimal transportation routes were modelled by solving the travelling salesman problem tsp the tsp considers the shortest possible route that is required to be taken to reach all locations within a network 35 the tsp was thus applied to the cape town road network it was assumed that in each scenario trips originated and ended at the pad facility this allowed for a detailed analysis on the financial and environmental effects of transportation on the proposed system a 4 ton truck was chosen as the form of transportation there were many limiting factors pertaining to the performance of the truck therefore several assumptions were incorporated during the logistics and transportation modelling of the proposed system the assumptions used to model these results are given in the supplementary information 2 5 economic and environmental analysis in the economic and environmental analysis the results obtained by flanagan and randall 19 and an estimation of the product produced from an ro and filtration process were scaled up to match the results from the transportation and logistics analysis the design calculations and assumptions are further expanded in detail in the supplementary information the economic and environmental viability of the proposed decentralized system was assessed based on the following indicators capital expenditure capex operating expenditure opex cost recovery of liquid and solid fertilizers net present cost npc net present value npv over an investment period of five years at a 10 discount rate water usage and conservation ghg emissions 2 5 1 capex estimations the components which contributed to the capex of each system were the provision of nrus by retrofitting existing urinal installations the trucks assumed to be purchased once off rental deposits for warehouse space and the ro units required for volume reduction the monetary scaling of ro units was assumed to be linear in relation to the quantity of urine treated moreover units of exact sizes for each scenario were assumed the nrus do not utilize any of the sewer connections within each building thus retrofitting costs pertaining to existing piping networks were not considered for the financial feasibility of this study but should be considered before actual implementation of such systems in the future 2 5 2 opex estimations the components identified as contributors to the opex of the system included labour energy requirements cost of calcium hydroxide for urine stabilization and rental expenses for treatment facilities and the packaging and distribution centres the operating and maintenance costs associated with a modified ludzack ettinger activated sludge mle as wastewater treatment plant was compared to that of the proposed decentralized system for direct reference with centralized bnr 2 5 3 cost recovery of liquid and solid fertilizers the selling price of calcium phosphate fertilizer was assumed from market prices for urine derived granular fertilizers however the selling price of a niche liquid fertilizer was calculated differently ten commercially available liquid based fertilizers were sourced and compared based on their nitrogen content the commercial fertilizers chosen included both fertilizers for ornamental vegetation and vegetation intended for human consumption a least square regression analysis on liquid fertilizer selling prices versus nitrogen content by weight was performed this was done to determine an appropriate selling price for the liquid fertilizer produced in the proposed system the economic evaluation did not include packaging and delivery costs associated with the sale of the finished products 2 5 4 npv npc the net present value or cost of installing and operating the entire system over a period of 5 years was determined to compare the monetary implications for each of the investigated scenarios a 5 year investment period was used to assess each scenario over a long term investment period a discount rate of 10 was used for this evaluation 2 5 5 greenhouse gas emissions greenhouse gas emissions were based on carbon dioxide co2 production from the electricity requirement for ro and fuel consumption of the trucks the co2 emissions were directly compared to those emitted by an mle as configuration for bnr at a conventional wastewater treatment plant 2 5 6 water savings the proposed system does not utilize a water based flushing system the potential impacts observed from converting to a waterless system were thus investigated this included an estimation of the quantity of water saved per annum as well as the water and sanitation and sewer system connection costs that would be applicable as per the city of cape town tariffs 36 in 2017 the city of cape town experienced a drought resulting from a water shortage 37 as a result the water tariffs imposed between then and the time of compiling this research have been inconsistent the tariffs used in the economic evaluation in this study represent the water sanitation and sewer connection tariffs for commercial use on 1 december 2018 36 2 5 7 sensitivity analysis potential variations in the factors which contribute to cost recovery and expenditure were considered this was done to determine which aspects contributed the most to the financial feasibility of the proposed system and how any potential negative effects could be alleviated the impacts experienced from varying the following aspects of each scenario were evaluated carrying capacity of the truck selling price of the liquid fertilizer product quantity of fertilizer sold 3 results discussion 3 1 transportation network and last mile logistics assessment the location of the optimized rrfs as well as the rrf allocated to each collection location are shown in fig 3 scenarios one and two incorporated fully off site urine treatment scenario three included a combination of off site and on site treatment and scenario four only incorporated on site treatment in scenarios where on site treatment was employed the truck was tasked with collecting the treated product and not the stabilized urine the priority when allocating the location for each of these rrfs was to minimize the overall distance from the collection locations to the rrfs while assuming spatial rationality each location is allocated to its nearest rrf in addition all scenarios were independent of one another for example the inclusion of two rrfs in scenario two did not consider the location of the one rrf used in scenario one each scenario essentially represented a hypothetical greenfield investigation flanagan and randall 19 found that approximately 11 g of solid calcium phosphate ca p can be recovered as a result of precipitation when 10 g of calcium hydroxide was added per litre of urine this ca p can be used as a fertilizer 38 furthermore it was estimated that if the volume of the remaining urine supernatant after ca p had precipitated were reduced by ro a liquid nitrogen based fertilizer with a 3 3 0 0 8 npk rating could potentially be retrieved since all the nitrogen would remain in solution as a result of the treatment process the existing water based urinals at each location were theoretically retrofitted to be nrus 19 so the quantity of ca p produced per kg of urine was scaled up in proportion to the quantity of collected urine these characteristics were required for the tsp route optimization the chosen transportation method envisioned for this simulation a 4 ton truck was weight restricted therefore the quantity and weight of stabilized urine required for collection at each collection location was a key aspect to consider these characteristics are shown in table 2 for the scaled up scenario it was found that 85 kg ca p could potentially be produced per week the results of the tsp on the cape town road network are displayed in fig 4 moreover the travel distances for each scenario are shown in table 4 each trip was modelled to start and end at the pad facility for each design scenario a 4 ton truck travelling at an average speed of 60 km hr 1 was employed in each of the four scenarios the travel time quoted in table 3 refers to the time that the truck spends on the road only however a loading time of 15 minutes per stop was assumed when calculating the truck driver wage in the economic feasibility calculations the positions of the rrfs were optimized for minimum average distance to shorten the total travelling distance in theory this is ideal as it decreases the total travel distance from the collection location to the rrfs when spatial rationality is assumed in reality the locations of these optimized sites may not have space provisions for the warehouses and treatment facilities envisioned actual optimization of realistic sites would require industrial real estate data and site specific trends however as this study deals with a hypothetical scenario this form of analysis was not conducted a single 4 ton truck was used to model the collection logistics for each scenario as seen in table 2 a maximum of roughly 7 5 m3 of urine was produced per week for the entire study area a 4 ton truck typically has a 20 m3 carrying capacity therefore urine volume constraints would not apply for transportation however the maximum quantity of urine produced is heavier than what was capable of being carried in one trip at 7 7 tons due to the chosen transportation mode being weight restricted the travel routes were required to be optimized to cater to the truck s capabilities one round trip was therefore not possible for the first and second design scenarios this was because the truck could not carry all the urine allocated to each respective rrf without offloading the additional weight because of the collected urinal containers in scenarios one and two at least one rrf was required to be visited more than once as displayed in fig 4 this subsequently increased the overall travel distance and travel time conversely if the carrying capacity were increased by using an 8 ton truck a 32 km and 1 km decrease was obtained in scenarios one and two respectively however the fuel consumption of an 8 ton truck at 3 33 km l 1 is double that of a 4 ton truck at approximately 6 66 km l 1 39 this increase in fuel consumption would roughly translate to a 10 l and a 16 l fuel consumption increase for scenarios one and two as well as a 25 kg co2 and 43 kg co2 increase in ghg emissions for scenarios one and two this is despite the 8 ton truck having a shorter travel distance in both scenarios likewise any increase in truck carrying capacity from 8 tons would have an increased negative effect for the same reasons when using a 4 ton truck scenarios three and four did not have problems pertaining to weight restrictions this was due to the increase in rrfs which offer increased opportunity to offload urine containers following collection this indicates that for more than two rrfs no benefit can be found from increasing the carrying capacity of the truck interestingly the travel distances for the 8 ton truck and the 4 ton truck increased and decreased respectively when increasing the number of rrfs from one to two this is because an 8 ton truck did not have weight restrictions in the case of one rrf but the total number of stops increased when two rrfs were employed this changed the required travelling routes and increased the travelling distance conversely the 4 ton truck experienced a decrease in weight restriction upon increasing the number of rrfs moreover the 4 ton truck experienced the same route changes as the 8 ton truck and a decrease in travel distance the difference in the travel distance between successive design scenarios decreased as the degree of decentralization increased the reasoning for this is the fact that the same quantity of urine is being transported in each scenario and weight restrictions only applied to scenarios one and two moreover although the number of rrfs increased the number of collection locations remained the same an increase in the number of collection locations would increase the required travel distance as new routes and increased weight restrictions would apply as economic environmental and time considerations are directly linked to travel distance an increase in collection locations would require a revision of the mode of transport as well 3 2 economic and environmental assessment the four design scenarios were evaluated based on their respective implementation costs the capital expenditure capex operating expenditure opex projected fertilizer sales recovered costs and net present value cost npv npc were taken into considerations the initial financial evaluations were done incorporating the use of a 4 ton truck this assessment was conducted under the assumption that the full potential of the proposed system is realised and all the produced fertilizer product is sold creating a source of income for each design scenario the same quantity of urine was treated to produce solid and liquid fertilizers a summary of the potential products retrieved from the proposed system from one year of operation is shown in fig 5 3 2 1 capex the parameters used to determine the initial capex of the project were the purchasing of nrus the deposit required for rental space the ro unit s required and the truck costs the capex for scenarios one two three and four were found to be 62 400 64 400 68 000 and 76 200 respectively it was apparent that the higher the degree of decentralization the higher the capital cost this increase was caused primarily by the increase in rental space required when the number of rrfs increased 3 2 2 opex operating costs for scenarios one two three and four were found to be 111 000 153 000 194 000 and 257 000 per year respectively a break down of these costs is displayed in fig 6 human labour rent and electricity were found to be the most significant components of the operating costs and increased as the number of rrfs increased the bnr operating and maintenance values included in fig 6 incorporated all labour electricity and processing expenses of an mle as system 40 moreover the bnr opex represents the equivalent amount of wastewater that would be treated in an mle as system if the collected urine in this study was diverted from entering the conventional sewage system the cost of the water that would be used per flush equivalent to the quantity of urine collected in the proposed system was considered when calculating the total cost of bnr at wwtps likewise the cost of the sewer connections equivalent to the urine collected by the system was also considered switching to a waterless urinal system would presumably lead to a decrease in flushes and further promote water conservation if any one of the design scenarios were to be implemented approximately 6840 m3 of water could be preserved per year equating to roughly 20 400 and 17 400 worth of water and sewer connection expenses respectively additionally 313 m3 of permeate water would be produced per year from urine treatment with ro literature indicates that ro treated wastewater 41 and urine 42 have applications in potable water production otherwise this recovered water could also potentially find use in other industries considering the recent water shortage in the city of cape town sustainable infrastructure that has applications in water conservation could aid in mitigating the effects of future water shortages for cost recovery it was assumed that the solid and liquid fertilizer produced in this system could enter the south african fertilizer market and be sold at prices which are competitive with established commercial fertilizers in this case the selling prices of the solid and liquid fertilizers would be 1 28 kg and 10 5 l from the proposed system it was estimated that a liquid fertilizer of 3 3 nitrogen by weight could potentially be produced from this combined treatment process approximately 78 4 m3 of liquid fertilizer and 4420 kg of ca p could potentially be retrieved by decentralizing urine treatment total fertilizer sales were found to be approximately 828 100 per year when considering the overall opex it was found that the potential net income of the system if all fertilizer is sold at the original design selling prices would be approximately 715 200 per year 3 2 3 greenhouse gas emissions and energy expenditure the ghg emissions of the proposed decentralized system were calculated based on carbon dioxide emissions the ghg emissions for scenarios one two three and four were found to be 3 381 kg co2 year 1 3 028 kg co2 year 1 2 900 kg co2 year 1 and 2 696 kg co2 year 1 the truck fuel emissions were the main contributor to ghg emissions in the decentralized system therefore as the number of rrfs increased causing a decrease in the travelling distance the carbon emissions of the system also decreased the ghg emissions of a conventional mle as system was found to be 9 846 kg co2 year 1 considering urine contributes approximately 80 of the total nitrogen in wastewater 8 the mass of carbon emissions per mass of nitrogen removed in an mle as system was used as a direct comparison to the proposed system additionally it was found that bnr energy expenditure for an equivalent mass of nitrogen in wastewater would be approximately 7548 kw h year 1 this represented an almost tenfold increase when compared to the 784 kw h year 1 energy expenditure for ro operation in the proposed decentralized system 3 2 4 net present value cost the npv of the system considering maximum fertilizer sales was evaluated over a 5 year investment period at an interest rate of 10 the comparison of the npv for each scenario is illustrated in fig 7 a positive net present value is realized for each scenario at maximum sales with scenario one exhibiting the highest npv of 2 65 million over a 5 year period scenario four exhibits the worst with an npv of 2 1 million for the same period the selling price of the recovered fertilizer product used in this research contributed significantly to the positive net present value achieved in the initial calculations the effect of varying this selling price was investigated more specifically the selling price that resulted in a net present value of zero was calculated this price was referred to as the break even selling price and is displayed in table 4 for each design scenario it was found that even if the liquid fertilizer selling price were decreased by up to 85 from 10 5 l to 1 57 l the proposed system was still capable of breaking even over an investment period of 5 years if one rrf was installed in the study area in the initial model calculations the ca p fertilizer accounted for just under 1 of the total income furthermore granular phosphorous based fertilizers derived from human urine have already been shown to be effective fertilizers 38 the ability of the recovered ca p to enter the south african fertilizer market at competitive prices was not questioned for this sensitivity analysis but should be considered for during actual implementation of such systems it was found that for scenarios one two three and four 15 20 25 and 33 of the liquid fertilizer would need to be sold to reach a break even point at the chosen design selling price approximate sales figures for liquid fertilizers were sourced from five local plant nurseries in cape town this was done to get an approximate estimate of the average quantity of liquid fertilizers sold per week it was found that roughly two litres of a popular liquid fertilizer brand are sold every week by these nurseries these approximate weekly sales values were applied to all the nurseries within cape town and evaluated over a five year investment period to determine how the npv was affected the abovementioned parameters represent the sale of approximately 10 of the fertilizer produced from the collected urine moreover it was found that at the design selling price a negative net present value was realised for all scenarios however if only this fraction of fertilizer is sold the remaining 90 of liquid fertilizer would only need to be sold at a bulk value as low as 0 67 l over five years to reach a break even point if one rrf is installed trucks with higher carrying capacities would directly increase the capex in each scenario an approximately 11 000 increase and a 30 500 increase would be observed if an 8 ton truck or a 14 ton truck were utilized respectively 43 likewise the operating costs of increasing the carrying capacity of the truck were higher for scenario one a 4 ton truck and an 8 ton truck would have a similar operating cost due to the larger distance travelled by the 4 ton truck as the required travelling distance between the two trucks types converges the 4 ton truck becomes the least expensive option a shorter travel distance was observed as the level of decentralization increased as expected this subsequently resulted in a decrease in co2 emissions from the truck despite this increasing the level of decentralization led to an increase in both capex and opex the differences in operating costs arose mainly due to an increase in the amount of rrfs which led to an increase in rental costs and operating personnel an argument could be made that rental costs would not have a significant contribution in the case of on site treatment provided that collection locations have pre existing and vacant floor space in this situation discounted rental rates could be negotiated in exchange for provision of recovered fertilizer if such a demand is applicable for example the urine produced by uct alone would be capable of providing approximately 48 of the nitrogen requirements for its rugby fields on the main campus per year however such detailed knowledge of each specific collection location is difficult to estimate it was found that transporting source separated urine in a 4 ton truck from highly frequented locations offers an appealing method of facilitating decentralization of urine treatment moreover from a financial perspective it was deduced that scenario one the implementation of one rrf was the best design scenario the plant nursery market was interrogated as a means for distribution because it was assumed that this is where the most appropriate sale opportunities would exist however it would be naïve to assume that urine derived liquid fertilizers would be capable of seamlessly entering the fertilizer market and competing with established commercially available fertilizers moreover if the recovered fertilizer were capable of being sold at competitive prices the sale quantities could be low due to several factors such as seasonal demand any decrease in sales would subsequently cause an increase in the break even selling price required if the realistic sales quantities are estimated to be 10 of the total liquid fertilizer produced the cost of production per litre of liquid fertilizer sold would be 38 higher than the initial design selling price from a financial perspective scaling down fertilizer production to a point where a profit is made may be advisable however alternate markets could be explored for maximum product distribution such as vineyards located nearby cape town south africa produces the seventh largest amount of wine globally according to the international organization of vine and wine oiv and has multiple geographic wine regions 44 the stellenbosch wine region which cape town is situated within constitutes roughly 16 of the total vineyard surface area in south africa according to the south african wine industry sawis 45 the total quantity of fertilizer produced from the proposed system per year 78 m3 of liquid fertilizer and 4420 kgs of ca p could provide approximately 0 3 0 01 and 0 2 of the nitrogen phosphorous and potassium required for the entire stellenbosch region per year importantly this is considering the potential contribution from only eight urine collection locations in cape town vineyards within and surrounding cape town thus offer potential for an alternative market to promote this liquid fertilizer as a bulk product the stellenbosch wine region annual npk fertilizer demands were calculated based on the vineyard nutrient requirements outlined by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations faoun 46 detailed calculations for the proposed system can be found in the supplementary information to assess the full potential of the proposed system the total amount of liquid and solid fertilizer that could be produced per year if all cape town residents used the nru was evaluated it was found that if all cape town residents women included urinated in an nru just once per week for one year approximately 46 2 and 28 of the stellenbosch wine region s annual nitrogen phosphorous and potassium requirements could be recovered as fertilizers this is shown in fig 8 the prospect of supplying recovered fertilizers to vineyards is helped by the fact that urine derived liquid fertilizers manufactured by urine nitrification and distillation are already available and being successfully used to fertilize vineyards in france 47 48 the proposed decentralized system and conventional bnr exhibited a similar operating cost per annum for the incorporation of one rrf as seen in fig 6 however lower ghg emissions and energy expenditure were observed when comparing any of the chosen design scenarios to wwtps furthermore research indicates that urine source separation can increase the life span of wwtps and treatment capacities by decreasing the influent nutrient load and the hydraulic load experienced 32 to put this research into perspective the effect that decentralized urine treatment would have on centralized wwtps was estimated considering the average nutrient compositions in urine and that urine constitutes approximately 80 of the nitrogen in wastewater streams 8 the total nitrogen in the influent at a wwtp is approximately 84 mg n l 1 an mle as configuration is capable of producing effluent quality with 10 mg n l 1 total nitrogen 40 by removing urine from wastewater streams approximately 17 mg n l 1 total nitrogen would enter wwtps decreased total nitrogen influent concentrations and a decrease in hydraulic load due to water conservation initiatives would presumably have a significant effect on conventional bnr and wwt in addition wilsenach and van loosdrecht 32 found that wwtps could become net energy producers if urine separation is implemented 4 conclusions human urine is a valuable resource with potential to produce many useful products the goal of this research was to investigate the recovery of resources from human urine within a densely populated modern city such as the city of cape town in south africa this work has shown that the collection of source separated urine for the purposes of resource recovery holds significant potential from a monetary and an environmental perspective it was shown that if urine was collected from shopping malls in cape town and treated using a combination of alkaline stabilization and volume reduction approximately 78 m3 of liquid fertilizer with a 3 3 0 0 8 npk rating could be produced per week in addition 4420 kg of solid ca p could be produced per week the liquid fertilizer produced would only need to be sold at 1 57 l to equate the total system expenditure to the total income over a five year period conversely it was found that there was only a market for about 10 of the recovered liquid fertilizer which could be sold as a niche fertilizer 10 5 l however in this scenario the remaining 90 of liquid fertilizer would only need to be sold at a bulk value of 0 67 l over a five year period to breakeven the combination of transportation planning and waste management could play an important role in future studies aiming to improve decentralized sanitation systems it is hoped that further research will be undertaken to improve niche methods of resource recovery and continue to work towards achieving the united nations sustainable development goals declaration of competing interest we do not have a conflict of interest with regards to our paper

13848,hexavalent chromium removal from wastewater is a major challenge for researchers the study attempts to use starch modified nanoscale zero valent iron for hexavalent chromium removal starch was used to reduce the agglomeration tendency of nanoparticle which was evident in sem micrographs the effects of various process variables were investigated including ph nanoparticle dosage initial chromium concentration mixing rate temperature the results showed that all these variables except ph were positively correlated with removal efficiency the ph played a vital role in cr vi removal performance the removal performance of bare nanoscale zero valent iron was below 50 for chromium concentration 50 mg l the starch encapsulated nanoscale zero valent iron worked well for lower chromium concentration but at higher concentration 50 mg l the performance stagnated to around 65 in order to improve the performance for higher chromium concentration the nanoparticle was integrated with various other remedial methods like ultrasonication irradiation aeration and fenton system all these remedial techniques generate reactive oxygen species in the system which together with nanoscale zero valent iron greatly enhance the removal performance it was seen that among various systems created the removal performance for us nzvi system uv nzvi system aeration nzvi system and fenton nzvi system increased to 92 86 7 91 93 respectively the removal efficiency was seen to be strongly correlated with parameters like orp and final ph of the system and thus can be used for monitoring removal performance keywords wastewater treatment cr vi removal nanoscale zvi starch encapsulated zvi integrated systems ultrasonication uv irradiation 1 introduction the inevitable use of chromium in industrial processes such as leather tanning metal finishing textile dyeing batteries 1 3 has generated serious environmental concerns chromium can exist in many oxidation states with trivalent and hexavalent being the most common 4 the toxicological and environmental profile of cr iii and cr vi is very different the trivalent form is considered safer in terms of toxicity mobility and stability than hexavalent form it also contributes to the protein metabolism of the human body on the contrary cr vi has been reported to cause many severe health ailments and is considered toxic and carcinogenic 5 7 due to these features of the trivalent form of chromium the most common route of treating hexavalent chromium is by reducing it to a less toxic trivalent state 8 several conventional physical and chemical treatment technologies like chemical precipitation membrane filtration biosorption and ion exchange are available but these technologies suffer from several drawbacks like energy intensive hazardous waste generation high operation cost 9 10 as cr vi cr iii has high standard reduction potential at low ph e g e cr2 o7 2 cr3 1 36 v hexavalent chromium can be easily reduced therefore using a reducing agent to treat hexavalent chromium is emerging as economic and efficient technology 11 nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi by virtue of its large specific surface area and high reactivity is considered strong reductant and has gained attention for its environmental remediation capability 12 13 the tendency of nzvi to agglomerate rapidly due to van der waal and magnetic forces results in decreased mobility of nzvi which greatly limits its application 14 to enhance the stability and mobility of nanoparticles organic stabilizers are often attached onto surface of such material to provide necessary electrostatic repulsion 15 several stabilizers like dextran 16 carboxymethyl cellulose cmc 17 chitosan 18 has been used successfully to achieve higher dispersibility and performance starch exhibits favorable characteristics like biocompatibility nontoxicity and biodegradability and thus emerging as a popular encapsulating alternative sun et al reported that starch enhanced the dispersibility and hydrophilicity of nzvi which increased their tendency to be suspended and adhered 19 rezazadeh et al showed that adding molecules of starch to zero valent iron helped increase the stability of adsorbent prevent oxidation of nanoparticle and improve the reactivity of nanoparticle for nitrate removal 20 though a lot of literature is presently studying the effect of adding cmc and guar gum to improve zero valent iron performance the effect of adding starch to zero valent iron for chromium removal has not been explored extensively therefore in the present study the performance of starch as a stabilizer was investigated the effect of different reaction parameters on its performance was also analyzed though biopolymers like starch can work well as a stabilizer helping enhance the dispersibility of nanoparticle through electro steric forces facilitating better electron transfer it fails to improve the electron selectivity of nanoparticle towards target contaminant hence a lot of electron coming from nanoparticle gets involved in side reactions with oxygen present in solution and nanoparticle exhausts itself unnecessarily thus enhancing electron selectivity is as important as electron transfer the presence of surface coating ensures controlled exposure of nanoparticle over a period of time thus the electron gets transferred to solution not abruptly but in a uniform way resulting in more effective electron transfer in order to get maximum performance of any nanoparticle both aspects are equally crucial the area of enhancing electron selectivity has remained a grey area in zero valent iron technology for a very long time only in the past five years we have seen an increased focus in this area one major way of improving electron selectivity is by generating reactive oxygen species ros through activation of molecular oxygen present in solution which would otherwise compete with target contaminants for electrons in the present study we have tried to couple various techniques of surface coating of nanoparticle to get improved electron transfer with techniques of generating reactive oxygen species to get improved electron selectivity in order to achieve this starch coated nzvi s nzvi was coupled with advanced techniques like ultrasonication irradiation aeration and fenton system to the best of our knowledge starch stabilized zero valent iron has not been integrated with four different strategies to generate reactive oxygen species in a single study so far integrating nanoparticles with these techniques not only affects the removal performance but also reduces the time for removal ultrasonication technique utilizes the principle that when sound waves above 20 khz pass the system it induces pressure variation and cavitation that grow and collapse this cavitation alters the interaction between nanoparticle and contaminant and also generates fresh reactive oxygen species which affects the reaction fu et al showed that ultrasound could lead to significant synergy in the removal of se iv by zvi because ultrasound can promote the generation of oh radicals and accelerate advanced fenton process 21 gao et al also reported that the degradation of propranolol by nzvi activated persulfate with ultrasound assistance could increase notably 22 uv irradiation system utilizes the fact that when a system is exposed to irradiation based on its photocatalytic ability it creates electron hole pair these electrons further create reactive oxygen species which enhances the removal process morgada et al found that uv vis light enhanced as v removal by nzvi this effect was partly attributed to the role of semiconductors of different fe ii fe iii oxides formed as nzvi shell during synthesis 23 montesino et al showed that cr vi removal using nanoparticulated zero valent iron was enhanced by visible light due to the heterogeneous photocatalytic process promoted by iron oxides present as an external layer of nanoparticle acting as semiconductor after excitation with light 24 the aeration process on the other hand introduces fresh molecular oxygen to the system which generates reactive oxygen species helping the reaction to progress in a recent study pang et al showed that zvi could react with molecular oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species which are able to oxidize and even mineralize organic compound 25 the fenton system involves the introduction of hydrogen peroxide to the system which has been reported to enhance the removal ability greatly kang et al reported higher removal efficiency for 1 4 dioxane and as iii when nzvi was integrated with hydrogen peroxide 26 li et al 2018b showed that applying strong oxidant like hydrogen peroxide could accelerate the reductive removal of nitrate and selenite by zvi 27 any contaminant removal using a reducing agent produces simultaneous oxidizing and reducing conditions in the system which can be measured using changes in oxidation reduction potential orp and changes in the final ph of the system the orp and final ph has been used in many studies to monitor the reducing conditions within the system yu et al showed that online orp ph and do dissolved oxygen monitoring data can be used as input to obtain a reliable evaluation of the effectiveness of nzvi fenton process for azo dye removal from textile wastewater 28 in another work yu et al showed that monitoring orp ph and do in a reactor presented a good correlation with cr vi removal efficiency thus monitoring orp and ph have good capabilities to evaluate cr vi removal efficiency 29 the objectives of the present study are i synthesis and characterization of starch coated nzvi s nzvi ii study the performance of starch coated nzvi and parameters affecting hexavalent chromium removal iii integrating starch nzvi with advanced techniques like ultrasonication irradiation fenton and aeration system iv monitor the reducing condition of the system using orp and final ph during the removal process 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of starch encapsulated nzvi s nzvi starch encapsulated zero valent iron was prepared by a modified method briefly 50 ml of 0 4 m nabh4 was added dropwise into 50 ml of 0 2 m feso4 7h2o solution containing one gram of potato starch as stabilizer after reaction was over the black solid particles were collected magnetically and washed three times using pure ethanol and then oven dried at 60 c overnight 31 2 2 characterization of starch stabilized nzvi to determine the crystal structure and phase identification of synthesized starch nanoscale zero valent iron x ray diffractometer model d8 focus bruker germany was employed in an angle range of 20 70 with cu kα radiation λ 0 154 å the surface morphology of s nzvi and chemical characterization were done using scanning electron microscope with edx model s 3400 n hitachi japan to explore surface interaction and presence of functional groups ftir spectrophotometer was used model spectrum 2000 perkin elmer usa 2 3 batch reaction experiment the effects of different parameters on chromium removal were investigated by batch experiment using a 500 ml conical flask for monitoring effect of ph on chromium removal efficiency oxidation reduction potential and final ph of the system multimeter with microprocessor mettle toledo ma 235 ph ion analyzer was employed in order to understand effect of initial chromium concentration on removal efficiency and amount of chromium removal uv vis spectrophotometer model lambda 35 perkin elmer usa was used at 540 nm following standard 1 5diphenyl carbazide method the stirring speed and temperature of system was controlled using magnetic stirrer with hot plate model remi 2 the experiments were carried out using 500 ml solution under various s nzvi dosage from 0 25 g l to 1 0 g l reaction temperature from 208 k to 308 k initial chromium concentration 10 mg l to 50 mg l and initial ph values from 3 to 9 for 180 min at certain time intervals aliquots were taken out and filtered to remove particles by a 0 45 μm membrane filter then the residual concentration of cr vi was measured in the process of the experiment one parameter changed while all other remained constant the removal efficiency of cr vi was calculated as follows r e c o c t c o 100 where re is the chromium removal efficiency and c 0 and c t mg l is the concentration of hexavalent chromium in the aqueous solution at initial time and time t min respectively 2 4 integrating s nzvi with other techniques in order to achieve appreciable chromium removal performance for higher chromium concentration s nzvi was integrated with various techniques like ultrasound us light irradiation uv aeration and fenton system the reaction conditions were the same as that for batch reaction all these experiments were carried out in 1 l flask with 250 ml solution about 1 ml solution was extracted using syringe within 1 5 10 15 30 45 60 90 and 120 min respectively the aliquots were then filtered and residual concentration was measured the orp and ph probe were also inserted and readings were taken during the experiment duration in order to study chromium removal performance of s nzvi ultrasound system we used an ultrasonication bath the effect of different ultrasonication frequency 37 khz and 80 khz was studied on chromium removal performance the effect of sonication temperature during ultrasonication was also measured the synthesized s nzvi was also integrated with uv irradiation system uv bulb of 1 15 w with different wavelength 365 nm and 254 nm kept at 15 cm resulting in different intensities of 1350 and 1100 μw cm2 were used the s nzvi was further integrated with aeration system aeration was conducted using lp 20 diphagram blower resun co ltd china aeration flowrate 2 5 l min and 3 5 l min was controlled by a flow meter fenton system was also used along with s nzvi the dosage of hydrogen peroxide was 10 ml l 20 ml l and 30 ml l respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization sem micrograph for bare nzvi is shown in fig 1 a the particles formed large spherical particles that stick together resulting in large particle size this indicates towards tendency of nzvi without encapsulation to aggregate due to either electrostatic forces among nanoparticle or surface tension interaction of particles thus lower surface area and poor reactivity can be expected when these nanoparticles were coated with starch they provided double positive impact a layer of polymer molecule on the surface provided strong steric repulsive forces and increasing surface charge of nanoparticle provided electrostatic stabilization resulting in uniform dispersion and smaller particle size as shown in fig 1b therefore the starch coating was evenly distributed onto the surface of the nanoparticle resulting in discrete well dispersed and close to the spherical shaped nanoparticle micrographs showing s nzvi reaction with hexavalent chromium is presented in fig 1c we see in this micrograph agglomerated lump of nanoparticles which were due to complete corrosion of nanoparticle that indicates enhanced one to one contact between particle and contaminant due to improved surface area 32 edx graph for fresh s nzvi is shown in fig 2 a the iron content is 35 16 followed by oxygen 29 89 the high iron content demonstrates the formation of zero valent iron while the presence of oxygen is due to the iron oxide shell formed at the surface of zero valent iron and hydroxyl group present in starch which forms a soft shell over entire nanoparticle thus edx confirms both formations of zero valent iron and the presence of a starch coating on nzvi surface in fig 2b which is for s nzvi after reaction with hexavalent chromium we find that oxygen content reaches up to 32 19 while iron content decreases to 25 71 marking corrosion of nanoparticle during the process of reducing chromium to its lower transition state the rise in oxygen may also be attributed to the involvement of nzvi in side reactions with oxygen present in the solution which is often undesired therefore it indicates that starch though helps to improve the surface area and overall dispersion of nanoparticle it was unable to prevent side reaction with oxygen present in solution thus it can be concluded that starch may improve electron transfer from fe0 core by maintaining controlled exposure of nanoparticle but it did not improve electron selectivity of the nanoparticle towards target contaminant ftir graph for fresh s nzvi and s nzvi after reaction with hexavalent chromium are shown in fig 3 a and b in fig 3a it can be seen that prominent peaks appear at 3340 cm 1 represents hydroxyl bond interaction and peak at 1643 represents hydroxyl bond as it is known that molecules of starch contain hydroxyl group in each repeat unit of starch which is favorable for complexation with the iron nanoparticle the peak at 2977 cm 1 shows ch stretching in coh group which is due to the presence of ch2oh group in the starch molecule which behaves as a capping agent for the nanoparticle helping in preventing aggregation the peak at 1045 cm 1 and 1043 cm 1 represents co bond is due to the presence of acetal functional group a carbon that has two ether oxygen attached the peak at 667 cm 1 represents feo interaction 33 this indicates that iron was present and actively interacted with starch during the fabrication process the peak at 601 cm 1 and 411 cm 1 indicates the presence of phosphate group in the nanoparticle which is because of the various starch present potato starch contains phosphate ester thus these functional groups present in starch will ensure the formation of adsorption layer that will behave as a steric shield that will protect particles from approaching each other fig 3b shows s nzvi after chromium removal it can be clearly seen that peaks have changed after adsorption these changes indicate the adsorption of cr vi on s nzvi the changes in intensity of the peaks show important role of functional group in adsorption of cr vi after adsorption the peak for hydroxyl group acetal functional group and phosphorus group changed which represent the enhanced activity of these functional group with chromium ion the peak for hydroxyl group becomes broader indicating a more significant role of the hydroxyl group in chromium reaction the peak intensity also decreased suggesting the rate of decrement in functional group which was responsible for the aggregation of s nzvi nanoparticle after reaction with chromium the xrd peak for fresh s nzvi is shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the characteristic peak for zero valent iron appear at 2 θ 44 8 confirming the presence of fe another peak with low intensity appears at 35 which represents fe2o3 suggesting that iron oxide shell was formed in the fabrication process in fig 4 s nzvi after chromium reaction was also represented the peak of fe at 44 8 diminished significantly as it got consumed in the presence of chromium anion it can be seen that a new prominent peak appears at 20 suggesting the formation of feooh indicating oxidation of s nzvi peak at 25 7 indicates the presence of organic matter showing interaction of starch coating in chromium adsorption the peaks at 31 and 63 14 indicate the presence of fe3o4 suggesting that s nzvi readily oxidized itself to a higher transition state in order to reduce chromium to its lower transition state the peak at 35 becomes more intense indicating that fe oxidized itself to fe2 showing the progress of reaction 35 3 2 effect of process parameters on batch reaction several studies previously have reported a strong influence of ph on chromium remediation process as seen in fig 5 a the chromium removal increased with decrease in ph value the chromium removal for ph 3 5 7 and 9 was 69 24 55 14 51 71 42 31 respectively it is evident that at lower ph better removal was observed this may be attributed to three aspect i lower ph results in enhanced corrosion of nzvi which promotes chromium removal ii increase in h concentration results in protonation of surface hydroxyl group which improves electrostatic attraction between s nzvi and cr vi anion resulting in enhanced electron transfer from s nzvi to target contaminant iii lower ph results in increased acid washing of s nzvi surface resulting in fresh active sites being available to chromium anions for reaction 36 it was also noticed that at high and neutral ph low chromium removal was observed this may be due to increased precipitation of fe iii hydroxides on iron surface which reduces electron transfer between nzvi and cr vi anion 37 thus the ph value of 3 4 considered optimum for effective chromium removal the effect of initial chromium concentration on cr vi removal using s nzvi was presented in fig 5b it was seen that removal for low initial chromium concentration of 10 mg l and 20 mg l was 100 and 99 87 respectively thus very high removal was obtained at low initial chromium concentration this was because for low chromium concentration the available fixed dosage was enough to interact and reduce the target contaminant successfully it was also noticed that as initial chromium concentration was increased to 50 mg l the removal decreased to 68 83 this may be due to the passivation layer of fe iii cr iii hydroxide developed on the surface of s nzvi that provided resistance to electron transfer from s nzvi to target contaminant higher concentration also caused limited s nzvi getting exposed to a lot of chromium ions this inhibited proper contact between adsorbate and adsorbent necessary for effective adsorption and reduction process it led to the exhaustion of s nzvi due to rapid oxidation 38 it also indicated the fact that at low concentration s nzvi could get involved in side reactions with oxygen species in solution and still achieve remarkable removal results with an increase in initial chromium concentration s nzvi could no longer afford to get involved in any side reaction as it strongly affected its chromium removal performance therefore with an increase in initial chromium concentration need for strategies that can improve electron selectivity became more pronounced clearly the starch coating on nanoparticle did improved dispersion which resulted in improved electron transfer it could not control the undesirable side reactions the effect of s nzvi dosage was shown in fig 5c the chromium removal efficiency increased as the dosage increased the chromium removal was minimum at 49 3 for a dosage of 0 15 g l and maximum removal was 68 91 at 0 5 g l this was because at a higher dosage more active sites were available for reaction facilitating more one to one contact between contaminant and nanoparticle it can also be seen that unlike very rapid removal of chromium within the first few minutes followed by slow removal over the remaining period as reported for zero valent iron without encapsulation the addition of starch resulted in the gradual removal of chromium over the entire period suggesting that starch provided controlled exposure of s nzvi which prevented its rapid corrosion in a short span 39 fig 5d illustrates the effect of stirring speed on removal efficiency the removal percentage improved a little with increasing stirring speed from about 60 at 450 rpm to more than 65 at 650 rpm this may be due to the fact that higher stirring speed facilitates mixing thereby enhancing one to one contact between nanoparticle and contaminant higher stirring speed also reduces the chances of agglomeration of magnetic nanoparticle thereby increasing the surface area available for reaction the effect of system temperature on removal efficiency was shown in fig 5e the removal efficiency was 64 2 66 8 and 69 03 for temperature 288 k 298 k and 308 k respectively thus chromium removal improved though slightly with increasing temperature generally increased temperature facilitates higher diffusion of chromium onto the s nzvi surface the removal was not very significant with change in temperature suggesting that change in temperature could not alter the surface porosity of s nzvi to a great extent which is responsible for enhanced intraparticle diffusion and increased chemical interaction at s nzvi surface 40 the batch reaction at optimum parameters initial chromium concentration 50 mg l ph 3 s nzvi dosage 0 5 g l stirring speed 550 rpm temperature 298 k was shown in fig 6 a the removal efficiency for starch bare nzvi and starch encapsulated nzvi was studied it was found that starch alone was not effective in chromium removal as the removal efficiency was less than 10 one reason may be the low adsorption capability of potato starch due to its low specific surface area of 0 15 m2 g which greatly limits chromium removal moreover studies have reported that native starch is mostly inert towards chemical reaction unless they are pretreated 41 for nzvi without any encapsulation the removal efficiency was around 55 this may be due to the aggregation of bare nanoparticle resulting from electrostatic attraction and van der waals forces among the particles which greatly increases the size of the nanoparticle thereby reducing the surface area available for chromium adsorption when nanoscale zero valent iron was coated using starch chromium removal reached upto 70 indicating that starch was able to reduce the tendency of aggregation and hence was effective in improving the chromium removal efficiency the starch coating prevents aggregation through electro steric stabilization of nanoparticle the starch coating provides electrostatic repulsion to nanoparticle by increasing the surface charge which increases the repulsive forces between the particle the starch coating also provides steric stabilization through the presence of long chain organic molecules on the surface which resist particle particle attraction thus the addition of starch to nzvi was able to improve chromium removal performance by 1 3 times as compared to bare nzvi the reducing condition present during the batch reaction was shown in fig 6b oxidation reduction potential orp is a measure of electron activity in a solution and indicates a relative tendency to accept or transfer electron it was seen that orp change was maximum for s nzvi it dropped from 221 mv to 61 mv the rapid decrease in orp level shows that more electron was transferred to the target contaminant which led to reduction of cr vi to its lower transition state of cr iii and subsequent oxidation of fe to its higher state of fe iii it can be noted that after 60 min the decline in orp is slower this may be attributed to the fact that after a certain time both oxidized fe iii and reduced cr iii got accumulated forming fe iii cr iii hydroxide layer on the surface of nanoparticle which greatly inhibited the electron transfer from s nzvi core to target contaminant the final ph reached the highest value for s nzvi as more oh ions are generated when cr vi gets reduced to cr iii by nzvi particle 41 42 it can be seen that the orp decline was most rapid and higher for s nzvi than for bare nzvi or starch this shows that starch encapsulation helped in more efficient electron transfer to target contaminants than others resulting in greater chromium removal 3 3 integration study the effect of different ultrasonic frequency on chromium removal efficiency was investigated and the result was shown in fig 7 a it was found that at a higher sonication frequency of 80 khz better removal frequency of 92 3 was obtained while for 37 khz the chromium removal remained 85 as reported in several literature ultrasound causes growth and collapse of the gas bubble cavitation producing high transient temperature and pressure which leads to the formation of free radicals oh and ooh via thermal dissociation of oxygen and water these free radicals recombine outside the cavitation bubble to form hydrogen peroxide at higher sonication frequency more free radicals are formed enhancing the reaction 43 when s nzvi is integrated with ultrasonication two sources of electron transfer to target contaminant gets triggered the two sources are i electron from fe core to chromium ion ii reactive oxygen species generated from thermal dissociation of molecular oxygen the presence of an additional source of electron from molecular activation of oxygen greatly enhances the overall removal process the reducing condition of the system marked by orp and the final ph is shown in fig 7b the orp values for frequency 80 khz decreased from 127 mv to 94 within 10 min and further decreased to 19 mv at the end of the reaction the orp values for 37 khz decreased less sharply from 150 mv to 118 mv in 10 min and further to 25 mv at the end of the reaction it can be seen that orp value though significant was not rapid in the first 30 min for both frequencies this shows that starch encapsulation was able to provide a controlled release of electrons from s nzvi core as the covering dissolved gradually over a period of time and not instantaneously also overall orp values decreased more sharply for 80 khz than 37 khz this may be due to the fact that at higher frequency the tendency of reactive oxygen species formation was more which led to greater electron availability for reaction with chromium than at lower frequency therefore higher frequency resulted in a more conducive reducing condition it can be noted that the orp values are correlated well with chromium removal percentage which also showed better removal at higher a frequency the final ph also synchronizes with orp and removal efficiency results the final ph for 80 khz rose sharply from 5 8 to 7 5 in the first 10 min and finally rose to 9 8 here it can be noted that the ph increase was sharper in the first 30 min of reaction and then gradual this may be attributed to the fact that hydroxyl ions are generated when a reaction takes place between a molecule of fe and cr vi thus the final ph shows the progress of the reaction at the beginning of the reaction more hydroxyl ions are generated due to better one to one contact between s nzvi and chromium molecules however as the reaction proceeds fe iii cr iii hydroxide layer formed on the s nzvi surface hinders fe cr vi contact limiting the generation of hydroxyl ion the rise in final ph was more at a higher frequency showing a more efficient reaction between chromium and s nzvi molecules than at lower frequency the effect of sonication temperature was investigated keeping sonication frequency constant at 37 khz and the result of the same is shown in fig 8 a it was found that the removal efficiency was higher for higher temperature with the removal of 92 for 308 k and 88 for 298 k high sonication temperature facilitates the reaction by reducing aggregation tendency among particles by disrupting strong magnetic interaction and van der waal interaction among nanoparticle this enhances the active site for the reaction high temperature also facilitates greater adsorption due to enhanced diffusion of contaminants onto the nanoparticle surface 44 the reducing conditions were shown in fig 8b the orp values at 288 k decreased slightly from 273 mv to 193 mv and further to 30 mv at the end of the reaction the orp values for 308 k decreased sharply from 188 mv to 129 mv in the first 10 min and finally to 26 mv at the end of the reaction the final ph also showed that more hydroxyl ions were generated at high temperature as the final ph rose sharply from 5 5 9 8 for temperature 308 k as against 9 1 for 288 k the effect of different light intensity on removal efficiency was shown in fig 9 a it was found that removal efficiency for light using a 15 w uv bulb with wavelength 365 nm kept at 15 cm was higher at 86 7 than for wavelength 254 nm 82 the removal in uv irradiation follows photocatalytic reaction and also free radical generation path the heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction takes place due to the presence of the external layer of iron oxide acting as a semiconductor bulk iron oxides have bandgap energies between 1 94 ev 2 2 ev which behaves as a metallic conductor after the excitation of iron oxides with light energy higher than their bandgap electron hole pair is formed and redox reaction involving these charge carriers can transform cr vi into lower states in addition to this fe0 present in the core act as hole scavenger facilitating charge separation and enhancing chromium removal moreover the electron generated may also react with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species o2o these reactive oxygen species react with a proton h to form perhydroxyl ions 45 these reactive oxygen species also enhance the removal reaction it can be seen that though irradiation facilitated chromium removal still removal could not go beyond 86 for 365 nm wavelength this may be due to the fact that the starch polymer coating over nzvi inhibited the irradiation process because starch polymer has higher bandgap energy and acts as an insulator in comparison to iron oxide shell which acts as conductor thus starch coating limited the excitation process of the electron from iron oxide shell the reducing conditions were presented in fig 9b the orp for wavelength 265 nm did not decrease very rapidly with a gradual decrease of 243 mv from 312 mv in the first 10 min and finally to 54 mv at the end of the reaction the orp for wavelength 365 nm also followed a similar pattern but the final orp value was more steep at 16 mv at the end of the reaction it can be seen that orp values declined gradually and could not reach the negative value this may be due to the fact that starch coating did not dissolve completely till the end of the experiment and it continued to hinder the direct contact between the light source and iron oxide shell the final value of ph also increased from 5 2 9 3 for the wavelength of 365 nm the effect of different aeration flowrate on removal efficiency was shown in fig 10 a it was seen that for aeration flowrate 2 5 l min the removal efficiency was 86 13 and that for flowrate 3 5 l min it increased to 91 this means that integrating starch nzvi with aeration system enhanced the removal performance mu et al reported that in aerobic nzvi process outward electron transfer takes place from iron core initiating two electron molecular oxygen activation o2 h2o2 and surface bound ferrous ions on iron oxide shell favor single electron molecular oxygen activation o2 o2 h2o2 46 the reducing condition during aeration starch nzvi system was shown in fig 10b the orp values fell rapidly from 257 mv to 185 mv in the first 10 min following a steep decrease of 8 mv at the end of the reaction the final ph values also showed a steep rise from 5 4 9 7 at the end of the reaction showing that enough hydroxyl ions were produced as a result of better interaction between chromium and s nzvi the effect of different hydrogen peroxide dosage on removal performance was shown in fig 11 a it was found that higher removal performance was obtained for higher peroxide dosage the removal performance for peroxide dosage 10 ml l remained at 85 which increased to 93 when the dosage was increased to 30 ml l hydrogen peroxide produces oh radicals these radicals have very high redox potential of 1 44 v producing very strong reducing conditions 47 the oh radical is produced by the following reaction 1 f e o h 2 o 2 2 h f e 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h 2 o 2 h o o h f e 3 the reducing conditions were shown in fig 11b the orp values for peroxide dosage 20 ml l and 30 ml l decreased sharply from 242 mv to 162 mv and 173 to 72 mv in first 10 min respectively further it decreased sharply to 21 mv for dosage 20 ml l and 32 mv for dosage 30 the ph also decreased sharply to 9 8 showing high discharge of hydroxyl ion due to the reduction of hexavalent chromium 3 4 conclusion in this study it was found that starch could be successfully used as an encapsulating agent to achieve high dispersion stability and reduce aggregation among nanoparticle for effective chromium removal the sem micrographs provided strong evidence that starch could help in improved dispersion the formation of fe was confirmed from the xrd graph it was noticed that the hydroxyl group played a prominent role in surface interaction indicating that starch which contains mainly hydroxyl group in the form of amylose and amylopectin played a crucial role in zero valent iron fabrication various evidence in this study indicated that starch coating helped in controlled exposure of zero valent iron enhancing electron transfer to chromium anion it also improved nanoparticle dispersion in the chromium solution the ph played a significant role in chromium removal it was seen that lower ph favored chromium removal as it enhanced protonation of surface hydroxyl group present in starch thus improving electrostatic attraction between s nzvi and chromium anion apart from ph and initial chromium concentration s nzvi dosage also affected chromium removal as available reactive sites were affected due to these parameters though starch coated nzvi showed appreciable performance of more than 95 removal at lower chromium concentration till 30 mg l as the concentration increased to 50 mg l the removal performance drastically reduced to near 65 in order to maintain high removal efficiency of s nzvi for chromium concentration higher than 30 mg l the nanoparticle was integrated with various techniques that can either activate molecular oxygen in solution to generate reactive oxygen species or enhance electron transfer from s nzvi core and shell to target contaminant in this pursuit s nzvi was integrated with techniques like ultrasonication fenton system and aeration system which showed remarkable improvement of greater than 90 while for irradiation process the removal was little less than 90 hence it can be inferred that integrating s nzvi with the advanced oxidation process can help to improve the chromium removal process in all these integrative processes the presence of starch as the encapsulating agent played a vital role the study also showed that orp and initial ph could be used as reliable tools for measuring chromium removal performance as they were strongly correlated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13848,hexavalent chromium removal from wastewater is a major challenge for researchers the study attempts to use starch modified nanoscale zero valent iron for hexavalent chromium removal starch was used to reduce the agglomeration tendency of nanoparticle which was evident in sem micrographs the effects of various process variables were investigated including ph nanoparticle dosage initial chromium concentration mixing rate temperature the results showed that all these variables except ph were positively correlated with removal efficiency the ph played a vital role in cr vi removal performance the removal performance of bare nanoscale zero valent iron was below 50 for chromium concentration 50 mg l the starch encapsulated nanoscale zero valent iron worked well for lower chromium concentration but at higher concentration 50 mg l the performance stagnated to around 65 in order to improve the performance for higher chromium concentration the nanoparticle was integrated with various other remedial methods like ultrasonication irradiation aeration and fenton system all these remedial techniques generate reactive oxygen species in the system which together with nanoscale zero valent iron greatly enhance the removal performance it was seen that among various systems created the removal performance for us nzvi system uv nzvi system aeration nzvi system and fenton nzvi system increased to 92 86 7 91 93 respectively the removal efficiency was seen to be strongly correlated with parameters like orp and final ph of the system and thus can be used for monitoring removal performance keywords wastewater treatment cr vi removal nanoscale zvi starch encapsulated zvi integrated systems ultrasonication uv irradiation 1 introduction the inevitable use of chromium in industrial processes such as leather tanning metal finishing textile dyeing batteries 1 3 has generated serious environmental concerns chromium can exist in many oxidation states with trivalent and hexavalent being the most common 4 the toxicological and environmental profile of cr iii and cr vi is very different the trivalent form is considered safer in terms of toxicity mobility and stability than hexavalent form it also contributes to the protein metabolism of the human body on the contrary cr vi has been reported to cause many severe health ailments and is considered toxic and carcinogenic 5 7 due to these features of the trivalent form of chromium the most common route of treating hexavalent chromium is by reducing it to a less toxic trivalent state 8 several conventional physical and chemical treatment technologies like chemical precipitation membrane filtration biosorption and ion exchange are available but these technologies suffer from several drawbacks like energy intensive hazardous waste generation high operation cost 9 10 as cr vi cr iii has high standard reduction potential at low ph e g e cr2 o7 2 cr3 1 36 v hexavalent chromium can be easily reduced therefore using a reducing agent to treat hexavalent chromium is emerging as economic and efficient technology 11 nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi by virtue of its large specific surface area and high reactivity is considered strong reductant and has gained attention for its environmental remediation capability 12 13 the tendency of nzvi to agglomerate rapidly due to van der waal and magnetic forces results in decreased mobility of nzvi which greatly limits its application 14 to enhance the stability and mobility of nanoparticles organic stabilizers are often attached onto surface of such material to provide necessary electrostatic repulsion 15 several stabilizers like dextran 16 carboxymethyl cellulose cmc 17 chitosan 18 has been used successfully to achieve higher dispersibility and performance starch exhibits favorable characteristics like biocompatibility nontoxicity and biodegradability and thus emerging as a popular encapsulating alternative sun et al reported that starch enhanced the dispersibility and hydrophilicity of nzvi which increased their tendency to be suspended and adhered 19 rezazadeh et al showed that adding molecules of starch to zero valent iron helped increase the stability of adsorbent prevent oxidation of nanoparticle and improve the reactivity of nanoparticle for nitrate removal 20 though a lot of literature is presently studying the effect of adding cmc and guar gum to improve zero valent iron performance the effect of adding starch to zero valent iron for chromium removal has not been explored extensively therefore in the present study the performance of starch as a stabilizer was investigated the effect of different reaction parameters on its performance was also analyzed though biopolymers like starch can work well as a stabilizer helping enhance the dispersibility of nanoparticle through electro steric forces facilitating better electron transfer it fails to improve the electron selectivity of nanoparticle towards target contaminant hence a lot of electron coming from nanoparticle gets involved in side reactions with oxygen present in solution and nanoparticle exhausts itself unnecessarily thus enhancing electron selectivity is as important as electron transfer the presence of surface coating ensures controlled exposure of nanoparticle over a period of time thus the electron gets transferred to solution not abruptly but in a uniform way resulting in more effective electron transfer in order to get maximum performance of any nanoparticle both aspects are equally crucial the area of enhancing electron selectivity has remained a grey area in zero valent iron technology for a very long time only in the past five years we have seen an increased focus in this area one major way of improving electron selectivity is by generating reactive oxygen species ros through activation of molecular oxygen present in solution which would otherwise compete with target contaminants for electrons in the present study we have tried to couple various techniques of surface coating of nanoparticle to get improved electron transfer with techniques of generating reactive oxygen species to get improved electron selectivity in order to achieve this starch coated nzvi s nzvi was coupled with advanced techniques like ultrasonication irradiation aeration and fenton system to the best of our knowledge starch stabilized zero valent iron has not been integrated with four different strategies to generate reactive oxygen species in a single study so far integrating nanoparticles with these techniques not only affects the removal performance but also reduces the time for removal ultrasonication technique utilizes the principle that when sound waves above 20 khz pass the system it induces pressure variation and cavitation that grow and collapse this cavitation alters the interaction between nanoparticle and contaminant and also generates fresh reactive oxygen species which affects the reaction fu et al showed that ultrasound could lead to significant synergy in the removal of se iv by zvi because ultrasound can promote the generation of oh radicals and accelerate advanced fenton process 21 gao et al also reported that the degradation of propranolol by nzvi activated persulfate with ultrasound assistance could increase notably 22 uv irradiation system utilizes the fact that when a system is exposed to irradiation based on its photocatalytic ability it creates electron hole pair these electrons further create reactive oxygen species which enhances the removal process morgada et al found that uv vis light enhanced as v removal by nzvi this effect was partly attributed to the role of semiconductors of different fe ii fe iii oxides formed as nzvi shell during synthesis 23 montesino et al showed that cr vi removal using nanoparticulated zero valent iron was enhanced by visible light due to the heterogeneous photocatalytic process promoted by iron oxides present as an external layer of nanoparticle acting as semiconductor after excitation with light 24 the aeration process on the other hand introduces fresh molecular oxygen to the system which generates reactive oxygen species helping the reaction to progress in a recent study pang et al showed that zvi could react with molecular oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species which are able to oxidize and even mineralize organic compound 25 the fenton system involves the introduction of hydrogen peroxide to the system which has been reported to enhance the removal ability greatly kang et al reported higher removal efficiency for 1 4 dioxane and as iii when nzvi was integrated with hydrogen peroxide 26 li et al 2018b showed that applying strong oxidant like hydrogen peroxide could accelerate the reductive removal of nitrate and selenite by zvi 27 any contaminant removal using a reducing agent produces simultaneous oxidizing and reducing conditions in the system which can be measured using changes in oxidation reduction potential orp and changes in the final ph of the system the orp and final ph has been used in many studies to monitor the reducing conditions within the system yu et al showed that online orp ph and do dissolved oxygen monitoring data can be used as input to obtain a reliable evaluation of the effectiveness of nzvi fenton process for azo dye removal from textile wastewater 28 in another work yu et al showed that monitoring orp ph and do in a reactor presented a good correlation with cr vi removal efficiency thus monitoring orp and ph have good capabilities to evaluate cr vi removal efficiency 29 the objectives of the present study are i synthesis and characterization of starch coated nzvi s nzvi ii study the performance of starch coated nzvi and parameters affecting hexavalent chromium removal iii integrating starch nzvi with advanced techniques like ultrasonication irradiation fenton and aeration system iv monitor the reducing condition of the system using orp and final ph during the removal process 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of starch encapsulated nzvi s nzvi starch encapsulated zero valent iron was prepared by a modified method briefly 50 ml of 0 4 m nabh4 was added dropwise into 50 ml of 0 2 m feso4 7h2o solution containing one gram of potato starch as stabilizer after reaction was over the black solid particles were collected magnetically and washed three times using pure ethanol and then oven dried at 60 c overnight 31 2 2 characterization of starch stabilized nzvi to determine the crystal structure and phase identification of synthesized starch nanoscale zero valent iron x ray diffractometer model d8 focus bruker germany was employed in an angle range of 20 70 with cu kα radiation λ 0 154 å the surface morphology of s nzvi and chemical characterization were done using scanning electron microscope with edx model s 3400 n hitachi japan to explore surface interaction and presence of functional groups ftir spectrophotometer was used model spectrum 2000 perkin elmer usa 2 3 batch reaction experiment the effects of different parameters on chromium removal were investigated by batch experiment using a 500 ml conical flask for monitoring effect of ph on chromium removal efficiency oxidation reduction potential and final ph of the system multimeter with microprocessor mettle toledo ma 235 ph ion analyzer was employed in order to understand effect of initial chromium concentration on removal efficiency and amount of chromium removal uv vis spectrophotometer model lambda 35 perkin elmer usa was used at 540 nm following standard 1 5diphenyl carbazide method the stirring speed and temperature of system was controlled using magnetic stirrer with hot plate model remi 2 the experiments were carried out using 500 ml solution under various s nzvi dosage from 0 25 g l to 1 0 g l reaction temperature from 208 k to 308 k initial chromium concentration 10 mg l to 50 mg l and initial ph values from 3 to 9 for 180 min at certain time intervals aliquots were taken out and filtered to remove particles by a 0 45 μm membrane filter then the residual concentration of cr vi was measured in the process of the experiment one parameter changed while all other remained constant the removal efficiency of cr vi was calculated as follows r e c o c t c o 100 where re is the chromium removal efficiency and c 0 and c t mg l is the concentration of hexavalent chromium in the aqueous solution at initial time and time t min respectively 2 4 integrating s nzvi with other techniques in order to achieve appreciable chromium removal performance for higher chromium concentration s nzvi was integrated with various techniques like ultrasound us light irradiation uv aeration and fenton system the reaction conditions were the same as that for batch reaction all these experiments were carried out in 1 l flask with 250 ml solution about 1 ml solution was extracted using syringe within 1 5 10 15 30 45 60 90 and 120 min respectively the aliquots were then filtered and residual concentration was measured the orp and ph probe were also inserted and readings were taken during the experiment duration in order to study chromium removal performance of s nzvi ultrasound system we used an ultrasonication bath the effect of different ultrasonication frequency 37 khz and 80 khz was studied on chromium removal performance the effect of sonication temperature during ultrasonication was also measured the synthesized s nzvi was also integrated with uv irradiation system uv bulb of 1 15 w with different wavelength 365 nm and 254 nm kept at 15 cm resulting in different intensities of 1350 and 1100 μw cm2 were used the s nzvi was further integrated with aeration system aeration was conducted using lp 20 diphagram blower resun co ltd china aeration flowrate 2 5 l min and 3 5 l min was controlled by a flow meter fenton system was also used along with s nzvi the dosage of hydrogen peroxide was 10 ml l 20 ml l and 30 ml l respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization sem micrograph for bare nzvi is shown in fig 1 a the particles formed large spherical particles that stick together resulting in large particle size this indicates towards tendency of nzvi without encapsulation to aggregate due to either electrostatic forces among nanoparticle or surface tension interaction of particles thus lower surface area and poor reactivity can be expected when these nanoparticles were coated with starch they provided double positive impact a layer of polymer molecule on the surface provided strong steric repulsive forces and increasing surface charge of nanoparticle provided electrostatic stabilization resulting in uniform dispersion and smaller particle size as shown in fig 1b therefore the starch coating was evenly distributed onto the surface of the nanoparticle resulting in discrete well dispersed and close to the spherical shaped nanoparticle micrographs showing s nzvi reaction with hexavalent chromium is presented in fig 1c we see in this micrograph agglomerated lump of nanoparticles which were due to complete corrosion of nanoparticle that indicates enhanced one to one contact between particle and contaminant due to improved surface area 32 edx graph for fresh s nzvi is shown in fig 2 a the iron content is 35 16 followed by oxygen 29 89 the high iron content demonstrates the formation of zero valent iron while the presence of oxygen is due to the iron oxide shell formed at the surface of zero valent iron and hydroxyl group present in starch which forms a soft shell over entire nanoparticle thus edx confirms both formations of zero valent iron and the presence of a starch coating on nzvi surface in fig 2b which is for s nzvi after reaction with hexavalent chromium we find that oxygen content reaches up to 32 19 while iron content decreases to 25 71 marking corrosion of nanoparticle during the process of reducing chromium to its lower transition state the rise in oxygen may also be attributed to the involvement of nzvi in side reactions with oxygen present in the solution which is often undesired therefore it indicates that starch though helps to improve the surface area and overall dispersion of nanoparticle it was unable to prevent side reaction with oxygen present in solution thus it can be concluded that starch may improve electron transfer from fe0 core by maintaining controlled exposure of nanoparticle but it did not improve electron selectivity of the nanoparticle towards target contaminant ftir graph for fresh s nzvi and s nzvi after reaction with hexavalent chromium are shown in fig 3 a and b in fig 3a it can be seen that prominent peaks appear at 3340 cm 1 represents hydroxyl bond interaction and peak at 1643 represents hydroxyl bond as it is known that molecules of starch contain hydroxyl group in each repeat unit of starch which is favorable for complexation with the iron nanoparticle the peak at 2977 cm 1 shows ch stretching in coh group which is due to the presence of ch2oh group in the starch molecule which behaves as a capping agent for the nanoparticle helping in preventing aggregation the peak at 1045 cm 1 and 1043 cm 1 represents co bond is due to the presence of acetal functional group a carbon that has two ether oxygen attached the peak at 667 cm 1 represents feo interaction 33 this indicates that iron was present and actively interacted with starch during the fabrication process the peak at 601 cm 1 and 411 cm 1 indicates the presence of phosphate group in the nanoparticle which is because of the various starch present potato starch contains phosphate ester thus these functional groups present in starch will ensure the formation of adsorption layer that will behave as a steric shield that will protect particles from approaching each other fig 3b shows s nzvi after chromium removal it can be clearly seen that peaks have changed after adsorption these changes indicate the adsorption of cr vi on s nzvi the changes in intensity of the peaks show important role of functional group in adsorption of cr vi after adsorption the peak for hydroxyl group acetal functional group and phosphorus group changed which represent the enhanced activity of these functional group with chromium ion the peak for hydroxyl group becomes broader indicating a more significant role of the hydroxyl group in chromium reaction the peak intensity also decreased suggesting the rate of decrement in functional group which was responsible for the aggregation of s nzvi nanoparticle after reaction with chromium the xrd peak for fresh s nzvi is shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the characteristic peak for zero valent iron appear at 2 θ 44 8 confirming the presence of fe another peak with low intensity appears at 35 which represents fe2o3 suggesting that iron oxide shell was formed in the fabrication process in fig 4 s nzvi after chromium reaction was also represented the peak of fe at 44 8 diminished significantly as it got consumed in the presence of chromium anion it can be seen that a new prominent peak appears at 20 suggesting the formation of feooh indicating oxidation of s nzvi peak at 25 7 indicates the presence of organic matter showing interaction of starch coating in chromium adsorption the peaks at 31 and 63 14 indicate the presence of fe3o4 suggesting that s nzvi readily oxidized itself to a higher transition state in order to reduce chromium to its lower transition state the peak at 35 becomes more intense indicating that fe oxidized itself to fe2 showing the progress of reaction 35 3 2 effect of process parameters on batch reaction several studies previously have reported a strong influence of ph on chromium remediation process as seen in fig 5 a the chromium removal increased with decrease in ph value the chromium removal for ph 3 5 7 and 9 was 69 24 55 14 51 71 42 31 respectively it is evident that at lower ph better removal was observed this may be attributed to three aspect i lower ph results in enhanced corrosion of nzvi which promotes chromium removal ii increase in h concentration results in protonation of surface hydroxyl group which improves electrostatic attraction between s nzvi and cr vi anion resulting in enhanced electron transfer from s nzvi to target contaminant iii lower ph results in increased acid washing of s nzvi surface resulting in fresh active sites being available to chromium anions for reaction 36 it was also noticed that at high and neutral ph low chromium removal was observed this may be due to increased precipitation of fe iii hydroxides on iron surface which reduces electron transfer between nzvi and cr vi anion 37 thus the ph value of 3 4 considered optimum for effective chromium removal the effect of initial chromium concentration on cr vi removal using s nzvi was presented in fig 5b it was seen that removal for low initial chromium concentration of 10 mg l and 20 mg l was 100 and 99 87 respectively thus very high removal was obtained at low initial chromium concentration this was because for low chromium concentration the available fixed dosage was enough to interact and reduce the target contaminant successfully it was also noticed that as initial chromium concentration was increased to 50 mg l the removal decreased to 68 83 this may be due to the passivation layer of fe iii cr iii hydroxide developed on the surface of s nzvi that provided resistance to electron transfer from s nzvi to target contaminant higher concentration also caused limited s nzvi getting exposed to a lot of chromium ions this inhibited proper contact between adsorbate and adsorbent necessary for effective adsorption and reduction process it led to the exhaustion of s nzvi due to rapid oxidation 38 it also indicated the fact that at low concentration s nzvi could get involved in side reactions with oxygen species in solution and still achieve remarkable removal results with an increase in initial chromium concentration s nzvi could no longer afford to get involved in any side reaction as it strongly affected its chromium removal performance therefore with an increase in initial chromium concentration need for strategies that can improve electron selectivity became more pronounced clearly the starch coating on nanoparticle did improved dispersion which resulted in improved electron transfer it could not control the undesirable side reactions the effect of s nzvi dosage was shown in fig 5c the chromium removal efficiency increased as the dosage increased the chromium removal was minimum at 49 3 for a dosage of 0 15 g l and maximum removal was 68 91 at 0 5 g l this was because at a higher dosage more active sites were available for reaction facilitating more one to one contact between contaminant and nanoparticle it can also be seen that unlike very rapid removal of chromium within the first few minutes followed by slow removal over the remaining period as reported for zero valent iron without encapsulation the addition of starch resulted in the gradual removal of chromium over the entire period suggesting that starch provided controlled exposure of s nzvi which prevented its rapid corrosion in a short span 39 fig 5d illustrates the effect of stirring speed on removal efficiency the removal percentage improved a little with increasing stirring speed from about 60 at 450 rpm to more than 65 at 650 rpm this may be due to the fact that higher stirring speed facilitates mixing thereby enhancing one to one contact between nanoparticle and contaminant higher stirring speed also reduces the chances of agglomeration of magnetic nanoparticle thereby increasing the surface area available for reaction the effect of system temperature on removal efficiency was shown in fig 5e the removal efficiency was 64 2 66 8 and 69 03 for temperature 288 k 298 k and 308 k respectively thus chromium removal improved though slightly with increasing temperature generally increased temperature facilitates higher diffusion of chromium onto the s nzvi surface the removal was not very significant with change in temperature suggesting that change in temperature could not alter the surface porosity of s nzvi to a great extent which is responsible for enhanced intraparticle diffusion and increased chemical interaction at s nzvi surface 40 the batch reaction at optimum parameters initial chromium concentration 50 mg l ph 3 s nzvi dosage 0 5 g l stirring speed 550 rpm temperature 298 k was shown in fig 6 a the removal efficiency for starch bare nzvi and starch encapsulated nzvi was studied it was found that starch alone was not effective in chromium removal as the removal efficiency was less than 10 one reason may be the low adsorption capability of potato starch due to its low specific surface area of 0 15 m2 g which greatly limits chromium removal moreover studies have reported that native starch is mostly inert towards chemical reaction unless they are pretreated 41 for nzvi without any encapsulation the removal efficiency was around 55 this may be due to the aggregation of bare nanoparticle resulting from electrostatic attraction and van der waals forces among the particles which greatly increases the size of the nanoparticle thereby reducing the surface area available for chromium adsorption when nanoscale zero valent iron was coated using starch chromium removal reached upto 70 indicating that starch was able to reduce the tendency of aggregation and hence was effective in improving the chromium removal efficiency the starch coating prevents aggregation through electro steric stabilization of nanoparticle the starch coating provides electrostatic repulsion to nanoparticle by increasing the surface charge which increases the repulsive forces between the particle the starch coating also provides steric stabilization through the presence of long chain organic molecules on the surface which resist particle particle attraction thus the addition of starch to nzvi was able to improve chromium removal performance by 1 3 times as compared to bare nzvi the reducing condition present during the batch reaction was shown in fig 6b oxidation reduction potential orp is a measure of electron activity in a solution and indicates a relative tendency to accept or transfer electron it was seen that orp change was maximum for s nzvi it dropped from 221 mv to 61 mv the rapid decrease in orp level shows that more electron was transferred to the target contaminant which led to reduction of cr vi to its lower transition state of cr iii and subsequent oxidation of fe to its higher state of fe iii it can be noted that after 60 min the decline in orp is slower this may be attributed to the fact that after a certain time both oxidized fe iii and reduced cr iii got accumulated forming fe iii cr iii hydroxide layer on the surface of nanoparticle which greatly inhibited the electron transfer from s nzvi core to target contaminant the final ph reached the highest value for s nzvi as more oh ions are generated when cr vi gets reduced to cr iii by nzvi particle 41 42 it can be seen that the orp decline was most rapid and higher for s nzvi than for bare nzvi or starch this shows that starch encapsulation helped in more efficient electron transfer to target contaminants than others resulting in greater chromium removal 3 3 integration study the effect of different ultrasonic frequency on chromium removal efficiency was investigated and the result was shown in fig 7 a it was found that at a higher sonication frequency of 80 khz better removal frequency of 92 3 was obtained while for 37 khz the chromium removal remained 85 as reported in several literature ultrasound causes growth and collapse of the gas bubble cavitation producing high transient temperature and pressure which leads to the formation of free radicals oh and ooh via thermal dissociation of oxygen and water these free radicals recombine outside the cavitation bubble to form hydrogen peroxide at higher sonication frequency more free radicals are formed enhancing the reaction 43 when s nzvi is integrated with ultrasonication two sources of electron transfer to target contaminant gets triggered the two sources are i electron from fe core to chromium ion ii reactive oxygen species generated from thermal dissociation of molecular oxygen the presence of an additional source of electron from molecular activation of oxygen greatly enhances the overall removal process the reducing condition of the system marked by orp and the final ph is shown in fig 7b the orp values for frequency 80 khz decreased from 127 mv to 94 within 10 min and further decreased to 19 mv at the end of the reaction the orp values for 37 khz decreased less sharply from 150 mv to 118 mv in 10 min and further to 25 mv at the end of the reaction it can be seen that orp value though significant was not rapid in the first 30 min for both frequencies this shows that starch encapsulation was able to provide a controlled release of electrons from s nzvi core as the covering dissolved gradually over a period of time and not instantaneously also overall orp values decreased more sharply for 80 khz than 37 khz this may be due to the fact that at higher frequency the tendency of reactive oxygen species formation was more which led to greater electron availability for reaction with chromium than at lower frequency therefore higher frequency resulted in a more conducive reducing condition it can be noted that the orp values are correlated well with chromium removal percentage which also showed better removal at higher a frequency the final ph also synchronizes with orp and removal efficiency results the final ph for 80 khz rose sharply from 5 8 to 7 5 in the first 10 min and finally rose to 9 8 here it can be noted that the ph increase was sharper in the first 30 min of reaction and then gradual this may be attributed to the fact that hydroxyl ions are generated when a reaction takes place between a molecule of fe and cr vi thus the final ph shows the progress of the reaction at the beginning of the reaction more hydroxyl ions are generated due to better one to one contact between s nzvi and chromium molecules however as the reaction proceeds fe iii cr iii hydroxide layer formed on the s nzvi surface hinders fe cr vi contact limiting the generation of hydroxyl ion the rise in final ph was more at a higher frequency showing a more efficient reaction between chromium and s nzvi molecules than at lower frequency the effect of sonication temperature was investigated keeping sonication frequency constant at 37 khz and the result of the same is shown in fig 8 a it was found that the removal efficiency was higher for higher temperature with the removal of 92 for 308 k and 88 for 298 k high sonication temperature facilitates the reaction by reducing aggregation tendency among particles by disrupting strong magnetic interaction and van der waal interaction among nanoparticle this enhances the active site for the reaction high temperature also facilitates greater adsorption due to enhanced diffusion of contaminants onto the nanoparticle surface 44 the reducing conditions were shown in fig 8b the orp values at 288 k decreased slightly from 273 mv to 193 mv and further to 30 mv at the end of the reaction the orp values for 308 k decreased sharply from 188 mv to 129 mv in the first 10 min and finally to 26 mv at the end of the reaction the final ph also showed that more hydroxyl ions were generated at high temperature as the final ph rose sharply from 5 5 9 8 for temperature 308 k as against 9 1 for 288 k the effect of different light intensity on removal efficiency was shown in fig 9 a it was found that removal efficiency for light using a 15 w uv bulb with wavelength 365 nm kept at 15 cm was higher at 86 7 than for wavelength 254 nm 82 the removal in uv irradiation follows photocatalytic reaction and also free radical generation path the heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction takes place due to the presence of the external layer of iron oxide acting as a semiconductor bulk iron oxides have bandgap energies between 1 94 ev 2 2 ev which behaves as a metallic conductor after the excitation of iron oxides with light energy higher than their bandgap electron hole pair is formed and redox reaction involving these charge carriers can transform cr vi into lower states in addition to this fe0 present in the core act as hole scavenger facilitating charge separation and enhancing chromium removal moreover the electron generated may also react with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species o2o these reactive oxygen species react with a proton h to form perhydroxyl ions 45 these reactive oxygen species also enhance the removal reaction it can be seen that though irradiation facilitated chromium removal still removal could not go beyond 86 for 365 nm wavelength this may be due to the fact that the starch polymer coating over nzvi inhibited the irradiation process because starch polymer has higher bandgap energy and acts as an insulator in comparison to iron oxide shell which acts as conductor thus starch coating limited the excitation process of the electron from iron oxide shell the reducing conditions were presented in fig 9b the orp for wavelength 265 nm did not decrease very rapidly with a gradual decrease of 243 mv from 312 mv in the first 10 min and finally to 54 mv at the end of the reaction the orp for wavelength 365 nm also followed a similar pattern but the final orp value was more steep at 16 mv at the end of the reaction it can be seen that orp values declined gradually and could not reach the negative value this may be due to the fact that starch coating did not dissolve completely till the end of the experiment and it continued to hinder the direct contact between the light source and iron oxide shell the final value of ph also increased from 5 2 9 3 for the wavelength of 365 nm the effect of different aeration flowrate on removal efficiency was shown in fig 10 a it was seen that for aeration flowrate 2 5 l min the removal efficiency was 86 13 and that for flowrate 3 5 l min it increased to 91 this means that integrating starch nzvi with aeration system enhanced the removal performance mu et al reported that in aerobic nzvi process outward electron transfer takes place from iron core initiating two electron molecular oxygen activation o2 h2o2 and surface bound ferrous ions on iron oxide shell favor single electron molecular oxygen activation o2 o2 h2o2 46 the reducing condition during aeration starch nzvi system was shown in fig 10b the orp values fell rapidly from 257 mv to 185 mv in the first 10 min following a steep decrease of 8 mv at the end of the reaction the final ph values also showed a steep rise from 5 4 9 7 at the end of the reaction showing that enough hydroxyl ions were produced as a result of better interaction between chromium and s nzvi the effect of different hydrogen peroxide dosage on removal performance was shown in fig 11 a it was found that higher removal performance was obtained for higher peroxide dosage the removal performance for peroxide dosage 10 ml l remained at 85 which increased to 93 when the dosage was increased to 30 ml l hydrogen peroxide produces oh radicals these radicals have very high redox potential of 1 44 v producing very strong reducing conditions 47 the oh radical is produced by the following reaction 1 f e o h 2 o 2 2 h f e 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h 2 o 2 h o o h f e 3 the reducing conditions were shown in fig 11b the orp values for peroxide dosage 20 ml l and 30 ml l decreased sharply from 242 mv to 162 mv and 173 to 72 mv in first 10 min respectively further it decreased sharply to 21 mv for dosage 20 ml l and 32 mv for dosage 30 the ph also decreased sharply to 9 8 showing high discharge of hydroxyl ion due to the reduction of hexavalent chromium 3 4 conclusion in this study it was found that starch could be successfully used as an encapsulating agent to achieve high dispersion stability and reduce aggregation among nanoparticle for effective chromium removal the sem micrographs provided strong evidence that starch could help in improved dispersion the formation of fe was confirmed from the xrd graph it was noticed that the hydroxyl group played a prominent role in surface interaction indicating that starch which contains mainly hydroxyl group in the form of amylose and amylopectin played a crucial role in zero valent iron fabrication various evidence in this study indicated that starch coating helped in controlled exposure of zero valent iron enhancing electron transfer to chromium anion it also improved nanoparticle dispersion in the chromium solution the ph played a significant role in chromium removal it was seen that lower ph favored chromium removal as it enhanced protonation of surface hydroxyl group present in starch thus improving electrostatic attraction between s nzvi and chromium anion apart from ph and initial chromium concentration s nzvi dosage also affected chromium removal as available reactive sites were affected due to these parameters though starch coated nzvi showed appreciable performance of more than 95 removal at lower chromium concentration till 30 mg l as the concentration increased to 50 mg l the removal performance drastically reduced to near 65 in order to maintain high removal efficiency of s nzvi for chromium concentration higher than 30 mg l the nanoparticle was integrated with various techniques that can either activate molecular oxygen in solution to generate reactive oxygen species or enhance electron transfer from s nzvi core and shell to target contaminant in this pursuit s nzvi was integrated with techniques like ultrasonication fenton system and aeration system which showed remarkable improvement of greater than 90 while for irradiation process the removal was little less than 90 hence it can be inferred that integrating s nzvi with the advanced oxidation process can help to improve the chromium removal process in all these integrative processes the presence of starch as the encapsulating agent played a vital role the study also showed that orp and initial ph could be used as reliable tools for measuring chromium removal performance as they were strongly correlated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13849,to enhance the adsorption performance of natural calcium based montmorillonite ca mmt the polymeric hydroxyaluminum cation keggin al30 al30o8 oh 56 h2o 24 18 and cetylpyridinium chloride cpc were used to modify ca mmt for preparation of cpc al30 pillared montmorillonite composite cpc al30pmt the cpc al30pmt was characterized via analysis of its chemical and physical structure morphology surface properties and zeta potential the results showed that the al30 polymer cation and cpc successfully intercalated into the interlayer of ca mmt which increased the d001 value from 1 47 nm to 1 93 nm and increased the pore volume correspondingly the zeta potential was reversed from negative to positive after modification presenting a possibility to adsorb anionic contaminants from water the investigation of hexavalent chromium cr vi adsorption on cpc al30pmt showed that the removal of cr vi was positively correlated with the dosage of adsorbent and negatively correlated with the initial concentration of cr vi the ionic strength and the initial ph of the solution cpc al30pmt showed good cr vi removal performance with the maximum adsorption q e of 42 44 mg g the adsorption process conformed to freundlich model and pseudo second order kinetic model thermodynamics studies showed that adsorption was a spontaneous exothermic process electrostatic interaction ion exchange and reduction were the main mechanisms of the removal keywords polymeric hydroxyaluminum cation keggin al30 cetylpyridinium chloride cpc montmorillonite composites adsorption cr vi removal 1 introduction chromium is a toxic heavy metal that is widely used in industrial production and it can cause serious pollution if discharging to water environment without proper treatment 1 hexavalent chromium cr vi is generally considered more toxic to organisms than trivalent chromium cr iii and it has caused raising public concern regarding environmental risk due to its easy migration carcinogenicity and difficult degradability 2 therefore the removal of cr vi from water has attracted widespread attention from researchers at present the common strategies of cr vi removal from water include chemical methods biological treatment ion exchange and adsorption 3 5 among them the removal of cr vi using adsorbents such as biomass adsorbents zeolites activated carbon and clay minerals has been researched widely because of the simple operation and high efficiency 6 11 as a natural adsorption material montmorillonite has been extensively used because of its abundant reserves low cost environmental friendliness and high thermal stability 12 13 however the natural montmorillonite is negatively charged in neutral solution leading to electrostatic repulsion to cr vi anion furthermore the interlayer spacing and pore volume of the natural montmorillonite are small which limit the adsorption capacity of heavy metals for these reasons the modification of montmorillonite can usually be adopted to improve its adsorption performance the montmorillonite modification methods include inorganic organic and inorganic organic hybrid modification due to the limitation of single material inorganic or organic modification an increasing attention has been paid to the use of inorganic organic modification approaches to prepare montmorillonite composites 14 16 the hydroxyaluminum polymerized cation keggin al13 al13o4 oh 24 h2o 12 7 fig 1 a is an extensively used modifier for inorganic modification of montmorillonite hou et al 17 prepared al13 montmorillonite and found that both tartrate and oxalate could be effectively adsorbed on the modified montmorillonite zacharias et al 18 synthesized hydroxyl iron aluminum modified montmorillonite and reported on the effective adsorption of po4 3 during recent years the hydrolysis chemistry and characterization analysis technology of aluminum have been greatly developed 19 researchers have found that the additional titration of substances with a keggin type structure with alkali can form larger polycations 20 zhen et al 21 reported a new type of keggin al30 al30o8 oh 56 h2o 24 18 fig 1b polymer cation consisted of two al13 and four octahedral aluminum monomers compared with al13 al30 has a larger particle size higher ionic charge density and more hydroxyl groups 22 zhu et al 23 prepared keggin al30 inorganic pillared montmorillonite with excellent structural stability thus in this study keggin al30 was selected to modify the montmorillonite to prepare al30 pillared montmorillonite al30pmt although inorganic modified montmorillonite increases the specific surface area stability and interlayer spacing the introduction of cationic organic modifiers can increase the surface potential and the amount of functional groups of montmorillonite making the removal of cr vi more efficient 1 therefore al30pmt was further organically modified to prepare montmorillonite composites previous studies have shown that the organic modification of inorganic montmorillonite can further improve its adsorption performance wang et al 1 used dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dodecyl amine and al13 to modify montmorillonite for cr vi removal and the results showed that the adsorption performance of composite modified montmorillonite for cr vi was significantly better than that of inorganic or organic modification alone hu et al 14 reported that aluminum hydroxypolycation and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab were chosen to synthesize inorganic organic pillared montmorillonite the experimental data showed that when the aluminum hydroxypolycation was intercalated prior to ctab the adsorption of cr vi was higher comparing with those intercalated simultaneously or ctab pre intercalated cetylpyridinium chloride cpc shown in table s1 is a cationic surfactant widely used in environmental remediation 24 cpc has a pyridine head group and a hydrophobic alkyl chain with 16 carbon atoms which has been used to modify montmorillonite successfully 2 the organic modification increased the surface potential of the montmorillonite making it more selective for anions adsorption 25 according to its special amphiphilic properties cpc was selected for organic modification of al30pmt to prepare cpc al30pmt however the attention to the removal of high concentrations of cr vi in solutions using inorganic organic hybrid modified montmorillonite is still sparse in previous studies in this study cpc al30pmt was used to remove high concentration cr vi confirming the application potential of the composite in the treatment of high concentration chromium containing wastewater the samples before and after modification were characterized by solid state 27al magic angle spinning nuclear

solutions were prepared using deionized water di water prepared by ultrapure water system shanghai high tech co ltd 2 2 preparation and characterization of cpc al30pmt 2 2 1 sample preparation the al30pmt was prepared according to the method of zhu et al 23 0 6 m naoh solution was slowly added at a rate of 1 ml min to a three necked flask placed in an oil bath at constant 95 c containing 1 0 m alcl3 solution to obtain a solution with a oh al3 molar ratio of 2 4 after continuous stirring for 12 h it was further aged for 24 h to obtain a colorless and transparent solution with a total al concentration of 0 2 m after that montmorillonite was added to reach the al montmorillonite concentration of 4 mmol g and the mixed solution was stirred for 24 h and then aged for 24 h finally the solid was centrifuged 12 000 rpm 10 min and separated from the aqueous phase the solid product was washed with di water until no chloride was detected with the agno3 solution the obtained solid was dried at 80 c and named as al30pmt the preparation process of cpc al30pmt was as follows according to the measured cec of al30pmt 121 31 meq 100 g 0 43 g cpc was added to a conical flask containing 50 ml di water followed by sonication of 15 min 1 0 g al30pmt was then added to the conical flask and shaken in a thermostatic water bath shaker for 24 h after the reaction the suspension was centrifuged 12 000 rpm for 10 min the obtained samples were washed with di water for 5 times and then dried at 80 c for 24 h the dried sample cpc al30pmt was ground to pass through a 200 mesh sieve and stored for further use 2 2 2 characterization of the sample the samples were subjected to 27al solid state nuclear magnetic measurement by a resonance spectrometer bruker avance iii 600 xrd d8 advance bruker

ftir nicolet is50 thermo fisher usa was used to analyze surface functional groups and chemical bonds the specific surface areas and pore size distribution of the sample were characterized using bet

elements content of the sample was characterized by sem eds nova nano sem450 fei the content and valence of metallic elements of the samples were detected by xps 250xi thermo fisher usa 2 3 cr vi adsorption experiment firstly 40 ml solution with the given initial cr vi concentration was added to the erlenmeyer flask which was placed in a water bath constant temperature oscillator to maintain constant solution temperatures t 298 k 313 k and 328 k then the adsorbent was added to the solution for cr vi adsorption after adsorption the suspension was separated using high speed centrifugation under 12 000 rpm and 10 min the solid phase and the liquid phase can be completely separated in a short time by the high speed centrifugation so the short term adsorption of the centrifugation process was negligible 1 14 17 the concentration of cr vi in the solution was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy aas sp 756 with the wavelength of 357 9 nm and with air flow of 4 5 l min and acetylene flow of 1 l min respectively the removal efficiency re and equilibrium adsorption capacity q e of cr vi were calculated by eqs 1 and 2 2 1 r e c 0 c e c 0 100 2 q e c 0 c e v m where c 0 and c e represent the initial concentration of cr vi mg l and the concentration of cr vi in the solution at adsorption equilibrium mg l respectively v refers the solution volume ml m is the adsorbent mass g 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the samples 3 1 1 solid state 27al mas nmr and xrd characterization solid state27al mas nmr characterization results are shown in fig 2 a the strong and sharp peak at 2 0 ppm was attributed to the presence of octahedral monomer al in ca mmt 26 the two broad peaks at 57 6 and 68 6 ppm were attributed to the substitution of si4 by al3 indicating the presence of tetrahedral al 27 the signal at 2 4 ppm was attributed to the octahedral al in layers of ca mmt and external shells of al30 cation asymmetry of octahedral al in the shell of al30 made the peak wider than that of ca mmt 2 0 ppm with the intercalation of al30 cations the signal of tetrahedral al in ca mmt sheets shifted from 57 6 ppm to 59 6 ppm this is due to the interaction between al30 cations and the charged layers of ca mmt the strong resonance peak appearing at 67 9 ppm is the signal peak of tetrahedral al in the al30 cation 28 confirming successful preparation of al30pmt according to the xrd characterization results fig 2b the d001 value of ca mmt was 1 47 nm which is a typical calcium based montmorillonite 29 after modification the d001 diffraction peaks of the two modified samples all transferred to lower angles and the d001 values of al30pmt and cpc al30pmt were 1 89 nm and 1 93 nm respectively indicating that the polymeric hydroxyl aluminum cation and cpc both played a role in increasing the interlayer spacing of the montmorillonite the intercalation of cpc only slightly enlarged the layer spacing this is mainly due to the steric hindrance caused by the intercalated large sized polymer aluminum cations which makes the cpc not fully accessible to the montmorillonite layers the diffraction peak at 2θ 9 1 was caused by the intercalation of a large number of al30 particles 23 the peak disappeared after the intercalation of cpc into the interlayers of montmorillonite the diffraction peak of 2θ 19 7 is a characteristic peak of montmorillonite 29 indicating that the modification does not change the layered structure of montmorillonite 3 1 2 characterization of sample structure bet analysis the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of various samples in fig 3 show that they have the type iv isotherms iupac classification with the hysteresis loop of type h3 iupic classification 30 indicating that the predominant pore structure of these samples are slit shaped pores or plate like particles 7 in addition the hysteresis loop of cpc al30pmt is smaller than that of others which is due to the fact that the specific surface area and pore volume of cpc al30pmt are smaller than that of ca mmt and al30pmt the significant increase in n2 adsorption around p p 0 0 45 is attributed to the existence of mesopore or a small number of macropore structures 31 when p p 0 is close to 1 the n2 molecules in the capillary tube of the outer surface of the particle make the adsorption curve to be slightly up warped due to condensation showing multilayer adsorption and implying the presence of mesopores as can be seen from table 1 and fig s1 the specific surface area and pore volume of cpc al30pmt are smaller than the other two samples on the contrary cpc al30pmt has the highest average pore size the decrease in specific surface area was due to the blockage of structural channels caused by cpc intercalation in the montmorillonite interlayer or bonded to the clay edge the xrd characterization results showed that the interlayer distance increased after modification but the change in specific surface area was not only affected by the interlayer distance but also related to factors such as the amount of modifier intercalation and its molecular size 32 the intercalation of cpc polymer formed a higher steric hindrance in the montmorillonite interlayer 33 which made it difficult for nitrogen molecules to enter the structural channel smoothly so the cpc al30pmt showed a small specific surface area in addition a large amount of cpc molecules in montmorillonite were adsorbed on the surface of the sample by tail tail interaction which caused cpc to occupy the pores of montmorillonite and reduced the pore volume of the sample the electrostatic repulsion and steric repulsion between cpc molecules caused some pores expanded leading to a higher average pore diameter of cpc al30pmt 34 35 although the specific surface area of cpc al30pmt decreased significantly its adsorption ability for cr vi was higher than the others which indicated that the mechanisms of cr vi adsorption on cpc al30pmt have been changed see the following studies 3 1 3 ftir characterization it can be seen from fig 4 that the difference of ftir spectra of al30pmt and ca mmt are not obvious indicating that the functional groups of the two samples had no significant change after the al30 modification in the ftir spectra the absorption peak at 513 cm 1 belongs to the bending vibration of mgo bond the peaks of 1041 cm 1 and 914 cm 1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of sio bond and the bending vibration of alo bond respectively 36 the band at 1640 cm 1 is attributed to the oh bending vibrational of adsorbed water and in the spectra of cpc al30pmt this band shows an attenuation indicating that the intercalation of the hydrophobic alkyl chain of cpc has an exclusion effect on the water molecules 36 an obvious absorption peak of cpc al30pmt sample at 1468 cm 1 is ascribed to the shear vibration and antisymmetric deformation vibration of the ch2 group 37 the asymmetric and symmetrical stretching vibration peaks of the ch bond in ch2 n appear at 2916 and 2847 cm 1 respectively indicating that cpc have been successfully loaded on the interlayer or surface of montmorillonite 38 the band at 3379 cm 1 of cpc is attributed to the cn stretching vibration but it is not shown in cpc al30pmt possibly due to that the positively charged surface of the cpc al30pmt limited its vibration 29 3 1 4 zeta potential investigation the zeta potential measurements of ca mmt al30pmt and cpc al30pmt under varying ph values are shown in fig 5 as the ph value increased from 2 to 12 the zeta potential of ca mmt decreased from 8 44 mv to 32 98 mv at ph 7 the zeta potential of al30pmt was positive which was attributed to the larger number of al oh2 functional groups in the al30pmt in alkaline environment a large number of amphoteric hydroxides such as al oh 4 were formed on the surface of al30pmt due to the oh present in the solution which switched the zeta potential of al30pmt from positive to negative 19 20 the zeta potential of cpc al30pmt remained positive with the ph ranging from 2 to 12 and higher than the others this is due to the highly positively charged al30 cations and the cpc micelles formed on the surface 39 cpc formed a micelle arrangement through van der waals force and hydrophobic effect which exposed positively charged n functional groups on the surface of montmorillonite resulting in the cpc al30pmt surface always maintaining a positive potential with the increase of the ph the adsorption of oh on cpc al30pmt reduced its zeta potential but remained positive which suggests that it is easier to remove anionic pollutants from wastewater by using cpc al30pmt than using ca mmt and al30pmt 3 1 5 sem characterization the sem profiles of montmorillonite before and after modification are shown in fig 6 and table s2 ca mmt fig 6a and al30pmt fig 6b both showed a sheet structure but the sheet structure of ca mmt was more combined tight while the layer of al30pmt was relatively loose indicating that the pillaring effect of polymerized hydroxylaluminum ions increased the montmorillonite layer spacing as can be seen from fig 6c the morphology of cpc al30pmt was curled and wrinkled and a noticeable rough structure was observed which was caused by the intercalation of cpc molecules the severely curled and loose lamellar morphology made cpc al30pmt easier to contact with cr vi this is consistent with the report by hu et al 14 from table s2 the al content of al30pmt is higher than that of ca mmt further indicating that the al30 polymer cation was successfully intercalated into the montmorillonite interlayer after cpc modification the content of element c increased significantly and the element cl appeared in the sample indicating that some of the cpc was not bound to al30pmt through ion exchange but was bonded to the surface of al30pmt through hydrophobic interaction see section 3 3 3 2 adsorption of cr vi on cpc al30pmt 3 2 1 the effect of the initial concentration the effect of initial concentration on cr vi adsorption is shown in fig 7 as can be seen from fig 7a the ca mmt could hardly adsorb cr vi due to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged clay surface and the cr vi anion after al30 modification the cr vi adsorption capacity of al30pmt was higher than ca mmt it was attributed that the polymeric hydroxylaluminum cation increased the interlayer spacing of montmorillonite and the increasing zeta potential enhanced the electrostatic attraction between al30pmt and cr vi however the cr vi adsorption capacity of al30pmt was far less than that of cpc al30pmt this phenomenon can be attributed to 1 the inorganic organic modification further expanded the montmorillonite interlayer spacing and made the structure looser which is beneficial for cr vi to enter the interlayer of the adsorbent 2 cl in cpc al30pmt exchanged with cr vi anion in solution see section 3 3 which improved the adsorption ability of adsorbent 3 cpc al30pmt had more positive charges at ph 2 and the electrostatic attraction with cr vi anion also promoted the adsorption of cpc al30pmt to cr vi the adsorption of cr vi on cpc al30pmt at different initial concentrations is shown in fig 7b as the initial concentration increased from 10 mg l to 1000 mg l the re gradually decreased from 92 38 to 20 45 at low initial concentrations there are many unoccupied adsorption sites in the adsorbent so the majority of cr vi anion can be adsorbed as the initial concentration increases most sites are occupied by cr vi anion resulting in the decrease of re and the increase of q e increased from 1 85 mg g to 42 44 mg g 3 2 2 the effect of adsorbent dosage as can be seen from fig 8 re increased with the increase of adsorbent dosage this is because the increase of the dosage can provide more active sites so that more cr vi ions in the solution are adsorbed to cpc al30pmt however with the increase of the dosage from 0 05 to 0 5 g the q e gradually decreased from 65 72 to 24 71 mg g rathinam et al 40 referred to this phenomenon as the concentration gradient splitting effect between adsorbent and adsorbate at lower dosages the adsorbents are more dispersed and most of the active sites can be efficiently combined with cr vi thus exhibiting a higher q e at higher dosages the collision between adsorbent particles leads to particle aggregation causing a decrease in the effective active sites which contributed to the decrease in q e a similar phenomenon was also found in the study of banat et al 41 3 2 3 the effect of ph and ionic strength the effect of ph and ionic strength on cr vi adsorption is shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the adsorption of cr vi is highly dependent on ph and ionic strength the q e decreased with the increase of ph and ionic strength when the ph was in the range of 2 4 the q e decreased slowly with the increase of ph when the ph increased from 4 to 8 the q e decreased rapidly with the increase of ph at ph 8 the q e slowly decreased and gradually tended to be stable the above phenomenon is due to the fact that ph can affect the surface zeta potential of adsorbent as well as the species of cr vi in solution at ph 4 hcro4 is the predominant species of cr vi in the solution when ph 4 cro4 2 appears in the solution and the proportion of hcro4 is gradually reduced since one cro4 2 ion has two negative charges adsorption of one cro4 2 ion requires two active adsorption sites which resulted in a reduction in the amount of cr vi adsorption 42 in addition the surface potential of cpc al30pmt is more positive at low ph due to the protonation reaction so the high electrostatic attraction is beneficial to the adsorption of anionic cr vi when ph 6 the surface potential of cpc al30pmt gradually decreased resulting in a decrease in electrostatic attraction between the adsorbent and cr vi anions therefore some cr vi anions cannot be stably fixed on the clay surface in addition it can be seen from the fig 9 that the adsorption of cr vi was also inhibited under high ionic strength as the concentration of nacl in the solution increased the high concentration of cl ions in the solution neutralized the positive charge on the adsorbent surface thereby reducing the electrostatic attraction between cpc al30pmt and cr vi a previous study reported that significantly inhibition of adsorption by ionic strength indicated the presence of ion exchange reaction 43 therefore it is deduced that the exchange between the cl in cpc al30pmt and the cr vi anions in solution is one of the mechanisms of adsorption process see section 3 3 for detailed analysis 3 2 4 adsorption kinetics the dynamic curves of cr vi adsorption on cpc al30pmt are shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the adsorption of cr vi by cpc al30pmt is relatively rapid within 120 min which is due to the large number of adsorption sites available in the adsorbent from 120 to 300 min the adsorption rate gradually decreased indicating that the available adsorption sites gradually saturate in addition because the remained cr vi in the solution gradually decreased the adsorption driving force caused by the concentration gradient also gradually decreased which further led to the decrease of adsorption rate as the time is further extended more than 300 min the adsorption amount tended to be stable and eventually reached equilibrium due to the saturation of adsorption sites the equilibrium adsorption capacity at 298 313 and 328 k was 37 42 42 44 and 47 81 mg g respectively the pseudo first order kinetic model pseudo second order kinetic model and intra particle diffusion model eqs s1 s3 44 46 were used to fit the adsorption data the results are shown in fig s2 and table 2 it can be seen from table 2 that the r 2 obtained from the fitting of the pseudo second order kinetic model is 0 999 which indicates that the adsorption process conforms to the pseudo second order kinetic model according to previous studies if the adsorption process conforms to the pseudo second order kinetic model it indicates that there is a chemical adsorption thus it can be inferred that chemical adsorption is one of the mechanisms for the adsorption of cr vi on cpc al30pmt 47 in addition if the curve fitted by intra particle diffusion model is a straight line and passing through the origin indicating that the intra particle diffusion is a rate limiting step of the adsorption process otherwise the liquid film diffusion mechanism also affects the adsorption process 46 it can be seen from fig s2c and the table 2 that the fitted lines are not straight lines passing through the origin indicating that the intra particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion affect the cr vi adsorption together 3 2 5 adsorption isotherms as can be seen from fig 11 the q e rapidly increased with the increase of c e when the c e exceeded 600 mg l the q e gradually tended to be stable the increase of temperature was favorable for adsorption and the explanations of this phenomenon are as follows 1 the increase of temperature can increase the diffusion rate and reaction activity of ions thus increasing the mass transfer rate of cr vi in adsorbent 48 49 2 the increase of temperature can reduce the thickness of liquid film on the surface of cpc al30pmt thus increasing the adsorbate diffusion rate in liquid film 46 to further investigate the adsorption process and reveal the adsorption mechanism langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevieh d r models see eqs s4 s8 43 50 51 were used to fit isothermal data the fitting curves and model parameters are shown in fig s3 and table 3 respectively from fig s3 and table 3 it can be seen that the freundlich model fitted the experimental data better than the two other models indicating that the adsorption of cr vi on cpc al30pmt is not a monolayer adsorption in addition it can be known from table 3 that the r 2 of fitted by d r model is also high so it can be further inferred that the adsorption of cr vi by cpc al30pmt is a multi layer adsorption on non uniform surfaces 50 generally the average adsorption energy e 8 kj mol indicates that physical adsorption is the main adsorption mechanism e in the range of 8 16 kj mol indicates that the adsorption is mainly a chemical ion exchange mechanism e 16 kj mol indicates that adsorption may be controlled by particle diffusion process 52 the e values calculated from the d r model in this study are 7 67 9 13 and 9 81 kj mol at 298 313 and 328 k respectively indicating that the physical adsorption and ion exchange are the mechanisms 3 2 6 thermodynamics the van t hoff equation eqs s9 s11 51 was used to analyze the thermodynamics of cr vi adsorption on cpc al30pmt the results are shown in table 4 as can be seen from the table 4 δh 0 indicating that the adsorption is endothermic reaction δs 0 indicating that the reaction is entropy increasing process δg 0 indicating that the adsorption process is spontaneous and the absolute value of δg increased with the increase of temperature indicating that the increase of temperature is beneficial to the adsorption process previous studies have suggested that δg values between 8 and 16 kj mol δg 20 kj mol and δg 40 kj mol correspond to ion exchange electrostatic attraction and surface complexation mechanisms respectively 53 base on the above results it can be deduced that the ion exchange plays a role during the process of cr vi adsorption 3 3 cr vi removal mechanisms 3 3 1 eds characterization cpc al30pmt and cpc al30pmt cr cpc al30pmt with cr vi adsorbed were characterized by eds to further investigate the adsorption mechanism from the eds spectra fig 12 and the data table 5 the peak of chromium 5 45 ev appeared in the sample cpc al30pmt cr while the peak of chlorine 0 12 ev and 2 63 ev in the cpc al30pmt disappeared after adsorption previous studies have shown that during the modification process some cpc molecules are combined with montmorillonite through hydrophobic interactions 54 therefore the presence of the ion exchange mechanism can be confirmed 3 3 2 xps and ftir characterization the xps spectra fig 13 indicate that a new peak appeared at 577 ev cr2p after cr vi adsorption on cpc al30pmt this peak can be fitted into four peaks and the ones at 586 8 ev and 585 9 ev were assigned to cr2p1 2 of cr vi and cr iii respectively while those at 578 3 ev and 576 6 ev corresponded to cr2p3 2 of cr vi and cr iii respectively 55 56 the appearance of cr in the wide scan xps spectra of cpc al30pmt cr indicates that cr vi has been bonded on the cpc al30pmt the fitting results show that cr in cpc al30pmt cr consists of cr vi 52 26 and cr iii 47 71 indicating that part of the adsorbed cr vi is reduced to cr iii the ftir characterization for the cpc al30pmt and cpc al30pmt cr was conducted to further study the reduction mechanism of cr vi and the spectra are shown in fig 14 it can be seen that the absorption peak at 3619 cm 1 of cpc al30pmt cr was sharper than that of cpc al30pmt this is because a large number of oh contributed from al30 of the cpc al30pmt provided electrons to cr vi and reduced them to cr iii 57 li et al 58 also reported that the hydroxyl group on the surface of kaolinite was an excellent electron donor which could provide electrons for the reduction reaction in addition the differences between the other functional groups in the two samples are not obvious indicating that the functional groups in cpc al30pmt did not have a chemical reaction with cr vi during the adsorption liu et al 2 suggested that fe in montmorillonite played a role in the cr vi reduction however fe was not detected in cpc al30pmt so this reduction pathway can be ruled out base on the above analysis the formula of cr vi reduction and adsorption mechanisms can be depicted as fig 15 4 conclusions in this study the new cpc al30pmt composite was successfully prepared by inorganic organic hybrid modification confirmed via investigation of the change of surface structure morphology and zeta potential the new synthesized cpc al30pmt was then used to remove high concentration cr vi from solution the results showed that the maximum cr vi adsorption capacity of cpc al30pmt was 42 44 mg g under the conditions of ph 2 initial concentration of 800 mg l and adsorbent dosage of 5 g l the kinetic thermodynamics and isothermal adsorption study showed that the adsorption process was a spontaneous endothermic reaction and conformed to pseudo second order kinetic model and freundlich isotherm model there are three main mechanisms for cpc al30pmt adsorption of cr vi i cr vi ions are adsorbed by van der waals force and electrostatic attraction physical adsorption ii the exchange between cl ions in cpc al30pmt and the cr vi anions in solution anion exchange iii part of adsorbed cr vi is reduced to cr iii by a large number of hydroxyl contributed from al30 of cpc al30pmt

13849,to enhance the adsorption performance of natural calcium based montmorillonite ca mmt the polymeric hydroxyaluminum cation keggin al30 al30o8 oh 56 h2o 24 18 and cetylpyridinium chloride cpc were used to modify ca mmt for preparation of cpc al30 pillared montmorillonite composite cpc al30pmt the cpc al30pmt was characterized via analysis of its chemical and physical structure morphology surface properties and zeta potential the results showed that the al30 polymer cation and cpc successfully intercalated into the interlayer of ca mmt which increased the d001 value from 1 47 nm to 1 93 nm and increased the pore volume correspondingly the zeta potential was reversed from negative to positive after modification presenting a possibility to adsorb anionic contaminants from water the investigation of hexavalent chromium cr vi adsorption on cpc al30pmt showed that the removal of cr vi was positively correlated with the dosage of adsorbent and negatively correlated with the initial concentration of cr vi the ionic strength and the initial ph of the solution cpc al30pmt showed good cr vi removal performance with the maximum adsorption q e of 42 44 mg g the adsorption process conformed to freundlich model and pseudo second order kinetic model thermodynamics studies showed that adsorption was a spontaneous exothermic process electrostatic interaction ion exchange and reduction were the main mechanisms of the removal keywords polymeric hydroxyaluminum cation keggin al30 cetylpyridinium chloride cpc montmorillonite composites adsorption cr vi removal 1 introduction chromium is a toxic heavy metal that is widely used in industrial production and it can cause serious pollution if discharging to water environment without proper treatment 1 hexavalent chromium cr vi is generally considered more toxic to organisms than trivalent chromium cr iii and it has caused raising public concern regarding environmental risk due to its easy migration carcinogenicity and difficult degradability 2 therefore the removal of cr vi from water has attracted widespread attention from researchers at present the common strategies of cr vi removal from water include chemical methods biological treatment ion exchange and adsorption 3 5 among them the removal of cr vi using adsorbents such as biomass adsorbents zeolites activated carbon and clay minerals has been researched widely because of the simple operation and high efficiency 6 11 as a natural adsorption material montmorillonite has been extensively used because of its abundant reserves low cost environmental friendliness and high thermal stability 12 13 however the natural montmorillonite is negatively charged in neutral solution leading to electrostatic repulsion to cr vi anion furthermore the interlayer spacing and pore volume of the natural montmorillonite are small which limit the adsorption capacity of heavy metals for these reasons the modification of montmorillonite can usually be adopted to improve its adsorption performance the montmorillonite modification methods include inorganic organic and inorganic organic hybrid modification due to the limitation of single material inorganic or organic modification an increasing attention has been paid to the use of inorganic organic modification approaches to prepare montmorillonite composites 14 16 the hydroxyaluminum polymerized cation keggin al13 al13o4 oh 24 h2o 12 7 fig 1 a is an extensively used modifier for inorganic modification of montmorillonite hou et al 17 prepared al13 montmorillonite and found that both tartrate and oxalate could be effectively adsorbed on the modified montmorillonite zacharias et al 18 synthesized hydroxyl iron aluminum modified montmorillonite and reported on the effective adsorption of po4 3 during recent years the hydrolysis chemistry and characterization analysis technology of aluminum have been greatly developed 19 researchers have found that the additional titration of substances with a keggin type structure with alkali can form larger polycations 20 zhen et al 21 reported a new type of keggin al30 al30o8 oh 56 h2o 24 18 fig 1b polymer cation consisted of two al13 and four octahedral aluminum monomers compared with al13 al30 has a larger particle size higher ionic charge density and more hydroxyl groups 22 zhu et al 23 prepared keggin al30 inorganic pillared montmorillonite with excellent structural stability thus in this study keggin al30 was selected to modify the montmorillonite to prepare al30 pillared montmorillonite al30pmt although inorganic modified montmorillonite increases the specific surface area stability and interlayer spacing the introduction of cationic organic modifiers can increase the surface potential and the amount of functional groups of montmorillonite making the removal of cr vi more efficient 1 therefore al30pmt was further organically modified to prepare montmorillonite composites previous studies have shown that the organic modification of inorganic montmorillonite can further improve its adsorption performance wang et al 1 used dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dodecyl amine and al13 to modify montmorillonite for cr vi removal and the results showed that the adsorption performance of composite modified montmorillonite for cr vi was significantly better than that of inorganic or organic modification alone hu et al 14 reported that aluminum hydroxypolycation and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab were chosen to synthesize inorganic organic pillared montmorillonite the experimental data showed that when the aluminum hydroxypolycation was intercalated prior to ctab the adsorption of cr vi was higher comparing with those intercalated simultaneously or ctab pre intercalated cetylpyridinium chloride cpc shown in table s1 is a cationic surfactant widely used in environmental remediation 24 cpc has a pyridine head group and a hydrophobic alkyl chain with 16 carbon atoms which has been used to modify montmorillonite successfully 2 the organic modification increased the surface potential of the montmorillonite making it more selective for anions adsorption 25 according to its special amphiphilic properties cpc was selected for organic modification of al30pmt to prepare cpc al30pmt however the attention to the removal of high concentrations of cr vi in solutions using inorganic organic hybrid modified montmorillonite is still sparse in previous studies in this study cpc al30pmt was used to remove high concentration cr vi confirming the application potential of the composite in the treatment of high concentration chromium containing wastewater the samples before and after modification were characterized by solid state 27al magic angle spinning nuclear

materials and methods 2 1 materials ca mmt was supplied by shandong west asia chemical industry co ltd with the purity 95 and the cationic exchange capacity cec of 85 69 meq 100 g measured by ammonium chloride ethanol method 8 other reagents were all analytical grade including hcl naoh alcl3 6h2o agno3 cacl2 c2h6o nh4cl nh3 h2o hcho and cpc purchased from tianjin komeo chemical reagent co ltd all solutions were prepared using deionized water di water prepared by ultrapure water system shanghai high tech co ltd 2 2 preparation and characterization of cpc al30pmt 2 2 1 sample preparation the al30pmt was prepared according to the method of zhu et al 23 0 6 m naoh solution was slowly added at a rate of 1 ml min to a three necked flask placed in an oil bath at constant 95 c containing 1 0 m alcl3 solution to obtain a solution with a oh al3 molar ratio of 2 4 after continuous stirring for 12 h it was further aged for 24 h to obtain a colorless and transparent solution with a total al concentration of 0 2 m after that montmorillonite was added to reach the al montmorillonite concentration of 4 mmol g and the mixed solution was stirred for 24 h and then aged for 24 h finally the solid was centrifuged 12 000 rpm 10 min and separated from the aqueous phase the solid product was washed with di water until no chloride was detected with the agno3 solution the obtained solid was dried at 80 c and named as al30pmt the preparation process of cpc al30pmt was as follows according to the measured cec of al30pmt 121 31 meq 100 g 0 43 g cpc was added to a conical flask containing 50 ml di water followed by sonication of 15 min 1 0 g al30pmt was then added to the conical flask and shaken in a thermostatic water bath shaker for 24 h after the reaction the suspension was centrifuged 12 000 rpm for 10 min the obtained samples were washed with di water for 5 times and then dried at 80 c for 24 h the dried sample cpc al30pmt was ground to pass through a 200 mesh sieve and stored for further use 2 2 2 characterization of the sample the samples were subjected to 27al solid state nuclear magnetic measurement by a resonance spectrometer bruker avance iii 600 xrd d8 advance bruker

ftir nicolet is50 thermo fisher usa was used to analyze surface functional groups and chemical bonds the specific surface areas and pore size distribution of the sample were characterized using bet

elements content of the sample was characterized by sem eds nova nano sem450 fei the content and valence of metallic elements of the samples were detected by xps 250xi thermo fisher usa 2 3 cr vi adsorption experiment firstly 40 ml solution with the given initial cr vi concentration was added to the erlenmeyer flask which was placed in a water bath constant temperature oscillator to maintain constant solution temperatures t 298 k 313 k and 328 k then the adsorbent was added to the solution for cr vi adsorption after adsorption the suspension was separated using high speed centrifugation under 12 000 rpm and 10 min the solid phase and the liquid phase can be completely separated in a short time by the high speed centrifugation so the short term adsorption of the centrifugation process was negligible 1 14 17 the concentration of cr vi in the solution was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy aas sp 756 with the wavelength of 357 9 nm and with air flow of 4 5 l min and acetylene flow of 1 l min respectively the removal efficiency re and equilibrium adsorption capacity q e of cr vi were calculated by eqs 1 and 2 2 1 r e c 0 c e c 0 100 2 q e c 0 c e v m where c 0 and c e represent the initial concentration of cr vi mg l and the concentration of cr vi in the solution at adsorption equilibrium mg l respectively v refers the solution volume ml m is the adsorbent mass g 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the samples 3 1 1 solid state 27al mas nmr and xrd characterization solid state27al mas nmr characterization results are shown in fig 2 a the strong and sharp peak at 2 0 ppm was attributed to the presence of octahedral monomer al in ca mmt 26 the two broad peaks at 57 6 and 68 6 ppm were attributed to the substitution of si4 by al3 indicating the presence of tetrahedral al 27 the signal at 2 4 ppm was attributed to the octahedral al in layers of ca mmt and external shells of al30 cation asymmetry of octahedral al in the shell of al30 made the peak wider than that of ca mmt 2 0 ppm with the intercalation of al30 cations the signal of tetrahedral al in ca mmt sheets shifted from 57 6 ppm to 59 6 ppm this is due to the interaction between al30 cations and the charged layers of ca mmt the strong resonance peak appearing at 67 9 ppm is the signal peak of tetrahedral al in the al30 cation 28 confirming successful preparation of al30pmt according to the xrd characterization results fig 2b the d001 value of ca mmt was 1 47 nm which is a typical calcium based montmorillonite 29 after modification the d001 diffraction peaks of the two modified samples all transferred to lower angles and the d001 values of al30pmt and cpc al30pmt were 1 89 nm and 1 93 nm respectively indicating that the polymeric hydroxyl aluminum cation and cpc both played a role in increasing the interlayer spacing of the montmorillonite the intercalation of cpc only slightly enlarged the layer spacing this is mainly due to the steric hindrance caused by the intercalated large sized polymer aluminum cations which makes the cpc not fully accessible to the montmorillonite layers the diffraction peak at 2θ 9 1 was caused by the intercalation of a large number of al30 particles 23 the peak disappeared after the intercalation of cpc into the interlayers of montmorillonite the diffraction peak of 2θ 19 7 is a characteristic peak of montmorillonite 29 indicating that the modification does not change the layered structure of montmorillonite 3 1 2 characterization of sample structure bet analysis the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of various samples in fig 3 show that they have the type iv isotherms iupac classification with the hysteresis loop of type h3 iupic classification 30 indicating that the predominant pore structure of these samples are slit shaped pores or plate like particles 7 in addition the hysteresis loop of cpc al30pmt is smaller than that of others which is due to the fact that the specific surface area and pore volume of cpc al30pmt are smaller than that of ca mmt and al30pmt the significant increase in n2 adsorption around p p 0 0 45 is attributed to the existence of mesopore or a small number of macropore structures 31 when p p 0 is close to 1 the n2 molecules in the capillary tube of the outer surface of the particle make the adsorption curve to be slightly up warped due to condensation showing multilayer adsorption and implying the presence of mesopores as can be seen from table 1 and fig s1 the specific surface area and pore volume of cpc al30pmt are smaller than the other two samples on the contrary cpc al30pmt has the highest average pore size the decrease in specific surface area was due to the blockage of structural channels caused by cpc intercalation in the montmorillonite interlayer or bonded to the clay edge the xrd characterization results showed that the interlayer distance increased after modification but the change in specific surface area was not only affected by the interlayer distance but also related to factors such as the amount of modifier intercalation and its molecular size 32 the intercalation of cpc polymer formed a higher steric hindrance in the montmorillonite interlayer 33 which made it difficult for nitrogen molecules to enter the structural channel smoothly so the cpc al30pmt showed a small specific surface area in addition a large amount of cpc molecules in montmorillonite were adsorbed on the surface of the sample by tail tail interaction which caused cpc to occupy the pores of montmorillonite and reduced the pore volume of the sample the electrostatic repulsion and steric repulsion between cpc molecules caused some pores expanded leading to a higher average pore diameter of cpc al30pmt 34 35 although the specific surface area of cpc al30pmt decreased significantly its adsorption ability for cr vi was higher than the others which indicated that the mechanisms of cr vi adsorption on cpc al30pmt have been changed see the following studies 3 1 3 ftir characterization it can be seen from fig 4 that the difference of ftir spectra of al30pmt and ca mmt are not obvious indicating that the functional groups of the two samples had no significant change after the al30 modification in the ftir spectra the absorption peak at 513 cm 1 belongs to the bending vibration of mgo bond the peaks of 1041 cm 1 and 914 cm 1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of sio bond and the bending vibration of alo bond respectively 36 the band at 1640 cm 1 is attributed to the oh bending vibrational of adsorbed water and in the spectra of cpc al30pmt this band shows an attenuation indicating that the intercalation of the hydrophobic alkyl chain of cpc has an exclusion effect on the water molecules 36 an obvious absorption peak of cpc al30pmt sample at 1468 cm 1 is ascribed to the shear vibration and antisymmetric deformation vibration of the ch2 group 37 the asymmetric and symmetrical stretching vibration peaks of the ch bond in ch2 n appear at 2916 and 2847 cm 1 respectively indicating that cpc have been successfully loaded on the interlayer or surface of montmorillonite 38 the band at 3379 cm 1 of cpc is attributed to the cn stretching vibration but it is not shown in cpc al30pmt possibly due to that the positively charged surface of the cpc al30pmt limited its vibration 29 3 1 4 zeta potential investigation the zeta potential measurements of ca mmt al30pmt and cpc al30pmt under varying ph values are shown in fig 5 as the ph value increased from 2 to 12 the zeta potential of ca mmt decreased from 8 44 mv to 32 98 mv at ph 7 the zeta potential of al30pmt was positive which was attributed to the larger number of al oh2 functional groups in the al30pmt in alkaline environment a large number of amphoteric hydroxides such as al oh 4 were formed on the surface of al30pmt due to the oh present in the solution which switched the zeta potential of al30pmt from positive to negative 19 20 the zeta potential of cpc al30pmt remained positive with the ph ranging from 2 to 12 and higher than the others this is due to the highly positively charged al30 cations and the cpc micelles formed on the surface 39 cpc formed a micelle arrangement through van der waals force and hydrophobic effect which exposed positively charged n functional groups on the surface of montmorillonite resulting in the cpc al30pmt surface always maintaining a positive potential with the increase of the ph the adsorption of oh on cpc al30pmt reduced its zeta potential but remained positive which suggests that it is easier to remove anionic pollutants from wastewater by using cpc al30pmt than using ca mmt and al30pmt 3 1 5 sem characterization the sem profiles of montmorillonite before and after modification are shown in fig 6 and table s2 ca mmt fig 6a and al30pmt fig 6b both showed a sheet structure but the sheet structure of ca mmt was more combined tight while the layer of al30pmt was relatively loose indicating that the pillaring effect of polymerized hydroxylaluminum ions increased the montmorillonite layer spacing as can be seen from fig 6c the morphology of cpc al30pmt was curled and wrinkled and a noticeable rough structure was observed which was caused by the intercalation of cpc molecules the severely curled and loose lamellar morphology made cpc al30pmt easier to contact with cr vi this is consistent with the report by hu et al 14 from table s2 the al content of al30pmt is higher than that of ca mmt further indicating that the al30 polymer cation was successfully intercalated into the montmorillonite interlayer after cpc modification the content of element c increased significantly and the element cl appeared in the sample indicating that some of the cpc was not bound to al30pmt through ion exchange but was bonded to the surface of al30pmt through hydrophobic interaction see section 3 3 3 2 adsorption of cr vi on cpc al30pmt 3 2 1 the effect of the initial concentration the effect of initial concentration on cr vi adsorption is shown in fig 7 as can be seen from fig 7a the ca mmt could hardly adsorb cr vi due to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged clay surface and the cr vi anion after al30 modification the cr vi adsorption capacity of al30pmt was higher than ca mmt it was attributed that the polymeric hydroxylaluminum cation increased the interlayer spacing of montmorillonite and the increasing zeta potential enhanced the electrostatic attraction between al30pmt and cr vi however the cr vi adsorption capacity of al30pmt was far less than that of cpc al30pmt this phenomenon can be attributed to 1 the inorganic organic modification further expanded the montmorillonite interlayer spacing and made the structure looser which is beneficial for cr vi to enter the interlayer of the adsorbent 2 cl in cpc al30pmt exchanged with cr vi anion in solution see section 3 3 which improved the adsorption ability of adsorbent 3 cpc al30pmt had more positive charges at ph 2 and the electrostatic attraction with cr vi anion also promoted the adsorption of cpc al30pmt to cr vi the adsorption of cr vi on cpc al30pmt at different initial concentrations is shown in fig 7b as the initial concentration increased from 10 mg l to 1000 mg l the re gradually decreased from 92 38 to 20 45 at low initial concentrations there are many unoccupied adsorption sites in the adsorbent so the majority of cr vi anion can be adsorbed as the initial concentration increases most sites are occupied by cr vi anion resulting in the decrease of re and the increase of q e increased from 1 85 mg g to 42 44 mg g 3 2 2 the effect of adsorbent dosage as can be seen from fig 8 re increased with the increase of adsorbent dosage this is because the increase of the dosage can provide more active sites so that more cr vi ions in the solution are adsorbed to cpc al30pmt however with the increase of the dosage from 0 05 to 0 5 g the q e gradually decreased from 65 72 to 24 71 mg g rathinam et al 40 referred to this phenomenon as the concentration gradient splitting effect between adsorbent and adsorbate at lower dosages the adsorbents are more dispersed and most of the active sites can be efficiently combined with cr vi thus exhibiting a higher q e at higher dosages the collision between adsorbent particles leads to particle aggregation causing a decrease in the effective active sites which contributed to the decrease in q e a similar phenomenon was also found in the study of banat et al 41 3 2 3 the effect of ph and ionic strength the effect of ph and ionic strength on cr vi adsorption is shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the adsorption of cr vi is highly dependent on ph and ionic strength the q e decreased with the increase of ph and ionic strength when the ph was in the range of 2 4 the q e decreased slowly with the increase of ph when the ph increased from 4 to 8 the q e decreased rapidly with the increase of ph at ph 8 the q e slowly decreased and gradually tended to be stable the above phenomenon is due to the fact that ph can affect the surface zeta potential of adsorbent as well as the species of cr vi in solution at ph 4 hcro4 is the predominant species of cr vi in the solution when ph 4 cro4 2 appears in the solution and the proportion of hcro4 is gradually reduced since one cro4 2 ion has two negative charges adsorption of one cro4 2 ion requires two active adsorption sites which resulted in a reduction in the amount of cr vi adsorption 42 in addition the surface potential of cpc al30pmt is more positive at low ph due to the protonation reaction so the high electrostatic attraction is beneficial to the adsorption of anionic cr vi when ph 6 the surface potential of cpc al30pmt gradually decreased resulting in a decrease in electrostatic attraction between the adsorbent and cr vi anions therefore some cr vi anions cannot be stably fixed on the clay surface in addition it can be seen from the fig 9 that the adsorption of cr vi was also inhibited under high ionic strength as the concentration of nacl in the solution increased the high concentration of cl ions in the solution neutralized the positive charge on the adsorbent surface thereby reducing the electrostatic attraction between cpc al30pmt and cr vi a previous study reported that significantly inhibition of adsorption by ionic strength indicated the presence of ion exchange reaction 43 therefore it is deduced that the exchange between the cl in cpc al30pmt and the cr vi anions in solution is one of the mechanisms of adsorption process see section 3 3 for detailed analysis 3 2 4 adsorption kinetics the dynamic curves of cr vi adsorption on cpc al30pmt are shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the adsorption of cr vi by cpc al30pmt is relatively rapid within 120 min which is due to the large number of adsorption sites available in the adsorbent from 120 to 300 min the adsorption rate gradually decreased indicating that the available adsorption sites gradually saturate in addition because the remained cr vi in the solution gradually decreased the adsorption driving force caused by the concentration gradient also gradually decreased which further led to the decrease of adsorption rate as the time is further extended more than 300 min the adsorption amount tended to be stable and eventually reached equilibrium due to the saturation of adsorption sites the equilibrium adsorption capacity at 298 313 and 328 k was 37 42 42 44 and 47 81 mg g respectively the pseudo first order kinetic model pseudo second order kinetic model and intra particle diffusion model eqs s1 s3 44 46 were used to fit the adsorption data the results are shown in fig s2 and table 2 it can be seen from table 2 that the r 2 obtained from the fitting of the pseudo second order kinetic model is 0 999 which indicates that the adsorption process conforms to the pseudo second order kinetic model according to previous studies if the adsorption process conforms to the pseudo second order kinetic model it indicates that there is a chemical adsorption thus it can be inferred that chemical adsorption is one of the mechanisms for the adsorption of cr vi on cpc al30pmt 47 in addition if the curve fitted by intra particle diffusion model is a straight line and passing through the origin indicating that the intra particle diffusion is a rate limiting step of the adsorption process otherwise the liquid film diffusion mechanism also affects the adsorption process 46 it can be seen from fig s2c and the table 2 that the fitted lines are not straight lines passing through the origin indicating that the intra particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion affect the cr vi adsorption together 3 2 5 adsorption isotherms as can be seen from fig 11 the q e rapidly increased with the increase of c e when the c e exceeded 600 mg l the q e gradually tended to be stable the increase of temperature was favorable for adsorption and the explanations of this phenomenon are as follows 1 the increase of temperature can increase the diffusion rate and reaction activity of ions thus increasing the mass transfer rate of cr vi in adsorbent 48 49 2 the increase of temperature can reduce the thickness of liquid film on the surface of cpc al30pmt thus increasing the adsorbate diffusion rate in liquid film 46 to further investigate the adsorption process and reveal the adsorption mechanism langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevieh d r models see eqs s4 s8 43 50 51 were used to fit isothermal data the fitting curves and model parameters are shown in fig s3 and table 3 respectively from fig s3 and table 3 it can be seen that the freundlich model fitted the experimental data better than the two other models indicating that the adsorption of cr vi on cpc al30pmt is not a monolayer adsorption in addition it can be known from table 3 that the r 2 of fitted by d r model is also high so it can be further inferred that the adsorption of cr vi by cpc al30pmt is a multi layer adsorption on non uniform surfaces 50 generally the average adsorption energy e 8 kj mol indicates that physical adsorption is the main adsorption mechanism e in the range of 8 16 kj mol indicates that the adsorption is mainly a chemical ion exchange mechanism e 16 kj mol indicates that adsorption may be controlled by particle diffusion process 52 the e values calculated from the d r model in this study are 7 67 9 13 and 9 81 kj mol at 298 313 and 328 k respectively indicating that the physical adsorption and ion exchange are the mechanisms 3 2 6 thermodynamics the van t hoff equation eqs s9 s11 51 was used to analyze the thermodynamics of cr vi adsorption on cpc al30pmt the results are shown in table 4 as can be seen from the table 4 δh 0 indicating that the adsorption is endothermic reaction δs 0 indicating that the reaction is entropy increasing process δg 0 indicating that the adsorption process is spontaneous and the absolute value of δg increased with the increase of temperature indicating that the increase of temperature is beneficial to the adsorption process previous studies have suggested that δg values between 8 and 16 kj mol δg 20 kj mol and δg 40 kj mol correspond to ion exchange electrostatic attraction and surface complexation mechanisms respectively 53 base on the above results it can be deduced that the ion exchange plays a role during the process of cr vi adsorption 3 3 cr vi removal mechanisms 3 3 1 eds characterization cpc al30pmt and cpc al30pmt cr cpc al30pmt with cr vi adsorbed were characterized by eds to further investigate the adsorption mechanism from the eds spectra fig 12 and the data table 5 the peak of chromium 5 45 ev appeared in the sample cpc al30pmt cr while the peak of chlorine 0 12 ev and 2 63 ev in the cpc al30pmt disappeared after adsorption previous studies have shown that during the modification process some cpc molecules are combined with montmorillonite through hydrophobic interactions 54 therefore the presence of the ion exchange mechanism can be confirmed 3 3 2 xps and ftir characterization the xps spectra fig 13 indicate that a new peak appeared at 577 ev cr2p after cr vi adsorption on cpc al30pmt this peak can be fitted into four peaks and the ones at 586 8 ev and 585 9 ev were assigned to cr2p1 2 of cr vi and cr iii respectively while those at 578 3 ev and 576 6 ev corresponded to cr2p3 2 of cr vi and cr iii respectively 55 56 the appearance of cr in the wide scan xps spectra of cpc al30pmt cr indicates that cr vi has been bonded on the cpc al30pmt the fitting results show that cr in cpc al30pmt cr consists of cr vi 52 26 and cr iii 47 71 indicating that part of the adsorbed cr vi is reduced to cr iii the ftir characterization for the cpc al30pmt and cpc al30pmt cr was conducted to further study the reduction mechanism of cr vi and the spectra are shown in fig 14 it can be seen that the absorption peak at 3619 cm 1 of cpc al30pmt cr was sharper than that of cpc al30pmt this is because a large number of oh contributed from al30 of the cpc al30pmt provided electrons to cr vi and reduced them to cr iii 57 li et al 58 also reported that the hydroxyl group on the surface of kaolinite was an excellent electron donor which could provide electrons for the reduction reaction in addition the differences between the other functional groups in the two samples are not obvious indicating that the functional groups in cpc al30pmt did not have a chemical reaction with cr vi during the adsorption liu et al 2 suggested that fe in montmorillonite played a role in the cr vi reduction however fe was not detected in cpc al30pmt so this reduction pathway can be ruled out base on the above analysis the formula of cr vi reduction and adsorption mechanisms can be depicted as fig 15 4 conclusions in this study the new cpc al30pmt composite was successfully prepared by inorganic organic hybrid modification confirmed via investigation of the change of surface structure morphology and zeta potential the new synthesized cpc al30pmt was then used to remove high concentration cr vi from solution the results showed that the maximum cr vi adsorption capacity of cpc al30pmt was 42 44 mg g under the conditions of ph 2 initial concentration of 800 mg l and adsorbent dosage of 5 g l the kinetic thermodynamics and isothermal adsorption study showed that the adsorption process was a spontaneous endothermic reaction and conformed to pseudo second order kinetic model and freundlich isotherm model there are three main mechanisms for cpc al30pmt adsorption of cr vi i cr vi ions are adsorbed by van der waals force and electrostatic attraction physical adsorption ii the exchange between cl ions in cpc al30pmt and the cr vi anions in solution anion exchange iii part of adsorbed cr vi is reduced to cr iii by a large number of hydroxyl contributed from al30 of cpc al30pmt
