9790,oil palm is one of the most rapidly growing tree crops in the tropics it is long lasting and high yielding serving as an input for a number of profitable industries the rapid expansion of oil palm has triggered environmental change historically the focus has been on the impact of biodiversity loss however the water requirements of oil palm plantations which traditionally depended on rainfall only are also changing partly because environmental concerns are directing oil palm expansion and cultivation into marginal areas according to some estimates these lands with cultivable marginal soils having an acid pyrite layer in the soil profile comprise about 7 5 million ha in indonesia here we employed the agricultural production systems simulator apsim to simulate the growth of oil palm on marginal lands within indonesia over an eight year period apsim oil palm was used to estimate the irrigation water requirement at different stages of plant growth for actual weather and soil conditions traditionally water footprint accounting of oil palm plantations at the field level considers one uniform value of evapotranspiration our analysis shows that considering a single value for the entire period of oil palm growth underestimates the water requirement at the field scale annual irrigation needs were found to range from 2543 mm to 3865 mm for the plantation ages examined 0 8 years we approximate that 8800 m3 of blue water and 6200 m3 of green water is required per ton of fresh fruit bunch produced from the study plantation occupying marginal lands where water requirements were largely governed by maintenance of a high water table similarly high volumes are likely to be required where oil palm is cultivated on pyritic soils thus the irrigation water requirement can no longer be neglected as oil palm plantations continue to expand onto marginal soils graphical abstract ga1 keywords oil palm expansion marginal lands water footprint apsim oil palm simulation 1 introduction oil palm is one of the most valuable oil crops in the world gilbert 2012 oil palm is not only used for cooking but also as animal feed input to a number of cosmetic products and biofuel moreover oil palm has a high yield per unit of fruit and the management of this crop is relatively easy therefore it is not surprising that we are seeing the rapid development of oil palm plantations in different countries around the world from 2009 to 2019 the area planted under this crop increased from 16 million ha to 28 million ha at the same time fresh fruit bunch yield has almost doubled from 217 million tonnes to 411 million tonnes faostat n d this trend continues with the doubling of oil palm production in every decade khatun et al 2017 oil palm elaeis guineensis jacq originated in tropical areas of central and west africa along the coastal belts between 5 n to 7 s corley and tinker 2015 therefore it is adapted to natural conditions of high rainfall throughout the year so water requirements of oil palm are generally considered to be fulfilled by the rainfall in tropical areas green water requirement however expansion of oil palm into other countries has increased its latitudinal range from 19 n to 16 s therefore oil palm plantations in areas of less rainfall require additional water from irrigation blue water requirement to maintain yield levels carr 2011 moreover the expansion of oil palm into areas of different soil characteristics can impose additional water demand for the plantations bloomfield and zahari 1982 the expansion of oil palm outside africa increased rapidly in southeast asia during the 19th century in fact malaysia and indonesia together are responsible for 77 of the total production of fresh fruit bunches of the world and represent 70 of the total world area under oil palm plantations in 2019 faostat n d the recent exponential expansion in these nations has brought in substantial revenues to this region for example in 2014 oil palm production and processing contributed 17 of the total agricultural gdp of indonesia and employed about 8 million people purnomo et al 2020 however the expansion of these plantations is imposing environmental stresses in terms of biodiversity loss land use change and water stresses vijay et al 2016 some studies suggesting that global oil palm expansion both small holder and large plantations is responsible for a significant proportion of tropical forest replacement vijay et al 2016 while other studies have pointed to a host of factors such as illegal logging commercial forestry forest fires etc contributing to the forest replacement gaveau et al 2016 regardless 27 of global forest loss has been attributed to commodity production including oil palm curtis et al 2018 due to forest loss there is a broad consensus to restrict the agricultural development in rainforests for example the indonesian government with international help has imposed a moratorium in different forms from 2010 until now on the expansion of oil palm plantations in forested areas palm oil industry in indonesia cpo production export indonesia investments n d on the other hand to continue to reap the economic benefits of this crop the government has made a policy for utilizing marginal lands which are not covered by forests or peatlands for plantations degraded land sustainable palm oil and indonesia s future 2010 this expansion of oil palm plantations into marginal lands thereby imposes different kinds of environmental and water management challenges such as low ph levels of water and constant submergence of particular soil layers in water the marginal agricultural areas in indonesia are the low potential coastal lands these areas are swampy with poor drainage under natural conditions historically these lands were submerged under the sea which caused the formation of acid sulfate pyrite soils containing a pyritic layer either in the shallow layer of the soil profile or in the deep layer when this pyrite layer is exposed to the atmosphere as a result of drainage it is oxidized causing acidic conditions and other environmental impacts according to some estimates these marginal lands comprise about 18 of indonesia s land area in sumatra alone the highest producer of oil palm there is 13 million ha of marginal lands out of these 7 5 million ha can be brought under cultivation sulaiman et al 2019 this makes indonesia host to the largest area of pyritic soils as compared to other countries wignyosukarto 2013 although these lands were historically reclaimed by local indigenous populations the indonesian government has started to utilize these lands on a large scale from 1970 s suryadi 2020 the usual technique to drain these lands is to construct drainage canal networks which will carry the water to the surrounding larger water bodies however this lowering of water exposes the pyritic soil layers to oxidation resulting in the acidic conditions in the soil making them unsuitable for crop cultivation therefore water management techniques for these plantations require the submergence of the pyritic layer thereby adding to the total water requirement of the oil palm plantations the water requirement of oil palm plantations on marginal lands is twofold the plant water requirement and maintenance of the groundwater level to submerge the acid pyrite layer and prevent oxidation therefore calculations of the water footprint of oil palm plantations will increase considerably hashim et al 2014 estimated the water footprint of oil palm plantations by considering a constant evapotranspiration need of the crop hashim et al 2014 however water footprint studies using a constant evapotranspiration value for the entire life of plantation can result in lower estimates of water needs as plantations are affected by not only different climatic conditions where they are grown but also the different stages of growth they require a different amount of water input moreover subramaniam et al 2020 extended these calculations to assess the water footprint of the entire supply chain of the oil palm production their analysis showed that fresh fruit bunch production does not increase much pressure on the total blue water requirement as compared to the other processes in palm oil production apart from the variable water requirements because of the different climates and age of the plant if pyritic marginal lands are utilized for the production of oil palm it will further increase the water footprint of the crop at the field level therefore it is important to include these important variables for the calculation of water needs for the production of fresh fruit bunch of oil palm grown on the marginal lands crop modeling frameworks have been developed for better management of different inputs and improving yield by simulating the crop growth their gradual development over the past decades has resulted in the expansion of these modeling frameworks as agriculture production system models these models incorporate information not only about the growth of the crops but link them to weather soil and management conditions they are used for the guidance of farmers and policymakers for the optimum use of resources and planning purposes holzworth et al 2015 furthermore these models can also help in the estimations of water footprint accounting of the crops agricultural production systems simulator apsim is one such modeling system keating et al 2003 holzworth et al 2014 it contains different crop modules and management modules linked through a common framework for simulating the growth of different crops in different climatic and soil conditions huth et al 2014 developed and tested the oil palm module of crop growth for this model this module can simulate the growth of oil palm plantations for an extended period of time by accounting for the longer fruiting and growing periods and requires different inputs during different stages of plant growth huth et al 2014 different management interventions that can exert an effect on output of oil palm fruit are the input of water and fertilizers therefore quantification of water input will be helpful for establishing water requirements of the crop at the field scale throughout the entire period of growth which is the major component in the water footprint computation for oil palm apsim oil palm has been used in a number of cases to study the growth of oil palm for extended periods of time to better understand its interplay with the environment okoro et al 2017 studied the impact of climate change on the oil palm growth in the nigerian delta region they used global circulation models to predict the climate at the end of the century and resulting impacts on the oil palm growth okoro et al 2017 pardon et al 2017 estimated the yield response of oil palm by varying the n application and resulting loss of n from the plantation by using apsim culman et al 2019 used apsim oil palm to optimize the irrigation application by using vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture data in a columbian plantation this modeling platform can capture multiple complex processes over extended periods of time for better planting and environmental impact assessment hence in our study we use the apsim modeling framework to quantify the water requirements of oil palm plantations occupying the marginal pyritic soils in sumatra indonesia this analysis is based on actual climate and soil conditions in the major oil palm growing area of the country which also has the largest area of marginal lands in the nation this is the first known study to quantify water requirements of oil palm grown on marginal soils at the field scale by taking into consideration both the local soil and climatic conditions for an extended eight year period the crop modeling framework used in this study can serve as a helpful tool for determining the crop water footprint at the field scale where the usual practice is only to use one single value of crop evapotranspiration for oil palm regardless of growth period 2 material and methods apsim keating et al 2003 holzworth et al 2014 was used for the simulation of oil palm growth from 2012 to 2019 8 years apsim is able to model plant growth by taking consideration of actual soil conditions and weather conditions moreover different management strategies can be applied according to the requirement of plant growth 2 1 study area the study area was located in the rawapitu district of lampung province of sumatra island at latitude 4 16 s and longitude 105 36 e at 3 m average above sea level the plantation is located near the coast of the java sea and it is owned by the government company pt perkebunan nusantara there are 135 trees planted per hectare the plantation and the plot studied is shown in figs 1a and 1b the river tributary paidada also passes close to the plantation which is the source of irrigation water for the plantation the paidada river joins the tulangbawang river a little further downstream which ultimately flows into the java sea water management infrastructure has been installed at the site to regulate water flows and levels specifically a water gate was built to control inflow and outflow caused by tidal movement drain blocks also were installed within the canal to maintain subsurface water levels between 40 and 60 cm from the surface to enhance plant productivity 2 2 climate data the indonesian archipelago is located along the equator this gives the country a hot and humid climate throughout the year indonesia in general has wet and a dry seasons although the timing and intensity of precipitation varies with location and elevation seasonal differences are due to the monsoonal nature of the climate the dry season starts in may and lasts until september the wet season is from october to march august is the driest month averaging approximately 50 mm and december the wettest with a mean of 300 mm a six fold difference the temperature range is rather constant between 22 and 33 c with an average temperature of 28 c the annual average rainfall is in the range 2000 3000 mm the climate data rainfall air temperature and solar radiation for the present study were obtained from the nasa power prediction of worldwide energy resources project the power project derives its data from the following nasa sources world climate research program wcrp global energy and water cycle experiment gewex surface radiation budget project nasa gewex srb and the clouds and the earth s radiant energy system ceres projects at nasa larc as well as the global modeling and assimilation office at the goddard space flight center https power larc nasa gov 2 3 apsim model description apsim is an agriculture modeling framework that allows different components of the farming system to be plugged into the main engine these include the modules for soil weather and different management practices apsim was developed by the agriculture production systems research unit a collaborating unit between the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization csiro and queensland state government agencies australia the main advantage of the model is that it allows the simulation of the growth of the crop by considering the different climatic and soil conditions moreover users can specify different management scenarios as well fig 2 is the schematic diagram showing different components of the model for a deeper description of the model we refer readers to keating et al 2003 and holzworth et al 2014 2 4 oil palm simulation for the biophysical development of the oil palm the model developed by huth et al 2014 was used which can be plugged in to the apsim modeling framework apsim oil palm was able to simulate the growth of the stem fronds roots and bunches as well as water and elemental cycling moreover it also incorporates the development of understory crop which dies off as a plantation matures the model was tested for multi year data for three plantations in papa new guinea they validated the model by comparing the modeled biomass growth to the actual growth observed for a 17 year period for details about the development and model testing the reader is referred to huth et al 2014 for the validation of our simulation we compared the modeled evapotranspiration et values to the et values computed by röll et al 2015 and manoli et al 2018 röll et al 2015 studied evapotranspiration values of different aged 2 25 years for 1 year oil palms in sumatra indonesia by measuring sap flux rate and employing the eddy covariance technique meanwhile manoli et al 2018 modeled the ecohydrological impacts induced by tropical forest conversion to oil palm plantations 2 5 soil processes apsim has the capability to model soil processes in detail hence the emphasis is not only on crop growth but also the soil conditions which are important the water and nitrogen n requirements are major considerations for any kind of crop these are the principal inputs that require management intervention therefore if we take optimum n application we can estimate the amount of water that will be required for the entire growth period of the crop to achieve maximum growth moreover the components related to soil organic matter were also kept the same as in huth et al 2014 this seems to be a reasonable assumption as our study area also lies along the same latitude as huth et al 2014 2 6 water movement soilwat is a cascading bucket water balance model the plant water uptake lower limit is taken as the bottom of the bucket while the maximum field capacity of the soil is taken as the top of the bucket the algorithms used for the water distribution throughout soil profile are from the ceres family of models however minor modifications were implemented for example soil parameters like unsaturated flow and saturated flow were determined separately for each layer further the decomposition of organic matter takes consideration of local climatic conditions probert et al 1998 hydrologic processes in the soil were modeled by taking consideration of climatic conditions and plant needs plant uptake of water was specified for each layer in terms of the lower limit of 15 bar potential ll15 lowest potential below which plant cannot extract water drained upper limit of 0 33 bar potential dul akin to field capacity and saturated volumetric water content before the start of the simulation the initial water was kept at 50 of plant available soil water throughout the soil profile runoff was calculated using the usda curve number technique soil evaporation was calculated as a two stage process in the first stage evaporation occurs at the potential evaporation rate calculated from priestly and taylor 1972 and in the second stage after evaporation becomes limited was defined by the fraction of square root of time after the end of first stage evaporation the movement of water from upper to lower soil layers happens in three ways firstly water below the saturation and drained upper limit moves or infiltrates to the lower layer governed by the factor swcon secondly the water between the lower limit and drained upper or unsaturated water flow depends on the average amount of water in the two soil layers and value of diffusivity constant finally the movement of water above saturation is controlled by mwcon the value can be 0 or 1 a value of 1 indicates that all the water above saturation moves to the layer below on the contrary a value of 0 indicates an impermeable layer and water starts to back up the soil layer where the value is set to zero will either become the groundwater below the layer or if it is the surface layer water will back up as it ponds on the surface 2 7 groundwater level data in our model setup we have fixed the groundwater level at a depth of 60 cm 600 mm below the surface of the soil this level is set on the basis of actual field observations in which the water level fluctuates between 40 and 60 cm depth thereby providing space for roots for proper development following bloomfield and zahri 1982 the required groundwater level for optimum growth of oil palm on pyritic soils is a constant high 40 45 cm water table below the surface if the water drops below this level soils become more acidic resulting in a significant drop of yield and wilting of crops therefore the explicit purpose of irrigation in these soils at our particular site was to maintain a constant groundwater level of 40 50 cm rather than meeting the plant water requirements of the crop moreover an irrigation efficiency of 80 was used because losses are only due to evaporation and the rest of the water becomes part of the groundwater 2 8 soil data for specifying the soil parameters for the crop growth soil samples from different depths were taken from the plantation site three samples were taken at each depth and the soil is classified according to the particle size distribution table 1 shows the soil characteristics taken from different depths of the plantation pedotransfer functions ptf were used to calculate the hydraulic parameters of the soil for different soil characteristics from rosetta developed by usda which uses the method of van genuchten 1980 water retention parameters are calculated the needed parameters are bulk density g cm3 air dry ll15 dul drained upper limit or field capacity saturated content and hydraulic conductivity ks some ks values increase with soil depth this is because of the specific texture of the soil profile in these marginal lands whereby some deeper soil layers either contain higher percentages of sand or have low bulk densities for example the middle two layers from 20 to 82 cm have lower bulk density while the lower most layer 82 200 cm has a higher sand fraction the values are shown in table 2 2 9 other data requirements for fertilizer input n fertilizer was simultaneously added at a rate of 0 14 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 05 kg palm for 1 2 3 4 years and mature palms respectively after indonesian oil palm research institute using the palm manager module this resulted in no deficiency of n during the simulation period because plant growth is sensitive to n concentration surface organic matter was simulated in two ways first apsim simulated the effect of organic matter that is left from the previous plantation or crop on soil water second it degrades the organic matter and constantly adds to the soil organic pool this includes not only previous organic matter that is present but also new matter added during harvest and natural aging of plants these values were adopted after huth et al 2014 at 20 000 kg ha of fronds and stem on the field before plantation with a carbon and nitrogen ratio of 75 2 10 understory growth and model parameterization the understory story growth in oil palm plantations under real conditions is either composed of legumes or grasses the resulting interaction between the understory and overstory growth is a complex process and the full complexity of growth of understory is not fully captured by any modeling platforms huth et al 2014 in apsim oil palm the understory is modeled based on the simplified assumption that the understory cover decreases with age at first and then stabilizes with a fixed amount of understory present throughout the plantation s life after the initial decrease the light use efficiency is assumed to be 1 3 g mj 1 and the understory biomass enters the carbon pool of the soil profile with about 2 of it supplying n to the overstory biomass in case of legumes and 0 05 of n in case of grasses huth et al 2014 the parameterization of the model is shown in the table 3 3 results 3 1 scenario 1 control without irrigation fig 3 shows the plant water requirement of the oil palm per ha in the case of no maintenance of the groundwater level or irrigation by eliminating these two factors it is possible to see the evapotranspiration demand of the plantation under baseline conditions before the age of 4 years the maximum plant water requirement reaches approximately 140 mm per month there is considerable reduction of total evapotranspiration at the end of the third and seventh years due to reduced rainfall in these years therefore at the plantation site there is water deficit that hampered the optimum growth of oil palm trees table 4 shows the total annual water use in terms of evapotranspiration without irrigation the annual evapotranspiration will reach the maximum level of about 1500 mm in the fifth year on the other hand the lowest value is about 800 mm during the first year however as the plantation matures the rainfall is not sufficient to meet the water demand of the crop therefore the annual evapotranspiration amount dropped from the fifth year onward clearly indicating the need for irrigation to sustain yield from the plantations 3 2 scenario 2 irrigation application in this second scenario actual conditions at the plantation site are simulated in the model which was the maintenance of a high water table through irrigation the groundwater level was fixed at 600 mm below the soil surface of the plantations and irrigation was applied to retain the maximum groundwater level of 500 mm actual condition on the plantation fig 4 shows the resulting increase in evapotranspiration from the plantation site notice the increased et rates at the end of third and seventh years as compared to control scenario due to application of irrigation et rates mostly vary in the range of 120 170 mm per month from the 4th until the 8th year of plantation table 5 shows the total annual rainfall total annual irrigation applied and corresponding evapotranspiration from the plantation site from 2012 to 2019 the total evapotranspiration steadily increased from about 900 mm per year to 1700 mm per year from the first to the 8th year of the plantation table 5 if we compare the difference of evapotranspiration from the plantation site with and without irrigation the total increase in et was about 150 mm in the first year and reached about 500 mm in the eighth year however the increase was not linearly distributed in some years such as fifth 2016 and seventh 2018 the increase was about 35 mm and 200 mm respectively fig 5 shows the total amount of water applied and the average groundwater level during the eight years of plantation the irrigated annual groundwater level generally remained at about 500 mm albeit somewhat lower in the fifth and sixth years and higher in the fourth and eighth years which aims to mitigate the impact of acidic soil conditions by covering the pyritic layer in the soil profile bloomfield and zahari 1982 the average water requirement for the plantation increases to about 5500 mm double the amount of annual average rainfall at the plantation site fig 5 however the distribution of the total amount of required water was different in different years the total first year irrigation water applied was the lowest about 2500 mm and in the fifth and sixth year it was the highest about 3800 mm table 5 the amount of irrigation applied was higher than the total amount of rainfall during any year 4 discussion oil palms grown on pyritic marginal soils provide a special challenge of maintaining a high water table level to mitigate the effects of acidic soils therefore maintaining a high water table produces additional water demand on top of the plant water requirements considerably increasing the total water requirement of the plantation our analysis of oil palm grown on a single plantation for eight years show that more than 95 of irrigation applied during 6 of 8 years was to fulfill the demand for maintaining a high groundwater level and for the remaining two years 80 of irrigation water applied was used for the same purpose irrigation applied to the plantation was more than the total annual rainfall in the region thereby indicating that a large amount of water i e on average 3300 mm of irrigation per year as compared to average rainfall of 2200 mm year is needed to maintain suitable groundwater levels to maintain oil palm yields therefore the water footprint of oil palm grown on the marginal pyritic soils was 80 95 more than grown on normal soils our simulated et values were validated by comparing our et values predicted by the model to the et values reported in previous studies manoli et al 2018 modeled evapotranspiration for young oil palm plants age 5 years in a range of 1000 1600 mm year on average while for mature oil palms age 8 years from 1200 to 1800 mm year similarly our et values for young oil palm varied between 900 and 1600 mm year from the first to the fifth year likewise our et values ranged from 1600 to 1700 mm year from sixth to eighth year corresponding closely with their study using the eddy covariance methods röll et al 2015 found an evapotranspiration rate of 2 8 4 7 mm day on a sunny day for 2 12 years old stands for oil palms grown on sumatra indonesia by extending these values they range from roughly 1022 1715 mm year which also lie close to our simulated values 900 1700 mm year one major advantage of conducting the simulation study is that we can account for the water lost not only due to oil palm evapotranspiration but also evapotranspiration associated with oil palm understory and evaporation from the ground soil layer the oil palm understory evapotranspiration was about 800 mm during the first year of plantation and dropped to approximately 60 mm at the end of the eighth year of simulation meanwhile soil evaporation reached about 500 mm at the end of the fourth year and then stabilized at more or less 400 mm for the remaining four years as the understory dies off and exposes more soil for direct evaporation table 5 and fig 4 these processes account for about 90 80 of total evapotranspiration during the first two years of plantation hence they cannot be ignored during the initial years of growth moreover even during the seventh and eighth year the combined evaporation from soil and understory et account for 30 of total et therefore estimation of water footprint based on simulation shows diverse drivers of et than merely using one constant value our main goal of the simulation was to maintain the groundwater level at 500 mm below the soil surface of the plantation this decision is based on the actual field practice of maintaining water level at this range this is the standard practice that is followed after bloomfield and zahari 1982 therefore in order to maintain a constant water table level we have used the criteria of applying irrigation if the rainfall in three consecutive days was less than 20 mm this scenario produced the desired water level within the preferred range but with some year to year fluctuations fig 5 furthermore the effects of a high water table on the yield of oil palm are also not fully understood carr 2011 hardanto et al 2017 compared the difference in sap flux densities of oil palm grown on low lying flooded lands and non flooded lands they found minor differences of sap flux densities between the two areas planted by the same species however the effects of change of yield were not observed in the study hardanto et al 2017 there is also evidence of the change in root biomass in oil palm seedlings for waterlogged conditions but no effect was observed on the above ground biomass of the seedlings da ponte et al 2019 for flood tolerant trees it is observed that about 96 recovery of photosynthesis within short period after flooding however long term effects of flooding can have negative effects on the plant physiology pallardy 2008 therefore it is required to establish a relationship between the different soil types and different level of water tables below the soil surface to maintain the maximum yield from the oil palm plantations grown on different soil types carr 2011 this will help to mitigate the yield gap for the plantations grown on the marginal lands the overall water movement in the soil profile of the plantation is captured by the soilwat model it has couple of limitations that can impact the results first soilwat is developed for non saturated soils and its application in saturated conditions can result in errors predicting soil water movement second as this model is a cascading bucket model it cannot predict accurately the effects of lateral movement of soil water tables 4 and 5 show that overall et rates against the input of rainfall and irrigation the excess water applied apart from et for the plant requirements either becomes a component of runoff or part of the drainage component in the cascading bucket approach therefore if we extend our results for plantations over a larger area it can cause two outcomes if plantations are on the upstream end of the ground water movement drained water will become part of maintained groundwater for lower areas second if the plantations are located close to the sea then drained water will become part of the sea hence for plantations located close to sea our model results will not differ much but for upstream areas it would overpredict the water needs however further research can couple hydrodynamic models with plant growth to better capture the real water conditions one of the important considerations for the oil palm grown on marginal lands is the yield of fresh fruit bunches the plantation site of our study area suffers from both high acidic content in soil layers and periodic low water table levels which cause acidic conditions and likely compromise yields fig 6 shows the actual yield from the plantation for an 8 year period and modeled yield there was a considerable difference between the two yield levels maximum yield from the actual plantation reached levels of 10 tonnes ha during the last two years however the maximum simulated yield reached the level of 30 tonnes ha in the simulated scenario moreover the yield gap starts to diverge from the second year onwards there can be many factors that could have influenced the yield in our area for instance there is some evidence that the yield of oil palm is affected by the soil type of the plantations therefore subjecting plants to different types of stresses hoffmann et al 2017 the fao s hwsd map indicates that the dominant soil in this area is a dystric histosols which was consistent with our observations the simulation of the oil palm module in apsim was verified in the oil palm plantations of papa new guinea where the dominant soil groups are molli andisols subjecting soils to different stresses such as seasonal moisture stresses as compared to the soil of our current plantation which suffers from poor drainage and sulfide layer in the soil profile harmonized world soil database v1 2 fao soils portal food and agriculture organization of the united nations n d although oil palm can better tolerate acidic conditions than most plantation crops very low ph values can hinder growth and impact fruit yield for instance it is shown that oil palm can grow well even at a ph of 4 3 and less than ideal drainage conditions shamshuddin et al 2014 however the performance of oil palm is affected when ph drops below the above level moreover water can become more acidic under waterlogged conditions with consistent leaching of the pyritic layer shamshuddin et al 2014 hence flushing is performed during the wet season by carefully operating the canal gates and replacing the old water from the dry season with the freshwater from rainfall and excess river flow although these mitigating measures can improve plantation conditions they will produce less yield than plantations with better soils on prime land therefore further research towards better cultivar types or soil treatments can improve the yield level of oil palm grown on marginal lands apart from the wet soil conditions or water quality issues that impact the oil palm yield yield calculations can be affected by the oil palm cultivar the apsim oil palm module is developed using the cultivar dami developed by new britain palm oil limited group in papua new guinea although this cultivar is reported to be high yielding dumortier et al n d the cultivation of this variety on pyritic soils is not fully understood however the indonesian oil palm research institute is also developing suitable cultivars that can better tolerate acidic conditions therefore future model calibration should take into account the different cultivars of oil palm as well in addition there is a continued yield gap difference between potential and actual yields in some oil palm plantations of indonesia between modeled values and remotely sensed estimations using remote sensing khiabani and takeuchi 2020 showed that actual yield from the plantations of sumatra indonesia ranged from 8 5 t ha and 15 4 t ha while the yield from our plantation site varied from 5 t ha to 10 t ha from sixth year onward we expected a lower bunch yield based on the marginal lands of our plantations our observed yields correspond better to remotely sensed yields than those output from apsim fig 6 a total of 28 tonnes of fresh fruit bunches are harvested per ha during the eight year study period however the water applied to the site during the eight year period was 17 000 mm of rainfall and 26 000 mm of irrigation in other words 170 000 m3 of rainfall and 260 000 m3 of irrigated water is used to produce 28 tonnes per ha of fresh fruit bunches from the study site it is important to note that water footprint studies that are carried out in the literature generally ignore the blue water footprint subramaniam et al 2014 although they acknowledge the large green water footprint of the oil palm plantations moreover it is recognized in the literature that irrigation during the dry periods of the year can increase the overall yield from the plantation site carr 2011 our study shows that for oil palm grown on pyritic soils there is a higher amount of blue water needed as compared to green water on the plantation site therefore ignoring blue water footprint can cause severe underestimation of the total water footprint accounting for oil palm production 5 conclusions the rapid expansion of oil palm driven by its high profitability has converted large tropical areas into plantations this rapid expansion has resulted in regulations that have imposed moratoria on oil palm expansion and shifted development of plantations onto marginal lands plantations in these areas provide a different kind of environmental challenge the yield of oil palm in low potential areas is considerably lower because of acidic conditions than yield in the high potential lands therefore the most common measure in order to increase the yield of the oil palm from these lands is to maintain a high water table level we have run the simulations to account for the water requirement of the oil palm if they are planted on low potential lands our analysis shows that the water requirement of the plants increases considerably with plantation age especially 4 5 years after plantation establishment primarily due to the need of a sufficiently high water table about 80 95 more irrigation water is required to make oil palm plantations possible on these lands previous studies conducted on water footprint accounting of oil palm ignore this consideration in their analysis these studies also fail to address varying water needs during different stages of the plantation we estimate that in our study area rawapitu plantation in indonesia about 15 000 m3 of water is required to cultivate 1 ton of fresh fruit bunches from the site about 6200 m3 is from green water use rainfall and 8800 m3 is from blue water use irrigation water applied to the site however it is important to note that our modeling was not able to capture the effect of yield reduction on the marginal lands it can either be due to a lack of understanding of soil chemical processes that affect the yield cultivar and or the effect of high water level none of which are well understood on the oil palm growth on marginal lands this shortcoming is an important area of future research nevertheless using the apsim modeling framework along with the apsim oil palm and other modules we are able to reasonably approximate field water requirements at our site over an eight year period thereby highlighting the utility of apsim for tracking oil palm water requirements in relation to plantation age on marginal soils declaration of

9790,oil palm is one of the most rapidly growing tree crops in the tropics it is long lasting and high yielding serving as an input for a number of profitable industries the rapid expansion of oil palm has triggered environmental change historically the focus has been on the impact of biodiversity loss however the water requirements of oil palm plantations which traditionally depended on rainfall only are also changing partly because environmental concerns are directing oil palm expansion and cultivation into marginal areas according to some estimates these lands with cultivable marginal soils having an acid pyrite layer in the soil profile comprise about 7 5 million ha in indonesia here we employed the agricultural production systems simulator apsim to simulate the growth of oil palm on marginal lands within indonesia over an eight year period apsim oil palm was used to estimate the irrigation water requirement at different stages of plant growth for actual weather and soil conditions traditionally water footprint accounting of oil palm plantations at the field level considers one uniform value of evapotranspiration our analysis shows that considering a single value for the entire period of oil palm growth underestimates the water requirement at the field scale annual irrigation needs were found to range from 2543 mm to 3865 mm for the plantation ages examined 0 8 years we approximate that 8800 m3 of blue water and 6200 m3 of green water is required per ton of fresh fruit bunch produced from the study plantation occupying marginal lands where water requirements were largely governed by maintenance of a high water table similarly high volumes are likely to be required where oil palm is cultivated on pyritic soils thus the irrigation water requirement can no longer be neglected as oil palm plantations continue to expand onto marginal soils graphical abstract ga1 keywords oil palm expansion marginal lands water footprint apsim oil palm simulation 1 introduction oil palm is one of the most valuable oil crops in the world gilbert 2012 oil palm is not only used for cooking but also as animal feed input to a number of cosmetic products and biofuel moreover oil palm has a high yield per unit of fruit and the management of this crop is relatively easy therefore it is not surprising that we are seeing the rapid development of oil palm plantations in different countries around the world from 2009 to 2019 the area planted under this crop increased from 16 million ha to 28 million ha at the same time fresh fruit bunch yield has almost doubled from 217 million tonnes to 411 million tonnes faostat n d this trend continues with the doubling of oil palm production in every decade khatun et al 2017 oil palm elaeis guineensis jacq originated in tropical areas of central and west africa along the coastal belts between 5 n to 7 s corley and tinker 2015 therefore it is adapted to natural conditions of high rainfall throughout the year so water requirements of oil palm are generally considered to be fulfilled by the rainfall in tropical areas green water requirement however expansion of oil palm into other countries has increased its latitudinal range from 19 n to 16 s therefore oil palm plantations in areas of less rainfall require additional water from irrigation blue water requirement to maintain yield levels carr 2011 moreover the expansion of oil palm into areas of different soil characteristics can impose additional water demand for the plantations bloomfield and zahari 1982 the expansion of oil palm outside africa increased rapidly in southeast asia during the 19th century in fact malaysia and indonesia together are responsible for 77 of the total production of fresh fruit bunches of the world and represent 70 of the total world area under oil palm plantations in 2019 faostat n d the recent exponential expansion in these nations has brought in substantial revenues to this region for example in 2014 oil palm production and processing contributed 17 of the total agricultural gdp of indonesia and employed about 8 million people purnomo et al 2020 however the expansion of these plantations is imposing environmental stresses in terms of biodiversity loss land use change and water stresses vijay et al 2016 some studies suggesting that global oil palm expansion both small holder and large plantations is responsible for a significant proportion of tropical forest replacement vijay et al 2016 while other studies have pointed to a host of factors such as illegal logging commercial forestry forest fires etc contributing to the forest replacement gaveau et al 2016 regardless 27 of global forest loss has been attributed to commodity production including oil palm curtis et al 2018 due to forest loss there is a broad consensus to restrict the agricultural development in rainforests for example the indonesian government with international help has imposed a moratorium in different forms from 2010 until now on the expansion of oil palm plantations in forested areas palm oil industry in indonesia cpo production export indonesia investments n d on the other hand to continue to reap the economic benefits of this crop the government has made a policy for utilizing marginal lands which are not covered by forests or peatlands for plantations degraded land sustainable palm oil and indonesia s future 2010 this expansion of oil palm plantations into marginal lands thereby imposes different kinds of environmental and water management challenges such as low ph levels of water and constant submergence of particular soil layers in water the marginal agricultural areas in indonesia are the low potential coastal lands these areas are swampy with poor drainage under natural conditions historically these lands were submerged under the sea which caused the formation of acid sulfate pyrite soils containing a pyritic layer either in the shallow layer of the soil profile or in the deep layer when this pyrite layer is exposed to the atmosphere as a result of drainage it is oxidized causing acidic conditions and other environmental impacts according to some estimates these marginal lands comprise about 18 of indonesia s land area in sumatra alone the highest producer of oil palm there is 13 million ha of marginal lands out of these 7 5 million ha can be brought under cultivation sulaiman et al 2019 this makes indonesia host to the largest area of pyritic soils as compared to other countries wignyosukarto 2013 although these lands were historically reclaimed by local indigenous populations the indonesian government has started to utilize these lands on a large scale from 1970 s suryadi 2020 the usual technique to drain these lands is to construct drainage canal networks which will carry the water to the surrounding larger water bodies however this lowering of water exposes the pyritic soil layers to oxidation resulting in the acidic conditions in the soil making them unsuitable for crop cultivation therefore water management techniques for these plantations require the submergence of the pyritic layer thereby adding to the total water requirement of the oil palm plantations the water requirement of oil palm plantations on marginal lands is twofold the plant water requirement and maintenance of the groundwater level to submerge the acid pyrite layer and prevent oxidation therefore calculations of the water footprint of oil palm plantations will increase considerably hashim et al 2014 estimated the water footprint of oil palm plantations by considering a constant evapotranspiration need of the crop hashim et al 2014 however water footprint studies using a constant evapotranspiration value for the entire life of plantation can result in lower estimates of water needs as plantations are affected by not only different climatic conditions where they are grown but also the different stages of growth they require a different amount of water input moreover subramaniam et al 2020 extended these calculations to assess the water footprint of the entire supply chain of the oil palm production their analysis showed that fresh fruit bunch production does not increase much pressure on the total blue water requirement as compared to the other processes in palm oil production apart from the variable water requirements because of the different climates and age of the plant if pyritic marginal lands are utilized for the production of oil palm it will further increase the water footprint of the crop at the field level therefore it is important to include these important variables for the calculation of water needs for the production of fresh fruit bunch of oil palm grown on the marginal lands crop modeling frameworks have been developed for better management of different inputs and improving yield by simulating the crop growth their gradual development over the past decades has resulted in the expansion of these modeling frameworks as agriculture production system models these models incorporate information not only about the growth of the crops but link them to weather soil and management conditions they are used for the guidance of farmers and policymakers for the optimum use of resources and planning purposes holzworth et al 2015 furthermore these models can also help in the estimations of water footprint accounting of the crops agricultural production systems simulator apsim is one such modeling system keating et al 2003 holzworth et al 2014 it contains different crop modules and management modules linked through a common framework for simulating the growth of different crops in different climatic and soil conditions huth et al 2014 developed and tested the oil palm module of crop growth for this model this module can simulate the growth of oil palm plantations for an extended period of time by accounting for the longer fruiting and growing periods and requires different inputs during different stages of plant growth huth et al 2014 different management interventions that can exert an effect on output of oil palm fruit are the input of water and fertilizers therefore quantification of water input will be helpful for establishing water requirements of the crop at the field scale throughout the entire period of growth which is the major component in the water footprint computation for oil palm apsim oil palm has been used in a number of cases to study the growth of oil palm for extended periods of time to better understand its interplay with the environment okoro et al 2017 studied the impact of climate change on the oil palm growth in the nigerian delta region they used global circulation models to predict the climate at the end of the century and resulting impacts on the oil palm growth okoro et al 2017 pardon et al 2017 estimated the yield response of oil palm by varying the n application and resulting loss of n from the plantation by using apsim culman et al 2019 used apsim oil palm to optimize the irrigation application by using vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture data in a columbian plantation this modeling platform can capture multiple complex processes over extended periods of time for better planting and environmental impact assessment hence in our study we use the apsim modeling framework to quantify the water requirements of oil palm plantations occupying the marginal pyritic soils in sumatra indonesia this analysis is based on actual climate and soil conditions in the major oil palm growing area of the country which also has the largest area of marginal lands in the nation this is the first known study to quantify water requirements of oil palm grown on marginal soils at the field scale by taking into consideration both the local soil and climatic conditions for an extended eight year period the crop modeling framework used in this study can serve as a helpful tool for determining the crop water footprint at the field scale where the usual practice is only to use one single value of crop evapotranspiration for oil palm regardless of growth period 2 material and methods apsim keating et al 2003 holzworth et al 2014 was used for the simulation of oil palm growth from 2012 to 2019 8 years apsim is able to model plant growth by taking consideration of actual soil conditions and weather conditions moreover different management strategies can be applied according to the requirement of plant growth 2 1 study area the study area was located in the rawapitu district of lampung province of sumatra island at latitude 4 16 s and longitude 105 36 e at 3 m average above sea level the plantation is located near the coast of the java sea and it is owned by the government company pt perkebunan nusantara there are 135 trees planted per hectare the plantation and the plot studied is shown in figs 1a and 1b the river tributary paidada also passes close to the plantation which is the source of irrigation water for the plantation the paidada river joins the tulangbawang river a little further downstream which ultimately flows into the java sea water management infrastructure has been installed at the site to regulate water flows and levels specifically a water gate was built to control inflow and outflow caused by tidal movement drain blocks also were installed within the canal to maintain subsurface water levels between 40 and 60 cm from the surface to enhance plant productivity 2 2 climate data the indonesian archipelago is located along the equator this gives the country a hot and humid climate throughout the year indonesia in general has wet and a dry seasons although the timing and intensity of precipitation varies with location and elevation seasonal differences are due to the monsoonal nature of the climate the dry season starts in may and lasts until september the wet season is from october to march august is the driest month averaging approximately 50 mm and december the wettest with a mean of 300 mm a six fold difference the temperature range is rather constant between 22 and 33 c with an average temperature of 28 c the annual average rainfall is in the range 2000 3000 mm the climate data rainfall air temperature and solar radiation for the present study were obtained from the nasa power prediction of worldwide energy resources project the power project derives its data from the following nasa sources world climate research program wcrp global energy and water cycle experiment gewex surface radiation budget project nasa gewex srb and the clouds and the earth s radiant energy system ceres projects at nasa larc as well as the global modeling and assimilation office at the goddard space flight center https power larc nasa gov 2 3 apsim model description apsim is an agriculture modeling framework that allows different components of the farming system to be plugged into the main engine these include the modules for soil weather and different management practices apsim was developed by the agriculture production systems research unit a collaborating unit between the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization csiro and queensland state government agencies australia the main advantage of the model is that it allows the simulation of the growth of the crop by considering the different climatic and soil conditions moreover users can specify different management scenarios as well fig 2 is the schematic diagram showing different components of the model for a deeper description of the model we refer readers to keating et al 2003 and holzworth et al 2014 2 4 oil palm simulation for the biophysical development of the oil palm the model developed by huth et al 2014 was used which can be plugged in to the apsim modeling framework apsim oil palm was able to simulate the growth of the stem fronds roots and bunches as well as water and elemental cycling moreover it also incorporates the development of understory crop which dies off as a plantation matures the model was tested for multi year data for three plantations in papa new guinea they validated the model by comparing the modeled biomass growth to the actual growth observed for a 17 year period for details about the development and model testing the reader is referred to huth et al 2014 for the validation of our simulation we compared the modeled evapotranspiration et values to the et values computed by röll et al 2015 and manoli et al 2018 röll et al 2015 studied evapotranspiration values of different aged 2 25 years for 1 year oil palms in sumatra indonesia by measuring sap flux rate and employing the eddy covariance technique meanwhile manoli et al 2018 modeled the ecohydrological impacts induced by tropical forest conversion to oil palm plantations 2 5 soil processes apsim has the capability to model soil processes in detail hence the emphasis is not only on crop growth but also the soil conditions which are important the water and nitrogen n requirements are major considerations for any kind of crop these are the principal inputs that require management intervention therefore if we take optimum n application we can estimate the amount of water that will be required for the entire growth period of the crop to achieve maximum growth moreover the components related to soil organic matter were also kept the same as in huth et al 2014 this seems to be a reasonable assumption as our study area also lies along the same latitude as huth et al 2014 2 6 water movement soilwat is a cascading bucket water balance model the plant water uptake lower limit is taken as the bottom of the bucket while the maximum field capacity of the soil is taken as the top of the bucket the algorithms used for the water distribution throughout soil profile are from the ceres family of models however minor modifications were implemented for example soil parameters like unsaturated flow and saturated flow were determined separately for each layer further the decomposition of organic matter takes consideration of local climatic conditions probert et al 1998 hydrologic processes in the soil were modeled by taking consideration of climatic conditions and plant needs plant uptake of water was specified for each layer in terms of the lower limit of 15 bar potential ll15 lowest potential below which plant cannot extract water drained upper limit of 0 33 bar potential dul akin to field capacity and saturated volumetric water content before the start of the simulation the initial water was kept at 50 of plant available soil water throughout the soil profile runoff was calculated using the usda curve number technique soil evaporation was calculated as a two stage process in the first stage evaporation occurs at the potential evaporation rate calculated from priestly and taylor 1972 and in the second stage after evaporation becomes limited was defined by the fraction of square root of time after the end of first stage evaporation the movement of water from upper to lower soil layers happens in three ways firstly water below the saturation and drained upper limit moves or infiltrates to the lower layer governed by the factor swcon secondly the water between the lower limit and drained upper or unsaturated water flow depends on the average amount of water in the two soil layers and value of diffusivity constant finally the movement of water above saturation is controlled by mwcon the value can be 0 or 1 a value of 1 indicates that all the water above saturation moves to the layer below on the contrary a value of 0 indicates an impermeable layer and water starts to back up the soil layer where the value is set to zero will either become the groundwater below the layer or if it is the surface layer water will back up as it ponds on the surface 2 7 groundwater level data in our model setup we have fixed the groundwater level at a depth of 60 cm 600 mm below the surface of the soil this level is set on the basis of actual field observations in which the water level fluctuates between 40 and 60 cm depth thereby providing space for roots for proper development following bloomfield and zahri 1982 the required groundwater level for optimum growth of oil palm on pyritic soils is a constant high 40 45 cm water table below the surface if the water drops below this level soils become more acidic resulting in a significant drop of yield and wilting of crops therefore the explicit purpose of irrigation in these soils at our particular site was to maintain a constant groundwater level of 40 50 cm rather than meeting the plant water requirements of the crop moreover an irrigation efficiency of 80 was used because losses are only due to evaporation and the rest of the water becomes part of the groundwater 2 8 soil data for specifying the soil parameters for the crop growth soil samples from different depths were taken from the plantation site three samples were taken at each depth and the soil is classified according to the particle size distribution table 1 shows the soil characteristics taken from different depths of the plantation pedotransfer functions ptf were used to calculate the hydraulic parameters of the soil for different soil characteristics from rosetta developed by usda which uses the method of van genuchten 1980 water retention parameters are calculated the needed parameters are bulk density g cm3 air dry ll15 dul drained upper limit or field capacity saturated content and hydraulic conductivity ks some ks values increase with soil depth this is because of the specific texture of the soil profile in these marginal lands whereby some deeper soil layers either contain higher percentages of sand or have low bulk densities for example the middle two layers from 20 to 82 cm have lower bulk density while the lower most layer 82 200 cm has a higher sand fraction the values are shown in table 2 2 9 other data requirements for fertilizer input n fertilizer was simultaneously added at a rate of 0 14 0 3 0 6 0 9 and 1 05 kg palm for 1 2 3 4 years and mature palms respectively after indonesian oil palm research institute using the palm manager module this resulted in no deficiency of n during the simulation period because plant growth is sensitive to n concentration surface organic matter was simulated in two ways first apsim simulated the effect of organic matter that is left from the previous plantation or crop on soil water second it degrades the organic matter and constantly adds to the soil organic pool this includes not only previous organic matter that is present but also new matter added during harvest and natural aging of plants these values were adopted after huth et al 2014 at 20 000 kg ha of fronds and stem on the field before plantation with a carbon and nitrogen ratio of 75 2 10 understory growth and model parameterization the understory story growth in oil palm plantations under real conditions is either composed of legumes or grasses the resulting interaction between the understory and overstory growth is a complex process and the full complexity of growth of understory is not fully captured by any modeling platforms huth et al 2014 in apsim oil palm the understory is modeled based on the simplified assumption that the understory cover decreases with age at first and then stabilizes with a fixed amount of understory present throughout the plantation s life after the initial decrease the light use efficiency is assumed to be 1 3 g mj 1 and the understory biomass enters the carbon pool of the soil profile with about 2 of it supplying n to the overstory biomass in case of legumes and 0 05 of n in case of grasses huth et al 2014 the parameterization of the model is shown in the table 3 3 results 3 1 scenario 1 control without irrigation fig 3 shows the plant water requirement of the oil palm per ha in the case of no maintenance of the groundwater level or irrigation by eliminating these two factors it is possible to see the evapotranspiration demand of the plantation under baseline conditions before the age of 4 years the maximum plant water requirement reaches approximately 140 mm per month there is considerable reduction of total evapotranspiration at the end of the third and seventh years due to reduced rainfall in these years therefore at the plantation site there is water deficit that hampered the optimum growth of oil palm trees table 4 shows the total annual water use in terms of evapotranspiration without irrigation the annual evapotranspiration will reach the maximum level of about 1500 mm in the fifth year on the other hand the lowest value is about 800 mm during the first year however as the plantation matures the rainfall is not sufficient to meet the water demand of the crop therefore the annual evapotranspiration amount dropped from the fifth year onward clearly indicating the need for irrigation to sustain yield from the plantations 3 2 scenario 2 irrigation application in this second scenario actual conditions at the plantation site are simulated in the model which was the maintenance of a high water table through irrigation the groundwater level was fixed at 600 mm below the soil surface of the plantations and irrigation was applied to retain the maximum groundwater level of 500 mm actual condition on the plantation fig 4 shows the resulting increase in evapotranspiration from the plantation site notice the increased et rates at the end of third and seventh years as compared to control scenario due to application of irrigation et rates mostly vary in the range of 120 170 mm per month from the 4th until the 8th year of plantation table 5 shows the total annual rainfall total annual irrigation applied and corresponding evapotranspiration from the plantation site from 2012 to 2019 the total evapotranspiration steadily increased from about 900 mm per year to 1700 mm per year from the first to the 8th year of the plantation table 5 if we compare the difference of evapotranspiration from the plantation site with and without irrigation the total increase in et was about 150 mm in the first year and reached about 500 mm in the eighth year however the increase was not linearly distributed in some years such as fifth 2016 and seventh 2018 the increase was about 35 mm and 200 mm respectively fig 5 shows the total amount of water applied and the average groundwater level during the eight years of plantation the irrigated annual groundwater level generally remained at about 500 mm albeit somewhat lower in the fifth and sixth years and higher in the fourth and eighth years which aims to mitigate the impact of acidic soil conditions by covering the pyritic layer in the soil profile bloomfield and zahari 1982 the average water requirement for the plantation increases to about 5500 mm double the amount of annual average rainfall at the plantation site fig 5 however the distribution of the total amount of required water was different in different years the total first year irrigation water applied was the lowest about 2500 mm and in the fifth and sixth year it was the highest about 3800 mm table 5 the amount of irrigation applied was higher than the total amount of rainfall during any year 4 discussion oil palms grown on pyritic marginal soils provide a special challenge of maintaining a high water table level to mitigate the effects of acidic soils therefore maintaining a high water table produces additional water demand on top of the plant water requirements considerably increasing the total water requirement of the plantation our analysis of oil palm grown on a single plantation for eight years show that more than 95 of irrigation applied during 6 of 8 years was to fulfill the demand for maintaining a high groundwater level and for the remaining two years 80 of irrigation water applied was used for the same purpose irrigation applied to the plantation was more than the total annual rainfall in the region thereby indicating that a large amount of water i e on average 3300 mm of irrigation per year as compared to average rainfall of 2200 mm year is needed to maintain suitable groundwater levels to maintain oil palm yields therefore the water footprint of oil palm grown on the marginal pyritic soils was 80 95 more than grown on normal soils our simulated et values were validated by comparing our et values predicted by the model to the et values reported in previous studies manoli et al 2018 modeled evapotranspiration for young oil palm plants age 5 years in a range of 1000 1600 mm year on average while for mature oil palms age 8 years from 1200 to 1800 mm year similarly our et values for young oil palm varied between 900 and 1600 mm year from the first to the fifth year likewise our et values ranged from 1600 to 1700 mm year from sixth to eighth year corresponding closely with their study using the eddy covariance methods röll et al 2015 found an evapotranspiration rate of 2 8 4 7 mm day on a sunny day for 2 12 years old stands for oil palms grown on sumatra indonesia by extending these values they range from roughly 1022 1715 mm year which also lie close to our simulated values 900 1700 mm year one major advantage of conducting the simulation study is that we can account for the water lost not only due to oil palm evapotranspiration but also evapotranspiration associated with oil palm understory and evaporation from the ground soil layer the oil palm understory evapotranspiration was about 800 mm during the first year of plantation and dropped to approximately 60 mm at the end of the eighth year of simulation meanwhile soil evaporation reached about 500 mm at the end of the fourth year and then stabilized at more or less 400 mm for the remaining four years as the understory dies off and exposes more soil for direct evaporation table 5 and fig 4 these processes account for about 90 80 of total evapotranspiration during the first two years of plantation hence they cannot be ignored during the initial years of growth moreover even during the seventh and eighth year the combined evaporation from soil and understory et account for 30 of total et therefore estimation of water footprint based on simulation shows diverse drivers of et than merely using one constant value our main goal of the simulation was to maintain the groundwater level at 500 mm below the soil surface of the plantation this decision is based on the actual field practice of maintaining water level at this range this is the standard practice that is followed after bloomfield and zahari 1982 therefore in order to maintain a constant water table level we have used the criteria of applying irrigation if the rainfall in three consecutive days was less than 20 mm this scenario produced the desired water level within the preferred range but with some year to year fluctuations fig 5 furthermore the effects of a high water table on the yield of oil palm are also not fully understood carr 2011 hardanto et al 2017 compared the difference in sap flux densities of oil palm grown on low lying flooded lands and non flooded lands they found minor differences of sap flux densities between the two areas planted by the same species however the effects of change of yield were not observed in the study hardanto et al 2017 there is also evidence of the change in root biomass in oil palm seedlings for waterlogged conditions but no effect was observed on the above ground biomass of the seedlings da ponte et al 2019 for flood tolerant trees it is observed that about 96 recovery of photosynthesis within short period after flooding however long term effects of flooding can have negative effects on the plant physiology pallardy 2008 therefore it is required to establish a relationship between the different soil types and different level of water tables below the soil surface to maintain the maximum yield from the oil palm plantations grown on different soil types carr 2011 this will help to mitigate the yield gap for the plantations grown on the marginal lands the overall water movement in the soil profile of the plantation is captured by the soilwat model it has couple of limitations that can impact the results first soilwat is developed for non saturated soils and its application in saturated conditions can result in errors predicting soil water movement second as this model is a cascading bucket model it cannot predict accurately the effects of lateral movement of soil water tables 4 and 5 show that overall et rates against the input of rainfall and irrigation the excess water applied apart from et for the plant requirements either becomes a component of runoff or part of the drainage component in the cascading bucket approach therefore if we extend our results for plantations over a larger area it can cause two outcomes if plantations are on the upstream end of the ground water movement drained water will become part of maintained groundwater for lower areas second if the plantations are located close to the sea then drained water will become part of the sea hence for plantations located close to sea our model results will not differ much but for upstream areas it would overpredict the water needs however further research can couple hydrodynamic models with plant growth to better capture the real water conditions one of the important considerations for the oil palm grown on marginal lands is the yield of fresh fruit bunches the plantation site of our study area suffers from both high acidic content in soil layers and periodic low water table levels which cause acidic conditions and likely compromise yields fig 6 shows the actual yield from the plantation for an 8 year period and modeled yield there was a considerable difference between the two yield levels maximum yield from the actual plantation reached levels of 10 tonnes ha during the last two years however the maximum simulated yield reached the level of 30 tonnes ha in the simulated scenario moreover the yield gap starts to diverge from the second year onwards there can be many factors that could have influenced the yield in our area for instance there is some evidence that the yield of oil palm is affected by the soil type of the plantations therefore subjecting plants to different types of stresses hoffmann et al 2017 the fao s hwsd map indicates that the dominant soil in this area is a dystric histosols which was consistent with our observations the simulation of the oil palm module in apsim was verified in the oil palm plantations of papa new guinea where the dominant soil groups are molli andisols subjecting soils to different stresses such as seasonal moisture stresses as compared to the soil of our current plantation which suffers from poor drainage and sulfide layer in the soil profile harmonized world soil database v1 2 fao soils portal food and agriculture organization of the united nations n d although oil palm can better tolerate acidic conditions than most plantation crops very low ph values can hinder growth and impact fruit yield for instance it is shown that oil palm can grow well even at a ph of 4 3 and less than ideal drainage conditions shamshuddin et al 2014 however the performance of oil palm is affected when ph drops below the above level moreover water can become more acidic under waterlogged conditions with consistent leaching of the pyritic layer shamshuddin et al 2014 hence flushing is performed during the wet season by carefully operating the canal gates and replacing the old water from the dry season with the freshwater from rainfall and excess river flow although these mitigating measures can improve plantation conditions they will produce less yield than plantations with better soils on prime land therefore further research towards better cultivar types or soil treatments can improve the yield level of oil palm grown on marginal lands apart from the wet soil conditions or water quality issues that impact the oil palm yield yield calculations can be affected by the oil palm cultivar the apsim oil palm module is developed using the cultivar dami developed by new britain palm oil limited group in papua new guinea although this cultivar is reported to be high yielding dumortier et al n d the cultivation of this variety on pyritic soils is not fully understood however the indonesian oil palm research institute is also developing suitable cultivars that can better tolerate acidic conditions therefore future model calibration should take into account the different cultivars of oil palm as well in addition there is a continued yield gap difference between potential and actual yields in some oil palm plantations of indonesia between modeled values and remotely sensed estimations using remote sensing khiabani and takeuchi 2020 showed that actual yield from the plantations of sumatra indonesia ranged from 8 5 t ha and 15 4 t ha while the yield from our plantation site varied from 5 t ha to 10 t ha from sixth year onward we expected a lower bunch yield based on the marginal lands of our plantations our observed yields correspond better to remotely sensed yields than those output from apsim fig 6 a total of 28 tonnes of fresh fruit bunches are harvested per ha during the eight year study period however the water applied to the site during the eight year period was 17 000 mm of rainfall and 26 000 mm of irrigation in other words 170 000 m3 of rainfall and 260 000 m3 of irrigated water is used to produce 28 tonnes per ha of fresh fruit bunches from the study site it is important to note that water footprint studies that are carried out in the literature generally ignore the blue water footprint subramaniam et al 2014 although they acknowledge the large green water footprint of the oil palm plantations moreover it is recognized in the literature that irrigation during the dry periods of the year can increase the overall yield from the plantation site carr 2011 our study shows that for oil palm grown on pyritic soils there is a higher amount of blue water needed as compared to green water on the plantation site therefore ignoring blue water footprint can cause severe underestimation of the total water footprint accounting for oil palm production 5 conclusions the rapid expansion of oil palm driven by its high profitability has converted large tropical areas into plantations this rapid expansion has resulted in regulations that have imposed moratoria on oil palm expansion and shifted development of plantations onto marginal lands plantations in these areas provide a different kind of environmental challenge the yield of oil palm in low potential areas is considerably lower because of acidic conditions than yield in the high potential lands therefore the most common measure in order to increase the yield of the oil palm from these lands is to maintain a high water table level we have run the simulations to account for the water requirement of the oil palm if they are planted on low potential lands our analysis shows that the water requirement of the plants increases considerably with plantation age especially 4 5 years after plantation establishment primarily due to the need of a sufficiently high water table about 80 95 more irrigation water is required to make oil palm plantations possible on these lands previous studies conducted on water footprint accounting of oil palm ignore this consideration in their analysis these studies also fail to address varying water needs during different stages of the plantation we estimate that in our study area rawapitu plantation in indonesia about 15 000 m3 of water is required to cultivate 1 ton of fresh fruit bunches from the site about 6200 m3 is from green water use rainfall and 8800 m3 is from blue water use irrigation water applied to the site however it is important to note that our modeling was not able to capture the effect of yield reduction on the marginal lands it can either be due to a lack of understanding of soil chemical processes that affect the yield cultivar and or the effect of high water level none of which are well understood on the oil palm growth on marginal lands this shortcoming is an important area of future research nevertheless using the apsim modeling framework along with the apsim oil palm and other modules we are able to reasonably approximate field water requirements at our site over an eight year period thereby highlighting the utility of apsim for tracking oil palm water requirements in relation to plantation age on marginal soils declaration of

9791,water sharing plans have been implemented to allocate water fairly between irrigated agriculture and other stakeholders water accounting is an important feature of successful water management and sharing remote regions are often neglected with metering infrastructure and therefore remote sensing is an option for the quantification of irrigation water use the guides published in fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 fao56 can provide some information in data poor regions although it has its own limitations without direct observations this study uses the constellation of landsat satellites 5 8 to monitor crop conditions via the vegetation index to assess crop growth through a crop coefficient k c based on an actual field condition this remotely sensed input is then used in soil water deficit modelling based on the fao56 approach over two fields an almond plantation and a vineyard located in south australia soil parameters such as readily available water raw are taken from in situ observations and digital soil maps for comparison the results closely matched metered irrigation time series with only small changes in results when interchanging in situ soil properties or digital soil maps following this an uncertainty analysis using a monte carlo approach was performed using the range of parameter values for raw a small period of this study 9 months of 2015 16 overlapped with the sentinel 2a operational period which was investigated for its improved spatial resolution and differences in spectral band width of key vegetation observation bands when comparing these results to previous studies which did not consider soil water deficits the improvements are substantial improvements ranged from 3 to 15 monthly and 56 to 68 annually these improvements require extra data which has the limitation of comprehensive field data being difficult to obtain and digital soil maps being potentially unreliable the choice to include soil water deficit modelling or not is dependent on the required accuracy to effectively use the quantified irrigation for the intended use keywords landsat sentinel 2 water accounting soil and landscape grid of australia irrigation monitoring compliance almond vineyard 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is the largest water user globally wisser et al 2008 in agricultural communities there is strong competition for water particularly in semi arid and arid regions the implementation of water sharing plans are a common action taken by governments to help allocate water sustainably effective water management requires a simple and efficient way to rapidly quantify irrigated water use for water accounting metering can be costly and equipment can be susceptible to tampering and failure bretreger et al 2019b holley and sinclair 2012 additional methods are required to ensure continuous and effective monitoring of water use this extends to monitoring the extraction of water from surface and ground water to assess holistic hydrological impacts which adds another layer of complexity van eekelen et al 2015 walker et al 2020 apart from metering water accounting can be performed by numerical modelling or remote sensing approaches numerical modelling of irrigation water use has potential issues due to difficulty representing the crop growth processes and subsequent water use accurately and the anthropogenic influences of irrigation fluxes on the hydrologic cycle that are often unaccounted for bretreger et al 2020 mcinerney et al 2018 quantifying irrigation water use with remote sensing is a common suggestion to supplement and support the limitations identified in metering bretreger et al 2019b matthews 2017 nsw dpie 2019 remote sensing approaches vary in their methodology using different sensing technology ranging from optical thermal or microwave sensors bretreger et al 2019b garrido rubio et al 2020 jalilvand et al 2019 le page et al 2020 maselli et al 2020 olivera guerra et al 2020 senay et al 2017 these studies commonly use the landsat series of satellites for optical and thermal studies while microwave sensors are onboard a range of satellite systems others use data assimilation techniques to allow land surface models to be updated based on soil moisture inputs to account for irrigation nair and indu 2019 each of the techniques has their own positives and negatives ranging from accuracy of irrigation of quantification to spatial resolution to ease of use recent studies have used the sentinel 2 series of satellites successfully to assess irrigation water use maselli et al 2020 these satellites have an increased spatial and temporal resolution compared to other freely available optical remote sensing options as the data from sentinel 2 is relatively new it has limitations for historic water accounting and trends although this data will likely show improvements the actual changes that may be observed require more research a key benefit of using remote sensing is it has the ability to show a surrogate of actual growth conditions as opposed to tabulated values representing typical crop development which is not always accurate pereira et al 2015 despite the benefit of remote sensing previous studies have shown subtle localised crop management practices e g induced minor water stress or mulching of soils can go undetected by remote sensing observations bretreger et al 2019b it is proposed that modelling a soil water deficit based on fao56 allen et al 1998 over fields may help to account for the limitations identified previously a review of recent irrigation quantification literature via remote sensing is presented by bretreger et al 2020 with a broad review of remote sensing in agriculture performed by karthikeyan et al 2020 incorporating this soil water deficit modelling approach requires accurate estimations of hydrologic properties throughout soil profiles digital soil maps provide crucial information in describing soil characteristics over large spatial extents batjes et al 2020 grundy et al 2015 minasny and mcbratney 2016 but they are typically considered to be less accurate compared to in situ samples quantifying irrigation via remote sensing has been tested using in situ soil samples olivera guerra et al 2020 the use of digital soil maps in these methodologies has not been thoroughly assessed or compared against the use of in situ values with any soil data there remains the question of the accuracy and reliability of the measurements together with the heterogeneity of the soil and how these uncertainties will impact the modelling approach incorporating soil properties into irrigation quantification modelling with remotely sensed data may improve prediction accuracy for plant water use and irrigation scheduling this approach can potentially allow widespread automated irrigation quantification using satellite observations this paper aims to 1 investigate the quantification of irrigation using moderate spatial resolution 30 m remote sensing observations in combination with soil water deficit modelling at the paddock scale with validation from metered irrigation 2 investigate the differences caused in model outputs by using soil properties collected via in situ sampling or digital soil maps as well as performing an uncertainty analysis of the range of parameter values available and 3 investigate the potential benefits of using higher spatial and temporal resolution satellite data such as the relatively new sentinel 2 10 m satellites compare to the moderate resolution satellite data from landsat 30 m that has a historic data catalogue 2 material and methods 2 1 site description in this study actual irrigation volumes were available from two sites in south australia an almond plantation with nonpareil varieties with price and keane varieties used as pollinators 34 628 138 683 and a cabernet sauvignon vineyard 35 239 138 523 these sites had irrigation recorded as part of a saline water trial study phogat et al 2018 2020 pitt et al 2015 the sites are managed as per standard commercial practices they have minimal near zero slope annual average rainfall at these locations is 426 9 mm for the almonds from 1972 to 2020 at bom id 023083 and 446 0 for the vineyard from 2000 to 2020 at bom id 023885 the soil in the almond field is described as well drained soft sandy loam over hard calcareous clay while the vineyard s soil has been described as 15 20 cm of sandy loam topsoil overlaying a clay b horizon fig 1 shows the locations of the study sites within australia with corresponding aerial photos of the field extents the almond plantation and vineyard both have comprehensive daily irrigation data that was provided by the south australian research and development institute the irrigation events were timed with a system of known flow rate and pressure before being divided by field area to achieve a depth of irrigation in mm data was available from july 2013 to june 2016 for the almond farm and from july 2011 to june 2015 for the vineyard annual average irrigation depths recorded are 923 mm for the almond and 139 mm for the wine grapes these differences in irrigation application are due to the different crops requiring different water to optimise production irrigation for the almond field was scheduled to replace the estimated tree evapotranspiration based on a modified version of the protocol set out by brown 2011 the irrigation on the vineyard was scheduled based on soil moisture measurements from gypsum blocks and assessments of canopy size in an attempt to refill crop available water pitt et al 2015 2 2 input data 2 2 1 precipitation and evapotranspiration data a daily time step of the precipitation

monteith equation defined by allen et al 1998 by eq 1 1 et o 0 408 r n g γ c n t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 c d u 2 where et o is the reference evapotranspiration mm day is the slope of the vapour pressure

resistance c d is a constant that is a function of the time step bulk surface resistance and aerodynamic roughness 2 2 2 remote sensing data the remote sensing data used in this study comprises of the optical and infrared bands from the landsat 5 7 and 8 satellites and the sentinel 2 satellites these were accessed remotely through digital earth australia dea dhu et al 2017 lewis et al 2017 which provides analysis ready satellite images i e with necessary radiometric and geometric corrections and cloud shadow removal dea provides landsat images at a 25 m resolution re sampled from 30 m their revisit time is approximately 16 days the time series of the three satellites were concatenated through time to improve the temporal resolution of the analysis during times when multiple satellites were orbiting during simulations when all three satellites were orbiting this allowed for approximately weekly revisit times a comparison with the sentinel 2 satellites was only available from october 2015 onwards for the almond field 9 months of data this data was sourced from dea in a similar manner to the landsat time series i e analysis ready data the data is from the sentinel 2a satellite only referred to throughout as sentinel 2 and therefore has a temporal resolution of 10 days and a spatial resolution of 10 m for the bands used 2 2 3 soil and crop information soil data was taken from two sources for calculation of the applied irrigation depth 1 in situ observed readily available water content raw that is the amount of available water to plants before they experience a reduction in transpiration or stress and soil salinity taken during the field experiments phogat et al 2018 2020 pitt et al 2015 and 2 the digital gridded dataset available via the soil and landscape grid of australia grundy et al 2015 slga available from https aclep csiro au aclep soilandlandscapegrid index html slga is a 3 arc second resolution 90 m of interpolated soil and landscape attributes across australia the depths reported are separated into 0 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm as the study sites are located within south australia the regional south australian sub dataset was used with values taken from the mid point of the field study sites which gave a good representation of the site the variable used for calculations from slga was the available water capacity awc the awc gives the water percentage available for plant growth for the specified depth interval defined as the difference between field capacity and wilting point the slga datasets provides estimates of the upper 95 and lower 5 confidence intervals for awc these are used for uncertainty analysis the awc is similar to a total available water content taw which is typically reported as a depth of water mm over a depth of soil m a weighted average of the reported slga awc was calculated based on the changing soil profile based on rooting depth and converted into a taw i e in mm m see section 2 3 only minor changes in the slga data are observed over the field scale sites used in this study suggesting the uniformity of soil at this spatial scale the in situ soil parameters are taken from field experiments described by pitt et al 2015 the raw is provided in this document and was determined from soil surveys conducted prior to planting for the vineyard and shortly after planting of the almond plantation the almond field has an in situ reported raw of 20 30 mm whereas the wine grape field has an in situ raw of 35 44 mm rooting depth for the almonds and wine grapes were reported as 0 6 m and 0 6 0 8 m respectively pitt et al 2015 the middle of these ranges was adopted when it was required for modelling rooting depth parameter input rooting depth at both sites is reported to extend below these levels although the majority of root mass is within these reported zones fao56 reports the maximum rooting depth of both these crops as 1 2 m which while deeper than those reported the relative depth remains the same between the two crops the range of raw reported was used in parameterising the uncertainty analysis 2 3 methodology a schematic of the methodology implemented for the modelling in this study is presented in fig 2 the method described here allows the simulation of irrigation water use using a soil water deficit swd methodology based on fao56 allen et al 1998 the swd is the depth of water below the field capacity of the soil the soil water deficit is computed via eq 2 2 swd t swd t 1 p t irr t aet t where swd is the soil water deficit mm p is the rainfall mm for the given day irr is the irrigation mm applied per day and aet is the actual evapotranspiration mm calculated for the day the initial deficit was set at 0 mm without any prior information the t subscript indicates the time step on a daily scale the swd was stopped from going above 0 indicating a soil moisture above field capacity with this water assumed to be lost to deep drainage or runoff the irrigation events are triggered when the swd reaches a refill point which is a negative value of the same magnitude as the raw this prevents the crop from experiencing water stress two values of raw were used based on the in situ observations and the slga dataset see section 2 2 3 to calculate the raw the taw is required the taw is defined via eq 3 allen et al 1998 3 taw 1000 θ fc θ wp z r where taw is the total available water mm θ fc is the soil moisture at field capacity θ wp is the soil moisture at wilting point and z r is the rooting depth m see section 2 2 3 for soil property unit conversions to calculate the raw eq 4 allen et al 1998 is used 4 raw ρ taw where raw is the readily available water mm and ρ is the depletion factor depletion factors are implemented to avoid the crop experiencing water stress from the soil moisture lowering to the wilting point of the soil these were set at 0 4 for the almond and 0 45 for the wine grapes as per fao56 allen et al 1998 as no site specific values were available aet is estimated via the methodology described in fao56 allen et al 1998 using eq 5 5 aet et o k c k s where aet is the actual evapotranspiration mm day et o is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day k c is the crop coefficient and k s is the crop stress factor the value of k s can be influenced by inhibiting environmental factors such as water stress k s water or salinity stress k s salinity k s varies between 0 and 1 with a value of 1 which indicates no stress being used unless stated otherwise see section 2 3 1 k c was calculated from the monthly mean of the landsat 5 7 and 8 satellites or sentinel 2 using the linear regression equation described by kamble et al 2013 k c is found via eq 6 6 k c 1 4571 ndvi 0 1725 where ndvi is the normalized differential vegetation index rouse et al 1974 the ndvi is given by eq 7 7 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red where ρ subscripts are the near infrared nir or red bands of the landsat sentinel observation used for calculation the ndvi is commonly used to represent field crop conditions due to the spectral properties of vegetation in the nir and red band wavelengths kamble et al 2013 derived the k c relationship with ndvi over a range of crops and returned an r2 value of 0 83 2 3 1 crop coefficient k c adjustments and crop stress k s plastic mulching was identified in the wine grapes field reducing the evaporation component of aet to account for this the k c was reduced by 30 using mulching factors as per the information detailed by allen et al 1998 for the irrigation infrastructure in use phogat et al 2020 pitt et al 2015 a previous study has identified issues with minor water stress applied to the wine grapes not being observed by ndvi and hence additional corrections are required bretreger et al 2019b to account for this a k s water of 0 7 was implemented which is common for wine production allen and pereira 2009 soil salinity will impact the transpiration and water uptake of a crop and is difficult to observe through remote sensing this was accounted for using soil salinity data taken from the original field study pitt et al 2015 the salt stress term was accounted for within k s using k s salinity this was implemented via eq 8 allen et al 1998 8 k s salinity 1 b k y 100 ec e ec e threshold where k s salinity is the salinity stress coefficient b is the percentage reduction in crop yield per increase in salinity ds m k y is a value describing reduced yield caused by salinity stress ec e is the measured salinity ds m and ec e threshold ds m is the threshold of salinity before stress occurs for a particular crop the inputs for the salinity stress equation for each of the fields is found in table 1 the salinity and water stress identified within this section is implemented via eq 5 a remote sensing method to identify salinity stress was not investigated due to the unavailability of the comprehensive validation data and practicality issues with its implementation the adjustment from water stress salinity stress and mulching were all accounted for by altering the k c value after calculation from the ndvi 2 4 validation and uncertainty analysis the simulated irrigation depths were compared against actual values recorded via metering for all sites the analysis was performed using a root mean square error rmse additionally a ratio of the estimated irrigation to the actual irrigation is calculated with a value of 1 indicating the model is on average simulating the correct irrigation this ratio was evaluated annually an uncertainty analysis was performed by selecting the upper and lower values of raw from both the in situ soil samples and the modelled estimates of the slga the upper and lower limits from the slga for the almond field were 18 0 mm and 33 7 mm while the in situ were 20 0 mm and 30 0 mm the vineyard showed upper and lower limits of 15 9 mm and 45 5 mm for the slga and 35 0 mm and 44 0 mm for in situ from these maximum and minimum values a monte carlo simulation was performed with 1000 repetitions to assess how the error in irrigation changes with the changing soil parameter from the range of values available this was evaluated the same way as the initial modelling comparisons 3 results 3 1 landsat irrigation simulations the time series of simulated irrigation water depth compared with metered irrigation is presented in fig 3 the simulated irrigation for the almond field follows the observed irrigation exceptionally well the wine grapes present some over estimations and do not perform as well as the almonds both time series show the increase in irrigation application during the summer months as the et o increases and precipitation is generally decreasing compared to winter months major differences observed in estimated irrigation is approximately equal to 1 irrigation event based on raw for example see the peak of the 2012 13 irrigation season for the wine grapes in this season there are 5 irrigation events simulated for both the slga and in situ parameters from november 2012 to march 2013 in the daily simulations 2 irrigation events occurred in january while using the in situ parameters based on the raw value these were on 5 and 27 january 2013 a similar process is observed in the 2014 15 irrigation season when comparing between the in situ and slga simulations as the time series is presented as a monthly sum of irrigation this can cause monthly values to seem bigger or smaller due to an irrigation event being simulated at the start or end of a month table 2 shows the rmse of both the monthly and yearly simulations in addition it shows the ratio of the estimated irrigation to the actual irrigation giving an indication of the overestimation for wine grape but slight underestimation for almond the yearly simulation can also be assessed by the reported standard deviation it is worth noting because the almond field has a higher average annual irrigation see section 2 1 the rmse is expected to be higher 3 2 uncertainty analysis of soil parameters an uncertainty analysis of the soil parameters measured from in situ sampling or the slga estimations was conducted using monte carlo analysis to assess the requirements of soil parameters the dotty plots in fig 4 show the results from 1000 simulations using the random parameter values between the specified ranges of raw the values were chosen by assessing the maximum and minimum of both in situ ranges provided and the 90 confidence limits provided in the slga data product the minimum and maximum raw values are 18 0 mm and 33 7 mm for the almond field and 15 9 mm and 45 5 mm for the vineyard the monthly simulations show a general decrease in error as the raw value is decreased for both the almond and vineyard the yearly simulations show a very slight decrease in error with smaller raw although the change in rmse is insensitive the annual vineyard shows the opposite trend with lower errors occurring with higher raw values the raw value is relatively insensitive with large changes in raw required to show significant changes in the rmse the in situ and slga simulation outputs show almost no difference in rmse the biggest difference in shown in the monthly almond plot which is less than 2 mm for a change in raw of over 3 mm 3 3 sentinel 2 irrigation simulation subset the sentinel 2 data is only available from october 2015 onwards this only allows simulations over the almond field for 9 months when substituting landsat observations for sentinel the differences in simulated irrigation results are minimal the changes are limited to the monthly rmse which has changed from 21 72 mm and 23 47 mm table 2 to 21 10 mm and 24 47 mm for the in situ and slga parameter sets respectively all other comparison metrics remained the same the irrigation time series is somewhat improved when observing the 9 month time series of sentinel 2 observations fig 5 this is particular evident during november 2015 where sentinel 2 simulations do not drop the simulated irrigation as much as the landsat simulations in april 2016 the deviation seen in the sentinel 2 time series is caused by approximately half the field not being observed by sentinel 2 and hence poor observations being applied in the modelling across the field the observation frequency will only increase as more of the sentinel 2 constellation is available the differences in spatial resolution for december 2015 over the almond field can be observed in fig 6 the values of k c varies slightly across the extent being modelled although this is predominately around the edge of the study area these impacts can be directly observed in the resamples sentinel 2 image features that have returned a low k c value with a 10 m resolution have influenced values from within the property boundary the change in number of pixels observing the site increased from 58 to 350 showing the difference the spatial resolution will make the statistics in the form of min max mean and standard deviation has change from 0 35 0 94 0 77 and 0 14 respectively for landsat 5 7 8 to 0 25 0 92 0 80 and 0 12 respectively for sentinel 2 original 10 m a series of features from the middle of the field were inspected to assess from a series of pixels inspected from fig 6 in the middle of the field where there are homogenous features to avoid spatial mismatches only minimal changes in k c were observed this change was a range of 0 002 and 0 025 this demonstrates the improvements or changes likely to be observed when making the change from the landsat series of satellites to the sentinel 2 fleet although observations of sentinel 2 were unavailable during the irrigation data collection over the wine grapes a similar improvement would likely be observed in border areas 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of simulating irrigation with soil water deficit modelling the simulations using the in situ or the slga soil parameters only show minor differences to each other in this study for the almond plantation there are no signs that one set of parameters clearly simulates irrigation better than the other the wine grape field shows some months with spikes of irrigation when simulating with the in situ soil parameters this may be due to irrigation events being triggered near a monthly divide by a slow depletion of soil moisture changing when the spike is simulated this is only an issue when the validation data is compared monthly see description of results in section 3 1 despite these spikes the inclusion of a soil water deficit term and the daily time step modelling has reduced the impact of large storm events occurring on monthly divides this has previously caused neighbouring months to simulate incorrectly over catchment scale studies bretreger et al 2020 even after large precipitation events e g fig 3 almond season 2013 14 the time series of irrigation estimation continues to match the metered irrigation well in most circumstances previous studies have shown aet from almonds can be successfully calculated from various remote sensing methodologies bellvert et al 2018 xue et al 2020 goldhamer et al 2005 has found that reduced aet in an almonds field was a result of reduced canopy size this is likely to be observed by remote sensing products through reduced ndvi k c values while the measurement of aet from vineyards using remote sensing have shown promising results knipper et al 2019 vanino et al 2015 there are reports of poor identification of minor water stress using vegetation indices such as the ndvi zarcotejada et al 2005 this is a limitation of the current methodology as the stress value is applied manually as per allen and pereira 2009 and something for future research to investigate see section 4 4 this could potentially be calibrated but a more comprehensive dataset that includes metered irrigation and ground based measurements of crops i e biomass growth conditions etc and et would likely be required for validation the rmse of the results presented in this paper shows an improvement from previous work that did not model soil water deficits bretreger et al 2019b for instance the almond field has shown a decrease in rmse from 24 3 mm monthly and 90 5 mm annually in the previous study by bretreger et al 2019b to 21 72 and 23 47 mm monthly and 40 12 and 39 61 mm annually table 2 this shows improvements of 3 11 monthly and 56 annually this is a clear significant improvement particularly for the annual validation the previous wine grapes simulation returned a rmse of 21 8 mm monthly and 150 7 mm annually there is a reduction in rmse in the wine grapes to 19 26 and 18 47 mm monthly and 48 87 and 47 69 mm annually when modelling the swd this shows improvements of 12 15 monthly and 68 annually previous studies have presented a lower rmse when quantifying irrigation using remote sensing bretreger et al 2020 jalilvand et al 2019 although these studies are performed and assessed over regional areas and are therefore not directly comparable with this field scale study there are many studies that have simulated irrigation using coarse resolution satellite data i e tens of kilometres such as microwave sensing technology which have significant benefits to the hydrological and agricultural communities le page et al 2020 nair and indu 2019 zaussinger et al 2019 coarse resolution satellite studies are impractical for small scale studies such as the present work and hence are not directly comparable studies on individual fields have reported a range of rmse values for annual validations from 44 to 176 mm or 6 77 garrido rubio et al 2020 these studies were performing using wheat maize and barley as the major crop types interestingly the discussion around the poorer results by garrido rubio et al 2020 state this is caused by barley commonly bring irrigated below recommended rates and being subject to minor water stress similar to the vineyards in the present study which the remote sensing observations found difficult to observe the improvements observed in this study compared to previous work bretreger et al 2019b is due to a number of reasons the k s term has been responsible for reducing overestimations that have been previous observed the water stress identified in the wine grapes using a stress coefficient requires identification of crop type for this to be implemented a correction factor similar to this may also help to improve the results over crops such as barley such as the study by garrido rubio et al 2020 without a correction factor relevant to the crop being grown aet could be overestimated based on the irrigation practice implemented on the ground the inclusion of salinity stress has improved results by modelling the reduction in plant water uptake and hence transpiration in the almond field the almond field was not subject to water stress corrections so the salinity term has been tested independently the modelling presented in this paper was only possible due to the field measurements of salinity taken during the data collection salinity can be quantified using steady state or transient models minhas et al 2020 alternatively soil salinity could be sensed via remote sensing abbas et al 2013 gorji et al 2017 metternicht and zinck 2003 although practical issues are present remote sensing salinity methods generally observe bare soil reflectance or changes in vegetation canopy cover due to increased salinity scudiero et al 2016 measuring the depth of salinity influence from satellite soil observations is difficult as they typically only sense the soil surface farifteh et al 2006 metternicht and zinck 2003 if remote sensing can provide salinity information at an appropriate spatial scale depth and accuracy this may help improve irrigation water quantification modelling thermal remote sensing may provide an option for identify crop salt or water stresses due to the changes in temperature from transpiration fluctuations dejonge et al 2015 kullberg et al 2017 pereira et al 2015 these methods have their own limitations such as required knowledge about a non stressed crop in a similar location for comparison a comprehensive salinity dataset is required for validation of any proposed operational relationship which was not currently available to the authors of this manuscript 4 2 choice of soil parameters and their uncertainty the improvements seen in the present paper show that modelling soil water deficits can improve the simulation of irrigation water use the fields used in this study had detailed soil assessments performed to find a raw and the rooting depth of the crops being simulated that is representative of the field at these spatial scales in practice digital soil maps provide the minimum data requirements wherever site specific in situ values are unavailable or when sites with large spatial extents have soil property changes that cannot be recognised by in situ sampling previous studies have successfully used in situ soil measurements in irrigation quantification simulations olivera guerra et al 2020 the results from the slga parameter simulations in this study shows only minor differences when compared to in situ soil parameter simulations the slga simulations over the almond plantation performed slightly better when comparing annual irrigation depths this is evident from the calculation of the raw as the in situ value used in simulations for the almonds and wine grapes were 25 and 39 5 mm respectively while the calculations from the slga databased returned a raw of 28 8 and 42 0 mm the in situ values are within the confidence limits set out within the slga with the 5 and 95 limits for the almond orchard soil being 18 0 mm and 33 7 mm while the soil for the wine grapes returned a limit of 15 9 mm and 45 5 mm if there is low confidence or a large range of estimated values of soil properties in digital soil maps they may not be appropriate for use grundy et al 2015 the accuracy of these maps will depend on the density of soil samples used in the derivation this may mean that for some sites the digital soil maps may not perform as well it is worth noting during the uncertainty analysis of raw values only relatively minor differences in irrigation estimation errors were observed see fig 4 for this study the irrigation simulation is insensitive to the uncertainties quantified in the raw values reported and used particularly when comparing annual simulations it also suggests that the input parameters used were a reasonable estimation of the heterogeneity of the soil over the study sites the changes in simulation are driven by the remote sensing observations discussed in section 4 3 and meteorological data this small change in irrigation estimation was due to the modelled irrigation being triggered at differing times and magnitude i e a smaller raw has smaller irrigation events more frequently see fig 3 for number of irrigation events this would likely cause errors on a daily scale if the results were compared at this time step while similar irrigation values would be found when summed over larger time periods i e months and years as higher temporal scales are used the value of the raw will likely become more sensitive and important to accurate results this is important if this work is to inform farm scale management decisions or this work is implemented elsewhere it is worth noting that small errors on high temporal resolution simulations can compound to larger errors which were observed in the annual comparisons these results suggest that digital soil maps such as the slga can be used for model input into remote sensing hydrology models and produce satisfactory results on an international scale global soil maps are available batjes et al 2020 which could aid in applications crop properties such as rooting depths were taken from in situ observation for this study if performing irrigation simulations without field data typical values can be found in fao56 along with depletion factors in a practical situation knowledge of the type of crop being grown and their spatial distributions is a necessity to facilitate users taking typical crop parameter values from literature there are remote sensing approaches developed to map irrigated areas gumma et al 2011 pervez and brown 2010 and identify crop types inglada et al 2016 löw and duveiller 2014 alternatively land use maps with appropriate detail may be able to aid finding this information without these techniques or data sources sites visits would likely be required to assign these crop parameters any site visits are subject to temporal limitations as conditions can change without the model processes reflecting this tabulated k c values share a similar limitation through their representation of theoretical crop growth conditions pereira et al 2015 and have been compared with remote sensing previously bretreger et al 2019a 4 3 changes in simulations from sentinel 2 future attempts at quantifying irrigation through optical remote sensing methodologies may be improved by implementing the sentinel 2 satellites the differences observed in this study were minimal although improvements were seen particularly in the time series fig 5 this is thought to be due to differences in spatial resolution and slight differences in spectral wavelength resolution used for ndvi derivation the temporal resolution differences are only minor with the combined landsat 7 and 8 revisit time being approximately 8 days while sentinel 2a observes every 10 days the current constellation of sentinel 2 has a revisit time of 5 days and hence will likely show improvements other studies have successfully used sentinel 2 for irrigation monitoring maselli et al 2020 the increased temporal and spatial resolution of sentinel 2 will likely enhance finer details across paddock scale environments fig 6 and potentially be able to be combined or harmonised blended with landsat observations for greater potential claverie et al 2018 flood 2017 mandanici and bitelli 2016 wang et al 2017 this is particularly evident as an interpolated daily ndvi was originally calculated for input in this study but the temporal resolution of the landsat series of satellites was not frequent enough for reliable daily estimates the improved temporal resolution of sentinel 2 may allow interpolation to daily values or fusion with other satellite data products such as sentinel 3 to improve temporal resolutions wang and atkinson 2018 as new satellites are launched e g landsat 9 this will further improve observational capacity the calculation of a monthly mean and median will also benefit from more observations contributing to the final value combining data products of different spatial resolutions may potential mean upscaling higher resolution data to match others e g upscaling sentinel 2 from 10 m to match the lower resolution of landsat 8 4 4 moving forward and future considerations water and salinity stress identification in crops is an important aspect to consider for future research the use of thermal satellite data may be able to identify temperature changes from stressed crops that are transpiring less as discussed in section 4 1 an alternative method may be the use of an increased spectral resolution the sentinel 2 red edge bands could be investigated as they have provided promising results in other fields for vegetation monitoring in stressed conditions west et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 as hyperspectral imaging becomes more available this may provide users with the option for additional options for detecting stress gerhards et al 2019 hyperspectral images have been shown to be able to pick up water stress in many crops including grapevines krishna et al 2019 loggenberg et al 2018 shivers et al 2019 zovko et al 2019 these remote sensing techniques may aid in identification of water and salinity stress these could then be applied to modelling approaches through the k s value it is also worth noting that if applying this to other study sites other forms of stress i e nutrient stress or disease may be present and should be considered as more data and information regarding the spectral response of crops is available the various forms of stress may be able to be separately identified liu et al 2021 mahajan et al 2016 pacumbaba and beyl 2011 zhang et al 2012 although the monitoring of irrigation water use is important for hydrological modelling purposes a requirement of accounting and compliance with water sharing plans relies on the monitoring of water extractions which are directly linked to irrigation water use a potential way forward for irrigation quantification in this context is the use of irrigation or conveyance efficiencies jensen 2007 to convert an irrigation water use into a water extraction van eekelen et al 2015 this would require its own independent study to assess this approach any attempts at this should use a metered irrigation value as well as a metered extraction to validate both hydrologic values as discussed above and in previous studies bretreger et al 2019b there can be practicality issues with acquiring enough high quality site representative input data to model the soil moisture deficit for irrigation monitoring a potential user needs to consider if the improved accuracy is important enough for their intended purpose to require this extra data collection 5 conclusion this paper demonstrated improvements in remote sensing approaches to quantify irrigation remote sensing and soil parameters were successfully combined to model the soil water deficit and quantify the irrigation water use over 2 fields in south australia conclusions are modelling the soil water deficit for irrigation quantification provided significant improvements compared to modelling irrigation without incorporating the soil water deficit the improvements address many of the issues that have been identified in previous works that for practical reasons did not account for soil properties the potential errors associated with digital soil maps were assessed using monte carlo simulations and not found to be an issue within this study as soil properties were relatively insensitive to the uncertainties from the datasets used however in regions with poor or unreliable soil maps this should be considered the potential benefits of increased temporal and spatial resolution from the sentinel 2 satellites provides users the opportunity for increased observational capabilities the improved results in this study come at the expense of the extra requirements of field data and knowledge required to correctly implement this modelling the choice of whether to model soil water deficits or rely on solely remote sensing methods is dependent on the intended use reliability of soil data and model accuracy requirements it is likely that the use of higher spatial and temporal resolution satellites e g

9791,water sharing plans have been implemented to allocate water fairly between irrigated agriculture and other stakeholders water accounting is an important feature of successful water management and sharing remote regions are often neglected with metering infrastructure and therefore remote sensing is an option for the quantification of irrigation water use the guides published in fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 fao56 can provide some information in data poor regions although it has its own limitations without direct observations this study uses the constellation of landsat satellites 5 8 to monitor crop conditions via the vegetation index to assess crop growth through a crop coefficient k c based on an actual field condition this remotely sensed input is then used in soil water deficit modelling based on the fao56 approach over two fields an almond plantation and a vineyard located in south australia soil parameters such as readily available water raw are taken from in situ observations and digital soil maps for comparison the results closely matched metered irrigation time series with only small changes in results when interchanging in situ soil properties or digital soil maps following this an uncertainty analysis using a monte carlo approach was performed using the range of parameter values for raw a small period of this study 9 months of 2015 16 overlapped with the sentinel 2a operational period which was investigated for its improved spatial resolution and differences in spectral band width of key vegetation observation bands when comparing these results to previous studies which did not consider soil water deficits the improvements are substantial improvements ranged from 3 to 15 monthly and 56 to 68 annually these improvements require extra data which has the limitation of comprehensive field data being difficult to obtain and digital soil maps being potentially unreliable the choice to include soil water deficit modelling or not is dependent on the required accuracy to effectively use the quantified irrigation for the intended use keywords landsat sentinel 2 water accounting soil and landscape grid of australia irrigation monitoring compliance almond vineyard 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is the largest water user globally wisser et al 2008 in agricultural communities there is strong competition for water particularly in semi arid and arid regions the implementation of water sharing plans are a common action taken by governments to help allocate water sustainably effective water management requires a simple and efficient way to rapidly quantify irrigated water use for water accounting metering can be costly and equipment can be susceptible to tampering and failure bretreger et al 2019b holley and sinclair 2012 additional methods are required to ensure continuous and effective monitoring of water use this extends to monitoring the extraction of water from surface and ground water to assess holistic hydrological impacts which adds another layer of complexity van eekelen et al 2015 walker et al 2020 apart from metering water accounting can be performed by numerical modelling or remote sensing approaches numerical modelling of irrigation water use has potential issues due to difficulty representing the crop growth processes and subsequent water use accurately and the anthropogenic influences of irrigation fluxes on the hydrologic cycle that are often unaccounted for bretreger et al 2020 mcinerney et al 2018 quantifying irrigation water use with remote sensing is a common suggestion to supplement and support the limitations identified in metering bretreger et al 2019b matthews 2017 nsw dpie 2019 remote sensing approaches vary in their methodology using different sensing technology ranging from optical thermal or microwave sensors bretreger et al 2019b garrido rubio et al 2020 jalilvand et al 2019 le page et al 2020 maselli et al 2020 olivera guerra et al 2020 senay et al 2017 these studies commonly use the landsat series of satellites for optical and thermal studies while microwave sensors are onboard a range of satellite systems others use data assimilation techniques to allow land surface models to be updated based on soil moisture inputs to account for irrigation nair and indu 2019 each of the techniques has their own positives and negatives ranging from accuracy of irrigation of quantification to spatial resolution to ease of use recent studies have used the sentinel 2 series of satellites successfully to assess irrigation water use maselli et al 2020 these satellites have an increased spatial and temporal resolution compared to other freely available optical remote sensing options as the data from sentinel 2 is relatively new it has limitations for historic water accounting and trends although this data will likely show improvements the actual changes that may be observed require more research a key benefit of using remote sensing is it has the ability to show a surrogate of actual growth conditions as opposed to tabulated values representing typical crop development which is not always accurate pereira et al 2015 despite the benefit of remote sensing previous studies have shown subtle localised crop management practices e g induced minor water stress or mulching of soils can go undetected by remote sensing observations bretreger et al 2019b it is proposed that modelling a soil water deficit based on fao56 allen et al 1998 over fields may help to account for the limitations identified previously a review of recent irrigation quantification literature via remote sensing is presented by bretreger et al 2020 with a broad review of remote sensing in agriculture performed by karthikeyan et al 2020 incorporating this soil water deficit modelling approach requires accurate estimations of hydrologic properties throughout soil profiles digital soil maps provide crucial information in describing soil characteristics over large spatial extents batjes et al 2020 grundy et al 2015 minasny and mcbratney 2016 but they are typically considered to be less accurate compared to in situ samples quantifying irrigation via remote sensing has been tested using in situ soil samples olivera guerra et al 2020 the use of digital soil maps in these methodologies has not been thoroughly assessed or compared against the use of in situ values with any soil data there remains the question of the accuracy and reliability of the measurements together with the heterogeneity of the soil and how these uncertainties will impact the modelling approach incorporating soil properties into irrigation quantification modelling with remotely sensed data may improve prediction accuracy for plant water use and irrigation scheduling this approach can potentially allow widespread automated irrigation quantification using satellite observations this paper aims to 1 investigate the quantification of irrigation using moderate spatial resolution 30 m remote sensing observations in combination with soil water deficit modelling at the paddock scale with validation from metered irrigation 2 investigate the differences caused in model outputs by using soil properties collected via in situ sampling or digital soil maps as well as performing an uncertainty analysis of the range of parameter values available and 3 investigate the potential benefits of using higher spatial and temporal resolution satellite data such as the relatively new sentinel 2 10 m satellites compare to the moderate resolution satellite data from landsat 30 m that has a historic data catalogue 2 material and methods 2 1 site description in this study actual irrigation volumes were available from two sites in south australia an almond plantation with nonpareil varieties with price and keane varieties used as pollinators 34 628 138 683 and a cabernet sauvignon vineyard 35 239 138 523 these sites had irrigation recorded as part of a saline water trial study phogat et al 2018 2020 pitt et al 2015 the sites are managed as per standard commercial practices they have minimal near zero slope annual average rainfall at these locations is 426 9 mm for the almonds from 1972 to 2020 at bom id 023083 and 446 0 for the vineyard from 2000 to 2020 at bom id 023885 the soil in the almond field is described as well drained soft sandy loam over hard calcareous clay while the vineyard s soil has been described as 15 20 cm of sandy loam topsoil overlaying a clay b horizon fig 1 shows the locations of the study sites within australia with corresponding aerial photos of the field extents the almond plantation and vineyard both have comprehensive daily irrigation data that was provided by the south australian research and development institute the irrigation events were timed with a system of known flow rate and pressure before being divided by field area to achieve a depth of irrigation in mm data was available from july 2013 to june 2016 for the almond farm and from july 2011 to june 2015 for the vineyard annual average irrigation depths recorded are 923 mm for the almond and 139 mm for the wine grapes these differences in irrigation application are due to the different crops requiring different water to optimise production irrigation for the almond field was scheduled to replace the estimated tree evapotranspiration based on a modified version of the protocol set out by brown 2011 the irrigation on the vineyard was scheduled based on soil moisture measurements from gypsum blocks and assessments of canopy size in an attempt to refill crop available water pitt et al 2015 2 2 input data 2 2 1 precipitation and evapotranspiration data a daily time step of the precipitation

monteith equation defined by allen et al 1998 by eq 1 1 et o 0 408 r n g γ c n t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 c d u 2 where et o is the reference evapotranspiration mm day is the slope of the vapour pressure curve kpa c r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 day g is the soil heat flux density mj m2 day γ is the psychometric constant kpa c t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s e s is the saturation vapour pressure kpa e a is the actual vapour pressure kpa c n is a constant that is a function of the time step and aerodynamic resistance c d is a constant that is a function of the time step bulk surface resistance and aerodynamic roughness 2 2 2 remote sensing data the remote sensing data used in this study comprises of the optical and infrared bands from the landsat 5 7 and 8 satellites and the sentinel 2 satellites these were accessed remotely through digital earth australia dea dhu et al 2017 lewis et al 2017 which provides analysis ready satellite images i e with necessary radiometric and geometric corrections and cloud shadow removal dea provides landsat images at a 25 m resolution re sampled from 30 m their revisit time is approximately 16 days the time series of the three satellites were concatenated through time to improve the temporal resolution of the analysis during times when multiple satellites were orbiting during simulations when all three satellites were orbiting this allowed for approximately weekly revisit times a comparison with the sentinel 2 satellites was only available from october 2015 onwards for the almond field 9 months of data this data was sourced from dea in a similar manner to the landsat time series i e analysis ready data the data is from the sentinel 2a satellite only referred to throughout as sentinel 2 and therefore has a temporal resolution of 10 days and a spatial resolution of 10 m for the bands used 2 2 3 soil and crop information soil data was taken from two sources for calculation of the applied irrigation depth 1 in situ observed readily available water content raw that is the amount of available water to plants before they experience a reduction in transpiration or stress and soil salinity taken during the field experiments phogat et al 2018 2020 pitt et al 2015 and 2 the digital gridded dataset available via the soil and landscape grid of australia grundy et al 2015 slga available from https aclep csiro au aclep soilandlandscapegrid index html slga is a 3 arc second resolution 90 m of interpolated soil and landscape attributes across australia the depths reported are separated into 0 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm as the study sites are located within south australia the regional south australian sub dataset was used with values taken from the mid point of the field study sites which gave a good representation of the site the variable used for calculations from slga was the available water capacity awc the awc gives the water percentage available for plant growth for the specified depth interval defined as the difference between field capacity and wilting point the slga datasets provides estimates of the upper 95 and lower 5 confidence intervals for awc these are used for uncertainty analysis the awc is similar to a total available water content taw which is typically reported as a depth of water mm over a depth of soil m a weighted average of the reported slga awc was calculated based on the changing soil profile based on rooting depth and converted into a taw i e in mm m see section 2 3 only minor changes in the slga data are observed over the field scale sites used in this study suggesting the uniformity of soil at this spatial scale the in situ soil parameters are taken from field experiments described by pitt et al 2015 the raw is provided in this document and was determined from soil surveys conducted prior to planting for the vineyard and shortly after planting of the almond plantation the almond field has an in situ reported raw of 20 30 mm whereas the wine grape field has an in situ raw of 35 44 mm rooting depth for the almonds and wine grapes were reported as 0 6 m and 0 6 0 8 m respectively pitt et al 2015 the middle of these ranges was adopted when it was required for modelling rooting depth parameter input rooting depth at both sites is reported to extend below these levels although the majority of root mass is within these reported zones fao56 reports the maximum rooting depth of both these crops as 1 2 m which while deeper than those reported the relative depth remains the same between the two crops the range of raw reported was used in parameterising the uncertainty analysis 2 3 methodology a schematic of the methodology implemented for the modelling in this study is presented in fig 2 the method described here allows the simulation of irrigation water use using a soil water deficit swd methodology based on fao56 allen et al 1998 the swd is the depth of water below the field capacity of the soil the soil water deficit is computed via eq 2 2 swd t swd t 1 p t irr t aet t where swd is the soil water deficit mm p is the rainfall mm for the given day irr is the irrigation mm applied per day and aet is the actual evapotranspiration mm calculated for the day the initial deficit was set at 0 mm without any prior information the t subscript indicates the time step on a daily scale the swd was stopped from going above 0 indicating a soil moisture above field capacity with this water assumed to be lost to deep drainage or runoff the irrigation events are triggered when the swd reaches a refill point which is a negative value of the same magnitude as the raw this prevents the crop from experiencing water stress two values of raw were used based on the in situ observations and the slga dataset see section 2 2 3 to calculate the raw the taw is required the taw is defined via eq 3 allen et al 1998 3 taw 1000 θ fc θ wp z r where taw is the total available water mm θ fc is the soil moisture at field capacity θ wp is the soil moisture at wilting point and z r is the rooting depth m see section 2 2 3 for soil property unit conversions to calculate the raw eq 4 allen et al 1998 is used 4 raw ρ taw where raw is the readily available water mm and ρ is the depletion factor depletion factors are implemented to avoid the crop experiencing water stress from the soil moisture lowering to the wilting point of the soil these were set at 0 4 for the almond and 0 45 for the wine grapes as per fao56 allen et al 1998 as no site specific values were available aet is estimated via the methodology described in fao56 allen et al 1998 using eq 5 5 aet et o k c k s where aet is the actual evapotranspiration mm day et o is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day k c is the crop coefficient and k s is the crop stress factor the value of k s can be influenced by inhibiting environmental factors such as water stress k s water or salinity stress k s salinity k s varies between 0 and 1 with a value of 1 which indicates no stress being used unless stated otherwise see section 2 3 1 k c was calculated from the monthly mean of the landsat 5 7 and 8 satellites or sentinel 2 using the linear regression equation described by kamble et al 2013 k c is found via eq 6 6 k c 1 4571 ndvi 0 1725 where ndvi is the normalized differential vegetation index rouse et al 1974 the ndvi is given by eq 7 7 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red where ρ subscripts are the near infrared nir or red bands of the landsat sentinel observation used for calculation the ndvi is commonly used to represent field crop conditions due to the spectral properties of vegetation in the nir and red band wavelengths kamble et al 2013 derived the k c relationship with ndvi over a range of crops and returned an r2 value of 0 83 2 3 1 crop coefficient k c adjustments and crop stress k s plastic mulching was identified in the wine grapes field reducing the evaporation component of aet to account for this the k c was reduced by 30 using mulching factors as per the information detailed by allen et al 1998 for the irrigation infrastructure in use phogat et al 2020 pitt et al 2015 a previous study has identified issues with minor water stress applied to the wine grapes not being observed by ndvi and hence additional corrections are required bretreger et al 2019b to account for this a k s water of 0 7 was implemented which is common for wine production allen and pereira 2009 soil salinity will impact the transpiration and water uptake of a crop and is difficult to observe through remote sensing this was accounted for using soil salinity data taken from the original field study pitt et al 2015 the salt stress term was accounted for within k s using k s salinity this was implemented via eq 8 allen et al 1998 8 k s salinity 1 b k y 100 ec e ec e threshold where k s salinity is the salinity stress coefficient b is the percentage reduction in crop yield per increase in salinity ds m k y is a value describing reduced yield caused by salinity stress ec e is the measured salinity ds m and ec e threshold ds m is the threshold of salinity before stress occurs for a particular crop the inputs for the salinity stress equation for each of the fields is found in table 1 the salinity and water stress identified within this section is implemented via eq 5 a remote sensing method to identify salinity stress was not investigated due to the unavailability of the comprehensive validation data and practicality issues with its implementation the adjustment from water stress salinity stress and mulching were all accounted for by altering the k c value after calculation from the ndvi 2 4 validation and uncertainty analysis the simulated irrigation depths were compared against actual values recorded via metering for all sites the analysis was performed using a root mean square error rmse additionally a ratio of the estimated irrigation to the actual irrigation is calculated with a value of 1 indicating the model is on average simulating the correct irrigation this ratio was evaluated annually an uncertainty analysis was performed by selecting the upper and lower values of raw from both the in situ soil samples and the modelled estimates of the slga the upper and lower limits from the slga for the almond field were 18 0 mm and 33 7 mm while the in situ were 20 0 mm and 30 0 mm the vineyard showed upper and lower limits of 15 9 mm and 45 5 mm for the slga and 35 0 mm and 44 0 mm for in situ from these maximum and minimum values a monte carlo simulation was performed with 1000 repetitions to assess how the error in irrigation changes with the changing soil parameter from the range of values available this was evaluated the same way as the initial modelling comparisons 3 results 3 1 landsat irrigation simulations the time series of simulated irrigation water depth compared with metered irrigation is presented in fig 3 the simulated irrigation for the almond field follows the observed irrigation exceptionally well the wine grapes present some over estimations and do not perform as well as the almonds both time series show the increase in irrigation application during the summer months as the et o increases and precipitation is generally decreasing compared to winter months major differences observed in estimated irrigation is approximately equal to 1 irrigation event based on raw for example see the peak of the 2012 13 irrigation season for the wine grapes in this season there are 5 irrigation events simulated for both the slga and in situ parameters from november 2012 to march 2013 in the daily simulations 2 irrigation events occurred in january while using the in situ parameters based on the raw value these were on 5 and 27 january 2013 a similar process is observed in the 2014 15 irrigation season when comparing between the in situ and slga simulations as the time series is presented as a monthly sum of irrigation this can cause monthly values to seem bigger or smaller due to an irrigation event being simulated at the start or end of a month table 2 shows the rmse of both the monthly and yearly simulations in addition it shows the ratio of the estimated irrigation to the actual irrigation giving an indication of the overestimation for wine grape but slight underestimation for almond the yearly simulation can also be assessed by the reported standard deviation it is worth noting because the almond field has a higher average annual irrigation see section 2 1 the rmse is expected to be higher 3 2 uncertainty analysis of soil parameters an uncertainty analysis of the soil parameters measured from in situ sampling or the slga estimations was conducted using monte carlo analysis to assess the requirements of soil parameters the dotty plots in fig 4 show the results from 1000 simulations using the random parameter values between the specified ranges of raw the values were chosen by assessing the maximum and minimum of both in situ ranges provided and the 90 confidence limits provided in the slga data product the minimum and maximum raw values are 18 0 mm and 33 7 mm for the almond field and 15 9 mm and 45 5 mm for the vineyard the monthly simulations show a general decrease in error as the raw value is decreased for both the almond and vineyard the yearly simulations show a very slight decrease in error with smaller raw although the change in rmse is insensitive the annual vineyard shows the opposite trend with lower errors occurring with higher raw values the raw value is relatively insensitive with large changes in raw required to show significant changes in the rmse the in situ and slga simulation outputs show almost no difference in rmse the biggest difference in shown in the monthly almond plot which is less than 2 mm for a change in raw of over 3 mm 3 3 sentinel 2 irrigation simulation subset the sentinel 2 data is only available from october 2015 onwards this only allows simulations over the almond field for 9 months when substituting landsat observations for sentinel the differences in simulated irrigation results are minimal the changes are limited to the monthly rmse which has changed from 21 72 mm and 23 47 mm table 2 to 21 10 mm and 24 47 mm for the in situ and slga parameter sets respectively all other comparison metrics remained the same the irrigation time series is somewhat improved when observing the 9 month time series of sentinel 2 observations fig 5 this is particular evident during november 2015 where sentinel 2 simulations do not drop the simulated irrigation as much as the landsat simulations in april 2016 the deviation seen in the sentinel 2 time series is caused by approximately half the field not being observed by sentinel 2 and hence poor observations being applied in the modelling across the field the observation frequency will only increase as more of the sentinel 2 constellation is available the differences in spatial resolution for december 2015 over the almond field can be observed in fig 6 the values of k c varies slightly across the extent being modelled although this is predominately around the edge of the study area these impacts can be directly observed in the resamples sentinel 2 image features that have returned a low k c value with a 10 m resolution have influenced values from within the property boundary the change in number of pixels observing the site increased from 58 to 350 showing the difference the spatial resolution will make the statistics in the form of min max mean and standard deviation has change from 0 35 0 94 0 77 and 0 14 respectively for landsat 5 7 8 to 0 25 0 92 0 80 and 0 12 respectively for sentinel 2 original 10 m a series of features from the middle of the field were inspected to assess from a series of pixels inspected from fig 6 in the middle of the field where there are homogenous features to avoid spatial mismatches only minimal changes in k c were observed this change was a range of 0 002 and 0 025 this demonstrates the improvements or changes likely to be observed when making the change from the landsat series of satellites to the sentinel 2 fleet although observations of sentinel 2 were unavailable during the irrigation data collection over the wine grapes a similar improvement would likely be observed in border areas 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of simulating irrigation with soil water deficit modelling the simulations using the in situ or the slga soil parameters only show minor differences to each other in this study for the almond plantation there are no signs that one set of parameters clearly simulates irrigation better than the other the wine grape field shows some months with spikes of irrigation when simulating with the in situ soil parameters this may be due to irrigation events being triggered near a monthly divide by a slow depletion of soil moisture changing when the spike is simulated this is only an issue when the validation data is compared monthly see description of results in section 3 1 despite these spikes the inclusion of a soil water deficit term and the daily time step modelling has reduced the impact of large storm events occurring on monthly divides this has previously caused neighbouring months to simulate incorrectly over catchment scale studies bretreger et al 2020 even after large precipitation events e g fig 3 almond season 2013 14 the time series of irrigation estimation continues to match the metered irrigation well in most circumstances previous studies have shown aet from almonds can be successfully calculated from various remote sensing methodologies bellvert et al 2018 xue et al 2020 goldhamer et al 2005 has found that reduced aet in an almonds field was a result of reduced canopy size this is likely to be observed by remote sensing products through reduced ndvi k c values while the measurement of aet from vineyards using remote sensing have shown promising results knipper et al 2019 vanino et al 2015 there are reports of poor identification of minor water stress using vegetation indices such as the ndvi zarcotejada et al 2005 this is a limitation of the current methodology as the stress value is applied manually as per allen and pereira 2009 and something for future research to investigate see section 4 4 this could potentially be calibrated but a more comprehensive dataset that includes metered irrigation and ground based measurements of crops i e biomass growth conditions etc and et would likely be required for validation the rmse of the results presented in this paper shows an improvement from previous work that did not model soil water deficits bretreger et al 2019b for instance the almond field has shown a decrease in rmse from 24 3 mm monthly and 90 5 mm annually in the previous study by bretreger et al 2019b to 21 72 and 23 47 mm monthly and 40 12 and 39 61 mm annually table 2 this shows improvements of 3 11 monthly and 56 annually this is a clear significant improvement particularly for the annual validation the previous wine grapes simulation returned a rmse of 21 8 mm monthly and 150 7 mm annually there is a reduction in rmse in the wine grapes to 19 26 and 18 47 mm monthly and 48 87 and 47 69 mm annually when modelling the swd this shows improvements of 12 15 monthly and 68 annually previous studies have presented a lower rmse when quantifying irrigation using remote sensing bretreger et al 2020 jalilvand et al 2019 although these studies are performed and assessed over regional areas and are therefore not directly comparable with this field scale study there are many studies that have simulated irrigation using coarse resolution satellite data i e tens of kilometres such as microwave sensing technology which have significant benefits to the hydrological and agricultural communities le page et al 2020 nair and indu 2019 zaussinger et al 2019 coarse resolution satellite studies are impractical for small scale studies such as the present work and hence are not directly comparable studies on individual fields have reported a range of rmse values for annual validations from 44 to 176 mm or 6 77 garrido rubio et al 2020 these studies were performing using wheat maize and barley as the major crop types interestingly the discussion around the poorer results by garrido rubio et al 2020 state this is caused by barley commonly bring irrigated below recommended rates and being subject to minor water stress similar to the vineyards in the present study which the remote sensing observations found difficult to observe the improvements observed in this study compared to previous work bretreger et al 2019b is due to a number of reasons the k s term has been responsible for reducing overestimations that have been previous observed the water stress identified in the wine grapes using a stress coefficient requires identification of crop type for this to be implemented a correction factor similar to this may also help to improve the results over crops such as barley such as the study by garrido rubio et al 2020 without a correction factor relevant to the crop being grown aet could be overestimated based on the irrigation practice implemented on the ground the inclusion of salinity stress has improved results by modelling the reduction in plant water uptake and hence transpiration in the almond field the almond field was not subject to water stress corrections so the salinity term has been tested independently the modelling presented in this paper was only possible due to the field measurements of salinity taken during the data collection salinity can be quantified using steady state or transient models minhas et al 2020 alternatively soil salinity could be sensed via remote sensing abbas et al 2013 gorji et al 2017 metternicht and zinck 2003 although practical issues are present remote sensing salinity methods generally observe bare soil reflectance or changes in vegetation canopy cover due to increased salinity scudiero et al 2016 measuring the depth of salinity influence from satellite soil observations is difficult as they typically only sense the soil surface farifteh et al 2006 metternicht and zinck 2003 if remote sensing can provide salinity information at an appropriate spatial scale depth and accuracy this may help improve irrigation water quantification modelling thermal remote sensing may provide an option for identify crop salt or water stresses due to the changes in temperature from transpiration fluctuations dejonge et al 2015 kullberg et al 2017 pereira et al 2015 these methods have their own limitations such as required knowledge about a non stressed crop in a similar location for comparison a comprehensive salinity dataset is required for validation of any proposed operational relationship which was not currently available to the authors of this manuscript 4 2 choice of soil parameters and their uncertainty the improvements seen in the present paper show that modelling soil water deficits can improve the simulation of irrigation water use the fields used in this study had detailed soil assessments performed to find a raw and the rooting depth of the crops being simulated that is representative of the field at these spatial scales in practice digital soil maps provide the minimum data requirements wherever site specific in situ values are unavailable or when sites with large spatial extents have soil property changes that cannot be recognised by in situ sampling previous studies have successfully used in situ soil measurements in irrigation quantification simulations olivera guerra et al 2020 the results from the slga parameter simulations in this study shows only minor differences when compared to in situ soil parameter simulations the slga simulations over the almond plantation performed slightly better when comparing annual irrigation depths this is evident from the calculation of the raw as the in situ value used in simulations for the almonds and wine grapes were 25 and 39 5 mm respectively while the calculations from the slga databased returned a raw of 28 8 and 42 0 mm the in situ values are within the confidence limits set out within the slga with the 5 and 95 limits for the almond orchard soil being 18 0 mm and 33 7 mm while the soil for the wine grapes returned a limit of 15 9 mm and 45 5 mm if there is low confidence or a large range of estimated values of soil properties in digital soil maps they may not be appropriate for use grundy et al 2015 the accuracy of these maps will depend on the density of soil samples used in the derivation this may mean that for some sites the digital soil maps may not perform as well it is worth noting during the uncertainty analysis of raw values only relatively minor differences in irrigation estimation errors were observed see fig 4 for this study the irrigation simulation is insensitive to the uncertainties quantified in the raw values reported and used particularly when comparing annual simulations it also suggests that the input parameters used were a reasonable estimation of the heterogeneity of the soil over the study sites the changes in simulation are driven by the remote sensing observations discussed in section 4 3 and meteorological data this small change in irrigation estimation was due to the modelled irrigation being triggered at differing times and magnitude i e a smaller raw has smaller irrigation events more frequently see fig 3 for number of irrigation events this would likely cause errors on a daily scale if the results were compared at this time step while similar irrigation values would be found when summed over larger time periods i e months and years as higher temporal scales are used the value of the raw will likely become more sensitive and important to accurate results this is important if this work is to inform farm scale management decisions or this work is implemented elsewhere it is worth noting that small errors on high temporal resolution simulations can compound to larger errors which were observed in the annual comparisons these results suggest that digital soil maps such as the slga can be used for model input into remote sensing hydrology models and produce satisfactory results on an international scale global soil maps are available batjes et al 2020 which could aid in applications crop properties such as rooting depths were taken from in situ observation for this study if performing irrigation simulations without field data typical values can be found in fao56 along with depletion factors in a practical situation knowledge of the type of crop being grown and their spatial distributions is a necessity to facilitate users taking typical crop parameter values from literature there are remote sensing approaches developed to map irrigated areas gumma et al 2011 pervez and brown 2010 and identify crop types inglada et al 2016 löw and duveiller 2014 alternatively land use maps with appropriate detail may be able to aid finding this information without these techniques or data sources sites visits would likely be required to assign these crop parameters any site visits are subject to temporal limitations as conditions can change without the model processes reflecting this tabulated k c values share a similar limitation through their representation of theoretical crop growth conditions pereira et al 2015 and have been compared with remote sensing previously bretreger et al 2019a 4 3 changes in simulations from sentinel 2 future attempts at quantifying irrigation through optical remote sensing methodologies may be improved by implementing the sentinel 2 satellites the differences observed in this study were minimal although improvements were seen particularly in the time series fig 5 this is thought to be due to differences in spatial resolution and slight differences in spectral wavelength resolution used for ndvi derivation the temporal resolution differences are only minor with the combined landsat 7 and 8 revisit time being approximately 8 days while sentinel 2a observes every 10 days the current constellation of sentinel 2 has a revisit time of 5 days and hence will likely show improvements other studies have successfully used sentinel 2 for irrigation monitoring maselli et al 2020 the increased temporal and spatial resolution of sentinel 2 will likely enhance finer details across paddock scale environments fig 6 and potentially be able to be combined or harmonised blended with landsat observations for greater potential claverie et al 2018 flood 2017 mandanici and bitelli 2016 wang et al 2017 this is particularly evident as an interpolated daily ndvi was originally calculated for input in this study but the temporal resolution of the landsat series of satellites was not frequent enough for reliable daily estimates the improved temporal resolution of sentinel 2 may allow interpolation to daily values or fusion with other satellite data products such as sentinel 3 to improve temporal resolutions wang and atkinson 2018 as new satellites are launched e g landsat 9 this will further improve observational capacity the calculation of a monthly mean and median will also benefit from more observations contributing to the final value combining data products of different spatial resolutions may potential mean upscaling higher resolution data to match others e g upscaling sentinel 2 from 10 m to match the lower resolution of landsat 8 4 4 moving forward and future considerations water and salinity stress identification in crops is an important aspect to consider for future research the use of thermal satellite data may be able to identify temperature changes from stressed crops that are transpiring less as discussed in section 4 1 an alternative method may be the use of an increased spectral resolution the sentinel 2 red edge bands could be investigated as they have provided promising results in other fields for vegetation monitoring in stressed conditions west et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 as hyperspectral imaging becomes more available this may provide users with the option for additional options for detecting stress gerhards et al 2019 hyperspectral images have been shown to be able to pick up water stress in many crops including grapevines krishna et al 2019 loggenberg et al 2018 shivers et al 2019 zovko et al 2019 these remote sensing techniques may aid in identification of water and salinity stress these could then be applied to modelling approaches through the k s value it is also worth noting that if applying this to other study sites other forms of stress i e nutrient stress or disease may be present and should be considered as more data and information regarding the spectral response of crops is available the various forms of stress may be able to be separately identified liu et al 2021 mahajan et al 2016 pacumbaba and beyl 2011 zhang et al 2012 although the monitoring of irrigation water use is important for hydrological modelling purposes a requirement of accounting and compliance with water sharing plans relies on the monitoring of water extractions which are directly linked to irrigation water use a potential way forward for irrigation quantification in this context is the use of irrigation or conveyance efficiencies jensen 2007 to convert an irrigation water use into a water extraction van eekelen et al 2015 this would require its own independent study to assess this approach any attempts at this should use a metered irrigation value as well as a metered extraction to validate both hydrologic values as discussed above and in previous studies bretreger et al 2019b there can be practicality issues with acquiring enough high quality site representative input data to model the soil moisture deficit for irrigation monitoring a potential user needs to consider if the improved accuracy is important enough for their intended purpose to require this extra data collection 5 conclusion this paper demonstrated improvements in remote sensing approaches to quantify irrigation remote sensing and soil parameters were successfully combined to model the soil water deficit and quantify the irrigation water use over 2 fields in south australia conclusions are modelling the soil water deficit for irrigation quantification provided significant improvements compared to modelling irrigation without incorporating the soil water deficit the improvements address many of the issues that have been identified in previous works that for practical reasons did not account for soil properties the potential errors associated with digital soil maps were assessed using monte carlo simulations and not found to be an issue within this study as soil properties were relatively insensitive to the uncertainties from the datasets used however in regions with poor or unreliable soil maps this should be considered the potential benefits of increased temporal and spatial resolution from the sentinel 2 satellites provides users the opportunity for increased observational capabilities the improved results in this study come at the expense of the extra requirements of field data and knowledge required to correctly implement this modelling the choice of whether to model soil water deficits or rely on solely remote sensing methods is dependent on the intended use reliability of soil data and model accuracy requirements it is likely that the use of higher spatial and temporal resolution satellites e g sentinel 2 will improve results declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

9792,chinese agricultural production has grown rapidly over the past two decades however expanding large scale production faces a sharp conflict with the supply of water resources meanwhile to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and protect the environment both the livestock and crop industries had to input more to achieve a high output of meat and grains and low graywater footprint emission using provincial panel data of china from 2008 to 2019 this study adopted a slacked based model to measure the country s agricultural water use efficiency awue that considered graywater from crop and livestock production as an unexpected output based on the concept of sustainable development using the graywater footprint as an undesired output included environmental pollution caused by agricultural production as part of the cost and could more accurately measure the water efficiency of current production we also applied the tobit model to identify the main factors influencing awue our results indicated the following 1 wealthy provinces produced more graywater than did poor provinces if the province s gross domestic product climbed the volume of graywater of livestock would surpass graywater of crops by a greater amount 2 the awue in southwest and south china fitted a u trend while the remaining five regions showed an inverted u shaped tendency 3 to improve the awue it is necessary to increase the crop area of economic crops and expand the scale of the livestock industry compared with investment in irrigation infrastructure investment in research and experimental development produces higher marginal benefits in enhancing the awue 4 environmental regulations inhibit the improvement of the awue while irrigation infrastructure significantly improves the awue keywords water resource agriculture environmental regulations graywater footprint slacked based model 1 introduction water scarcity is one of the major global environmental problems in the 21st century srinivasan et al 2012 although technological advances have made irrigation more effective agriculture still accounts for 80 90 of all fresh water used by humans most of which is used for food production mbava et al 2020 morison et al 2008 agriculture commands more water than any other activity on this planet qadir et al 2003 similarly agricultural water consumption in china has accounted for over 60 of the total domestic water consumption since 1998 china has been suffering from a shortage of water resources for many years primarily due to a large food demand khan et al 2009 wang et al 2014b there are both exogenous and endogenous causes of this dilemma the main exogenous cause is china s large population making chinese per capita freshwater resources a quarter of the world average fan et al 2019 the main endogenous reason is the low level of agricultural development in china which is mainly reflected in the inefficiency of agricultural water use and the misuse of pesticides and fertilizers that lead to water pollution and aggravate water scarcity a large population has a great potential for development and also a great potential for being a burden on the food and water supply under current dietary patterns national irrigation water requirements will reach 249 billion m 3 when the expected population peak occurs in 2032 he et al 2021 to alleviate the conflict of water resources this research mainly focuses on the endogenous reason for the long term water shortage in china it is beneficial to examine agricultural water use efficiency awue by considering environmental pollution from agricultural production and livestock awue is defined as the crop yield per unit of water resources which includes irrigation water and precipitation based on this definition this study considers the negative externalities of agricultural production and advances a new conception of the awue measuring the awue in each province is a prerequisite for achieving high quality agricultural development and could also provide a reference for formulating agricultural development plans at the national level therefore this study aims to answer the following questions how can awue be measured at the provincial level in china what is the current situation of this provincial level awue are there any spatial differences or correlations among different provinces what factors influence awue 2 literature review data envelopment analysis dea slack based model data envelopment analysis sbm dea and their derivative methods are frequently used for efficiency evaluations charnes et al 1978 düzakın and düzakın 2007 tone 2001 the above models have been widely applied to measure awue hai et al 2020 li et al 2018 lu et al 2021b in terms of utilizing these methods on agricultural water resources scholars have gradually changed from the original multi input and single output models to multi input and multi output models which are more suitable for actual production several scholars who used the multi input model to evaluate awue selected similar indicators the original data of land labor water resources and capital or data weighted by the population or crop area have been input variables of agricultural production lu et al 2021b mu et al 2016 several scholars have considered unexpected outputs they generally regarded agricultural sewage as an undesired output which internalizes the negative externalities of production and makes the evaluation more realistic deng et al 2016 sun and zhao 2013 crop and livestock production graywater can accurately evaluate agricultural water pollution providing a suitable method to measure the unexpected output of agriculture graywater footprint is defined as the volume of fresh water required to absorb and assimilate a certain pollutant load based on the natural background concentration and existing environmental water quality standards franke et al 2013 hoekstra et al 2011 unlike in other countries china s agricultural production includes livestock production moreover the graywater associated with livestock is more than that associated with crops when producing one unit of protein mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 however chinese researchers have studied the graywater footprint by considering only the residues of agricultural production nitrogen and phosphorus in chemical fertilizers and pesticides and ignoring the water pollution from nitrogen and phosphorus produced by livestock this hinders them from obtaining unbiased results when using a multifactor input model to measure the provincial awue in china our study utilizes the sbm model method a multi input and multi output model and considers the graywater produced by agricultural production and livestock as an unexpected output in addition this study employs the global and local moran indices to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of china s awue nature industry structure technology economics crop structure and irrigation infrastructure can influence the awue natural factors such as precipitation temperature sunlight clouds fog and natural disasters can also significantly affect the awue piao et al 2010 precipitation has been proven to critically impact agriculture because precipitation utilization or management practices for dryland crops directly affect agricultural production bennie and hensley 2001 zhang et al 2012 for industrial structure factors in more developed areas the proportion of agriculture is small compared to tertiary industries which causes a weak water resource scale effect wang et al 2018a technological advancement is a driving force for more efficient water utilization the improvement in urban water use efficiency depends on new technology investments bai et al 2017 specifically new technologies allow farmers to know the physiological parameters that describe the crop s water status and photosynthetic activity other approaches such as the use of oxygen stable isotopes as a proxy for water use are still far from being applied casadesús et al 2007 ferrio et al 2007 tuberosa et al 2007 in terms of economic factors the regional economic development level has a non linear and positive correlation with water resource efficiency song et al 2018 the crop structure is supposed to fit regional characteristics tan et al 2017 moreover it is advisable to decrease agricultural freshwater consumption using local strategies such as improving the crop ratio of economic crops cotton oil bearing crops fiber crops sugarcane and beetroots and adopting alternate drought tolerant crops evans and sadler 2008 agricultural drought is related to meteorological and hydrological conditions and the resilience of crops to water deficits and has negative impacts on agricultural production shen et al 2019 irrigation can greatly alleviate the negative impacts of droughts and increase agricultural production kang et al 2017 lu et al 2021a yu et al 2019 in addition tang et al 2015 indicated that irrigation infrastructure increases water use efficiency while land fragmentation decreases it these are important but general factors of awue in this paper we consider some novel factors that are more instructive and meaningful such as food type structure and environmental regulations which are important but not noted by researchers we describe the impactful paths of food type structure and environmental regulations on awue in section 4 4 1 determinants and then a mechanism analysis of how they influence the awue in section 5 discussion furthermore instead of utilizing the proportion of primary industry agriculture production in the gdp to represent the industrial structure we employ the ratio between the tertiary industry percentage and the primary industry percentage in the gdp we also explain the reasoning in section 4 4 1 3 material and methods based on current research tone 2001 slacks based measure data envelopment analysis sbm dea analyzing undesirable outputs was established to estimate the water use efficiency deng et al 2016 liu et al 2020a wei et al 2021 we then used the tobit model to analyze the determinants of water use efficiency 3 1 method for estimating water use efficiency in the traditional dea model the undesirable output is converted into input to solve the following scheel 2001 1 min θ λ θ s t j 1 m λ j x j θ x j 0 j 1 n 1 λ j y j g y j 0 g j 1 n 2 λ j y j 0 b θ y j 0 b λ j 0 θ 1 where θ represents the efficiency value between 0 and 1 and d m u 0 is efficient if θ 1 cooper et al 2007 x j y j g and y j b represent input desirable output and undesirable output variables respectively and m n 1 and n 2 record the number of variables x j y g y b and λ j are the weight coefficients the congestion and slack problems of input or output were not considered in model 1 therefore the following model proposed by tone 2001 can solve the problem 2 min ρ λ s s g s b ρ

where ρ s j s j b and s j g represent the efficiency value input redundancy undesirable output redundancy and desirable output deficiency respectively when ρ 1 equivalently s j s j b s j g 0 d m u 0

efficiency awue value equal to ρ in eq 2 γ j t λ j s j t s j s j g t s j g and s j b t s j b dea is a non parametric linear programming method the core of which is to construct the effective frontier sbm dea is solved through non parametric programming and the effective frontier is constructed based on the projection method tone 2016 awue calculated by sbm dea is a relative efficiency value compared to the effective frontier awue of provinces that are the same as the maximum reference value equal 1 while awue values of provinces that are not on the frontier are less than 1 consequently the value of awue ranges from zero to one awue is most efficient when its value is 1 otherwise the lower the value the lower the efficiency awue has no units since it represents a relative value based on these mathematical theories we used maxdea software to evaluate awue the input and output data are listed in table 1 3 2 moran index to study the coefficients of global spatial autocorrelation this study adopted the global moran index the global moran index can distinguish the characteristics of aggregation or dispersion of observations within the scope of this study this is defined as follows 4 g l o b a l m o r a n i n i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x 2 x j x 2 i 1 n j 1 n w i j in eq 4 x i 1 n x i n n is the number of provinces and cities in this article n 31 w ij is the space distance weight and x i is the value of the x variable of the geographic unit i the index reflects the similarities between provinces and cities in the study area and neighboring provinces and cities when i is close to 1 it indicates that similar attributes are agglomerated when i is close to 1 it indicates that different attributes are clustered together the global moran index can only judge the degree of relevance and difference of observations in the entire scope however it cannot judge the specific spatial agglomeration characteristics and significance within the regional view the local moran index can solve this problem its definition is as follows 5 l o c a l m o r a n i x i x 2 j 1 n w i j x j x 2 s 2 in eq 5 the meanings of x n w ij and x i are the same as above and s 2 is the standard deviation and this indicator is used to measure the correlation between provinces and cities and their surrounding provinces and cities a positive i i indicates a high high aggregation type or a low low aggregation type a negative i i indicates a high low aggregation type or a low high aggregation type 3 3 calculation of the agricultural graywater footprint regarding the calculation of the agricultural graywater footprint sun et al 2016a suggested that the agricultural graywater footprint consists of a crop graywater footprint and breeding graywater footprint 6 l a g r l c r o p l l

measuring the graywater footprint based on nitrogen was available thus there was 35 nitrogen in the fertilizer l l i v e s t o c k refers to the nitrogen load in the manure emissions of eight types of

donkeys and mules sheep broilers and laying hens based on l l i v e s t o c k the graywater footprint of the livestock industry can be calculated using eq 9 the graywater footprint is defined as the total amount of water used to dilute the key pollutant with the highest concentration and the current academic community believes that nitrogen is the key pollutant element some scholars believe that using only nitrogen to measure the graywater footprint is biased gu et al 2014 li et al 2019 wang et al 2014a however considering factors such as data availability and collection costs the method of measuring the graywater footprint based on nitrogen has still been developed by leaps and bounds hoekstra et al 2011 proposed a calculation method for the graywater footprint 9 g w f m 3 l k g c m a x

standard and natural concentration of nitrogen in fresh water tables 3 and 4 3 4 data 3 4 1 data source the agricultural water use data of china s 31 provinces were obtained from the china rural statistical yearbook nbs 2008 2019a and china water statistics yearbook mwr prc 2008 2019 socioeconomic data were obtained from the china statistical yearbook nbs 2008 2019b covering the period from 2008 to 2019 the sources of the influencing factor data include the china statistical yearbook the chinese rural statistical yearbook and the statistical bulletin of national science technology investment these are noted in table 5 3 4 2 input and output data human capital land water input and agricultural output are common options when input output models are used to evaluate water efficiency our study referred to lu et al 2021b mu et al 2016 and utilized the employment number of agricultural collectively owned enterprises in each province agriculture forestry and water affairs expenditures arable land area agricultural water consumption and total agricultural output value to measure the human capital land water resources input and agricultural output indicators respectively in addition we considered graywater as an unexpected output deng et al 2016 sun and zhao 2013 we used the input output data shown in table 1 4 results 4 1 graywater of crop and livestock production using the method described above we evaluated the graywater of agricultural crops and livestock in china the level of livestock graywater of was higher than that of crop graywater as there were several provinces in which the livestock graywater exceeded that of crops fig 1 for the graywater of crops gwc in some regions such as south and southwest china the livestock graywater was more than that of crops at the regional level northwest china and north china produced a smaller volume of gwc than did central china for the graywater of livestock gwl the regions of south china central china and north china have a higher population density and more developed economy producing much more gwl than is produced in the remaining regions central china and south china have a more developed economy with a larger amount of arable land and a larger population considering the social and economic factors thus the gwc was influenced by arable land and agricultural management the gwl was affected by consumption level dietary habits and population density in addition the gaps between the gwc and gwl in the seven regions were distinct specifically the northwest had the smallest gap between gwc and gwl due to its inferior natural endowment for agricultural development and superior natural endowment for livestock in the remaining regions the more developed regions produced larger graywater volumes as shown in fig 1 a from fig 1 b we find that shanghai and henan provinces have a large gap because these provinces are wealthy and people consume more protein products there the increasing demand for meat increases the livestock production thus producing more gwl therefore wealthy provinces produce more graywater than poor provinces do second if the province s gross domestic product climbs the volume of gwl will increasingly surpass that of gwc therefore it is advisable to decrease graywater by developing a low pollution livestock industry as shown in fig 1 b the provinces municipalities in which the graywater footprints were at the maximum and the minimum extremes were more worthy of attention the gwl in henan shandong and sichuan far exceeded their gwc this indicates that the livestock industry is large in these three regions which should be the focus of the central government when reforming the livestock breeding industry similar to the distribution law of the graywater footprint at the regional level the graywater footprint of a province was also affected by population arable land and eating habits for example henan and shandong are populous provinces while the sichuanese prefer a variety of animal offal however the graywater footprints of the three provinces of beijing tianjin and shanghai were low and their livestock graywater footprints were very close to the agricultural graywater footprints this is because of their arable land area and industrial structure these cities have very little arable land and mainly rely on tertiary industries for these economically developed cities more attention needs to be paid to the transfer of their graywater footprint to other provinces through trade 4 2 agricultural water use efficiency in china s 31 provinces the sbm model was applied to evaluate the awue in various provinces in china from 2008 to 2019 some details are shown in table a1 and table 1 displays the average awue of each province from table 1 the awue of the northeastern area in china failed to show strong efficiency because jilin liaoning and heilongjiang provinces all maintain a low awue of less than 0 5 in central china and east china specifically the lower reaches of the yangtze river and coastal provinces including guangdong zhejiang fujian and jiangsu maintained a high awue for a long time in the northwest area almost all the provinces had a low efficiency except for shannxi in southwest china chongqing and sichuan have strong awues however tibet has a low awue from a nationwide perspective the overall awue presents a southeast to northwest gradient declining law which is closely related to china s unique three tiered distribution of climate and geography the chinese government classifies 31 provinces into seven categories north northeast northwest central east south and southwest according to economic and geographic principles from fig 2 we found that there were several awue trends at both the regional and provincial levels 1 nationwide fig 2 c and provincial level awues were divided into two parts by a split zone the first group gathered at high levels around 2010 and the second group at low levels around 2015 in the middle the density of awue 0 5 0 75 was low which means that there were few provinces at this level that is to say the chinese awue has been low since 2015 thus nationwide agricultural development and the promotion of agricultural water use management required more labor technology and capital input after 2015 2 from a regional level fig 2 a and fig 2 b the regional average awue from high to low levels was as follows central china south china east china southwest north china northeast and northwest regions from 2013 2014 many regional awues were reversed at this time five regions including central china east china north china northwest and northeast showed an awue increase while two regions southwest and south china showed a decrease in addition the average awue in the southwest and south china fitted a u shape and the other five regions all showed an inverted u shaped change trend there were two categories in these regions divided by the split zone mentioned above the low awue group contained northeast northwest and north china and the high awue group included the remaining four regions thus the south china and southwest regions have developed their agriculture efficiently since 2015 however the northern regions including north china northwest and northeast did not make positive progress with their agriculture 3 at the provincial level fig 2 d the provinces in central china and east china such as zhejiang shandong fujian jiangsu hunan and henan maintained high awue levels the provinces in north china northwest and northeast maintained their awue at a low level the developed provinces such as chongqing sichuan and guangdong in the southwest and south china regions had higher awue values compared with underdeveloped provinces such as guizhou yunnan and guangxi therefore provinces in the northern region reached a high awue level which is more difficult for drier climates however in the same climate zone the economy facilitated the awue 4 3 spatial autocorrelation of agricultural water use efficiency according to table 2 the awue ranges from 0 1 to analyze the awue this study divided the awue range of 0 1 into five equal parts as 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 0 8 1 0 and referred to them as the lowest low medium high and highest levels respectively we used arcgis 10 3 software to visualize the awue fig 3 we interpreted the spatial situations of the regional and provincial level awues as follows 1 as shown in fig 3 provinces that maintained a high awue level were mainly located in east china and south china however the awue in hunan jiangxi and hubei remained at a low level in addition the awues in central china and southwest china were not stable 2 taking the black river teng chong line br tc line as the boundary the awue in provinces north of this line such as inner mongolia xinjiang tibet and qinghai were mostly at a low or lowest level the awue in the regions south of the br tc line and the middle and lower reaches of east china and south china such as henan jiangsu and shandong were able to maintain a high awue level based on a distance space weight vector in four neighbors through app geoda the awue in each province in the four periods fig 4 show global and partial autocorrelations the global autocorrelation results are presented in table 5 the global spatial correlation of the awue was effective table 5 as time passed the global moran index decreased which showed that the awue spatial difference increased there are several reasons for this first severe regional economic disparity has led to a large discrepancy in research and development r d expenditures which widened the gap in awue in various provinces second the awues in developed provinces far surpass the underdeveloped ones as the multi region commerce transfers virtual water from the wealthy to the poor the local spatial correlation of the awue works in all periods fig 4 specifically several provinces in the southwest region such as yunnan guizhou chongqing and sichuan show high high agglomeration indicating that the awue in southwest china was higher due to its geographical and climatic advantages however in the northwest the xinjiang autonomous region has always been in the low low aggregation meaning that the awues in the surrounding provinces of the xinjiang autonomous region were at relatively low levels in east china anhui and shanghai show low high agglomeration indicating that the provincial level awues were quite different over time 4 4 analysis of the awue determinants the above input output model shows that labor capital water resources land and livestock crop wastewater discharge all affect the awue in fact the awue is also affected by other factors such as nature industry structure technology economics crop type structure irrigation infrastructure food type structure and environmental regulations this section combines qualitative and quantitative analysis methods to explain the mechanisms of various factors affecting the awue the spatial measurement method was used to quantitatively analyze the impact of various factors on the awue 4 4 1 determinants of china s awue 1 natural endowments natural factors such as precipitation temperature sunlight clouds fog and natural disasters can significantly affect awue piao et al 2010 wang et al 2020 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b zhang et al 2015 precipitation has been proven to critically affect agriculture because precipitation utilization or management practices for dryland crops directly affect agricultural production bennie and hensley 2001 zhang et al 2012 2 proportion of tertiary and primary industries the reason for considering the proportion of tertiary and primary industries ptp instead of simply using the proportion of the primary industry in the gdp as the determinant was that the market and government can choose between the three elements of human capital and land in the three industries and these investment elements will all affect the awue the path through which the ptp affects the awue is ptp declines agricultural output value increases awue increases 3 proportion of grain production and meat production the proportion of grain production and meat production pgm can be defined from aspects of food supply and demand from the aspect of supply it represents the proportion of grains and meats in the food produced by each province each year as a policymaker the government should guide farmers to engage in crops or aquaculture to change this ratio to achieve food security or reduce pollution from the demand perspective assuming that the market is cleared this ratio reflects individuals food preferences before reaching the level of high income as income increases individuals preference for meat increases significantly this preference does not necessarily match the purpose of the government therefore the path through which the pgm influences the awue is government control or changes in food preferences pgm changes changes in grain meat output changes in total graywater footprint awue 4 technological progress the new economic growth theory incorporates technological progress into the framework of economic development laying the theoretical foundation for agricultural science and technology to promote agriculture and increase productivity jin et al 2002 the progression of drip irrigation low pressure pipe irrigation equipment and new crops relies on technological innovation and the former will effectively reduce the amount of water consumed per unit of agricultural output if technological innovation could be regarded as a system then r d expenditure would be the most important input element of this system therefore r d expenditure was used to measure technological progress 5 farmer s income lin 2008 proposed that an increase in residents income could increase savings thereby increasing personal capital ownership which leads to powerful production endowment this theory s main content is that enterprises with normal management levels are expected to obtain a normal and socially acceptable profit level without relying on government or external subsidies we extended this theory to agricultural production and suggested that an agricultural production unit with self sustaining ability could achieve technological progress through self accumulation thereby continuously improving its own production efficiency while the level of self accumulation could be measured by farmers income and willingness to save when the agricultural self accumulation caused by an increase in farmers income can meet the needs of agricultural technology renewal the efficiency of agricultural production will continue to improve which means agriculture can survive according to the theory of comparative advantage and viability the increased income of farmers could drive the entire industry s technological progress and improve output efficiency taking the agricultural industry as an example these theories should also be applied therefore the income of agricultural producers also affects the awue in addition farmers saving propensity determines their intention to convert income into capital 6 agricultural crop structure agricultural producers can choose to grow food crops such as cereals and potatoes or economic crops such as cotton and beans the water consumption for the two types is inconsistent which demonstrates that the agricultural crop structure affects the awue 7 environmental regulations the porter hypothesis states that appropriate environmental regulations er will stimulate technological innovation and reduce or offset the cost of observing those regulations porter and van der linde 1995 similarly appropriate er could encourage technological innovation which is conducive to achieving high efficiency and low pollution in agricultural production the amount of investment in environmental pollution control was used to represent the measurement of er and the intensity of er was measured by the proportion of investment in environmental pollution control in the gdp berman and bui 2001 gray 1987 lanoie et al 2008 to solve the issue of data limitation the allocation basis m distribution was used as the proportion matrix of urban environmental infrastructure regulation investment of each province to the total environmental pollution regulation investment from 2007 to 2019 we assumed that the distribution of any other item in the total environmental pollution regulation investment follows this ratio then we obtained m province the matrix of environmental pollution regulation investment of every province by using the e e c and m d i s t r i b u t i o n from 2007 to 2019 m province v ec m distribution 8 irrigation infrastructure effective irrigation refers to relatively flat cultivated land that depends on a certain water source owing to a certain water source and equipped with irrigation projects or equipment the effective irrigation area reflects the intensity of the regional irrigation infrastructure if in developing countries such as iran and china whose rural economies mainly depend on agricultural products intensive irrigated agriculture is responsible for over 90 of freshwater consumption samian et al 2015 these large agricultural countries have significant room for improvement in their agricultural water use and constitute the basis of the global sustainable development of water resources nazari et al 2018 rosegrant et al 2009 therefore the irrigation level directly affects awue kaur et al 2021 this study regarded the ratio of efficient irrigation area to cultivated land irrigation area as the local if level 4 4 2 quantification of the factors influencing awue using the tobit model we analyzed the factors listed in table 6 as follows 10 10 a w u e α 1 l n n e α 2 l n p t p α 3 l n p g m α 4 l n t p α 5 l n f i α 6 l n c s α 7 l n e r α 8 l n i f c o n s i ε the meaning of each variable is shown above and all variables comprised a 31 12 matrix because this study used panel data from 31 inland chinese provinces autonomous regions or municipalities from 2008 to 2019 neglecting china s hong kong macao and taiwan provinces standardizing all variables helps to quantitatively analyze the influence of each variable on the dependent variable we employed the method of x min max min to standardize all variables using the processed data the tobit regression results are presented in table 7 eight variances were significant in the regression analysis table 7 specifically the factors that had a positive effect on the awue included natural resource endowment ne technological progress tp and irrigation infrastructure if the factors that had a negative effect on the awue included the proportion of tertiary industrial and primary industry ptp proportion of grain production and meat production pgm farmer income agricultural crop structure cs and environmental regulations er among the positive factors tp was one of the most important factors affecting the awue followed by ne the ne was determined by the geography and climate of a region and it was difficult to change however increasing r d expenditures could promote technological progress the regression results show that a 1 increase in tp across the country could increase the awue by 0 977 furthermore if can improve awue a 1 increase in if nationwide could increase the awue by 0 139 under the current technological status the marginal benefits of funds invested in r d development far exceed those invested in upgrading irrigation equipment therefore it is advisable for the government to invest in r d rather than upgrade irrigation equipment among the negative factors fi was one of the most important factors affecting the awue followed by cs the inhibitory effect of er on the awue cannot be ignored ptp and pgm had similar impacts on the awue the increase in farmers income leads to a decrease in awue which may be due to the low saving tendency of farmers mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 in addition agriculture now belongs to the outflow stage of three major factors capital labor and technology the increase in fi may be due to the withdrawal of some farmers from the agricultural production market and the income that individual farmers could obtain increased therefore it is important to improve the awue by increasing the crop ratio of cash crops and re entering the agricultural field through policy guidance as for cs it should be noted that the output efficiency of cash and food crops was inconsistent which means that the economic output per unit of input and pollution emissions were also different the negative regression coefficient of cs indicates that the higher the grain crop ratio the lower the awue specifically every 1 increase in the grain ratio reduces the awue by 0 32 to reduce pollution the cs should be reduced nationwide or the output per unit area should be increased through technological advancement based on the results shown in table 6 under current technology and natural conditions reducing the pgm by 1 nationwide could increase the awue by 0 2248 combining the results of the cs table 6 we found that to improve water efficiency it is necessary to increase the output per unit of agricultural input and increase investment in the livestock industry similarly the coefficient of ptp was negative table 6 and a 1 decrease in ptp could improve the awue by 0 2348 therefore it is not feasible to increase the proportion of tertiary industries to reduce agricultural pollution and improve the awue even if local primary industry pollution disappears the development of the tertiary industry still needs to purchase raw materials agricultural products through trade which is equivalent to the transfer of agricultural water pollution and not conducive to the country s environmental governance only by properly adjusting the proportion between ptp and ptg can the pollution of water resources be effectively reduced er is the government s investment in the governance of environmental issues er inevitably increase the burden of pollution control costs for enterprises under the condition of unchanged production technology the squeezing effect of productive investment and forced changes in production processes reduce the efficiency of enterprise technological innovation the regression results in table 6 show that a 1 increase in er across the country could reduce the efficiency of water resources by 0 3056 which shows that er reduces the efficiency of corporate innovation 5 discussion this paper answers the four questions raised in the introduction section based on these answers we find differences with other scholars in the awue driving force in terms of tp er and pgm first this study used provincial panel data of china from 2008 to 2019 and adopted a slacked based model to measure china s awue in addition it considered the pollution caused by crop and livestock in the agricultural graywater footprint expanding the concept of agricultural water use to identify the factors influencing the awue in chinese provinces this study employed a tobit regression to identify the positive and negative factors however there were also some limitations in this study by analyzing changes in the determinants in different areas tp and er were found to be the main reasons for the changes in u shape and reversed u shape as shown in fig 5 the impact of r d and technology investment and er investment on water resource efficiency has a lagging effect we found that the cs er and industrial structure had an inhibitory effect on the awue the interpretation of the results in this study is as follows fig 6 indicates the impact of the ptp on the agricultural graywater footprint we assumed that the population in a region needs a certain amount of food which was composed of grains and meat both of which had a substitution effect according to the previous results we found that economically developed regions consume more meat than underdeveloped regions however the graywater footprint of producing the same amount of grain meat was different it was assumed that the graywater footprint of the livestock industry will continue to decrease with the expansion of production capacity because of technological progress and scale effects while the graywater footprint of the crop industry was diminishing with the expansion of production capacity due to factors such as scattered production and huge differences in crop growth habits which were difficult to be managed in a unified manner in china the current investment in livestock industry management lags that of developed countries thus there was much room for improvement while the crop industry was restricted by the mountain environment it was difficult to achieve low cost mass production there our assumptions meet the basic facts based on the assumptions we found that the crop graywater footprint and livestock graywater footprint show different changes with the increase in production as a result the total graywater footprint which is composed of the crop graywater footprint and livestock graywater footprint showed a u shaped trend when the output value of the industry and the output value of the crop industry reached q the total graywater footprint was the smallest because the graywater footprint was an unexpected output the awue was maximized at this time in addition regardless of the ratio of the scale of the crop industry to that of livestock the awue will be reduced at present due to income restrictions and eating habits china s per capita protein intake is still lower than that in developed countries this means that as income increases china s per capita protein intake will still increase bringing greater challenges to meat producers in the livestock industry the negative coefficient of pgm in table 6 indicates that an increase in pgm could decrease awue consequently increasing the value of livestock and reducing pgm could move the curve closer to q which is conducive to improving awue in china this conclusion does not conflict with previous findings that the graywater footprint of livestock exceeds that of crops in most areas this fact only explains the absolute quantitative relationship between china s livestock and crop industry pollution but cannot confirm the specific substitution relationship between crop industry graywater and livestock graywater as for ptp we suggest that there was a multiplier effect between the primary industry and the tertiary industry instead of a substitute relationship for example the development of takeaway promoted the output value of the catering industry which directly increased the demand for raw materials agricultural products and drove the demand for agricultural products for the catering industry therefore the key adjustment of the industrial structure requires the largest tertiary industry ratio that the primary industry can afford some scholars believe that environmental regulations reduce the efficiency of corporate innovation environmental regulations inevitably increase the burden of pollution control costs for enterprises and the extrusion effect of productive investment and the forced change in the production process could reduce the efficiency of an enterprise s technological innovation if the production technology remains unchanged boyd and mcclelland 1999 levinsohn and petrin 2003 zhao et al 2019 found that environmental regulations have a threshold effect on technological innovation when environmental regulations do not reach the threshold the impact of environmental regulations on corporate performance is uncertain as the intensity of environmental regulation changes from weak to strong the impact effect changes from offset effect to compensation effect only when the intensity of environmental regulation exceeds a certain threshold could the porter hypothesis be realized our study believes that china s investment in environmental regulation has not yet reached the threshold which has caused the inhibitory effect of environmental regulatory investment on technological progress and further led to a decline in the awue compared with the research findings from other scholars and based on the perspective of industrial structure and natural endowment this paper considers that improving the awue should be adapted to local conditions which is consistent with the view of wang and lin 2021 moreover based on the theory of viability and comparative advantage this paper explains that increasing farmers income is not enough to make china s agriculture viable jin et al 2019 believe that the awue in some regions of china is on the rise while our study demonstrates that during 2008 2019 except for the western region the awue in other regions showed an inverted u trend the reason was that although the input of all kinds of factors in each province showed a growth trend during the study period the growth of input factors did not conform to the law of agricultural production this resulted in a reduction in awue after 2010 one disadvantage of this study was that although the pollution caused by livestock was considered in the measurement of the graywater footprint due to restrictions in the statistical data on livestock in china it can only be roughly estimated when we evaluated the value of the runoff coefficient α different soil textures and fertilizer management levels were ignored those factors influence α significantly han et al 2010 ramos et al 2019 wang et al 2019 yoshinaga et al 2007 consequently this might cause errors in the graywater of crop production organic fertilizer is an essential factor when studying agricultural graywater footprints however as china s organic agriculture is relatively less developed than that in the united states and european developed countries the data on organic fertilizer are lacking at present we found that data on organic fertilizers in china still widely use survey and questionnaire methods li and shen 2021 wang et al 2018b zhang et al 2018a these methods can be better used in small scale regional research rather than large scale regional research therefore statistics on the application of organic fertilizers are of great help in accurately measuring the agricultural graywater footprint in china 6 conclusion 1 wealthy provinces produce more graywater than do poor provinces second if the provinces gross domestic products climb the volume of gwl will surpass gwc by a larger amount 2 the average awue in southwest and south china fit a u trend while the remaining five regions all show an inverted u shaped tendency in 2012 two important strategic documents issued by the chinese government turned the trend of the awue of seven regions through the path of technology 3 compared with investment in irrigation infrastructure investment in r d has higher marginal benefits in enhancing the awue in addition a 1 decrease in pgm could increase the awue by 0 2248 nationwide 4 environmental regulations still inhibit the improvement of awue which means that environmental regulations have not yet reached the threshold for which a per unit input could positively influence awue however the improvement of the awue by irrigation infrastructure was obvious declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research was financially

9792,chinese agricultural production has grown rapidly over the past two decades however expanding large scale production faces a sharp conflict with the supply of water resources meanwhile to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and protect the environment both the livestock and crop industries had to input more to achieve a high output of meat and grains and low graywater footprint emission using provincial panel data of china from 2008 to 2019 this study adopted a slacked based model to measure the country s agricultural water use efficiency awue that considered graywater from crop and livestock production as an unexpected output based on the concept of sustainable development using the graywater footprint as an undesired output included environmental pollution caused by agricultural production as part of the cost and could more accurately measure the water efficiency of current production we also applied the tobit model to identify the main factors influencing awue our results indicated the following 1 wealthy provinces produced more graywater than did poor provinces if the province s gross domestic product climbed the volume of graywater of livestock would surpass graywater of crops by a greater amount 2 the awue in southwest and south china fitted a u trend while the remaining five regions showed an inverted u shaped tendency 3 to improve the awue it is necessary to increase the crop area of economic crops and expand the scale of the livestock industry compared with investment in irrigation infrastructure investment in research and experimental development produces higher marginal benefits in enhancing the awue 4 environmental regulations inhibit the improvement of the awue while irrigation infrastructure significantly improves the awue keywords water resource agriculture environmental regulations graywater footprint slacked based model 1 introduction water scarcity is one of the major global environmental problems in the 21st century srinivasan et al 2012 although technological advances have made irrigation more effective agriculture still accounts for 80 90 of all fresh water used by humans most of which is used for food production mbava et al 2020 morison et al 2008 agriculture commands more water than any other activity on this planet qadir et al 2003 similarly agricultural water consumption in china has accounted for over 60 of the total domestic water consumption since 1998 china has been suffering from a shortage of water resources for many years primarily due to a large food demand khan et al 2009 wang et al 2014b there are both exogenous and endogenous causes of this dilemma the main exogenous cause is china s large population making chinese per capita freshwater resources a quarter of the world average fan et al 2019 the main endogenous reason is the low level of agricultural development in china which is mainly reflected in the inefficiency of agricultural water use and the misuse of pesticides and fertilizers that lead to water pollution and aggravate water scarcity a large population has a great potential for development and also a great potential for being a burden on the food and water supply under current dietary patterns national irrigation water requirements will reach 249 billion m 3 when the expected population peak occurs in 2032 he et al 2021 to alleviate the conflict of water resources this research mainly focuses on the endogenous reason for the long term water shortage in china it is beneficial to examine agricultural water use efficiency awue by considering environmental pollution from agricultural production and livestock awue is defined as the crop yield per unit of water resources which includes irrigation water and precipitation based on this definition this study considers the negative externalities of agricultural production and advances a new conception of the awue measuring the awue in each province is a prerequisite for achieving high quality agricultural development and could also provide a reference for formulating agricultural development plans at the national level therefore this study aims to answer the following questions how can awue be measured at the provincial level in china what is the current situation of this provincial level awue are there any spatial differences or correlations among different provinces what factors influence awue 2 literature review data envelopment analysis dea slack based model data envelopment analysis sbm dea and their derivative methods are frequently used for efficiency evaluations charnes et al 1978 düzakın and düzakın 2007 tone 2001 the above models have been widely applied to measure awue hai et al 2020 li et al 2018 lu et al 2021b in terms of utilizing these methods on agricultural water resources scholars have gradually changed from the original multi input and single output models to multi input and multi output models which are more suitable for actual production several scholars who used the multi input model to evaluate awue selected similar indicators the original data of land labor water resources and capital or data weighted by the population or crop area have been input variables of agricultural production lu et al 2021b mu et al 2016 several scholars have considered unexpected outputs they generally regarded agricultural sewage as an undesired output which internalizes the negative externalities of production and makes the evaluation more realistic deng et al 2016 sun and zhao 2013 crop and livestock production graywater can accurately evaluate agricultural water pollution providing a suitable method to measure the unexpected output of agriculture graywater footprint is defined as the volume of fresh water required to absorb and assimilate a certain pollutant load based on the natural background concentration and existing environmental water quality standards franke et al 2013 hoekstra et al 2011 unlike in other countries china s agricultural production includes livestock production moreover the graywater associated with livestock is more than that associated with crops when producing one unit of protein mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 however chinese researchers have studied the graywater footprint by considering only the residues of agricultural production nitrogen and phosphorus in chemical fertilizers and pesticides and ignoring the water pollution from nitrogen and phosphorus produced by livestock this hinders them from obtaining unbiased results when using a multifactor input model to measure the provincial awue in china our study utilizes the sbm model method a multi input and multi output model and considers the graywater produced by agricultural production and livestock as an unexpected output in addition this study employs the global and local moran indices to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of china s awue nature industry structure technology economics crop structure and irrigation infrastructure can influence the awue natural factors such as precipitation temperature sunlight clouds fog and natural disasters can also significantly affect the awue piao et al 2010 precipitation has been proven to critically impact agriculture because precipitation utilization or management practices for dryland crops directly affect agricultural production bennie and hensley 2001 zhang et al 2012 for industrial structure factors in more developed areas the proportion of agriculture is small compared to tertiary industries which causes a weak water resource scale effect wang et al 2018a technological advancement is a driving force for more efficient water utilization the improvement in urban water use efficiency depends on new technology investments bai et al 2017 specifically new technologies allow farmers to know the physiological parameters that describe the crop s water status and photosynthetic activity other approaches such as the use of oxygen stable isotopes as a proxy for water use are still far from being applied casadesús et al 2007 ferrio et al 2007 tuberosa et al 2007 in terms of economic factors the regional economic development level has a non linear and positive correlation with water resource efficiency song et al 2018 the crop structure is supposed to fit regional characteristics tan et al 2017 moreover it is advisable to decrease agricultural freshwater consumption using local strategies such as improving the crop ratio of economic crops cotton oil bearing crops fiber crops sugarcane and beetroots and adopting alternate drought tolerant crops evans and sadler 2008 agricultural drought is related to meteorological and hydrological conditions and the resilience of crops to water deficits and has negative impacts on agricultural production shen et al 2019 irrigation can greatly alleviate the negative impacts of droughts and increase agricultural production kang et al 2017 lu et al 2021a yu et al 2019 in addition tang et al 2015 indicated that irrigation infrastructure increases water use efficiency while land fragmentation decreases it these are important but general factors of awue in this paper we consider some novel factors that are more instructive and meaningful such as food type structure and environmental regulations which are important but not noted by researchers we describe the impactful paths of food type structure and environmental regulations on awue in section 4 4 1 determinants and then a mechanism analysis of how they influence the awue in section 5 discussion furthermore instead of utilizing the proportion of primary industry agriculture production in the gdp to represent the industrial structure we employ the ratio between the tertiary industry percentage and the primary industry percentage in the gdp we also explain the reasoning in section 4 4 1 3 material and methods based on current research tone 2001 slacks based measure data envelopment analysis sbm dea analyzing undesirable outputs was established to estimate the water use efficiency deng et al 2016 liu et al 2020a wei et al 2021 we then used the tobit model to analyze the determinants of water use efficiency 3 1 method for estimating water use efficiency in the traditional dea model the undesirable output is converted into input to solve the following scheel 2001 1 min θ λ θ s t j 1 m λ j x j θ x j 0 j 1 n 1 λ j y j g y j 0 g j 1 n 2 λ j y j 0 b θ y j 0 b λ j 0 θ 1 where θ represents the efficiency value between 0 and 1 and d m u 0 is efficient if θ 1 cooper et al 2007 x j y j g and y j b represent input desirable output and undesirable output variables respectively and m n 1 and n 2 record the number of variables x j y g y b and λ j are the weight coefficients the congestion and slack problems of input or output were not considered in model 1 therefore the following model proposed by tone 2001 can solve the problem 2 min ρ λ s s g s b ρ 1 1 m j 1 m s j x j 0 1 1 n 1 n 2 j 1 n 1 s j g y j 0 g j 1 n 2 s j b y j 0 b s t x j 0 j 1 m λ j x j s j y j 0 g j 1 n 1 λ j y j g s j g y j 0 b j 1 n 2 λ j y j b s j b λ j 0 s j 0 s j g 0 s j b 0 where ρ s j s j b and s j g represent the efficiency value input redundancy undesirable output redundancy and desirable output deficiency respectively when ρ 1 equivalently s j s j b s j g 0 d m u 0 is efficient cooper et al 2007 to facilitate solving model 2 is generally converted to the following linear programming model 3 min τ t γ s s g s b τ t 1 m j 1 m s j x j 0 s t 1 t 1 n 1 n 2 j 1 n 1 s

efficiency awue value equal to ρ in eq 2 γ j t λ j s j t s j s j g t s j g and s j b t s j b dea is a non parametric linear programming method the core of which is to construct the effective frontier sbm dea is solved through non parametric programming and the effective frontier is constructed based on the projection method tone 2016 awue calculated by sbm dea is a relative efficiency value compared to the effective frontier awue of provinces that are the same as the maximum reference value equal 1 while awue values of provinces that are not on the frontier are less than 1 consequently the value of awue ranges from zero to one awue is most efficient when its value is 1 otherwise the lower the value the lower the efficiency awue has no units since it represents a relative value based on these mathematical theories we used maxdea software to evaluate awue the input and output data are listed in table 1 3 2 moran index to study the coefficients of global spatial autocorrelation this study adopted the global moran index the global moran index can distinguish the characteristics of aggregation or dispersion of observations within the scope of this study this is defined as follows 4 g l o b a l m o r a n i n i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x 2 x j x 2 i 1 n j 1 n w i j in eq 4 x i 1 n x i n n is the number of provinces and cities in this article n 31 w ij is the space distance weight and x i is the value of the x variable of the geographic unit i the index reflects the similarities between provinces and cities in the study area and neighboring provinces and cities when i is close to 1 it indicates that similar attributes are agglomerated when i is close to 1 it indicates that different attributes are clustered together the global moran index can only judge the degree of relevance and difference of observations in the entire scope however it cannot judge the specific spatial agglomeration characteristics and significance within the regional view the local moran index can solve this problem its definition is as follows 5 l o c a l m o r a n i x i x 2 j 1 n w i j x j x 2 s 2 in eq 5 the meanings of x n w ij and x i are the same as above and s 2 is the standard deviation and this indicator is used to measure the correlation between provinces and cities and their surrounding provinces and cities a positive i i indicates a high high aggregation type or a low low aggregation type a negative i i indicates a high low aggregation type or a low high aggregation type 3 3 calculation of the agricultural graywater footprint regarding the calculation of the agricultural graywater footprint sun et al 2016a suggested that the agricultural graywater footprint consists of a crop graywater footprint and breeding graywater footprint 6 l a g r l c r o p l l i v e s t o c k in eq 6 l a g r represents the total nitrogen load of agriculture l c r o p represents the total nitrogen load in the crop industry l l i v e s t o c k represents the total nitrogen load in the livestock industry l c r o p estimates the nitrogen load from agricultural nitrogen fertilizers in our study we assumed that all fertilizers were n h 4 n o 3 because the method of measuring the graywater footprint based on nitrogen was available thus there was 35 nitrogen in the fertilizer l l i v e s t o c k refers to the nitrogen load in the manure emissions of eight types of livestock including swine beef cattle cows horses donkeys mules sheep broilers and laying hens brandjes et al 1996 gu et al 2008 yan et al 2010 7 l c r o p α a p p l 8 l l i v e s t o c k i 1 8 ξ i n

l c r o p is the annual nitrogen load caused by the use of nitrogen fertilizers in the crop industry our research referred to studies of sun et al 2016b zhu 2000 taking the α value of all provinces across the country as 7 based on l c r o p the graywater footprint of the crop industry can be calculated by eq 9 eq 8 represents the nitrogen content in feces feeding amount and excretion coefficient of the i type of livestock the details of ξ i n i and p i are listed in table 2 l l i v e s t o c k represents the nitrogen load which is the total nitrogen quantity from swine beef cattle cows horses donkeys and mules sheep broilers and laying hens based on l l i v e s t o c k the graywater footprint of the livestock industry can be calculated using eq 9 the graywater footprint is defined as the total amount of water used to dilute the key pollutant with the highest concentration and the current academic community believes that nitrogen is the key pollutant element some scholars believe that using only nitrogen to measure the graywater footprint is biased gu et al 2014 li et al 2019 wang et al 2014a however considering factors such as data availability and collection costs the method of measuring the graywater footprint based on nitrogen has still been developed by leaps and bounds hoekstra et al 2011 proposed a calculation method for the graywater footprint 9 g w f m 3 l k g c m a x c n a t k g m 3 in eq 9 gwf represents the annual graywater footprint l represents the key pollutant load c m a x represents the standard concentration of pollutants in quality water kg m 3 and c n a

standard and natural concentration of nitrogen in fresh water tables 3 and 4 3 4 data 3 4 1 data source the agricultural water use data of china s 31 provinces were obtained from the china rural statistical yearbook nbs 2008 2019a and china water statistics yearbook mwr prc 2008 2019 socioeconomic data were obtained from the china statistical yearbook nbs 2008 2019b covering the period from 2008 to 2019 the sources of the influencing factor data include the china statistical yearbook the chinese rural statistical yearbook and the statistical bulletin of national science technology investment these are noted in table 5 3 4 2 input and output data human capital land water input and agricultural output are common options when input output models are used to evaluate water efficiency our study referred to lu et al 2021b mu et al 2016 and utilized the employment number of agricultural collectively owned enterprises in each province agriculture forestry and water affairs expenditures arable land area agricultural water consumption and total agricultural output value to measure the human capital land water resources input and agricultural output indicators respectively in addition we considered graywater as an unexpected output deng et al 2016 sun and zhao 2013 we used the input output data shown in table 1 4 results 4 1 graywater of crop and livestock production using the method described above we evaluated the graywater of agricultural crops and livestock in china the level of livestock graywater of was higher than that of crop graywater as there were several provinces in which the livestock graywater exceeded that of crops fig 1 for the graywater of crops gwc in some regions such as south and southwest china the livestock graywater was more than that of crops at the regional level northwest china and north china produced a smaller volume of gwc than did central china for the graywater of livestock gwl the regions of south china central china and north china have a higher population density and more developed economy producing much more gwl than is produced in the remaining regions central china and south china have a more developed economy with a larger amount of arable land and a larger population considering the social and economic factors thus the gwc was influenced by arable land and agricultural management the gwl was affected by consumption level dietary habits and population density in addition the gaps between the gwc and gwl in the seven regions were distinct specifically the northwest had the smallest gap between gwc and gwl due to its inferior natural endowment for agricultural development and superior natural endowment for livestock in the remaining regions the more developed regions produced larger graywater volumes as shown in fig 1 a from fig 1 b we find that shanghai and henan provinces have a large gap because these provinces are wealthy and people consume more protein products there the increasing demand for meat increases the livestock production thus producing more gwl therefore wealthy provinces produce more graywater than poor provinces do second if the province s gross domestic product climbs the volume of gwl will increasingly surpass that of gwc therefore it is advisable to decrease graywater by developing a low pollution livestock industry as shown in fig 1 b the provinces municipalities in which the graywater footprints were at the maximum and the minimum extremes were more worthy of attention the gwl in henan shandong and sichuan far exceeded their gwc this indicates that the livestock industry is large in these three regions which should be the focus of the central government when reforming the livestock breeding industry similar to the distribution law of the graywater footprint at the regional level the graywater footprint of a province was also affected by population arable land and eating habits for example henan and shandong are populous provinces while the sichuanese prefer a variety of animal offal however the graywater footprints of the three provinces of beijing tianjin and shanghai were low and their livestock graywater footprints were very close to the agricultural graywater footprints this is because of their arable land area and industrial structure these cities have very little arable land and mainly rely on tertiary industries for these economically developed cities more attention needs to be paid to the transfer of their graywater footprint to other provinces through trade 4 2 agricultural water use efficiency in china s 31 provinces the sbm model was applied to evaluate the awue in various provinces in china from 2008 to 2019 some details are shown in table a1 and table 1 displays the average awue of each province from table 1 the awue of the northeastern area in china failed to show strong efficiency because jilin liaoning and heilongjiang provinces all maintain a low awue of less than 0 5 in central china and east china specifically the lower reaches of the yangtze river and coastal provinces including guangdong zhejiang fujian and jiangsu maintained a high awue for a long time in the northwest area almost all the provinces had a low efficiency except for shannxi in southwest china chongqing and sichuan have strong awues however tibet has a low awue from a nationwide perspective the overall awue presents a southeast to northwest gradient declining law which is closely related to china s unique three tiered distribution of climate and geography the chinese government classifies 31 provinces into seven categories north northeast northwest central east south and southwest according to economic and geographic principles from fig 2 we found that there were several awue trends at both the regional and provincial levels 1 nationwide fig 2 c and provincial level awues were divided into two parts by a split zone the first group gathered at high levels around 2010 and the second group at low levels around 2015 in the middle the density of awue 0 5 0 75 was low which means that there were few provinces at this level that is to say the chinese awue has been low since 2015 thus nationwide agricultural development and the promotion of agricultural water use management required more labor technology and capital input after 2015 2 from a regional level fig 2 a and fig 2 b the regional average awue from high to low levels was as follows central china south china east china southwest north china northeast and northwest regions from 2013 2014 many regional awues were reversed at this time five regions including central china east china north china northwest and northeast showed an awue increase while two regions southwest and south china showed a decrease in addition the average awue in the southwest and south china fitted a u shape and the other five regions all showed an inverted u shaped change trend there were two categories in these regions divided by the split zone mentioned above the low awue group contained northeast northwest and north china and the high awue group included the remaining four regions thus the south china and southwest regions have developed their agriculture efficiently since 2015 however the northern regions including north china northwest and northeast did not make positive progress with their agriculture 3 at the provincial level fig 2 d the provinces in central china and east china such as zhejiang shandong fujian jiangsu hunan and henan maintained high awue levels the provinces in north china northwest and northeast maintained their awue at a low level the developed provinces such as chongqing sichuan and guangdong in the southwest and south china regions had higher awue values compared with underdeveloped provinces such as guizhou yunnan and guangxi therefore provinces in the northern region reached a high awue level which is more difficult for drier climates however in the same climate zone the economy facilitated the awue 4 3 spatial autocorrelation of agricultural water use efficiency according to table 2 the awue ranges from 0 1 to analyze the awue this study divided the awue range of 0 1 into five equal parts as 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 0 8 1 0 and referred to them as the lowest low medium high and highest levels respectively we used arcgis 10 3 software to visualize the awue fig 3 we interpreted the spatial situations of the regional and provincial level awues as follows 1 as shown in fig 3 provinces that maintained a high awue level were mainly located in east china and south china however the awue in hunan jiangxi and hubei remained at a low level in addition the awues in central china and southwest china were not stable 2 taking the black river teng chong line br tc line as the boundary the awue in provinces north of this line such as inner mongolia xinjiang tibet and qinghai were mostly at a low or lowest level the awue in the regions south of the br tc line and the middle and lower reaches of east china and south china such as henan jiangsu and shandong were able to maintain a high awue level based on a distance space weight vector in four neighbors through app geoda the awue in each province in the four periods fig 4 show global and partial autocorrelations the global autocorrelation results are presented in table 5 the global spatial correlation of the awue was effective table 5 as time passed the global moran index decreased which showed that the awue spatial difference increased there are several reasons for this first severe regional economic disparity has led to a large discrepancy in research and development r d expenditures which widened the gap in awue in various provinces second the awues in developed provinces far surpass the underdeveloped ones as the multi region commerce transfers virtual water from the wealthy to the poor the local spatial correlation of the awue works in all periods fig 4 specifically several provinces in the southwest region such as yunnan guizhou chongqing and sichuan show high high agglomeration indicating that the awue in southwest china was higher due to its geographical and climatic advantages however in the northwest the xinjiang autonomous region has always been in the low low aggregation meaning that the awues in the surrounding provinces of the xinjiang autonomous region were at relatively low levels in east china anhui and shanghai show low high agglomeration indicating that the provincial level awues were quite different over time 4 4 analysis of the awue determinants the above input output model shows that labor capital water resources land and livestock crop wastewater discharge all affect the awue in fact the awue is also affected by other factors such as nature industry structure technology economics crop type structure irrigation infrastructure food type structure and environmental regulations this section combines qualitative and quantitative analysis methods to explain the mechanisms of various factors affecting the awue the spatial measurement method was used to quantitatively analyze the impact of various factors on the awue 4 4 1 determinants of china s awue 1 natural endowments natural factors such as precipitation temperature sunlight clouds fog and natural disasters can significantly affect awue piao et al 2010 wang et al 2020 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b zhang et al 2015 precipitation has been proven to critically affect agriculture because precipitation utilization or management practices for dryland crops directly affect agricultural production bennie and hensley 2001 zhang et al 2012 2 proportion of tertiary and primary industries the reason for considering the proportion of tertiary and primary industries ptp instead of simply using the proportion of the primary industry in the gdp as the determinant was that the market and government can choose between the three elements of human capital and land in the three industries and these investment elements will all affect the awue the path through which the ptp affects the awue is ptp declines agricultural output value increases awue increases 3 proportion of grain production and meat production the proportion of grain production and meat production pgm can be defined from aspects of food supply and demand from the aspect of supply it represents the proportion of grains and meats in the food produced by each province each year as a policymaker the government should guide farmers to engage in crops or aquaculture to change this ratio to achieve food security or reduce pollution from the demand perspective assuming that the market is cleared this ratio reflects individuals food preferences before reaching the level of high income as income increases individuals preference for meat increases significantly this preference does not necessarily match the purpose of the government therefore the path through which the pgm influences the awue is government control or changes in food preferences pgm changes changes in grain meat output changes in total graywater footprint awue 4 technological progress the new economic growth theory incorporates technological progress into the framework of economic development laying the theoretical foundation for agricultural science and technology to promote agriculture and increase productivity jin et al 2002 the progression of drip irrigation low pressure pipe irrigation equipment and new crops relies on technological innovation and the former will effectively reduce the amount of water consumed per unit of agricultural output if technological innovation could be regarded as a system then r d expenditure would be the most important input element of this system therefore r d expenditure was used to measure technological progress 5 farmer s income lin 2008 proposed that an increase in residents income could increase savings thereby increasing personal capital ownership which leads to powerful production endowment this theory s main content is that enterprises with normal management levels are expected to obtain a normal and socially acceptable profit level without relying on government or external subsidies we extended this theory to agricultural production and suggested that an agricultural production unit with self sustaining ability could achieve technological progress through self accumulation thereby continuously improving its own production efficiency while the level of self accumulation could be measured by farmers income and willingness to save when the agricultural self accumulation caused by an increase in farmers income can meet the needs of agricultural technology renewal the efficiency of agricultural production will continue to improve which means agriculture can survive according to the theory of comparative advantage and viability the increased income of farmers could drive the entire industry s technological progress and improve output efficiency taking the agricultural industry as an example these theories should also be applied therefore the income of agricultural producers also affects the awue in addition farmers saving propensity determines their intention to convert income into capital 6 agricultural crop structure agricultural producers can choose to grow food crops such as cereals and potatoes or economic crops such as cotton and beans the water consumption for the two types is inconsistent which demonstrates that the agricultural crop structure affects the awue 7 environmental regulations the porter hypothesis states that appropriate environmental regulations er will stimulate technological innovation and reduce or offset the cost of observing those regulations porter and van der linde 1995 similarly appropriate er could encourage technological innovation which is conducive to achieving high efficiency and low pollution in agricultural production the amount of investment in environmental pollution control was used to represent the measurement of er and the intensity of er was measured by the proportion of investment in environmental pollution control in the gdp berman and bui 2001 gray 1987 lanoie et al 2008 to solve the issue of data limitation the allocation basis m distribution was used as the proportion matrix of urban environmental infrastructure regulation investment of each province to the total environmental pollution regulation investment from 2007 to 2019 we assumed that the distribution of any other item in the total environmental pollution regulation investment follows this ratio then we obtained m province the matrix of environmental pollution regulation investment of every province by using the e e c and m d i s t r i b u t i o n from 2007 to 2019 m province v ec m distribution 8 irrigation infrastructure effective irrigation refers to relatively flat cultivated land that depends on a certain water source owing to a certain water source and equipped with irrigation projects or equipment the effective irrigation area reflects the intensity of the regional irrigation infrastructure if in developing countries such as iran and china whose rural economies mainly depend on agricultural products intensive irrigated agriculture is responsible for over 90 of freshwater consumption samian et al 2015 these large agricultural countries have significant room for improvement in their agricultural water use and constitute the basis of the global sustainable development of water resources nazari et al 2018 rosegrant et al 2009 therefore the irrigation level directly affects awue kaur et al 2021 this study regarded the ratio of efficient irrigation area to cultivated land irrigation area as the local if level 4 4 2 quantification of the factors influencing awue using the tobit model we analyzed the factors listed in table 6 as follows 10 10 a w u e α 1 l n n e α 2 l n p t p α 3 l n p g m α 4 l n t p α 5 l n f i α 6 l n c s α 7 l n e r α 8 l n i f c o n s i ε the meaning of each variable is shown above and all variables comprised a 31 12 matrix because this study used panel data from 31 inland chinese provinces autonomous regions or municipalities from 2008 to 2019 neglecting china s hong kong macao and taiwan provinces standardizing all variables helps to quantitatively analyze the influence of each variable on the dependent variable we employed the method of x min max min to standardize all variables using the processed data the tobit regression results are presented in table 7 eight variances were significant in the regression analysis table 7 specifically the factors that had a positive effect on the awue included natural resource endowment ne technological progress tp and irrigation infrastructure if the factors that had a negative effect on the awue included the proportion of tertiary industrial and primary industry ptp proportion of grain production and meat production pgm farmer income agricultural crop structure cs and environmental regulations er among the positive factors tp was one of the most important factors affecting the awue followed by ne the ne was determined by the geography and climate of a region and it was difficult to change however increasing r d expenditures could promote technological progress the regression results show that a 1 increase in tp across the country could increase the awue by 0 977 furthermore if can improve awue a 1 increase in if nationwide could increase the awue by 0 139 under the current technological status the marginal benefits of funds invested in r d development far exceed those invested in upgrading irrigation equipment therefore it is advisable for the government to invest in r d rather than upgrade irrigation equipment among the negative factors fi was one of the most important factors affecting the awue followed by cs the inhibitory effect of er on the awue cannot be ignored ptp and pgm had similar impacts on the awue the increase in farmers income leads to a decrease in awue which may be due to the low saving tendency of farmers mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 in addition agriculture now belongs to the outflow stage of three major factors capital labor and technology the increase in fi may be due to the withdrawal of some farmers from the agricultural production market and the income that individual farmers could obtain increased therefore it is important to improve the awue by increasing the crop ratio of cash crops and re entering the agricultural field through policy guidance as for cs it should be noted that the output efficiency of cash and food crops was inconsistent which means that the economic output per unit of input and pollution emissions were also different the negative regression coefficient of cs indicates that the higher the grain crop ratio the lower the awue specifically every 1 increase in the grain ratio reduces the awue by 0 32 to reduce pollution the cs should be reduced nationwide or the output per unit area should be increased through technological advancement based on the results shown in table 6 under current technology and natural conditions reducing the pgm by 1 nationwide could increase the awue by 0 2248 combining the results of the cs table 6 we found that to improve water efficiency it is necessary to increase the output per unit of agricultural input and increase investment in the livestock industry similarly the coefficient of ptp was negative table 6 and a 1 decrease in ptp could improve the awue by 0 2348 therefore it is not feasible to increase the proportion of tertiary industries to reduce agricultural pollution and improve the awue even if local primary industry pollution disappears the development of the tertiary industry still needs to purchase raw materials agricultural products through trade which is equivalent to the transfer of agricultural water pollution and not conducive to the country s environmental governance only by properly adjusting the proportion between ptp and ptg can the pollution of water resources be effectively reduced er is the government s investment in the governance of environmental issues er inevitably increase the burden of pollution control costs for enterprises under the condition of unchanged production technology the squeezing effect of productive investment and forced changes in production processes reduce the efficiency of enterprise technological innovation the regression results in table 6 show that a 1 increase in er across the country could reduce the efficiency of water resources by 0 3056 which shows that er reduces the efficiency of corporate innovation 5 discussion this paper answers the four questions raised in the introduction section based on these answers we find differences with other scholars in the awue driving force in terms of tp er and pgm first this study used provincial panel data of china from 2008 to 2019 and adopted a slacked based model to measure china s awue in addition it considered the pollution caused by crop and livestock in the agricultural graywater footprint expanding the concept of agricultural water use to identify the factors influencing the awue in chinese provinces this study employed a tobit regression to identify the positive and negative factors however there were also some limitations in this study by analyzing changes in the determinants in different areas tp and er were found to be the main reasons for the changes in u shape and reversed u shape as shown in fig 5 the impact of r d and technology investment and er investment on water resource efficiency has a lagging effect we found that the cs er and industrial structure had an inhibitory effect on the awue the interpretation of the results in this study is as follows fig 6 indicates the impact of the ptp on the agricultural graywater footprint we assumed that the population in a region needs a certain amount of food which was composed of grains and meat both of which had a substitution effect according to the previous results we found that economically developed regions consume more meat than underdeveloped regions however the graywater footprint of producing the same amount of grain meat was different it was assumed that the graywater footprint of the livestock industry will continue to decrease with the expansion of production capacity because of technological progress and scale effects while the graywater footprint of the crop industry was diminishing with the expansion of production capacity due to factors such as scattered production and huge differences in crop growth habits which were difficult to be managed in a unified manner in china the current investment in livestock industry management lags that of developed countries thus there was much room for improvement while the crop industry was restricted by the mountain environment it was difficult to achieve low cost mass production there our assumptions meet the basic facts based on the assumptions we found that the crop graywater footprint and livestock graywater footprint show different changes with the increase in production as a result the total graywater footprint which is composed of the crop graywater footprint and livestock graywater footprint showed a u shaped trend when the output value of the industry and the output value of the crop industry reached q the total graywater footprint was the smallest because the graywater footprint was an unexpected output the awue was maximized at this time in addition regardless of the ratio of the scale of the crop industry to that of livestock the awue will be reduced at present due to income restrictions and eating habits china s per capita protein intake is still lower than that in developed countries this means that as income increases china s per capita protein intake will still increase bringing greater challenges to meat producers in the livestock industry the negative coefficient of pgm in table 6 indicates that an increase in pgm could decrease awue consequently increasing the value of livestock and reducing pgm could move the curve closer to q which is conducive to improving awue in china this conclusion does not conflict with previous findings that the graywater footprint of livestock exceeds that of crops in most areas this fact only explains the absolute quantitative relationship between china s livestock and crop industry pollution but cannot confirm the specific substitution relationship between crop industry graywater and livestock graywater as for ptp we suggest that there was a multiplier effect between the primary industry and the tertiary industry instead of a substitute relationship for example the development of takeaway promoted the output value of the catering industry which directly increased the demand for raw materials agricultural products and drove the demand for agricultural products for the catering industry therefore the key adjustment of the industrial structure requires the largest tertiary industry ratio that the primary industry can afford some scholars believe that environmental regulations reduce the efficiency of corporate innovation environmental regulations inevitably increase the burden of pollution control costs for enterprises and the extrusion effect of productive investment and the forced change in the production process could reduce the efficiency of an enterprise s technological innovation if the production technology remains unchanged boyd and mcclelland 1999 levinsohn and petrin 2003 zhao et al 2019 found that environmental regulations have a threshold effect on technological innovation when environmental regulations do not reach the threshold the impact of environmental regulations on corporate performance is uncertain as the intensity of environmental regulation changes from weak to strong the impact effect changes from offset effect to compensation effect only when the intensity of environmental regulation exceeds a certain threshold could the porter hypothesis be realized our study believes that china s investment in environmental regulation has not yet reached the threshold which has caused the inhibitory effect of environmental regulatory investment on technological progress and further led to a decline in the awue compared with the research findings from other scholars and based on the perspective of industrial structure and natural endowment this paper considers that improving the awue should be adapted to local conditions which is consistent with the view of wang and lin 2021 moreover based on the theory of viability and comparative advantage this paper explains that increasing farmers income is not enough to make china s agriculture viable jin et al 2019 believe that the awue in some regions of china is on the rise while our study demonstrates that during 2008 2019 except for the western region the awue in other regions showed an inverted u trend the reason was that although the input of all kinds of factors in each province showed a growth trend during the study period the growth of input factors did not conform to the law of agricultural production this resulted in a reduction in awue after 2010 one disadvantage of this study was that although the pollution caused by livestock was considered in the measurement of the graywater footprint due to restrictions in the statistical data on livestock in china it can only be roughly estimated when we evaluated the value of the runoff coefficient α different soil textures and fertilizer management levels were ignored those factors influence α significantly han et al 2010 ramos et al 2019 wang et al 2019 yoshinaga et al 2007 consequently this might cause errors in the graywater of crop production organic fertilizer is an essential factor when studying agricultural graywater footprints however as china s organic agriculture is relatively less developed than that in the united states and european developed countries the data on organic fertilizer are lacking at present we found that data on organic fertilizers in china still widely use survey and questionnaire methods li and shen 2021 wang et al 2018b zhang et al 2018a these methods can be better used in small scale regional research rather than large scale regional research therefore statistics on the application of organic fertilizers are of great help in accurately measuring the agricultural graywater footprint in china 6 conclusion 1 wealthy

9793,the impact of zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha colonization on pressurized irrigation systems is becoming important in many areas of the world if the infestation is not controlled the conveyance capacity of the network reduces and mussels can completely block the system preventing irrigation a methodology to assess zebra mussel infestation in collective pressurized networks based on monitorization and hydraulic simulation is developed in this research normalized pressure defined as the difference between simulated and measured pressure is an indicator of the presence of zebra mussels morales hernández et al 2018 when this variable is combined with the distributed discharge of the irrigation network it is possible to use an optimization procedure to produce a roughness map of network pipelines roughness in excess of that characteristic of the pipeline material can be directly associated zebra mussel infestation different objective functions optimization algorithms and strategies are proposed in this work with the aim of attaining constant discharge independent normalized pressure at each observation point in the network roughness values under different pipe conditions reproducing levels of zebra mussel infestation were experimentally obtained at a reference laboratory the limitations and uncertainties of the proposed methodology are discussed normalized pressure was validated in an irrigation network belonging to a water users association using continuous data recorded at different observation points during a complete irrigation campaign the non invasive hydraulic method has been designed to identify infested areas in real time and to optimize the chemical treatments controlling mussel development keywords dreissena polymorpha irrigation networks hydraulic simulation normalized pressure optimization pipe roughness 1 introduction zebra mussels dreissena polymorpha are causing extensive damage to hydraulic infrastructure as they reproduce inside water conduits and attach to many different types of surfaces severe problems have been reported in fluvial systems and lakes aldridge et al 2004 wimbush et al 2009 nakano and strayer 2014 olson et al 2018 morales et al 2019 catita et al 2020 but also in pressurized irrigation networks araujo et al 2006 morales hernández et al 2018 zebra mussel has become an important restriction for the management of pressurized collective irrigation networks supplied from colonized reservoirs rivers or canals the enormous volume of infested water the high reproductive rate the adaptation capacity of the species and the cost efficiency required for agricultural production make it very difficult to eradicate the mussel in these water bodies therefore control measures are required to reduce its impact the us geological survey set up a monitoring network to detect the presence of zebra mussel in many water bodies around the country benson et al 2021 reported that piping irrigation systems downstream an infested water body are very likely candidates for infestation in canada the alberta irrigation districts 704 k ha of irrigated land have recognized that the extensive irrigation network particularly the underground pipeline network could experience significant reductions in water conveyance capacity if invasive mussels colonize irrigation water supply reservoirs the government and the irrigation districts of the region are preventing the introduction of the species in irrigation water supply reservoirs and recommending control and eradication measures if zebra mussel eventually infest irrigation water supply canals pipelines and on farm irrigation systems paterson earth and water consulting 2018 in spain the ebro jucar segura and guadalquivir river basins authorities have reported several reservoirs colonized by zebra mussel supplying water to irrigation districts monitoring networks to detect and quantify infestation have been established the ebro river basin has the largest number of colonized reservoirs of the spanish territory che 2018 morales hernández et al 2018 reported that in riegos del alto aragón project raa 120 k ha of irrigated land in the ebro river basin reservoirs are colonized by zebra mussel as a consequence 66 of the irrigated area is infested these authors documented the extent of the zebra mussel dispersion from the colonized reservoir to the piping irrigation systems and the control measures adopted by the irrigation districts to control the species the physical conditions of irrigation reservoirs are adequate for mussel reproduction and growing araujo 2006 colonized reservoirs act as permanent source of larvae for downstream water bodies and irrigation systems intensive zebra mussel invasion of irrigation pipes has been found to occur mainly during the juvenile stage of planktonic veligers zhang et al 2017 veligers first move freely in the water at an age of 18 90 days veligers adhere to hard substrates roberts 1990 resulting in biofouling pipe clogging and decreasing water transport efficiency pipe colonization is a gradual process that reduces the effective diameter of the pipe and increases its roughness if the infestation is not controlled the conveyance capacity of the network reduces and mussels can completely block the system preventing irrigation the two major problems of the recently modernized irrigation systems identified by the farmers in the raa project are electricity cost and zebra mussel colonization morales hernández et al 2018 a dense network of canals and small water derivations connect the natural water bodies and reservoirs with the irrigated areas of a large part of the spanish irrigated land this particularity has facilitated and accelerated dispersion of zebra mussels as compared with other countries araujo 2006 the effect of zebra mussel colonization of pipes can be compared to the accumulation of suspended particles on the inside wall of aged pipes the roughness of the inner pipe wall affects the pressure drop of a fluid flowing through that pipe this additional roughness can be hydraulically described as a constriction of the flow area and as an increase of the wall shear stress kandlikar et al 2005 collective irrigation networks are more likely to be colonized than on farm irrigation networks since the former are closer to the infested water bodies however if the infestation of collective pipelines is not controlled the on farm network can be colonized too the early detection of zebra mussel adults and shells in collective pressurized irrigation networks is a complex experimental problem most pipelines are buried in agricultural fields so it is necessary to rely on indirect measurements of zebra mussel presence and on hydraulic simulations key elements of these networks include pipelines hydrants points of water delivery to farms and often pumping stations responding to water demand at the hydrants hydrants are usually accessible for hydraulic measurements the combination of sensors and hydraulic simulation has been successfully applied in the past to other problems such as monitoring water leaks pérez et al 2011 abdulshaheed et al 2017 and pressurized network calibration walski 2000 2004 kumar et al 2010 this methodology was recently used to introduce the concept of normalized pressure in the context of zebra mussel infestation of collective irrigation networks morales hernández et al 2018 normalized pressure was defined as the difference between simulated and measured pressure at a certain point of a given irrigation network the difference could be related to the presence of zebra mussels obstructing water flow the method was validated by morales hernández et al 2018 using two different test cases a discrete chemical treatment and the analysis of three years of telemetry pressure data in three remotely controlled hydrants in a collective irrigation network a period without hydrant openings or closings is a stationary period these periods minimize measurement uncertainties since changes in flow velocity and pressure are not expected hydraulic pipe simulators such as epanet rossman 2000 can obtain adequate results under these conditions providing a complete characterization of the network morales hernández et al 2018 however errors resulting from incorrect network characterization such as the length diameter and roughness of each pipeline are carried over thorough the numerical simulations such errors can prevent the extraction of adequate conclusions uncertainties related with the network characterization and the hydraulic measurements require optimization methods to minimize errors in the estimation of parameters such as roughness two main optimization method families can be distinguished derivative free search algorithms mugunthan et al 2005 and gradient based methods chaparro et al 2008 although the latter set of methods could be more efficient for smooth function errors because they can obtain the optimal value they require the gradient to perform the optimization that is the variation of the objective function with respect to the controlled variable obtaining the gradient can be complex when dealing with an external software on the other hand derivative free algorithms are usually able to detect the optimal interval in the global solution space at the extra cost of large computational burden and low efficiency since an extensive number of function evaluations is required some of the most popular optimization methods are included in nlopt johnson 2017 a set of free open source libraries for nonlinear optimization the optimization subroutines are implemented in different languages so they can be called from c fortran or matlab among others the bobyqa algorithm powell 2009 with a classical least squares objective function is an interesting optimization subroutine since its supports local optimization subject to bounds on the variables chemical treatments are the most effective control measures for agricultural irrigation networks waller and fisher 1998 paterson earth and water consulting 2018 morales hernández et al 2018 chemicals are required that are effective fast and have minimum environmental impact and cost the local conditions water quality quantity irrigation network environmental constrains and infestation level should always be considered when selecting a chemical treatment early detection and location of colonized areas within the network will reduce the economic and environmental cost of the chemical treatment the aim of this research was to progress in the development of the normalized pressure method for the early detection and location of zebra mussel infestation in irrigation network pipelines the following specific objectives were set 1 to characterize and minimize experimental data error in water pressure measurement 2 to explore different optimization methods to obtain roughness estimates at different observation points in a collective pressurized network 3 to apply the normalized pressure method to a complete collective irrigation network focusing on the spatial characterization of roughness and 4 to estimate the infestation level by assigning the estimated roughness values to a proxy of infestation in experimental pipelines 2 materials and methods 2 1 normalized pressure and network discharge the hydraulic simulation required to determine normalized pressure should consider the condition of the network at the measurement time and location since network hydraulics periodically change with the opening and closing of hydrant valves normalized pressure is only meaningful when stationary periods of network operation are considered irrigation telemetry and remote control tm rc systems are frequently installed in the modern irrigation networks of spain playán et al 2018 such systems can produce the data required to identify stationary periods in a time series of network operation data pressure can be simulated throughout the pipelines of collective irrigation networks using a hydraulic piping network software such as epanet rossman 2000 an adequate characterization of pipeline diameters lengths and roughness as well as the elevation of nodal points is required for adequate simulation pressure measurements can be experimentally obtained using pressure transducers installed at specific network points usually the network hydrants morales hernández et al 2018 used normalized pressure to identify the presence of zebra mussels adult or shells in a pipe high and positive values of normalized pressure indicate infestation while values close to zero suggest that the pipe is essentially clean of mussels this rule is based on the concept of head loss in hydraulic modeling when simulated pressure exceeds measured pressure head losses are underestimated in the simulation total pressure losses h f can be characterized by the friction factor f dimensionless using the darcy weisbach eq 1 where l is the pipeline length d the diameter v the flow velocity and g the gravitational acceleration 1 h f f l d v 2 2 g the empirical colebrook white equation expresses the darcy friction factor f as a function of reynolds number re the pipe hydraulic diameter d h and the absolute roughness coefficient ε c 2 1 f 2 log ε c 3 7 d h 2 54 re f therefore it is feasible to predict in a qualitative way the behavior of normalized pressure p n in a pipeline with respect to discharge in the case of choosing the correct absolute roughness coefficient ε c an overestimated ε o or an underestimated ε u value the effect on normalized pressure of the selected coefficients as a function of discharge is presented in fig 1 as observed in the case of an adequate estimation of the absolute roughness coefficient p n should remain invariant the difference between simulated and measured pressure is discharge independent when an overestimated absolute roughness coefficient is used p n will decrease its value as discharge increases conversely p n will increase with discharge when an underestimated value of the absolute roughness coefficient is used it is worth remarking that the influence of the roughness factor is negligible for low discharge values indeed the three normalized pressure curves tend to the same value δ for q 0 i e when the system becomes hydrostatic this theoretical analysis referred to a pipeline can be extrapolated to a network composed by several pipelines and a number of pressure observation points since normalized pressure is only valid for networks in which the demand at all hydrants is known the total discharge delivery q d understood as the sum of all hydrant demands can be considered as a representative variable of the hydraulic network 2 2 la violada network almudévar water users association the almudévar water users association al wua with a total extension of 3744 ha is located in the central ebro river valley fig 2a and in the northwest part of the riegos del alto aragón project fig 2b this wua was modernized from surface to pressurized irrigation typically sprinkler irrigation solid sets between 2008 and 2010 al wua has five independent irrigation networks each one including a pumping station a reservoir and a tm rc system with the capacity to issue hydrant valves and farm sector valves opening and closing orders and registering hydrant discharge one of the irrigation networks called la violada covers an irrigated area of 1400 ha fig 2c this network was used to develop and validate the method presented in this paper the information provided by the tm rc database was used to identify stationary periods of network operation ten pressure transducers were installed at hydrants h226 h234 h241 h243 h249 h256 h260 h261 h264 and h275 fig 2c transducers were strategically located following the identification by the al wua management of network branches suffering from intense zebra mussel infestation pressure monitoring covered an irrigation campaign from june to mid october 2017 two types of hydrants can be distinguished in the network transport and service hydrants a transport hydrant not only gives service to one or several farms but its upstream and downstream pipelines convey a large amount of water to supply distant irrigated areas hydrants h226 h256 or h261 exemplify transport hydrants hydrants located near the end of network branches carry a low flow discharge though their upstream and downstream pipelines if any h241 h249 or h275 are examples of service hydrants 2 3 minimizing data uncertainties the quality of measured and simulated pressure data requires some discussion there are different sources of uncertainty that need to be controlled to obtain adequate results from the proposed method a non infested network should have a constant zero value of normalized pressure any non zero value of δ fig 1 implies an error in pressure measurement and or a deficient hydraulic characterization of the network the pressure transducers used in this research model dickson pr325 had a manufacturer accuracy of 1 all sensors were verified at the laboratory before their installation in the field a high precision pressure measurement instrument model wika pch6400 was used for this verification devices with measurement errors exceeding the manufacturer specifications were rejected devices showing small deviations were assigned an ad hoc calibration curve pressure transducers were installed at the hydrant points fig 2c at certain elevation from the underground pipeline network the installation height of each pressure transducer was considered when comparing measured and simulated pressure at each observation point pressure transducers were equipped with a data logger programed to record pressure every minute data were periodically downloaded to a database network characterization can also be a relevant source of error when assessing normalized pressure information about pipeline length diameter and roughness was obtained from the construction project report an absolute roughness coefficient of 0 01 mm was initially used in all pipelines regardless of its material diameter and installation the location and elevation of all hydrants was corrected from the original project using altimetry data obtained with a high precision gps receiver model gs15 receiver leyca geosystems ag heerbrugg switzerland gps measurements were corrected in real time rtk using the permanent network of active geodesy of the aragón region of spain ensuring elevation errors lower than 0 02 m morales hernández et al 2018 the information about the discharge demand of each hydrant was not always complete at the tm rc system in those cases the nominal hydrant discharge obtained from the construction project report was considered a pumping station is used to pressurize la violada irrigation network variable frequency drives installed in the three pumps adjust flow and pressure to the actual water demand these adjustments produce pressure oscillations that propagate through the network a pressure transducer installed just downstream of the pumping station provide measurements every minute that are logged by the tm rc scada pressure at this location was used as inflow boundary condition for the hydraulic simulation of the network the data series was filtered using a minimum stationary period duration of 10 min in morales hernández et al 2018 a stationary period of 20 min was selected as a balance between computing time and accuracy however the choice of 10 min was more convenient in this work to provide a larger number of periods for the analysis of normalized pressure as well as to increase accuracy leaving aside the computational burden the tm rc database provided the hydrant configuration at the stationary periods and the pressure transducers installed at the network hydrants supplied pressure observations these data should be synchronized and validated for simulation purposes in order to select adequate stationary periods the quality of pressure measurements at the pumping station was assessed three accuracy levels u1 u2 and u3 were defined according to their standard deviation σ p kpa as reported in eq 3 3 u σ p u 3 σ p 2 u 2 2 σ p 5 u 1 σ p 5 quality assessment was also applied to data measured at the hydrants using the pressure transducers given the frequency of pressure transducer data recording a minimum of 10 pressure measurements were acquired at each stationary period since normalized pressure is determined using a unique pressure observation an arithmetic mean was computed finally the computed normalized pressure for each hydrant and stationary period was screened to eliminate outliers fig 3a shows a conceptual plot of normalized pressure pn at hydrant i against the network discharge delivery qd to identify outliers qd was discretized in ranges and the mean normalized pressure was computed for each range any data point exceeding plus minus two standard deviations was considered as an outlier in this work the discharge discretization interval was 200 l s 1 fig 3b presents the mean continuous line and the range of pn discontinuous line as well as the outliers cross symbols for each discretized value of qd in the analyzed hydrant 2 4 optimization normalized pressure was computed for each stationary period at each monitored hydrant the following step in data analysis was to determine optimum values of roughness of the simulated pipes that make normalized pressure constant for different values of qd optimization procedures were thus applied to obtain estimates of absolute roughness values for each pipe and each stationary period note that there is a direct relationship between monitored hydrants and estimated roughness values in this framework pipes serving a large number of monitored hydrants will achieve more reliable roughness estimates than pipes serving few monitored hydrants such as the north part of the piping network in fig 2c the determination of the optimum number of monitored locations given a certain network topology is an important issue but it is out of the scope of this research work the nature of this optimization is complex since iterations are required over the roughness coefficient of several pipelines multi dimensional satisfying the value of normalized pressure p n at different hydrants multi objective and for different total discharge deliveries q d multi scenario the following constraints were imposed to the optimization problem and its solution 1 the initial configuration of the network was defined by a constant roughness value of 0 01 mm for all pipelines 2 a discharge constant p n is sought at each measured hydrant 3 the range of the absolute roughness is 0 001 100 mm 4 the derivative free optimization algorithm bobyqa powell 2009 was used different objective functions and topology strategies were analyzed in this research 2 4 1 objective functions in optimization problems the definition of an adequate objective function is the key to quick convergence to an appropriate solution the general multi objective optimization problem can be formulated via the minimization of the sum of different functions f i f i p n i with different weights ω i as follows 4 min i n f i 2 ω i where i 1 n being n the number of measured hydrants in this work homogeneous weights ω i 1 n were adopted as previously discussed an intercept in the discharge normalized pressure curve may exist due to experimental errors and assumptions fig 1 this intercept δ i can be different for each measured hydrant i three different types of functions f i were considered in this work leading to three different objective functions 2 4 1 1 quasi hydrostatic pressure this method consists in computing the intercept δ i as the average of p n i when q d is low less than 50 l s 1 this corresponds to a quasi hydrostatic network status once δ i is determined by an arithmetic mean the function f i is defined as follows 5 f i p n δ i 2 4 1 2 quadratic regression the computation of the intercept δ i in this method is based on fitting a quadratic regression without the linear term the independent variable is q d while the dependent variable is normalized pressure at hydrant i p n i 6 p n i q d a i q d 2 δ i the function f i is built using eq 5 as in the quasi hydrostatic case 2 4 1 3 null slope the function f i corresponds to the slope of normalized pressure with respect to network discharge it is computed as follows 7 f i j 1 m q d j q d p i n p n i j 1 m q d j q d 2 where m is the number of total steady configurations of the network to be analyzed and q d and p n i are the mean discharges and normalized pressures respectively 2 4 2 network topology the number of dimensions or parameters to be optimized is a key factor to the optimization problem it governs not only the number of iterations of the optimization procedure and consequently the computational time but also the accuracy and unicity of the results making the number of dimensions equal to the number of pipelines in the network would be the best option but the computational time would be unaffordable la violada network has 146 different pipes in order to determine the number of dimensions it is important to match the density of input data and results and to use reasonable computation times three levels of accuracy were proposed in this work by establishing zones grouping a number of pipelines the network was divided in different zones whose pipelines will have the same absolute roughness coefficient fig 4 shows the network zones corresponding to the three optimization scenarios used in this research three zones fig 4a five zones fig 4b and eleven zones fig 4c two zones remain the same in all three scenarios zone 1 and zone 2 zone 1 corresponds to the north side of the network while zone 2 corresponds to the pipelines located near the reservoir and the pumping station zone 1 red pipes in fig 4a 4c was kept invariable because no pressure measurements were available in this network area and optimization could not be performed the south area of the network green pipes in fig 4a has the largest number of pressure measurements and was discretized in one three and nine zones in the three optimization scenarios respectively a sensitivity analysis was performed for the first optimization scenario three zones fig 4a to assess the influence of each zone on the results and the uncertainty and or robustness of the solution the baseline roughness extracted from a previous optimization lower limit upper limit and size step values used in each zone are presented in table 1 2 5 from pipe absolute roughness to level of infestation experimental measurements of head losses were performed at a certified laboratory central laboratory for irrigation equipment and materials testing une en iso iec 17 025 for a pipe under different levels of obstacles to flow in its cross sectional area obstacles were used as a proxy of the zebra mussel colonies established in a similar pipeline a pvc pipe of dn200 and 16 atmospheres inner diameter of 170 4 mm was used in the experiment this diameter was adequate for laboratory measurements and is within the small range of diameters used in pressurized irrigation networks the laboratory can analyze head losses in pipe diameters dn200 dn250 and dn300 the measurement accuracy of pressure readings is 0 25 the length of the analyzed pipe was 1 1 m adequate for the laboratory monitoring equipment to simulate zebra mussel effects on pipeline head losses screws were inserted at different distances and to different depths distance between screws of the same circular crown xd distance between circular crowns xl fig 5a and depths xh fig 5b fig 5a and 5b present the longitudinal and cross sectional profiles of the experimental pipe the values of the parameters defining the experimental conditions presented in fig 5 are summarized in table 2 two spacings between screws 29 9 mm 52 4 mm and 59 8 mm 104 8 mm xd x xl respectively and four screw depths inside the pipes xh 0 20 30 and 40 mm were tested in general for each pipe configuration five discharges were evaluated table 2 head losses were obtained for each condition the darcy weisbach equation eq 1 and colebrook implicit equation eq 2 were used to determine absolute roughness 3 results the proposed methodology was applied to la violada network during the 2017 irrigation season the al wua tm rc database provided 13 499 irrigation records from february 23 to december 30 pressure transducers were installed at the hydrant points during the last week of may and were removed at the end of november pumping pressure data were available throughout the irrigation season the location and elevation of the 105 hydrants were measured and the built project data was updated accordingly the network length totalized 31 655 m organized in 147 pipe sections with diameters ranging from 144 mm to 1176 mm and with lengths ranging from 5 m to 1120 m 3 1 data filtering data from june 1st to november 30th were processed during this time 3875 stationary periods larger than 10 min were identified in the tm rc database regarding the stability of pressure at the pumping station 305 periods were classified as u1 268 as u2 and 3302 as u3 85 of total the most exigent accuracy level u3 was selected because it provided an adequate accuracy and did not drastically reduce the number of stationary periods the total number of pressure measurements at each hydrant ranged from 200 943 at h249 to 219 682 at h261 particularly among all the stationary periods the available measured data ranged from 89 for h249 to 100 for h226 the screening of normalized pressure data permitted to eliminate outliers at each hydrant the number of outliers ranged from 2 at hydrant h256 to 5 at hydrant h241 with a mean of 3 among all hydrants note that this process makes that some stationary periods do not have pressure information at all hydrants at all time steps however only 1 of the stationary cases were finally discarded as they had less than 3 valid hydrant normalized pressure values as a result a total number of 3269 stationary cases were used in this study 3 2 optimization the proposed optimization methods quasi hydrostatic quadratic regression and null slope were applied to the three scenarios 3 5 and 11 zones fig 6 presents the standard deviation of normalized pressure for the nine combinations and for the original non optimized situation i e with a constant roughness value of 0 01 mm for all pipes in general the largest variability corresponds to the most distant hydrant and the lowest to the closest hydrant to the network inlet the improvement of all optimizations respect to the original situation is important at h241 reduction form 18 kpa to 10 kpa and h243 reduction from 16 kpa to 8 kpa non relevant at h249 fig 6 and average at the rest of hydrants based on the standard deviation analysis the quadratic regression optimization method was the most efficient in 6 out of the 10 hydrants h234 h260 h264 and h275 applied to the 11 zone scenario and h226 and h241 for the 3 zone scenario conversely the null slope method obtained the lowest standard deviation in h243 and h261 for the 3 zone configuration and in h249 for the 11 zone configuration the quasi hydrostatic method was preferred for hydrant h256 note that the differences between the methods were usually in the order of 0 1 kpa in the standard deviation consequently the different combinations of optimization method and zoning scenario had small implications on the standard deviation of normalized pressure only at h249 the 11 zones scenario showed lower standard deviation of pn than the other two scenarios with no differences between optimization methods the standard deviation achieved after optimization was lower or equal to 10 kpa for all measurement hydrants the values of the intercept at the different hydrants δi for both quasi hydrostatic and quadratic regression optimization methods see eqs 5 and 6 respectively are displayed in table 3 values ranged from 8 4 kpa at hydrant h275 for the quadratic regression method to 51 8 kpa at hydrant h249 for both optimization methods the difference between the intercepts in absolute value computed by one or the other method is at most 1 5 kpa fig 7 illustrates the comparison between the original values of normalized pressure and the optimized pn obtained with the best combination of optimization method and zoning scenario for four hydrants the selected hydrants are h226 the closest to the pumping station fig 7a h243 with one of the largest dispersions of normalized pressure standard deviation of 16 kpa fig 7b h249 with the largest variability between optimization methods and no relevant improvements respect to the non optimized situation fig 7c and h256 with one of the lowest dispersions of pn fig 7d hydrants with high dispersion on the original data maintain relevant dispersion after the optimization process h243 fig 7b however the standard deviation was reduced to half of the original value the optimization process provides the values of absolute roughness for each zone and optimization method fig 8 for example for the 3 zone scenario fig 8a the values of roughness strongly depend on the optimization method for zone 1 values from 0 02 mm for the quadratic regression to 0 70 mm for quasi hydrostatic but show small differences for zones 2 and 3 this is particularly true for the quasi hydrostatic and quadratic regression methods which provide excellent agreement for zones 2 25 mm and 3 0 30 mm the dependence on the optimization method for zone 1 relies on the lack of measurement points in this zone the maps of the absolute roughness of the pipes for the 3 zone fig 9a 5 zone fig 9b and 11 zone fig 9c scenarios for the quasi hydrostatic optimization method provide the estimated spatial distribution of the roughness coefficient in a qualitative basis the highest the roughness the highest the zebra mussel colonization of the pipeline zones 1 and 2 account for the same set of pipelines in the three sectoring scenarios fig 4 however the optimized roughness values changed with the zoning scenario for zone 1 and remained almost constant for zone 2 zone 1 presented lower roughness in the 3 zone scenario 0 02 0 70 mm fig 8a than for the other scenarios 5 zones 1 1 11 mm figs 8b and 11 zones 0 50 50 mm fig 8c zone 1 had no measurement devices so roughness changes in this zone will not affect measurements only pipes with upstream downstream pressure measurements can be optimized since changes in their roughness will affect these measures zone 2 corresponds to the network inlet this is the shortest zone with the largest pipeline diameters and only has one measurement point located at its downstream end h226 this zone has the largest roughness coefficient values for any of the studied configurations fig 8 roughness values ranging between 25 and 30 mm are quite similar among optimization methods and zoning scenarios the average normalized pressure of its measurement point was the lowest of all monitored points 9 9 kpa fig 7a although the pipeline diameter is the largest 1 176 mm the same level of zebra mussel infestation will provide smaller normalized pressures in large pipelines than in small pipelines this can explain why the lowest normalized pressure resulted in the highest estimated roughness coefficient zone 2 was the most affected by zebra mussel colonization in all the analyzed conditions the southern part of the network has nine measurement points and was divided in 1 3 or 9 zones zone 3 was quite similar for the 5 zone and 11 zone scenarios and attained similar roughness in both scenarios roughness variability in this zone from 0 02 to 0 30 mm depends on the optimization method zone 4 of the 5 zone scenario which was divided in zones 4 5 and 6 in the 11 zone scenario resulted in moderate roughness values lower than 1 mm zone 8 of the 11 zone scenario is an end of network branch fig 4c that delivers water to four hydrants and includes measurement point h249 this zone has the lowest value of optimized roughness 0 001 mm fig 8c and 9c indicating that zebra mussel infestation is low the measurement point of this zone h249 showed the largest values of intercept in the normalized pressure 51 8 kpa fig 7c and had one of the smallest pipeline diameters 181 mm the large value of the intercept introduced uncertainty that could explain the low value of roughness coefficient in addition the small pipe diameter could explain why the highest normalized pressure provided the lowest value of roughness however the optimization process is a mathematical instrument to adjust data which does not necessarily provide unique solutions 3 3 sensitivity analysis to characterize the robustness of the optimization method and to justify the variability of the results for zone 1 a sensitivity analysis was performed for each of the zones for the quasi hydrostatic method applied to the 3 zones scenario the error e was computed following eq 8 and the sensitivity φ eq 9 8 e 1 n m i 1 n j 1 m p n i δ i j 9 φ e i 1 e i 1 2 e i 1 e i ε i 1 ε i 1 2 ε i 1 ε i where φ is the sensitivity ε is the absolute roughness value e is the error m is the number of total steady configurations of the network and n the number of measurement points fig 10 shows a scatter plot between values of roughness for each of the three zones zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 fig 10a b and c respectively versus sensitivity right axis and error left axis zone 1 has a sensitivity equal to zero fig 10a corroborating that zone 1 has no influence on the results the error remains constant independently of the roughness value the absence of pressure measurements inside the zone to adjust roughness values results in any value providing similar results in order to provide sensitivity to this area observation points should be added the sensitivity of zone 2 fig 10b is lower than that of zone 3 fig 10c note the x axis scale a small change in the roughness coefficient of zone 2 has much less influence on the results than the same change in zone 3 in both areas sensitivity increases as we move away from the optimal solution minimum error but at different rates again the larger number of measurement points in zone 3 9 points compared with those of zone 2 on point can explain the different sensitivity to assess the combined effect of the selected values between zones 2 and 3 a combined error analysis is presented in fig 11 there is a wide strip of values in which the result of optimization becomes very similar showing a similar error values of roughness between 16 and 34 mm for zone 2 and between 0 30 and 0 60 mm for zone 3 provide similar error values a zoom in this strip of error values is presented in fig 11b the error scale ranges from 35 to 80 at fig 11a and from 33 5 to 36 at fig 11b the sensitivity analysis of the optimization algorithm led to the global minimum consequently the optimization method provided robust and consistent solutions table 4 shows the results of computational time and number of iterations for each configuration as the number of dimensions increased the calculation time and the number of iterations required for convergence increased however there were no notable differences between optimization methods considering the same number of discretization zones the computing time of the proposed algorithm for zebra mussel infestation assessment is affordable and the number of observations and zones can be increased without compromising its practical application 3 4 from absolute roughness to zebra mussel infestation level the total number of experimental measurements of head losses at the laboratory was 35 the different screw configurations inside the pipe were translated to occupied cross sectional area in percentage considering the diameter of the screw the distance between them and the depth into the pipe the experiment performed with the maximum number of screws inserted at its maximum depth occupied 29 5 of the total pipe cross sectional area and was considered as representative of an extremely high colonization the infestation levels proposed in this study were based on the cross sectional area occupied by the screws extremely high 25 very high from 20 to 25 high from 15 to 20 medium from 10 to 15 medium low from 5 to 10 and low from 0 to 5 fig 12a presents the roughness coefficient experimentally obtained as a function of the cross sectional area occupied by the screws in the ranges of the infestation levels are also presented in the upper part of the figure error bars represent the experimental variability of absolute roughness for the different values of discharge measured at each screw configuration table 2 in general the variability of the roughness coefficient increased with the infestation level for the same infestation level the lower the discharge the larger the roughness coefficient the measurement performed with no screws resulted in low roughness values ranging from 0 0013 to 0 002 mm for the lowest and the highest discharge respectively with an average of 0 0016 mm this average value is in the range proposed by manufacturers for pvc or other plastic pipes 0 0015 0 007 mm and will be considered as the upper roughness limit for infestation free pipes as the area occupied by screws grows absolute roughness increases reaching extremely high values averaging 118 6 mm for the most occupied section area a second grade polynomic equation was adjusted to fit the average values of absolute roughness as the useful section decreases fig 12a the model is representative of the analyzed pipe dn200 and dinner 170 4 mm its applicability to other diameters has not been tested la violada network has 32 of its pipes similar in diameter to the one used in this experiment around 65 of the pipes are smaller in diameter than dn300 mm and only 2 of the pipes have diameters exceeding 1000 mm several authors have indicated that with decreasing diameters the relative importance of pipe surface roughness increases kandlikar et al 2005 taylor et al 2006 experiments with other diameters would be required to extend the obtained results to the rest of pipe sections in the network the laboratory cannot evaluate the largest diameters present in the experimental network in the moody diagram moody 1944 the graphic form of the colebrook s equation the friction factor increases with reynolds number and asymptotically reaches a constant value at high reynolds numbers this relationship changes with the relative roughness the values of relative roughness ε d presented in this diagram ranged from 0 to 0 05 fig 12b presents an extension of the moody diagram for a larger range of relative roughness from 9 6e 06 0 6962 as measured at the laboratory the laminar to turbulent transition occurs at lower reynolds numbers as the relative roughness increases fig 12b as an exploratory exercise the values of absolute roughness obtained for each zone with the proposed method fig 9 were transformed to infestation level following the adjusted model presented in fig 12a for the 3 zone and 5 zone scenarios 94 5 of the total pipes have a low infestation level and the other 5 5 have a moderate low infestation level the 11 zone scenario showed different percentage of the infestation levels with 2 8 of infestation free pipes 80 9 of low infected pipes and 16 3 of moderate low infected pipes regarding the validity of the relationship between absolute roughness and infestation level pipes with the largest diameter of the network 3 pipes of 1176 mm were classified as moderate low infected in the three scenarios the largest infestation level of the network classification this level of infestation of the large pipes should be carefully considered because of the previously discussed upscaling problems 4 discussion zebra mussel has a strong capacity to block large pipes and to colonize pressurized collective irrigation networks the normalized pressure method has been applied in this study to determine the infestation level of zebra mussels in network pipes the quality of measured and simulated pressure data is critical to the applicability of the pn method de schaetzen et al 2000 and kumar et al 2010 reported that measurement points should be selected as the most sensitive to changes in pipe roughness parameters in this work the measurement points were those identified by the district manager as the most problematic for zebra mussel consequently these were the most likely to change the roughness of the underlying pipes walski 2000 indicated that data quality is an important and commonly ignored issue during calibration appropriate data are collected when there is sufficient head loss larger than the measurement error to draw valid conclusions the uncertainty of data measurements at specific nodes and at the network inlet can be minimized by ensuring a low standard deviation of the measurements during the stationary periods bezerra et al 2017 working on roughness calibration of piping networks with hydraulic simulation modeling indicated that an adequate layout of the nodes with known pressures was more important than a large number of pressure measurements to follow this recommendation the location and elevation of all hydrants from the original project was revised using altimetry data obtained with a high precision gps receiver even then an important uncertainty in irrigation network hydraulic characteristics was identified in variable δ of the normalized pressure method the method keeps this variable constant excluding this uncertainty from the determination of pn the selected approach for comparing observed and simulated nodal pressure and for adjusting the friction coefficients of pipes to obtain an acceptable tolerance of error resulted adequate to determine the infestation level of zebra mussel in pipes most efforts towards model calibration have been undertaken by adjusting roughness coefficients alone the reduction in pipe diameter has often been neglected boxall et al 2004 this simplification has often been found to adequately predict pressure distribution and flow balance at each node in the system walski 2004 however the representation of the flow paths and velocity distribution may not be well predicted many water quality problems including disinfectant decay hallam et al 2002 clark and haught 2005 disinfection by product formation and taste and odor problems have been associated with the residence time of water in distribution systems christensen and barfuss 2009 this approach is also necessary when applied at mini and micro pipes where the relative size of the roughness with respect to the pipe diameter grows dramatically taylor et al 2006 in this study neither the velocity nor the micro pipes are relevant the simultaneous calibration of roughness and diameter reduction would strongly increase the number of unknowns to estimate the roughness coefficient of each pipeline in the network the pn method applied to stationary states was used together with an optimization algorithm that minimized an objective function three different objective functions were compared based on different hydraulic assumptions the multi variable problem of finding the optimum value for all the pipelines in the network and for each different steady configuration would require unmanageable experimental and computational resources therefore three different cluster scenarios were designed including 3 5 and 11 zones kumar et al 2010 proposed a practical methodology for large networks based on a clustering algorithm for automatically grouping the pipes having similar roughness characteristics into one zone the principles of this method were applied in this research the uncertainty about the location and level of infestation of the different pipes was overcome by the analysis of different grouping scenarios for the study network the absolute roughness of plastic pipes seems to vary substantially according to the type of plastic or the pipe condition diogo and vilela 2014 even if the absolute roughness was detected relatively small in some tested pipes it appears to have an important role in the resistance law this may be relevant mainly for large sections and large lengths frequently requiring precise calculations in practical applications and or for relatively high reynolds numbers the moody diagram provides values of friction for relative roughness between 0 and 0 05 higher values of relative roughness are expected for moderately to high infested pipes by zebra mussel other applications of flows in small diameters such as high heat flux cooling microfluidics and biological application kandlikar et al 2005 will also require high values of relative roughness experiments have been performed in this research to extend the roughness ranges to 0 6962 however experiments were only performed for a dn200 mm diameter under turbulent flow results should be carefully upscaled for larger diameters further research in this line will include more measurement points at the piping network and several seasons of data sets the comparison between seasons will determine if the infestation pattern depends on structural fixed or and on seasonal variable characteristics it would also be interesting to discriminate between the effects of mussel settlement inside the pipes and the accumulation of dead and detached shells mussel settlement has been analyzed in this research a process expected to induce gradual head loss increase according to the network managers the second process results in a sudden head drop that has not been analyzed in this study the proposed normalized pressure method requires intense data series that not always are available although tm rc systems have been widely installed in modernized irrigation networks since xxi century the data required to adequately apply the method are not easy to find playán et al 2018 in a study about tm rc systems installed in wuas in spain indicated that a large majority of the tm rc systems 85 are regularly used to improve water and energy management but only 25 of them exploit most of the potential capacities of the technology the development of applications based on tm rc technology such as the normalized pressure method will reinforce the use and success of both the technology and the method however in the short term the development of a simplified method replacing tm rc data by more commonly available irrigation network data constitutes a key challenge to control zebra mussel infestation 5 conclusions the normalized pressure method has been applied to a collective pressurized irrigation network telemetry and remote control data sets were available and pressure recorders were installed at specific hydrants the method permitted to characterize pipe roughness which was associated to zebra mussel settlement the application of the method underlined the importance of data quality quality data control procedures were proposed and applied to pressure data different objective functions were used for the optimization process providing similar estimations of pipe roughness the network zoning scenario had a major role on pipe roughness values the division of the network into zones of similar pipe absolute roughness should be performed taking into account the existence of sufficient pressure measurement points the optimized pipe absolute roughness values summarizes the effect of section constriction and the increase on wall shear stress no attempt was made to separate both effects in view of the limited availability of experimental data the method permitted to establish different values of pipe absolute roughness for the analyzed network zones the values of pipe roughness were tentatively classified in six infestation levels based on laboratory experiments the well established hydraulic principles used in this research contribute to the validity of the results namely of the capacity of the normalized pressure method to map zebra mussel infestation in the pipelines of a collective irrigation network the ultimate validation of the process would require a forensic approach extracting pipelines to verify their infestation level a practice that is not possible in real irrigation networks intensive research on this methodology more density of observation points several irrigation campaigns would permit to take a decisive step in its application decision making on management practices and chemical treatments observing the evolution of infestation in network zones and establishing cost efficient thresholds protecting network operability would lead to informed decision making about chemical treatments applied to the complete network or to parts of it continuous monitoring of normalized pressure would permit to separate the effects of mussels and those of dead shells ideally predicting the accumulation of shells following a

9793,the impact of zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha colonization on pressurized irrigation systems is becoming important in many areas of the world if the infestation is not controlled the conveyance capacity of the network reduces and mussels can completely block the system preventing irrigation a methodology to assess zebra mussel infestation in collective pressurized networks based on monitorization and hydraulic simulation is developed in this research normalized pressure defined as the difference between simulated and measured pressure is an indicator of the presence of zebra mussels morales hernández et al 2018 when this variable is combined with the distributed discharge of the irrigation network it is possible to use an optimization procedure to produce a roughness map of network pipelines roughness in excess of that characteristic of the pipeline material can be directly associated zebra mussel infestation different objective functions optimization algorithms and strategies are proposed in this work with the aim of attaining constant discharge independent normalized pressure at each observation point in the network roughness values under different pipe conditions reproducing levels of zebra mussel infestation were experimentally obtained at a reference laboratory the limitations and uncertainties of the proposed methodology are discussed normalized pressure was validated in an irrigation network belonging to a water users association using continuous data recorded at different observation points during a complete irrigation campaign the non invasive hydraulic method has been designed to identify infested areas in real time and to optimize the chemical treatments controlling mussel development keywords dreissena polymorpha irrigation networks hydraulic simulation normalized pressure optimization pipe roughness 1 introduction zebra mussels dreissena polymorpha are causing extensive damage to hydraulic infrastructure as they reproduce inside water conduits and attach to many different types of surfaces severe problems have been reported in fluvial systems and lakes aldridge et al 2004 wimbush et al 2009 nakano and strayer 2014 olson et al 2018 morales et al 2019 catita et al 2020 but also in pressurized irrigation networks araujo et al 2006 morales hernández et al 2018 zebra mussel has become an important restriction for the management of pressurized collective irrigation networks supplied from colonized reservoirs rivers or canals the enormous volume of infested water the high reproductive rate the adaptation capacity of the species and the cost efficiency required for agricultural production make it very difficult to eradicate the mussel in these water bodies therefore control measures are required to reduce its impact the us geological survey set up a monitoring network to detect the presence of zebra mussel in many water bodies around the country benson et al 2021 reported that piping irrigation systems downstream an infested water body are very likely candidates for infestation in canada the alberta irrigation districts 704 k ha of irrigated land have recognized that the extensive irrigation network particularly the underground pipeline network could experience significant reductions in water conveyance capacity if invasive mussels colonize irrigation water supply reservoirs the government and the irrigation districts of the region are preventing the introduction of the species in irrigation water supply reservoirs and recommending control and eradication measures if zebra mussel eventually infest irrigation water supply canals pipelines and on farm irrigation systems paterson earth and water consulting 2018 in spain the ebro jucar segura and guadalquivir river basins authorities have reported several reservoirs colonized by zebra mussel supplying water to irrigation districts monitoring networks to detect and quantify infestation have been established the ebro river basin has the largest number of colonized reservoirs of the spanish territory che 2018 morales hernández et al 2018 reported that in riegos del alto aragón project raa 120 k ha of irrigated land in the ebro river basin reservoirs are colonized by zebra mussel as a consequence 66 of the irrigated area is infested these authors documented the extent of the zebra mussel dispersion from the colonized reservoir to the piping irrigation systems and the control measures adopted by the irrigation districts to control the species the physical conditions of irrigation reservoirs are adequate for mussel reproduction and growing araujo 2006 colonized reservoirs act as permanent source of larvae for downstream water bodies and irrigation systems intensive zebra mussel invasion of irrigation pipes has been found to occur mainly during the juvenile stage of planktonic veligers zhang et al 2017 veligers first move freely in the water at an age of 18 90 days veligers adhere to hard substrates roberts 1990 resulting in biofouling pipe clogging and decreasing water transport efficiency pipe colonization is a gradual process that reduces the effective diameter of the pipe and increases its roughness if the infestation is not controlled the conveyance capacity of the network reduces and mussels can completely block the system preventing irrigation the two major problems of the recently modernized irrigation systems identified by the farmers in the raa project are electricity cost and zebra mussel colonization morales hernández et al 2018 a dense network of canals and small water derivations connect the natural water bodies and reservoirs with the irrigated areas of a large part of the spanish irrigated land this particularity has facilitated and accelerated dispersion of zebra mussels as compared with other countries araujo 2006 the effect of zebra mussel colonization of pipes can be compared to the accumulation of suspended particles on the inside wall of aged pipes the roughness of the inner pipe wall affects the pressure drop of a fluid flowing through that pipe this additional roughness can be hydraulically described as a constriction of the flow area and as an increase of the wall shear stress kandlikar et al 2005 collective irrigation networks are more likely to be colonized than on farm irrigation networks since the former are closer to the infested water bodies however if the infestation of collective pipelines is not controlled the on farm network can be colonized too the early detection of zebra mussel adults and shells in collective pressurized irrigation networks is a complex experimental problem most pipelines are buried in agricultural fields so it is necessary to rely on indirect measurements of zebra mussel presence and on hydraulic simulations key elements of these networks include pipelines hydrants points of water delivery to farms and often pumping stations responding to water demand at the hydrants hydrants are usually accessible for hydraulic measurements the combination of sensors and hydraulic simulation has been successfully applied in the past to other problems such as monitoring water leaks pérez et al 2011 abdulshaheed et al 2017 and pressurized network calibration walski 2000 2004 kumar et al 2010 this methodology was recently used to introduce the concept of normalized pressure in the context of zebra mussel infestation of collective irrigation networks morales hernández et al 2018 normalized pressure was defined as the difference between simulated and measured pressure at a certain point of a given irrigation network the difference could be related to the presence of zebra mussels obstructing water flow the method was validated by morales hernández et al 2018 using two different test cases a discrete chemical treatment and the analysis of three years of telemetry pressure data in three remotely controlled hydrants in a collective irrigation network a period without hydrant openings or closings is a stationary period these periods minimize measurement uncertainties since changes in flow velocity and pressure are not expected hydraulic pipe simulators such as epanet rossman 2000 can obtain adequate results under these conditions providing a complete characterization of the network morales hernández et al 2018 however errors resulting from incorrect network characterization such as the length diameter and roughness of each pipeline are carried over thorough the numerical simulations such errors can prevent the extraction of adequate conclusions uncertainties related with the network characterization and the hydraulic measurements require optimization methods to minimize errors in the estimation of parameters such as roughness two main optimization method families can be distinguished derivative free search algorithms mugunthan et al 2005 and gradient based methods chaparro et al 2008 although the latter set of methods could be more efficient for smooth function errors because they can obtain the optimal value they require the gradient to perform the optimization that is the variation of the objective function with respect to the controlled variable obtaining the gradient can be complex when dealing with an external software on the other hand derivative free algorithms are usually able to detect the optimal interval in the global solution space at the extra cost of large computational burden and low efficiency since an extensive number of function evaluations is required some of the most popular optimization methods are included in nlopt johnson 2017 a set of free open source libraries for nonlinear optimization the optimization subroutines are implemented in different languages so they can be called from c fortran or matlab among others the bobyqa algorithm powell 2009 with a classical least squares objective function is an interesting optimization subroutine since its supports local optimization subject to bounds on the variables chemical treatments are the most effective control measures for agricultural irrigation networks waller and fisher 1998 paterson earth and water consulting 2018 morales hernández et al 2018 chemicals are required that are effective fast and have minimum environmental impact and cost the local conditions water quality quantity irrigation network environmental constrains and infestation level should always be considered when selecting a chemical treatment early detection and location of colonized areas within the network will reduce the economic and environmental cost of the chemical treatment the aim of this research was to progress in the development of the normalized pressure method for the early detection and location of zebra mussel infestation in irrigation network pipelines the following specific objectives were set 1 to characterize and minimize experimental data error in water pressure measurement 2 to explore different optimization methods to obtain roughness estimates at different observation points in a collective pressurized network 3 to apply the normalized pressure method to a complete collective irrigation network focusing on the spatial characterization of roughness and 4 to estimate the infestation level by assigning the estimated roughness values to a proxy of infestation in experimental pipelines 2 materials and methods 2 1 normalized pressure and network discharge the hydraulic simulation required to determine normalized pressure should consider the condition of the network at the measurement time and location since network hydraulics periodically change with the opening and closing of hydrant valves normalized pressure is only meaningful when stationary periods of network operation are considered irrigation telemetry and remote control tm rc systems are frequently installed in the modern irrigation networks of spain playán et al 2018 such systems can produce the data required to identify stationary periods in a time series of network operation data pressure can be simulated throughout the pipelines of collective irrigation networks using a hydraulic piping network software such as epanet rossman 2000 an adequate characterization of pipeline diameters lengths and roughness as well as the elevation of nodal points is required for adequate simulation pressure measurements can be experimentally obtained using pressure transducers installed at specific network points usually the network hydrants morales hernández et al 2018 used normalized pressure to identify the presence of zebra mussels adult or shells in a pipe high and positive values of normalized pressure indicate infestation while values close to zero suggest that the pipe is essentially clean of mussels this rule is based on the concept of head loss in hydraulic modeling when simulated pressure exceeds measured pressure head losses are underestimated in the simulation total pressure losses h f can be characterized by the friction factor f dimensionless using the darcy weisbach eq 1 where l is the pipeline length d the diameter v the flow velocity and g the gravitational acceleration 1 h f f l d v 2 2 g the empirical colebrook white equation expresses the darcy friction factor f as a function of reynolds number re the pipe hydraulic diameter d h and the absolute roughness coefficient ε c 2 1 f 2 log ε c 3 7 d h 2 54 re f therefore it is feasible to predict in a qualitative way the behavior of normalized pressure p n in a pipeline with respect to discharge in the case of choosing the correct absolute roughness coefficient ε c an overestimated ε o or an underestimated ε u value the effect on normalized pressure of the selected coefficients as a function of discharge is presented in fig 1 as observed in the case of an adequate estimation of the absolute roughness coefficient p n should remain invariant the difference between simulated and measured pressure is discharge independent when an overestimated absolute roughness coefficient is used p n will decrease its value as discharge increases conversely p n will increase with discharge when an underestimated value of the absolute roughness coefficient is used it is worth remarking that the influence of the roughness factor is negligible for low discharge values indeed the three normalized pressure curves tend to the same value δ for q 0 i e when the system becomes hydrostatic this theoretical analysis referred to a pipeline can be extrapolated to a network composed by several pipelines and a number of pressure observation points since normalized pressure is only valid for networks in which the demand at all hydrants is known the total discharge delivery q d understood as the sum of all hydrant demands can be considered as a representative variable of the hydraulic network 2 2 la violada network almudévar water users association the almudévar water users association al wua with a total extension of 3744 ha is located in the central ebro river valley fig 2a and in the northwest part of the riegos del alto aragón project fig 2b this wua was modernized from surface to pressurized irrigation typically sprinkler irrigation solid sets between 2008 and 2010 al wua has five independent irrigation networks each one including a pumping station a reservoir and a tm rc system with the capacity to issue hydrant valves and farm sector valves opening and closing orders and registering hydrant discharge one of the irrigation networks called la violada covers an irrigated area of 1400 ha fig 2c this network was used to develop and validate the method presented in this paper the information provided by the tm rc database was used to identify stationary periods of network operation ten pressure transducers were installed at hydrants h226 h234 h241 h243 h249 h256 h260 h261 h264 and h275 fig 2c transducers were strategically located following the identification by the al wua management of network branches suffering from intense zebra mussel infestation pressure monitoring covered an irrigation campaign from june to mid october 2017 two types of hydrants can be distinguished in the network transport and service hydrants a transport hydrant not only gives service to one or several farms but its upstream and downstream pipelines convey a large amount of water to supply distant irrigated areas hydrants h226 h256 or h261 exemplify transport hydrants hydrants located near the end of network branches carry a low flow discharge though their upstream and downstream pipelines if any h241 h249 or h275 are examples of service hydrants 2 3 minimizing data uncertainties the quality of measured and simulated pressure data requires some discussion there are different sources of uncertainty that need to be controlled to obtain adequate results from the proposed method a non infested network should have a constant zero value of normalized pressure any non zero value of δ fig 1 implies an error in pressure measurement and or a deficient hydraulic characterization of the network the pressure transducers used in this research model dickson pr325 had a manufacturer accuracy of 1 all sensors were verified at the laboratory before their installation in the field a high precision pressure measurement instrument model wika pch6400 was used for this verification devices with measurement errors exceeding the manufacturer specifications were rejected devices showing small deviations were assigned an ad hoc calibration curve pressure transducers were installed at the hydrant points fig 2c at certain elevation from the underground pipeline network the installation height of each pressure transducer was considered when comparing measured and simulated pressure at each observation point pressure transducers were equipped with a data logger programed to record pressure every minute data were periodically downloaded to a database network characterization can also be a relevant source of error when assessing normalized pressure information about pipeline length diameter and roughness was obtained from the construction project report an absolute roughness coefficient of 0 01 mm was initially used in all pipelines regardless of its material diameter and installation the location and elevation of all hydrants was corrected from the original project using altimetry data obtained with a high precision gps receiver model gs15 receiver leyca geosystems ag heerbrugg switzerland gps measurements were corrected in real time rtk using the permanent network of active geodesy of the aragón region of spain ensuring elevation errors lower than 0 02 m morales hernández et al 2018 the information about the discharge demand of each hydrant was not always complete at the tm rc system in those cases the nominal hydrant discharge obtained from the construction project report was considered a pumping station is used to pressurize la violada irrigation network variable frequency drives installed in the three pumps adjust flow and pressure to the actual water demand these adjustments produce pressure oscillations that propagate through the network a pressure transducer installed just downstream of the pumping station provide measurements every minute that are logged by the tm rc scada pressure at this location was used as inflow boundary condition for the hydraulic simulation of the network the data series was filtered using a minimum stationary period duration of 10 min in morales hernández et al 2018 a stationary period of 20 min was selected as a balance between computing time and accuracy however the choice of 10 min was more convenient in this work to provide a larger number of periods for the analysis of normalized pressure as well as to increase accuracy leaving aside the computational burden the tm rc database provided the hydrant configuration at the stationary periods and the pressure transducers installed at the network hydrants supplied pressure observations these data should be synchronized and validated for simulation purposes in order to select adequate stationary periods the quality of pressure measurements at the pumping station was assessed three accuracy levels u1 u2 and u3 were defined according to their standard deviation σ p kpa as reported in eq 3 3 u σ p u 3 σ p 2 u 2 2 σ p 5 u 1 σ p 5 quality assessment was also applied to data measured at the hydrants using the pressure transducers given the frequency of pressure transducer data recording a minimum of 10 pressure measurements were acquired at each stationary period since normalized pressure is determined using a unique pressure observation an arithmetic mean was computed finally the computed normalized pressure for each hydrant and stationary period was screened to eliminate outliers fig 3a shows a conceptual plot of normalized pressure pn at hydrant i against the network discharge delivery qd to identify outliers qd was discretized in ranges and the mean normalized pressure was computed for each range any data point exceeding plus minus two standard deviations was considered as an outlier in this work the discharge discretization interval was 200 l s 1 fig 3b presents the mean continuous line and the range of pn discontinuous line as well as the outliers cross symbols for each discretized value of qd in the analyzed hydrant 2 4 optimization normalized pressure was computed for each stationary period at each monitored hydrant the following step in data analysis was to determine optimum values of roughness of the simulated pipes that make normalized pressure constant for different values of qd optimization procedures were thus applied to obtain estimates of absolute roughness values for each pipe and each stationary period note that there is a direct relationship between monitored hydrants and estimated roughness values in this framework pipes serving a large number of monitored hydrants will achieve more reliable roughness estimates than pipes serving few monitored hydrants such as the north part of the piping network in fig 2c the determination of the optimum number of monitored locations given a certain network topology is an important issue but it is out of the scope of this research work the nature of this optimization is complex since iterations are required over the roughness coefficient of several pipelines multi dimensional satisfying the value of normalized pressure p n at different hydrants multi objective and for different total discharge deliveries q d multi scenario the following constraints were imposed to the optimization problem and its solution 1 the initial configuration of the network was defined by a constant roughness value of 0 01 mm for all pipelines 2 a discharge constant p n is sought at each measured hydrant 3 the range of the absolute roughness is 0 001 100 mm 4 the derivative free optimization algorithm bobyqa powell 2009 was used different objective functions and topology strategies were analyzed in this research 2 4 1 objective functions in optimization problems the definition of an adequate objective function is the key to quick convergence to an appropriate solution the general multi objective optimization problem can be formulated via the minimization of the sum of different functions f i f i p n i with different weights ω i as follows 4 min i n f i 2 ω i where i 1 n being n the number of measured hydrants in this work homogeneous weights ω i 1 n were adopted as previously discussed an intercept in the discharge normalized pressure curve may exist due to experimental errors and assumptions fig 1 this intercept δ i can be different for each measured hydrant i three different types of functions f i were considered in this work leading to three different objective functions 2 4 1 1 quasi hydrostatic pressure this method consists in computing the intercept δ i as the average of p n i when q d is low less than 50 l s 1 this corresponds to a quasi hydrostatic network status once δ i is determined by an arithmetic mean the function f i is defined as follows 5 f i p n δ i 2 4 1 2 quadratic regression the computation of the intercept δ i in this method is based on fitting a quadratic regression without the linear term the independent variable is q d while the dependent variable is normalized pressure at hydrant i p n i 6 p n i q d a i q d 2 δ i the function f i is built using eq 5 as in the quasi hydrostatic case 2 4 1 3 null slope the function f i corresponds to the slope of normalized pressure with respect to network discharge it is computed as follows 7 f i j 1 m q d j q d p i n p n i j 1 m q d j q d 2 where m is the number of total steady configurations of the network to be analyzed and q d and p n i are the mean discharges and normalized pressures respectively 2 4 2 network topology the number of dimensions or parameters to be optimized is a key factor to the optimization problem it governs not only the number of iterations of the optimization procedure and consequently the computational time but also the accuracy and unicity of the results making the number of dimensions equal to the number of pipelines in the network would be the best option but the computational time would be unaffordable la violada network has 146 different pipes in order to determine the number of dimensions it is important to match the density of input data and results and to use reasonable computation times three levels of accuracy were proposed in this work by establishing zones grouping a number of pipelines the network was divided in different zones whose pipelines will have the same absolute roughness coefficient fig 4 shows the network zones corresponding to the three optimization scenarios used in this research three zones fig 4a five zones fig 4b and eleven zones fig 4c two zones remain the same in all three scenarios zone 1 and zone 2 zone 1 corresponds to the north side of the network while zone 2 corresponds to the pipelines located near the reservoir and the pumping station zone 1 red pipes in fig 4a 4c was kept invariable because no pressure measurements were available in this network area and optimization could not be performed the south area of the network green pipes in fig 4a has the largest number of pressure measurements and was discretized in one three and nine zones in the three optimization scenarios respectively a sensitivity analysis was performed for the first optimization scenario three zones fig 4a to assess the influence of each zone on the results and the uncertainty and or robustness of the solution the baseline roughness extracted from a previous optimization lower limit upper limit and size step values used in each zone are presented in table 1 2 5 from pipe absolute roughness to level of infestation experimental measurements of head losses were performed at a certified laboratory central laboratory for irrigation equipment and materials testing une en iso iec 17 025 for a pipe under different levels of obstacles to flow in its cross sectional area obstacles were used as a proxy of the zebra mussel colonies established in a similar pipeline a pvc pipe of dn200 and 16 atmospheres inner diameter of 170 4 mm was used in the experiment this diameter was adequate for laboratory measurements and is within the small range of diameters used in pressurized irrigation networks the laboratory can analyze head losses in pipe diameters dn200 dn250 and dn300 the measurement accuracy of pressure readings is 0 25 the length of the analyzed pipe was 1 1 m adequate for the laboratory monitoring equipment to simulate zebra mussel effects on pipeline head losses screws were inserted at different distances and to different depths distance between screws of the same circular crown xd distance between circular crowns xl fig 5a and depths xh fig 5b fig 5a and 5b present the longitudinal and cross sectional profiles of the experimental pipe the values of the parameters defining the experimental conditions presented in fig 5 are summarized in table 2 two spacings between screws 29 9 mm 52 4 mm and 59 8 mm 104 8 mm xd x xl respectively and four screw depths inside the pipes xh 0 20 30 and 40 mm were tested in general for each pipe configuration five discharges were evaluated table 2 head losses were obtained for each condition the darcy weisbach equation eq 1 and colebrook implicit equation eq 2 were used to determine absolute roughness 3 results the proposed methodology was applied to la violada network during the 2017 irrigation season the al wua tm rc database provided 13 499 irrigation records from february 23 to december 30 pressure transducers were installed at the hydrant points during the last week of may and were removed at the end of november pumping pressure data were available throughout the irrigation season the location and elevation of the 105 hydrants were measured and the built project data was updated accordingly the network length totalized 31 655 m organized in 147 pipe sections with diameters ranging from 144 mm to 1176 mm and with lengths ranging from 5 m to 1120 m 3 1 data filtering data from june 1st to november 30th were processed during this time 3875 stationary periods larger than 10 min were identified in the tm rc database regarding the stability of pressure at the pumping station 305 periods were classified as u1 268 as u2 and 3302 as u3 85 of total the most exigent accuracy level u3 was selected because it provided an adequate accuracy and did not drastically reduce the number of stationary periods the total number of pressure measurements at each hydrant ranged from 200 943 at h249 to 219 682 at h261 particularly among all the stationary periods the available measured data ranged from 89 for h249 to 100 for h226 the screening of normalized pressure data permitted to eliminate outliers at each hydrant the number of outliers ranged from 2 at hydrant h256 to 5 at hydrant h241 with a mean of 3 among all hydrants note that this process makes that some stationary periods do not have pressure information at all hydrants at all time steps however only 1 of the stationary cases were finally discarded as they had less than 3 valid hydrant normalized pressure values as a result a total number of 3269 stationary cases were used in this study 3 2 optimization the proposed optimization methods quasi hydrostatic quadratic regression and null slope were applied to the three scenarios 3 5 and 11 zones fig 6 presents the standard deviation of normalized pressure for the nine combinations and for the original non optimized situation i e with a constant roughness value of 0 01 mm for all pipes in general the largest variability corresponds to the most distant hydrant and the lowest to the closest hydrant to the network inlet the improvement of all optimizations respect to the original situation is important at h241 reduction form 18 kpa to 10 kpa and h243 reduction from 16 kpa to 8 kpa non relevant at h249 fig 6 and average at the rest of hydrants based on the standard deviation analysis the quadratic regression optimization method was the most efficient in 6 out of the 10 hydrants h234 h260 h264 and h275 applied to the 11 zone scenario and h226 and h241 for the 3 zone scenario conversely the null slope method obtained the lowest standard deviation in h243 and h261 for the 3 zone configuration and in h249 for the 11 zone configuration the quasi hydrostatic method was preferred for hydrant h256 note that the differences between the methods were usually in the order of 0 1 kpa in the standard deviation consequently the different combinations of optimization method and zoning scenario had small implications on the standard deviation of normalized pressure only at h249 the 11 zones scenario showed lower standard deviation of pn than the other two scenarios with no differences between optimization methods the standard deviation achieved after optimization was lower or equal to 10 kpa for all measurement hydrants the values of the intercept at the different hydrants δi for both quasi hydrostatic and quadratic regression optimization methods see eqs 5 and 6 respectively are displayed in table 3 values ranged from 8 4 kpa at hydrant h275 for the quadratic regression method to 51 8 kpa at hydrant h249 for both optimization methods the difference between the intercepts in absolute value computed by one or the other method is at most 1 5 kpa fig 7 illustrates the comparison between the original values of normalized pressure and the optimized pn obtained with the best combination of optimization method and zoning scenario for four hydrants the selected hydrants are h226 the closest to the pumping station fig 7a h243 with one of the largest dispersions of normalized pressure standard deviation of 16 kpa fig 7b h249 with the largest variability between optimization methods and no relevant improvements respect to the non optimized situation fig 7c and h256 with one of the lowest dispersions of pn fig 7d hydrants with high dispersion on the original data maintain relevant dispersion after the optimization process h243 fig 7b however the standard deviation was reduced to half of the original value the optimization process provides the values of absolute roughness for each zone and optimization method fig 8 for example for the 3 zone scenario fig 8a the values of roughness strongly depend on the optimization method for zone 1 values from 0 02 mm for the quadratic regression to 0 70 mm for quasi hydrostatic but show small differences for zones 2 and 3 this is particularly true for the quasi hydrostatic and quadratic regression methods which provide excellent agreement for zones 2 25 mm and 3 0 30 mm the dependence on the optimization method for zone 1 relies on the lack of measurement points in this zone the maps of the absolute roughness of the pipes for the 3 zone fig 9a 5 zone fig 9b and 11 zone fig 9c scenarios for the quasi hydrostatic optimization method provide the estimated spatial distribution of the roughness coefficient in a qualitative basis the highest the roughness the highest the zebra mussel colonization of the pipeline zones 1 and 2 account for the same set of pipelines in the three sectoring scenarios fig 4 however the optimized roughness values changed with the zoning scenario for zone 1 and remained almost constant for zone 2 zone 1 presented lower roughness in the 3 zone scenario 0 02 0 70 mm fig 8a than for the other scenarios 5 zones 1 1 11 mm figs 8b and 11 zones 0 50 50 mm fig 8c zone 1 had no measurement devices so roughness changes in this zone will not affect measurements only pipes with upstream downstream pressure measurements can be optimized since changes in their roughness will affect these measures zone 2 corresponds to the network inlet this is the shortest zone with the largest pipeline diameters and only has one measurement point located at its downstream end h226 this zone has the largest roughness coefficient values for any of the studied configurations fig 8 roughness values ranging between 25 and 30 mm are quite similar among optimization methods and zoning scenarios the average normalized pressure of its measurement point was the lowest of all monitored points 9 9 kpa fig 7a although the pipeline diameter is the largest 1 176 mm the same level of zebra mussel infestation will provide smaller normalized pressures in large pipelines than in small pipelines this can explain why the lowest normalized pressure resulted in the highest estimated roughness coefficient zone 2 was the most affected by zebra mussel colonization in all the analyzed conditions the southern part of the network has nine measurement points and was divided in 1 3 or 9 zones zone 3 was quite similar for the 5 zone and 11 zone scenarios and attained similar roughness in both scenarios roughness variability in this zone from 0 02 to 0 30 mm depends on the optimization method zone 4 of the 5 zone scenario which was divided in zones 4 5 and 6 in the 11 zone scenario resulted in moderate roughness values lower than 1 mm zone 8 of the 11 zone scenario is an end of network branch fig 4c that delivers water to four hydrants and includes measurement point h249 this zone has the lowest value of optimized roughness 0 001 mm fig 8c and 9c indicating that zebra mussel infestation is low the measurement point of this zone h249 showed the largest values of intercept in the normalized pressure 51 8 kpa fig 7c and had one of the smallest pipeline diameters 181 mm the large value of the intercept introduced uncertainty that could explain the low value of roughness coefficient in addition the small pipe diameter could explain why the highest normalized pressure provided the lowest value of roughness however the optimization process is a mathematical instrument to adjust data which does not necessarily provide unique solutions 3 3 sensitivity analysis to characterize the robustness of the optimization method and to justify the variability of the results for zone 1 a sensitivity analysis was performed for each of the zones for the quasi hydrostatic method applied to the 3 zones scenario the error e was computed following eq 8 and the sensitivity φ eq 9 8 e 1 n m i 1 n j 1 m p n i δ i j 9 φ e i 1 e i 1 2 e i 1 e i ε i 1 ε i 1 2 ε i 1 ε i where φ is the sensitivity ε is the absolute roughness value e is the error m is the number of total steady configurations of the network and n the number of measurement points fig 10 shows a scatter plot between values of roughness for each of the three zones zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 fig 10a b and c respectively versus sensitivity right axis and error left axis zone 1 has a sensitivity equal to zero fig 10a corroborating that zone 1 has no influence on the results the error remains constant independently of the roughness value the absence of pressure measurements inside the zone to adjust roughness values results in any value providing similar results in order to provide sensitivity to this area observation points should be added the sensitivity of zone 2 fig 10b is lower than that of zone 3 fig 10c note the x axis scale a small change in the roughness coefficient of zone 2 has much less influence on the results than the same change in zone 3 in both areas sensitivity increases as we move away from the optimal solution minimum error but at different rates again the larger number of measurement points in zone 3 9 points compared with those of zone 2 on point can explain the different sensitivity to assess the combined effect of the selected values between zones 2 and 3 a combined error analysis is presented in fig 11 there is a wide strip of values in which the result of optimization becomes very similar showing a similar error values of roughness between 16 and 34 mm for zone 2 and between 0 30 and 0 60 mm for zone 3 provide similar error values a zoom in this strip of error values is presented in fig 11b the error scale ranges from 35 to 80 at fig 11a and from 33 5 to 36 at fig 11b the sensitivity analysis of the optimization algorithm led to the global minimum consequently the optimization method provided robust and consistent solutions table 4 shows the results of computational time and number of iterations for each configuration as the number of dimensions increased the calculation time and the number of iterations required for convergence increased however there were no notable differences between optimization methods considering the same number of discretization zones the computing time of the proposed algorithm for zebra mussel infestation assessment is affordable and the number of observations and zones can be increased without compromising its practical application 3 4 from absolute roughness to zebra mussel infestation level the total number of experimental measurements of head losses at the laboratory was 35 the different screw configurations inside the pipe were translated to occupied cross sectional area in percentage considering the diameter of the screw the distance between them and the depth into the pipe the experiment performed with the maximum number of screws inserted at its maximum depth occupied 29 5 of the total pipe cross sectional area and was considered as representative of an extremely high colonization the infestation levels proposed in this study were based on the cross sectional area occupied by the screws extremely high 25 very high from 20 to 25 high from 15 to 20 medium from 10 to 15 medium low from 5 to 10 and low from 0 to 5 fig 12a presents the roughness coefficient experimentally obtained as a function of the cross sectional area occupied by the screws in the ranges of the infestation levels are also presented in the upper part of the figure error bars represent the experimental variability of absolute roughness for the different values of discharge measured at each screw configuration table 2 in general the variability of the roughness coefficient increased with the infestation level for the same infestation level the lower the discharge the larger the roughness coefficient the measurement performed with no screws resulted in low roughness values ranging from 0 0013 to 0 002 mm for the lowest and the highest discharge respectively with an average of 0 0016 mm this average value is in the range proposed by manufacturers for pvc or other plastic pipes 0 0015 0 007 mm and will be considered as the upper roughness limit for infestation free pipes as the area occupied by screws grows absolute roughness increases reaching extremely high values averaging 118 6 mm for the most occupied section area a second grade polynomic equation was adjusted to fit the average values of absolute roughness as the useful section decreases fig 12a the model is representative of the analyzed pipe dn200 and dinner 170 4 mm its applicability to other diameters has not been tested la violada network has 32 of its pipes similar in diameter to the one used in this experiment around 65 of the pipes are smaller in diameter than dn300 mm and only 2 of the pipes have diameters exceeding 1000 mm several authors have indicated that with decreasing diameters the relative importance of pipe surface roughness increases kandlikar et al 2005 taylor et al 2006 experiments with other diameters would be required to extend the obtained results to the rest of pipe sections in the network the laboratory cannot evaluate the largest diameters present in the experimental network in the moody diagram moody 1944 the graphic form of the colebrook s equation the friction factor increases with reynolds number and asymptotically reaches a constant value at high reynolds numbers this relationship changes with the relative roughness the values of relative roughness ε d presented in this diagram ranged from 0 to 0 05 fig 12b presents an extension of the moody diagram for a larger range of relative roughness from 9 6e 06 0 6962 as measured at the laboratory the laminar to turbulent transition occurs at lower reynolds numbers as the relative roughness increases fig 12b as an exploratory exercise the values of absolute roughness obtained for each zone with the proposed method fig 9 were transformed to infestation level following the adjusted model presented in fig 12a for the 3 zone and 5 zone scenarios 94 5 of the total pipes have a low infestation level and the other 5 5 have a moderate low infestation level the 11 zone scenario showed different percentage of the infestation levels with 2 8 of infestation free pipes 80 9 of low infected pipes and 16 3 of moderate low infected pipes regarding the validity of the relationship between absolute roughness and infestation level pipes with the largest diameter of the network 3 pipes of 1176 mm were classified as moderate low infected in the three scenarios the largest infestation level of the network classification this level of infestation of the large pipes should be carefully considered because of the previously discussed upscaling problems 4 discussion zebra mussel has a strong capacity to block large pipes and to colonize pressurized collective irrigation networks the normalized pressure method has been applied in this study to determine the infestation level of zebra mussels in network pipes the quality of measured and simulated pressure data is critical to the applicability of the pn method de schaetzen et al 2000 and kumar et al 2010 reported that measurement points should be selected as the most sensitive to changes in pipe roughness parameters in this work the measurement points were those identified by the district manager as the most problematic for zebra mussel consequently these were the most likely to change the roughness of the underlying pipes walski 2000 indicated that data quality is an important and commonly ignored issue during calibration appropriate data are collected when there is sufficient head loss larger than the measurement error to draw valid conclusions the uncertainty of data measurements at specific nodes and at the network inlet can be minimized by ensuring a low standard deviation of the measurements during the stationary periods bezerra et al 2017 working on roughness calibration of piping networks with hydraulic simulation modeling indicated that an adequate layout of the nodes with known pressures was more important than a large number of pressure measurements to follow this recommendation the location and elevation of all hydrants from the original project was revised using altimetry data obtained with a high precision gps receiver even then an important uncertainty in irrigation network hydraulic characteristics was identified in variable δ of the normalized pressure method the method keeps this variable constant excluding this uncertainty from the determination of pn the selected approach for comparing observed and simulated nodal pressure and for adjusting the friction coefficients of pipes to obtain an acceptable tolerance of error resulted adequate to determine the infestation level of zebra mussel in pipes most efforts towards model calibration have been undertaken by adjusting roughness coefficients alone the reduction in pipe diameter has often been neglected boxall et al 2004 this simplification has often been found to adequately predict pressure distribution and flow balance at each node in the system walski 2004 however the representation of the flow paths and velocity distribution may not be well predicted many water quality problems including disinfectant decay hallam et al 2002 clark and haught 2005 disinfection by product formation and taste and odor problems have been associated with the residence time of water in distribution systems christensen and barfuss 2009 this approach is also necessary when applied at mini and micro pipes where the relative size of the roughness with respect to the pipe diameter grows dramatically taylor et al 2006 in this study neither the velocity nor the micro pipes are relevant the simultaneous calibration of roughness and diameter reduction would strongly increase the number of unknowns to estimate the roughness coefficient of each pipeline in the network the pn method applied to stationary states was used together with an optimization algorithm that minimized an objective function three different objective functions were compared based on different hydraulic assumptions the multi variable problem of finding the optimum value for all the pipelines in the network and for each different steady configuration would require unmanageable experimental and computational resources therefore three different cluster scenarios were designed including 3 5 and 11 zones kumar et al 2010 proposed a practical methodology for large networks based on a clustering algorithm for automatically grouping the pipes having similar roughness characteristics into one zone the principles of this method were applied in this research the uncertainty about the location and level of infestation of the different pipes was overcome by the analysis of different grouping scenarios for the study network the absolute roughness of plastic pipes seems to vary substantially according to the type of plastic or the pipe condition diogo and vilela 2014 even if the absolute roughness was detected relatively small in some tested pipes it appears to have an important role in the resistance law this may be relevant mainly for large sections and large lengths frequently requiring precise calculations in practical applications and or for relatively high reynolds numbers the moody diagram provides values of friction for relative roughness between 0 and 0 05 higher values of relative roughness are expected for moderately to high infested pipes by zebra mussel other applications of flows in small diameters such as high heat flux cooling microfluidics and biological application kandlikar et al 2005 will also require high values of relative roughness experiments have been performed in this research to extend the roughness ranges to 0 6962 however experiments were only performed for a dn200 mm diameter under turbulent flow results should be carefully upscaled for larger diameters further research in this line will include more measurement points at the piping network and several seasons of data sets the comparison between seasons will determine if the infestation pattern depends on structural fixed or and on seasonal variable characteristics it would also be interesting to discriminate between the effects of mussel settlement inside the pipes and the accumulation of dead and detached shells mussel settlement has been analyzed in this research a process expected to induce gradual head loss increase according to the network managers the second process results in a sudden head drop that has not been analyzed in this study the proposed normalized pressure method requires intense data series that not always are available although tm rc systems have been widely installed in modernized irrigation networks since xxi century the data required to adequately apply the method are not easy to find playán et al 2018 in a study about tm rc systems installed in wuas in spain indicated that a large majority of the tm rc systems 85 are regularly used to improve water and energy management but only 25 of them exploit most of the potential capacities of the technology the development of applications based on tm rc technology such as the normalized pressure method will reinforce the use and success of both the technology and the method however in the short term the development of a simplified method replacing tm rc data by more commonly available irrigation network data constitutes a key challenge to control zebra mussel infestation 5 conclusions the normalized pressure method has been applied to a collective pressurized irrigation network telemetry and remote control data sets were available and pressure recorders were installed at specific hydrants the method permitted to characterize pipe roughness which was associated to zebra mussel settlement the application of the method underlined the importance of data quality quality data control procedures were proposed and applied to pressure data different objective functions were used for the optimization process providing similar estimations of pipe roughness the network zoning scenario had a major role on pipe roughness values the division of the network into zones of similar pipe absolute roughness should be performed taking into account the existence of sufficient pressure measurement points the optimized pipe absolute roughness values summarizes the effect of section constriction and the increase on wall shear stress no attempt was made to separate both effects in view of the limited availability of experimental data the method permitted to establish different values of pipe absolute roughness for the analyzed network zones the values of pipe roughness were tentatively classified in six infestation levels based on laboratory experiments the well established hydraulic principles used in this research contribute to the validity of the results namely of the capacity of the normalized pressure method to map zebra mussel infestation in the pipelines of a collective irrigation network the ultimate validation of the process would require a forensic approach extracting pipelines to verify their infestation level a practice that is not possible in real irrigation networks intensive research on this methodology more density of observation points several irrigation campaigns would permit to take a decisive step in its application decision making on management practices and chemical treatments observing the evolution of infestation in network zones and establishing cost efficient thresholds protecting network operability would lead to informed decision making about chemical treatments applied to the complete network or to parts of it continuous monitoring of normalized pressure would permit to separate the effects of mussels and those of dead shells ideally predicting the accumulation of shells following a

9794,the application of mulching materials has significantly improved the production of wheat in semi arid regions however various mulching applications under different tillage practices whether it can improve the root growth spatial distribution of root nutrients uptake and grain yield of wheat is not clear therefore a two years ﬁeld study was carried out during 2016 17 and 2017 18 to evaluate root growth nutrients uptake and wheat production under six treatments ct conventional planting sm wheat stalk mulching fm plastic mulching rt without plastic mulching with furrow and ridge planting

a basic component of global ecosystems and has a basic role to supply soil water and nutrients jeschke et al 1997 in addition the above ground biomass production depends largely on the plant root systems hodge 2006 the growth and distribution of the root system in the soil determined the ability of crops to absorb nutrients and extract water spedding et al 2004 lynch 2011 usually the growth of the root system depends on the genetic characteristics of the plant and the physicochemical properties of the soil and shows great plasticity in different ecological environments gan et al 2008 to improve the root systems of plants had the potential to obtain more water and mineral nutrients hammer et al 2009 however insufficient rainfall and unpredictability are the main limiting factors that limit the development and productivity of wheat root systems in the semi arid regions huwe 2003 mosaddeghi et al 2009 zhao et al 2013 reported that cultivation practice is widely adopted for its many functions which include changing soil properties and improving soil water storage capacity cultivation practices can also affect root development and soil properties zhang et al 2014 in the near future water shortages are expected to occur chakraborty et al 2008 therefore the application of mulching materials has been used as a means to protect rainwater and improve root growth and wheat production fageria 2004 wang et al 2011 one of the most effective agricultural practices is plastic film mulching which can effective use of light rain zhang et al 1999 this technology can improve rainwater conservation and improve sustainable roots growth until the soil depth reaches 60 cm gan et al 2008 plastic film mulching effectively collects rainwater and decreases evaporation thus improving soil water contents root growth crop yield and reducing farmers expenses hodge 2006 zhao et al 2014 lynch 2011 observed that under the rainwater harvesting system the roots of spring wheat can penetrate deeper into the soil than of conventional flat planting and the root length density is higher which is attributed to improving more rainwater preservation unfortunately our knowledge of how different mulching materials aﬀects soil dynamics such as microbial abundance and enzymatic activity should also be studied as they influence the root development the nutrients cycle of the soil and uptake of plant nutrients which collectively influence wheat production understanding root morphology is essential to get for maximum crop yield in rain fed agriculture as roots are the most essential organ for nutrient and water uptake which play a key role in the plant soil ecosystems lipiec and stepniewski 1995 spedding et al 2004 the uptake of water and nutrients are largely dependent on the root systems of crops qin et al 2006 tillage techniques not only affect rooting conditions for crop growth but also directly affect the uptake of soil nutrients and root growth fageria 2004 root length density rld is a vital parameter for assessing the impact of cultivation techniques on root development and production noguchi et al 2005a these substances such as amino acids and hormones are partly involved in the root material synthesis transport material from xylem saps and physiological activities which determines environmental impacts of agriculture bleeding sap is a manifestation

study the swc with a 1 120 cm soil depth was frequently determined at different wheat growth stages the ridge furrow rainfall collection farming practice with various mulching applications significantly improved the swc compared with the conventional flat planting fig 2 between the two study years the average swc at various growth stages was significantly p 0 05 different and the treatment rankings were as follows rps rp rt fm sm ct treatment in these two years of research there were non considerable differences in swc at the time of sowing between different treatments in two years study swc treated with rps and rp were significantly higher than those treated with sm and ct at different growth stages from jointing to flowering the swc increased significantly and from flowering to seed filling the swc decreased significantly during the 2016 17 study year in all the treatments 3 2 root length density rld the root length density rld of the crop root zone is an essential determinant and its role is to provide nutrients and water to the wheat crop during the 2017 18 study years the mean rld of the entire soil profile 0 100 cm depth was calculated in the present two year study the wheat rld slowly decreased from flowering to maturity at 0 100 cm soil profile depth the rps and rp farming practices had a considerable p 0 05 effect on rld and non considerable variation was recorded between rt and ct treatments at various growth stages fig 3 the rld was significantly increased in the order of rps rp pm sm rt ct treatments across the soil profile of 0 100 cm at flowering and maturity stages in 2017 18 study years during the wheat flowering and maturity growth stages the rld of the topmost soil profile 0 10 cm indicated that there were considerable variations between the applications of different mulch materials under the two farming practices however the maximum rld was recorded under rps farming practice followed by rp than that of conventional flat planting across the soil profile depths of 0 60 cm there was no significant variation in rld at the 70 100 cm of soil depth at the flowering and maturity growth stages in all treatments 3 3 rate of root bleeding sap and delivery rate of ion composition in the growth stages of wheat under both study years farming practices with different mulch materials have a significant effect on the root bleeding saps flow fig 4 in 2016 17 under rps and rp treatments the root bleeding rate at 25 50 75 100 and 125 dap respectively was significantly maximum compared with ct planting practice there was non considerable variation in the flow of root bleeding rate between rps and rp planting practices and rt and fm treatment in the various growth stages a similar trend for the root bleeding rate was observed in 2017 18 the root bleeding rate at rps treatment in the various growth stages was significantly maximum compared with rt planting practice and at 100 and 125 dap under the rps and rp planting practices were significantly maximum compared with fm planting practice in addition the root bleeding sap rate at the 25 and 125 dap under the rps treatment was significantly higher compared with fm farming practice in the 2017 18 study years the mineral nutrients to the root sap differed significantly which shows variations under different farming practices with applications of mulching materials at different wheat growth stages table 1 because almost all nitrogen such as no3 and nh4 is absorbed by the roots the xylem transports it to the shoots where different farming practices with applications of mulching materials significantly change the no3 and nh4 delivery rate during the various growth stages the no3 and nh4 delivery rates under rps treatment were significantly maximum than those at fm treatment during the 2017 18 study years the nh4 delivery rate under the rps farming practice was significantly maximum compared with fm farming practice at v7 flowering and grain filling and non considerable variations were recorded between rp and fm treatment at flowering and grain filling during 2017 and v7 and grain filling stages in 2018 therefore at v7 flowering and grain filling the no3 delivery rate at the rps farming practice is significantly maximum compared with fm farming practice in addition during the 2017 18 study years the no3 and nh4 delivery rates in the rp treatment were significantly maximum compared with no3 and nh4 delivery rates under fm treatment during the 2017 18 study years the cultivation practices of different mulch materials affected the fe zn p k ca and mg delivery rates at different growth stages the fe zn p k ca and mg delivery rates in the rps treatment were significantly maximum compared with fm farming practice compared with the rp farming practice the fm farming practice has greatly reduced the delivery rates of fe zn p k ca and mg during various growth stages in the 2017 18 study years however at v7 flowering and grain filling there were non considerable variations in p and k delivery rates between rp and fm treatments compared with ct treatment fm treatment has higher fe zn p k ca and mg delivery rates at different growth stages during two study years the fe and zn delivery rates were significantly little difference between rps and rp farming practices at the most growth stages of the two study years 3 4 abundance of soil microorganism table 2 indicated that farming practices with different mulching materials applications had significantly affected the rhizosphere soil microorganism s quantity soil actinomycetes bacteria and fungi quantities under the rps and rp farming practices were all significantly maximum compared with the rest of all treatments under various mulching materials applications it increased the soil actinomycetes bacteria and fungi quantities under the ridge furrow planting practice as compared with flat planting under various mulching materials table 2 in the rps treatment was significantly maximum in soil actinomycetes bacteria and fungi quantities compared with fm treatment in rps and rp treatments considerable variations of soil actinomycetes bacteria and fungi quantities were not recorded however microbial abundances were markedly higher in rps and rp treatments than that of the rest of all treatments soil microbial biomass c higher under the ridge furrow planting practice as compared with flat planting under various mulching materials table 3 the highest smbc was found in rps treatment follow by rp and fm treatments respectively under the rps treatment the smbc was significantly maximum compared with the rest of all treatments under the rp farming practice the smbc was significantly compared with sm farming practice but non significantly higher than that of fm treatment soil microbial biomass n increased under the ridge furrow planting practice as compared with flat planting under various mulching materials table 3 soil microbial biomass n at the rps and rp farming practices was significantly maximum compared with the rest of all treatments but did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from fm treatment during the 2017 study year under the rps treatment was significantly higher smbc smbn than the rest of all treatments during 2017 compared to rps and fm treatments sm and ct treatment were significantly increased the smbc smbn ratio during the 2018 study year 3 5 soil enzyme activity under the rps and rp treatments significantly increased the catalase invertase urease and phosphatase activities in comparison to the rest of all treatments table 4 average of two year data indicated that under the rps treatment significantly increased invertase 36 5 urease 49 5 phosphatase 60 3 and catalase 59 5 than that of ct treatment the catalase invertase urease and phosphatase activities increased under the ridge furrow planting practice as compared with flat planting under various mulching materials table 4 the maximum catalase invertase urease and phosphatase activities were all observed under the rps and rp treatments and have no significant difference the catalase invertase urease and phosphatase activities under the rp treatments were significantly higher by 33 8 53 6 55 0 and 50 8 than that of ct treatment with no considerable variation between the rps and rp farming practices the fm treatment significantly increased the catalase invertase urease and phosphatase activities by 27 7 41 7 44 1 and 133 6 compared to ct treatment respectively 3 6 nutrient uptake the uptake of n p and k was significantly affected by farming practices with different mulching materials applications table 5 under the rps treatment significantly increased n p k than that of all treatments during two study years mean n p and k uptake under the rps treatment were significantly higher by 17 8 29 5 and 18 5 than those in rt treatment across the two growing seasons the uptake of n p and k was significantly improved under the ridge furrow planting practice as compared with flat planting under various mulching materials however have no considerable variations were recorded between the rps and rp treatments during the two study years compared to ct treatment mean n p and k uptake were significantly increased by 128 0 90 0 and 102 5 in the fm treatment respectively 3 7 yield and yield components of wheat the farming practices with different mulching materials applications have significantly affected the yield components such as number of seed per spike yield per spike g spikelets per spike 1000 grain weight g and grain yield than that of conventional flat farming practice in 2016 17 and 2017 18 table 6 two year average data showed that rps and rp farming practices significantly produced the maximum wheat ear seed per spike yield per spike g spikelets per spike and 1000 grain weight g compared to all other treatments in 2016 17 the grain yields for each of the farming practices were ranked as rps fm rp sm rt ct treatments compared with ct treatment the grain yield under the rps fm rp sm and rt treatments were significantly improved by 3 1 2 4 2 5 2 0 and 1 0 t ha 1 in 2017 18 the grain yield under the rps fm rp sm and rt treatments were significantly improved by 4 3 3 5 3 1 2 2 and 0 4 t ha 1 than that of ct treatment respectively 4 discussion 4 1 farming practices effects on soil water storage and root distribution rhizosphere soil water content microbial abundance and enzyme activity are essential biological and physical parameters that affect nutrient uptake root development and wheat production compared with traditional flat with no film mulching plastic films covered with ridges and furrows can efficiently use light precipitation as a result of increased water use efficiency li et al 2001 gan et al 2013 plastic mulch can also increase surface soil moisture and promote the establishment of stand plant development doussan et al 2006 it is well known that an rf system with plastic film can efficiently use light precipitation and increase access to wheat crops guo et al 2008 plastic mulch can improve the moisture content of the top surface soil promote root growth and development and thus increase wheat production mosaddeghi et al 2009 in the two years study swc treated with rps and rp were significantly higher than those treated with sm and ct at different growth stages the stalk mulching on the furrow zone can increase the swc due to efficiently accumulating light rainfall water promoting precipitation infiltration and reduce evaporation fageria 2004 the development and spatial distribution of roots have a huge effect on the nutrients and water uptake capacity of crops as well as on root development and wheat production liu et al 2009 lino et al 2016 cultivation methods are an important part to the soil management system and it affects root characteristics dry matter and yield qin et al 2006 several earlier studies report that farming practices may significantly affect the spatial pattern of wheat roots doussan et al 2006 mosaddeghi et al 2009 in this study wheat rld slowly decreased from flowering to maturity at 0 100 cm soil profile depth the rps and rp farming practices had a considerable p 0 05 effect on rld and non considerable variation was recorded between rt and ct treatments at various growth stages the rld is a relevant parameter characterizing the root system chassot et al 2001 our finding indicated that during wheat flowering and maturity growth stages the rld of the topmost soil profile 0 10 cm indicated that there were considerable variations between the applications of different mulch materials under the two farming practices however the maximum rld was recorded under rps farming practice followed by rp than that of conventional flat planting across the soil profile depths of 0 60 cm fageria 2004 found that reduced irrigation amount has reduce the wheat root and stem growth it is essential to note that at the top of 50 cm soil profile approximately 80 of the total root length was accumulated engels and marschner 1993 4 2 various mulching materials effects on root bleeding sap flow under rain fed condition root bleeding sap flow is closely related to the effective soil water uptake of the root system and indicates the physiological activity within the root system ansari et al 2004 yuhong et al 2014 noguchi et al 2005b suggest a close relationship between wheat bleeding rates and root system our results also show that the root bleeding rate at 25 50 75 100 and 125 dap under rps and rp treatments higher than that under ct planting practice there was non considerable variation in the flow of root bleeding rate between rps and rp planting practices and rt and fm treatment in the various growth stages differences in root bleeding rates between different varieties throughout the sampling period may depend on differences in stem size related to the rooting system noguchi et al 2005a morita et al 2000 reported that nutrients content in xylem sap which represents the nutritional status of plants and dry soil affect the nutrient uptake higher root bleeding rates may be mostly related to a greater amount of nitrogen and dry matter which leads to improvement in the grains ear 1 doussan et al 2006 noguchi et al 2005b find out that the nutritional components in xylem sap also represented the nutritious status of plants in this study the no3 and nh4 delivery rates under rps treatment were significantly maximum than those at fm treatment during the 2017 18 study years by examining the root bleeding sap information about the assimilation activity of the roots and qualitative information about the supply of nitrogen to the shoot can be obtained thomas et al 1979 therefore at v7 flowering and grain filling the no3 delivery rate at the rps farming practice is significantly maximum compared with fm farming practice during the 2017 18 study years the cultivation practices of different mulch materials affected the fe zn p k ca and mg delivery rates these finding are consistent with barraclough and weir 1988 who suggest that as soil compaction increases generally decrease potassium concentration and absorption lipiec and stepniewski 1995 found that farming practices had no effect on potassium content in grains but increased potassium content in straw traditional flat planting significantly reduced soil bulk density resulting in higher leaf fe zn p k ca and mg content and tuber yield of sweet potatoes agbede 2010 at different growth stages the fe zn p k ca and mg delivery rates in the rps treatment were significantly maximum compared with fm farming practice however at v7 flowering and grain filling there were non considerable variations in p and k delivery rates between rp and fm treatments previous research has shown that the application of mulching materials can affect nutrient uptake araújo et al 2013 lino et al 2016 in this study there was little difference in fe and zn delivery rates between rps and rp treatments plastic film mulching can increase enzyme activity on the soil gao et al 2014 which supports our similar findings for catalase invertase urease and phosphatase in rps and rp treatments in addition wet soils have higher enzyme activity than dry soils vyn et al 2002 therefore we observed higher activity in rps and rp treatments which may be due to higher water content in the soils plastic covered ridges have a positive effect on soil microorganisms such as actinomycetes fungi and bacteria benintende et al 2008 li et al 2004 observed that the abundance of these three types of microorganisms under the rfmf treatment was 12 higher than that of the non covered treatment under the rps treatment smbc was significantly higher than all other treatments a good biological indicator of soil quality may be a microbial activity and the impact of cultivation methods on microbial activity can be determined by smbc levels kader et al 2017 4 3 root enzymatic activities and wheat production responses to various farming practices the available nitrogen to the soil may reduce smbn levels and microbial activity zhang et al 2002 compared with ct treatment rps treatment significantly increased soils microbial activity in turn the richer the microorganisms which are vital biological components in the soil nutrient cycle the produce stronger the enzymatic activity mineralization of available crops nutrients xiao et al 2013 the activities of soil microbial under rp treatment were significantly maximum compared with ct farming practice the microbial growths in crops and soils were significantly increased under different mulching materials guo et al 2008 as result mulching materials significantly improve soil water storage in the root zone with extensive root growth wang et al 2011 in this study the average n p and k uptake under rps treatment were significantly higher than that of rt treatment yin et al 2015 demonstrated that higher wheat root biomass is significantly associated with grain yield plastic mulching can regulate soil water to achieve maximum productions clark et al 2003 our finding also presents that under rps treatment significantly p 0 05 increased root growth development and grain yield this study provided the basis for developing methods to fully measure morphological root system characteristics improve the rhizosphere environment and reduce wheat production risks in semi arid regions 5 conclusions ridge tillage with plastic film mulch on ridges and stalk on furrows rps can significantly improve the root biomass rhizosphere soil moisture enzyme activity and microbial abundance at the depth of 0 100 cm therefore in the rps treatment the root length density the ratio of root bleeding saps the nutrient absorption and the yield and yield composition of wheat were higher than those of the other treatments except rt treatment the rps treatment significantly improved the root systems at the depth of 50 cm which helped increase wheat yield the rps and rp treatments significantly enhanced the ratio of root bleeding saps and rld at various growth stages and attain the highest at 125 dap compared with the fm treatment the rld of the rps and rt treatments at the top 10 50 cm soil profile was significantly higher compared with fm but there was no variation in the rld at below 60 cm in addition during two study years the delivery rates of nh4 and no3 at rps treatment are significantly maximum compared with fm and rt treatments while under rp treatment was significantly maximum compared with fm during 2017 18 years the p k ca mg fe and zn delivery rates at the rps and rt practices were significantly maximum than those of all other treatments our results show that the rps farming practice has the potential to improve the rhizosphere environment improve root biomass the spatial temporal distribution of root systems nutrient uptake and wheat productivity future study is needed to investigate the impact of farming practices on crops production

9794,the application of mulching materials has significantly improved the production of wheat in semi arid regions however various mulching applications under different tillage practices whether it can improve the root growth spatial distribution of root nutrients uptake and grain yield of wheat is not clear therefore a two years ﬁeld study was carried out during 2016 17 and 2017 18 to evaluate root growth nutrients uptake and wheat production under six treatments ct conventional planting sm wheat stalk mulching fm plastic mulching rt without plastic mulching with furrow and ridge planting rp plastic mulching with furrow and ridge planting rps plastic mulching on ridges and stalk mulching on furrows under the rps treatment root biomass soil moisture soil enzymatic activity and microbial abundance can be significantly improved thus promoting root growth nutrient absorption and wheat production the rps treatment significantly improved the rooting system in the upper soil profile of 50 cm which helped increase the yield of wheat at various wheat growth stages the rps and rt treatment at the depth of 10 50 cm significantly increased root bleeding saps and rld and reached up to the highest value at 125 dap however there were no differences in rld between the six different treatment methods in deeper soil profiles below 60 cm in addition during 2016 17 and 2017 18 the nh4 and no3 delivery rates under the rps were significantly higher than that of fm and rt while the delivery rates of nh4 and no3 under the rp treatment were maximum compared with fm practice under the rps and rt treatments the fe ca p zn k and mg delivery rates were significantly maximum in summary rps farming practices have been great potential to improve the rhizosphere environment root biomass and wheat yield in semi arid regions keywords mulching applications tillage practices root bleeding sap rhizosphere soil environment root length density wheat production 1 introduction the plant root system is a basic component of global ecosystems and has a basic role to supply soil water and nutrients jeschke et al 1997 in addition the above ground biomass production depends largely on the plant root systems hodge 2006 the growth and distribution of the root system in the soil determined the ability of crops to absorb nutrients and extract water spedding et al 2004 lynch 2011 usually the growth of the root system depends on the genetic characteristics of the plant and the physicochemical properties of the soil and shows great plasticity in different ecological environments gan et al 2008 to improve the root systems of plants had the potential to obtain more water and mineral nutrients hammer et al 2009 however insufficient rainfall and unpredictability are the main limiting factors that limit the development and productivity of wheat root systems in the semi arid regions huwe 2003 mosaddeghi et al 2009 zhao et al 2013 reported that cultivation practice is widely adopted for its many functions which include changing soil properties and improving soil water storage capacity cultivation practices can also affect root development and soil properties zhang et al 2014 in the near future water shortages are expected to occur chakraborty et al 2008 therefore the application of mulching materials has been used as a means to protect rainwater and improve root growth and wheat production fageria 2004 wang et al 2011 one of the most effective agricultural practices is plastic film mulching which can effective use of light rain zhang et al 1999 this technology can improve rainwater conservation and improve sustainable roots growth until the soil depth reaches 60 cm gan et al 2008 plastic film mulching effectively collects rainwater and decreases evaporation thus improving soil water contents root growth crop yield and reducing farmers expenses hodge 2006 zhao et al 2014 lynch 2011 observed that under the rainwater harvesting system the roots of spring wheat can penetrate deeper into the soil than of conventional flat planting and the root length density is higher which is attributed to improving more rainwater preservation unfortunately our knowledge of how different mulching materials aﬀects soil dynamics such as microbial abundance and enzymatic activity should also be studied as they influence the root development the nutrients cycle of the soil and uptake of plant nutrients which collectively influence wheat production understanding root morphology is essential to get for maximum crop yield in rain fed agriculture as roots are the most essential organ for nutrient and water uptake which play a key role in the plant soil ecosystems lipiec and stepniewski 1995 spedding et al 2004 the uptake of water and nutrients are largely dependent on the root systems of crops qin et al 2006 tillage techniques not only affect rooting conditions for crop growth but also directly affect the uptake of soil nutrients and root growth fageria 2004 root length density rld is a vital parameter for assessing the impact of cultivation techniques on root development and production noguchi et al 2005a these substances such as amino acids and hormones are partly involved in the root material synthesis transport material from xylem saps and physiological activities which determines environmental impacts of agriculture bleeding sap is a manifestation of the root pressure taking effect on the shoot peuke 2000 amato and ritchie 2002 the root bleeding saps composition and quantity reveal the root growth and development amos and walters 2006 fageria 2004 reported that bleeding sap differs with plant and soil circumstances root activity and seasons given the difficulty of evaluating root systems in ﬁeld trials root bleeding sap is helpful to learn root behavior especially nutrient uptake doussan et al 2006 the objectives of the present study were to 1 assess how farming practices affects the rhizosphere environment root growth nutrient uptake and yield of wheat and 2 determine and compare application of mulching materials by examining multiple above ground nutrient uptake and grain yield and below ground soil moisture temperature enzyme activity microorganism abundance and root growth factors under different farming practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this research work was carried out at institute of water saving

to find out the soil microbial biomass c in the extract while soil microbial biomass nitrogen was determination by kjeldahl method 2 3 5 wheat production and nutrient uptake at the end of each growing season all plants except the border rows of each field are manually harvested at the harvesting stage to determine grain yield and yield components from each plot 10 plants were selected cut from the ground dried in the oven and then 0 5 mm sieve is used for sieving after wet digesting the samples in h2so4 h2o2 the total n and p were determined by using an automatic continuous flow analyzer the total potassium was determined by a flame photometer 6400a china 2 3 6 statistical analysis spss 18 0 is used to perform analysis of variance analyze the data for each sampling event separately test the mean using the least significant lsd test between the means in all cases if p 0 05 the difference was considered a significant difference 3 results 3 1 soil water contents during two years of study the swc with a 1 120 cm soil depth was frequently determined at different wheat growth stages the ridge furrow rainfall collection farming practice with various mulching applications significantly improved the swc compared with the conventional flat planting fig 2 between the two study years the average swc at various growth stages was significantly p 0 05 different and the treatment rankings were as follows rps rp rt fm sm ct treatment in these two years of research there were non considerable differences in swc at the time of sowing between different treatments in two years study swc treated with rps and rp were significantly higher than those treated with sm and ct at different growth stages from jointing to flowering the swc increased significantly and from flowering to seed filling the swc decreased significantly during the 2016 17 study year in all the treatments 3 2 root length density rld the root length density rld of the crop root zone is an essential determinant and its role is to provide nutrients and water to the wheat crop during the 2017 18 study years the mean rld of the entire soil profile 0 100 cm depth was calculated in the present two year study the wheat rld slowly decreased from flowering to maturity at 0 100 cm soil profile depth the rps and rp farming practices had a considerable p 0 05 effect on rld and non considerable variation was recorded between rt and ct treatments at various growth stages fig 3 the rld was significantly increased in the order of rps rp pm sm rt ct treatments across the soil profile of 0 100 cm at flowering and maturity stages in 2017 18 study years during the wheat flowering and maturity growth stages the rld of the topmost soil profile 0 10 cm indicated that there were considerable variations between the applications of different mulch materials under the two farming practices however the maximum rld was recorded under rps farming practice followed by rp than that of conventional flat planting across the soil profile depths of 0 60 cm there was no significant variation in rld at the 70 100 cm of soil depth at the flowering and maturity growth stages in all treatments 3 3 rate of root bleeding sap and delivery rate of ion composition in the growth stages of wheat under both study years farming practices with different mulch materials have a significant effect on the root bleeding saps flow fig 4 in 2016 17 under rps and rp treatments the root bleeding rate at 25 50 75 100 and 125 dap respectively was significantly maximum compared with ct planting practice there was non considerable variation in the flow of root bleeding rate between rps and rp planting practices and rt and fm treatment in the various growth stages a similar trend for the root bleeding rate was observed in 2017 18 the root bleeding rate at rps treatment in the various growth stages was significantly maximum compared with rt planting practice and at 100 and 125 dap under the rps and rp planting practices were significantly maximum compared with fm planting practice in addition the root bleeding sap rate at the 25 and 125 dap under the rps treatment was significantly higher compared with fm farming practice in the 2017 18 study years the mineral nutrients to the root sap differed significantly which shows variations under different farming practices with applications of mulching materials at different wheat growth stages table 1 because almost all nitrogen such as no3 and nh4 is absorbed by the roots the xylem transports it to the shoots where different farming practices with applications of mulching materials significantly change the no3 and nh4 delivery rate during the various growth stages the no3 and nh4 delivery rates under rps treatment were significantly maximum than those at fm treatment during the 2017 18 study years the nh4 delivery rate under the rps farming practice was significantly maximum compared with fm farming practice at v7 flowering and grain filling and non considerable variations were recorded between rp and fm treatment at flowering and grain filling during 2017 and v7 and grain filling stages in 2018 therefore at v7 flowering and grain filling the no3 delivery rate at the rps farming practice is significantly maximum compared with fm farming practice in addition during the 2017 18 study years the no3 and nh4 delivery rates in the rp treatment were significantly maximum compared with no3 and nh4 delivery rates under fm treatment during the 2017 18 study years the cultivation practices of different mulch materials affected the fe zn p k ca and mg delivery rates at different growth stages the fe zn p k ca and mg delivery rates in the rps treatment were significantly maximum compared with fm farming practice compared with the rp farming practice the fm farming practice has greatly reduced the delivery rates of fe zn p k ca and mg during various growth stages in the 2017 18 study years however at v7 flowering and grain filling there were non considerable variations in p and k delivery rates between rp and fm treatments compared with ct treatment fm treatment has higher fe zn p k ca and mg delivery rates at different growth stages during two study years the fe and zn delivery rates were significantly little difference between rps and rp farming practices at the most growth stages of the two study years 3 4 abundance of soil microorganism table 2 indicated that farming practices with different mulching materials applications had significantly affected the rhizosphere soil microorganism s quantity soil actinomycetes bacteria and fungi quantities under the rps and rp farming practices were all significantly maximum compared with the rest of all treatments under various mulching materials applications it increased the soil actinomycetes bacteria and fungi quantities under the ridge furrow planting practice as compared with flat planting under various mulching materials table 2 in the rps treatment was significantly maximum in soil actinomycetes bacteria and fungi quantities compared with fm treatment in rps and rp treatments considerable variations of soil actinomycetes bacteria and fungi quantities were not recorded however microbial abundances were markedly higher in rps and rp treatments than that of the rest of all treatments soil microbial biomass c higher under the ridge furrow planting practice as compared with flat planting under various mulching materials table 3 the highest smbc was found in rps treatment follow by rp and fm treatments respectively under the rps treatment the smbc was significantly maximum compared with the rest of all treatments under the rp farming practice the smbc was significantly compared with sm farming practice but non significantly higher than that of fm treatment soil microbial biomass n increased under the ridge furrow planting practice as compared with flat planting under various mulching materials table 3 soil microbial biomass n at the rps and rp farming practices was significantly maximum compared with the rest of all treatments but did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from fm treatment during the 2017 study year under the rps treatment was significantly higher smbc smbn than the rest of all treatments during 2017 compared to rps and fm treatments sm and ct treatment were significantly increased the smbc smbn ratio during the 2018 study year 3 5 soil enzyme activity under the rps and rp treatments significantly increased the catalase invertase urease and phosphatase activities in comparison to the rest of all treatments table 4 average of two year data indicated that under the rps treatment significantly increased invertase 36 5 urease 49 5 phosphatase 60 3 and catalase 59 5 than that of ct treatment the catalase invertase urease and phosphatase activities increased under the ridge furrow planting practice as compared with flat planting under various mulching materials table 4 the maximum catalase invertase urease and phosphatase activities were all observed under the rps and rp treatments and have no significant difference the catalase invertase urease and phosphatase activities under the rp treatments were significantly higher by 33 8 53 6 55 0 and 50 8 than that of ct treatment with no considerable variation between the rps and rp farming practices the fm treatment significantly increased the catalase invertase urease and phosphatase activities by 27 7 41 7 44 1 and 133 6 compared to ct treatment respectively 3 6 nutrient uptake the uptake of n p and k was significantly affected by farming practices with different mulching materials applications table 5 under the rps treatment significantly increased n p k than that of all treatments during two study years mean n p and k uptake under the rps treatment were significantly higher by 17 8 29 5 and 18 5 than those in rt treatment across the two growing seasons the uptake of n p and k was significantly improved under the ridge furrow planting practice as compared with flat planting under various mulching materials however have no considerable variations were recorded between the rps and rp treatments during the two study years compared to ct treatment mean n p and k uptake were significantly increased by 128 0 90 0 and 102 5 in the fm treatment respectively 3 7 yield and yield components of wheat the farming practices with different mulching materials applications have significantly affected the yield components such as number of seed per spike yield per spike g spikelets per spike 1000 grain weight g and grain yield than that of conventional flat farming practice in 2016 17 and 2017 18 table 6 two year average data showed that rps and rp farming practices significantly produced the maximum wheat ear seed per spike yield per spike g spikelets per spike and 1000 grain weight g compared to all other treatments in 2016 17 the grain yields for each of the farming practices were ranked as rps fm rp sm rt ct treatments compared with ct treatment the grain yield under the rps fm rp sm and rt treatments were significantly improved by 3 1 2 4 2 5 2 0 and 1 0 t ha 1 in 2017 18 the grain yield under the rps fm rp sm and rt treatments were significantly improved by 4 3 3 5 3 1 2 2 and 0 4 t ha 1 than that of ct treatment respectively 4 discussion 4 1 farming practices effects on soil water storage and root distribution rhizosphere soil water content microbial abundance and enzyme activity are essential biological and physical parameters that affect nutrient uptake root development and wheat production compared with traditional flat with no film mulching plastic films covered with ridges and furrows can efficiently use light precipitation as a result of increased water use efficiency li et al 2001 gan et al 2013 plastic mulch can also increase surface soil moisture and promote the establishment of stand plant development doussan et al 2006 it is well known that an rf system with plastic film can efficiently use light precipitation and increase access to wheat crops guo et al 2008 plastic mulch can improve the moisture content of the top surface soil promote root growth and development and thus increase wheat production mosaddeghi et al 2009 in the two years study swc treated with rps and rp were significantly higher than those treated with sm and ct at different growth stages the stalk mulching on the furrow zone can increase the swc due to efficiently accumulating light rainfall water promoting precipitation infiltration and reduce evaporation fageria 2004 the development and spatial distribution of roots have a huge effect on the nutrients and water uptake capacity of crops as well as on root development and wheat production liu et al 2009 lino et al 2016 cultivation methods are an important part to the soil management system and it affects root characteristics dry matter and yield qin et al 2006 several earlier studies report that farming practices may significantly affect the spatial pattern of wheat roots doussan et al 2006 mosaddeghi et al 2009 in this study wheat rld slowly decreased from flowering to maturity at 0 100 cm soil profile depth the rps and rp farming practices had a considerable p 0 05 effect on rld and non considerable variation was recorded between rt and ct treatments at various growth stages the rld is a relevant parameter characterizing the root system chassot et al 2001 our finding indicated that during wheat flowering and maturity growth stages the rld of the topmost soil profile 0 10 cm indicated that there were considerable variations between the applications of different mulch materials under the two farming practices however the maximum rld was recorded under rps farming practice followed by rp than that of conventional flat planting across the soil profile depths of 0 60 cm fageria 2004 found that reduced irrigation amount has reduce the wheat root and stem growth it is essential to note that at the top of 50 cm soil profile approximately 80 of the total root length was accumulated engels and marschner 1993 4 2 various mulching materials effects on root bleeding sap flow under rain fed condition root bleeding sap flow is closely related to the effective soil water uptake of the root system and indicates the physiological activity within the root system ansari et al 2004 yuhong et al 2014 noguchi et al 2005b suggest a close relationship between wheat bleeding rates and root system our results also show that the root bleeding rate at 25 50 75 100 and 125 dap under rps and rp treatments higher than that under ct planting practice there was non considerable variation in the flow of root bleeding rate between rps and rp planting practices and rt and fm treatment in the various growth stages differences in root bleeding rates between different varieties throughout the sampling period may depend on differences in stem size related to the rooting system noguchi et al 2005a morita et al 2000 reported that nutrients content in xylem sap which represents the nutritional status of plants and dry soil affect the nutrient uptake higher root bleeding rates may be mostly related to a greater amount of nitrogen and dry matter which leads to improvement in the grains ear 1 doussan et al 2006 noguchi et al 2005b find out that the nutritional components in xylem sap also represented the nutritious status of plants in this study the no3 and nh4 delivery rates under rps treatment were significantly maximum than those at fm treatment during the 2017 18 study years by examining the root bleeding sap information about the assimilation activity of the roots and qualitative information about the supply of nitrogen to the shoot can be obtained thomas et al 1979 therefore at v7 flowering and grain filling the no3 delivery rate at the rps farming practice is significantly maximum compared with fm farming practice during the 2017 18 study years the cultivation practices of different mulch materials affected the fe zn p k ca and mg delivery rates these finding are consistent with barraclough and weir 1988 who suggest that as soil compaction increases generally decrease potassium concentration and absorption lipiec and stepniewski 1995 found that farming practices had no effect on potassium content in grains but increased potassium content in straw traditional flat planting significantly reduced soil bulk density resulting in higher leaf fe zn p k ca and mg content and tuber yield of sweet potatoes agbede 2010 at different growth stages the fe zn p k ca and mg delivery rates in the rps treatment were significantly maximum compared with fm farming practice however at v7 flowering and grain filling there were non considerable variations in p and k delivery rates between rp and fm treatments previous research has shown that the application of mulching materials can affect nutrient uptake araújo et al 2013 lino et al 2016 in this study there was little difference in fe and zn delivery rates between rps and rp treatments plastic film mulching can increase enzyme activity on the soil gao et al 2014 which supports our similar findings for catalase invertase urease and phosphatase in rps and rp treatments in addition wet soils have higher enzyme activity than dry soils vyn et al 2002 therefore we observed higher activity in rps and rp treatments which may be due to higher water content in the soils plastic covered ridges have a positive effect on soil microorganisms such as actinomycetes fungi and bacteria benintende et al 2008 li et al 2004 observed that the abundance of these three types of microorganisms under the rfmf treatment was 12 higher than that of the non covered treatment under the rps treatment smbc was significantly higher than all other treatments a good biological indicator of soil quality may be a microbial activity and the impact of cultivation methods on microbial activity can be determined by smbc levels kader et al 2017 4 3 root enzymatic activities and wheat production responses to various farming practices the available nitrogen to the soil may reduce smbn levels and microbial activity zhang et al 2002 compared with ct treatment rps treatment significantly increased soils microbial activity in turn the richer the microorganisms which are vital biological components in the soil nutrient cycle the produce stronger the enzymatic activity mineralization of available crops nutrients xiao et al 2013 the activities of soil microbial under rp treatment were significantly maximum compared with ct farming practice the microbial growths in crops and soils were significantly increased under different mulching materials guo et al 2008 as result mulching materials significantly improve soil water storage in the root zone with extensive root growth wang et al 2011 in this study the average n p and k uptake under rps treatment were significantly higher than that of rt treatment yin et al 2015 demonstrated that higher wheat root biomass is significantly associated with grain yield plastic mulching can regulate soil water to achieve maximum productions clark et al 2003 our finding also presents that under rps treatment significantly p 0 05 increased root growth development and grain yield this study provided the basis for developing methods to fully measure morphological root system characteristics improve the rhizosphere environment and reduce wheat production risks in semi arid regions 5 conclusions ridge tillage with plastic film mulch on ridges and stalk on furrows rps can significantly improve the root biomass rhizosphere soil moisture enzyme activity and microbial abundance at the depth of 0 100 cm therefore in the rps treatment the root length density the ratio of root bleeding saps the nutrient absorption and the yield and yield composition of wheat were higher than those of the other treatments except rt treatment the rps treatment significantly improved the root systems at the depth of 50 cm which helped increase wheat yield the rps and rp treatments significantly enhanced the ratio of root bleeding saps and rld at various growth stages and attain the highest at 125 dap compared with the fm treatment the rld of the rps and rt treatments at the top 10 50 cm soil profile was significantly higher compared with fm but there was no variation in the rld at below 60 cm in addition during two study years the delivery rates of nh4 and no3 at rps treatment are significantly maximum compared with fm and rt treatments while under rp treatment was significantly maximum compared with fm during 2017 18 years the p k ca mg fe and zn delivery rates at the rps and rt practices were significantly maximum than those of all other treatments our results show that the rps farming practice has the potential to improve the rhizosphere environment improve root biomass the spatial temporal distribution of root systems nutrient uptake and wheat productivity future study is needed to investigate the impact of farming practices on crops production
