7735,study region denmark study focus tile drainage widespread across agricultural areas in denmark significantly impacts the hydrological cycle tile drain flow dynamics and their spatial patterns are crucial for water managers to address water quality and quantity issues however these processes are challenging to simulate accurately in this study we developed 10 m resolution drain models in mike she for 26 drain sites across denmark to predict drain flow spatial and temporal dynamics joint calibration of all drain models was conducted by evaluating pbias and kge of simulated and observed drain flow subsequently we performed a correlation analysis between physical parameters and spatial patterns of simulated drain fraction df ratio of drain flow to recharge per grid cell new hydrological insights the jointly calibrated models achieved average pbias and kge of 6 7 and 0 53 respectively for drain flow predictions across 26 drain sites the correlation of df with topographical variables was highest on a national scale and on most of the drain sites including gyldenholm1 4 norsminde1 11 and other jylland drain sites lillebæk drain sites showed a high correlation with average clay content in 0 30 cm layer of soil thus in addition to developing scalable fine resolution drain models for denmark this study also identifies the control parameters for spatial patterns of drain flows across denmark graphical abstract ga1 keywords subsurface drains shallow groundwater modeling hydrogeological variables topographical variables data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction tile drainage is an agricultural technique for regulating the subsurface water level in waterlogged regions to make the land more productive and better suited for agriculture zucker and brown 1998 however there are environmental consequences associated with tile drained agricultural areas i e increased transport of high nutrient loads to surface waters skaggs et al 1994 stenberg et al 2012 these environmental consequences are due to decreased groundwater travel times schilling et al 2012 and increased annual stream flow volumes magner et al 2004 therefore investigation of tile drain flows is important for water managers to predetermine their influences on the hydrological cycle to address the changes in the hydrological cycle due to tile drains it is crucial to not only understand and quantify temporal drain flow dynamics but also their spatial flow patterns to the best of our knowledge no methods exist that directly measure the spatial distribution of drain flows across the drain site without the use of modeling techniques hansen et al 2019a and boico et al 2022 studied the spatial distribution of drain flows while many previous studies investigated only temporal drain flow dynamics using physics based models de schepper et al 2017 salo et al 2017 sammons et al 2005 turunen et al 2013 youssef et al 2021 all these studies developed models for single drain sites despite being effective for specific sites these physics based models are likely not scalable because a model tested on one or two sites might not be effective in capturing hydrological dynamics on other neighboring catchments grayson et al 1992 heuvelmans et al 2004 montanari et al 2013 developing physics based models for multiple sites is a cumbersome task due to the large number of parameters involved in the calibration process basha et al 2008 beven 1989 but it is certainly valuable for scalability of hydrololgical models for europe a physics based model called macro evaluates drain flow system performance but it is a one dimensional model and obtaining detailed spatial information is rather difficult jarvis and larsbo 2012 jeantet et al 2021 larsbo et al 2005 similarly there are also lumped and semi conceptual models that have been developed for drain flow prediction on multiple sites beskow et al 2011 jeantet et al 2021 perrin et al 2003 however lumped and semi conceptual models fail to consider physics based parameters and their spatial variability abbott et al 1986 we suggest a joint calibration of various drain sites using physics based models can help to address the scalability issue if selected drain sites cover all variability in their physical characteristics the spatial patterns of generated drain flow are complex and not only influenced by existing drain infrastructure but also controlled by physical characteristics such as geology and topography hansen et al 2013 2019a motarjemi et al 2021 the influence of topography and pedo geological variables have been studied on groundwater level and subsurface flows condon and maxwell 2015 dahl et al 2007 but not a lot of research has been conducted specifically on tile drain flows few studies have been conducted to improve the understanding of spatial drain flow patterns and to identify the most influential topographical and pedo geological variables for drain flows boico et al 2022 hansen et al 2019b 2019a motarjemi et al 2021 motarjemi et al 2021 investigated the influence of physical variables such as clay content slope topographical wetness index twi flow accumulation and topographical position index tpi these variables were studied on yearly drain flow amounts for multiple drain sites using machine learning models e g random forest neural networks support vector machines and cubist models motarjemi et al 2021 according to the authors the correlation between spatial patterns of drain flows and physical variables were not assessed in their study therefore no significant correlation was found between temporal drain flow and topographical indexes motarjemi et al 2021 boico et al 2022 studied the sensitivity of hydraulic conductivities and specific yields on spatial patterns of drain flows using hydrogeosphere however boico et al 2022 did not include the influence of topographical variables but the authors recommended it for future investigations hansen et al 2019a studied the correlation between the spatial distribution of drain flow and twi in 100 m resolution but found no significant correlation the authors also investigated the impact of deeper geological layers below the tile drain level and found geological layers upto 23 3 m depth significant for the spatial distribution of drain flow hansen et al 2019a de schepper et al 2017 examined the seasonal drain flow patterns using hydrogeosphere and mike she they concluded that shallow underground structures influence the drain flows hansen et al 2019b studied influencing parameters for the shallow drain flow using feflow and found geology below 3 m depth is also a significant parameter for accurate drain flow predictions previously researchers attempted to investigate temporal drain flow dynamics with their physical variables however a gap exists in assessing the correlations between the spatial distribution of drain flow and physical variables at the field scale the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to develop jointly calibrated physics based models to predict drain flow temporal and spatial dynamics for multiple catchments across denmark 2 to improve our understanding of how physical variables such as geology and topography influence the spatial distribution of drain flow in tile drained agricultural areas to achieve the objectives we simulated daily drain flow dynamics for 26 drain sites in 10 m resolution using mike she after joint calibration of all 26 drain sites to one common parameter set we produced spatial maps of simulated drain fraction df the ratio of drainage volume to recharge volume per grid these maps were compared to maps of potentially important physical control variables to generate a better understanding of physical features that drive spatial variation in drain flow and df the use of multiple sites in a joint calibration improves the robustness of the parameter estimation and coverage of physical control variables across drained regions in denmark 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection drain stations daily drain flow data and the area of drain sites are available across denmark for 26 drain sites table 1 all drain sites were tile drained and varied between 1 and 120 ha based on hydrogeological similarity denmark is divided into 3 main regions fyn jylland and sjælland lolland in fyn data are available for 4 sites in sjælland lolland data are available for 8 sites in total 4 sites in gyldenholm and 4 in lolland for jylland data are available for a total of 14 sites out of 14 sites 11 are in the norsminde catchment mid jylland 1 in vadum upper jylland 1 in fillerup mid jylland and 1 in ulvsborg mid jylland fig 1 shows the locations of drain sites and table 1 shows properties and their division based on regions 2 2 existing national hydrological model of denmark national hydrological model of denmark known as dk model hip was the starting point for the development of the fine scale models for all drain sites dk model hip is a distributed hydrological model with a horizontal resolution of 100 m henriksen et al 2020 stisen et al 2019 this model cannot produce spatial drain flow patterns on the field scale 1 120 ha for two reasons firstly the model is not validated against direct drain flow observations secondly the coarse resolution makes it challenging to decipher field scale controls of drain flow patterns for example the most relevant driver of drain flow patterns is water table depth with significant variations in water table depth below 100 m resolution koch et al 2021 the drain models developed in the current study were based on dk model hip but with a modified horizontal resolution of 10 m to better capture the surface groundwater processes henriksen et al 2020 the dk model hip is setup up in the mike she model code abbott et al 1986 dhi 2020 and simulates 3d subsurface flow as well as 2d overland flow river flow and a simple representation of root zone processes the model is forced by a national gridded daily dataset of precipitation 10 km resolution temperature and reference evapotranspiration 20 km resolution scharling 1999a 1999b all relevant details related to the setup and parameterization of the 100 m dk model hip can be found in henriksen et al 2020 2 3 adaptation to the 10 m resolution drain models the 10 m resolution drain models were set up in the mike she model code for each of the specific drain site area the dynamic boundary conditions and baseline model structure were used from the dk model hip the catchment area was extended in the detailed models with a buffer of 200 m to alleviate the effect of the applied dynamic boundary conditions of the dk model hip the purpose of the 10 m resolution drain models was to estimate the spatial distribution of df in higher resolution than the 100 m dk model hip therefore we refined relevant topographic geologic and drain parameters to 10 m resolution all other inputs and forcing remained the same as in the 100 m dk model hip the refined parameters included surface topography drain time constant and drain depth paved area fraction and the hydraulic conductivity of the uppermost geological layer the uppermost 2 m none of the 26 models have interference from streams and lakes pumping wells or irrigation therefore these packages were disabled in mike she we assumed drains in all model cells because the exact location of drainpipes was unknown and mike she only allows an implicit representation of drains in the model we considered this assumption reasonable as the modeled areas are known to be tile drained and drain flow in mike she will only be generated in cells when groundwater levels are above drain depth at a particular time as tile drains are located between 0 5 and 2 m depth most typically around 1 m one of the most important parameters to study drain flows was the hydraulic conductivity of the uppermost layer of the subsurface 2 m thickness in the current setup the existing dk model hip used a soil class based hydraulic conductivity map jakobsen et al 2015 however for the 10 m resolution drain models we aimed to develop a distributed hydraulic conductivity map in high resolution adhikari et al 2013 have developed clay content maps for all of denmark in 30 m resolution and we considered these maps suitable for producing hydraulic conductivity maps for our study therefore we developed a linear pedo transfer function based on the existing clay content map for denmark to produce a distributed hydraulic conductivity map in 30 m resolution 2 4 joint calibration of 10 m resolution drain models a joint automatic calibration was performed across all the drain sites to obtain a joint and robust parameter set applicable to all drain sites across denmark each drain site has daily drain flow observations for a specific period table 1 which implies that evaluation periods for each site also vary possible evaluation periods were limited to the period between 1990 and 2019 based on the availability of daily climate data and groundwater boundary conditions from the national 100 m model we used nationally coherent parameter sets this calibration was in accordance with the calibration scheme for the 100 m hip dk model which was calibrated with one national parametrization scheme of each parameter to secure spatial consistency in model results we used the ostrich calibration software the pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search padds algorithm of ostrich is a global multi objective optimizer asadzadeh and tolson 2013 matott 2017 it determines a pareto front allowing for evaluation of the trade off between multiple objective function groups without having to apply weights to these groups prior to calibration in our calibration we used two objective function groups the kling gupta efficiency kge and percentage bias pbias between daily simulated and observed drain flow at the outlet of each drain site mean kge and mean pbias across 26 drain models were used by padds algorithm to determine the pareto front see fig 3 kge and pbias were used in the objective function because kge describes the temporal drain flow performance and pbias describes whether simulated drain flows are overestimated or underestimated the selection of calibration parameters was based on past experience with the dk model henriksen et al 2020 højberg et al 2015 and past studies related to danish drain sites de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2013 the most common parameters selected in previous drain models included the hydraulic conductivity of soil shallow geologic layers and drain parameters such as drain time constant and drain depth de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2019b 2013 2019a the deeper geological layers approximately below 20 m were not included in calibration as this study focused on the shallow groundwater system influencing the drain system and has relatively low influence from lateral flows de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2013 we believe calibration of deeper geological layers to drain flow observations would not produce better parameterization for a deeper saturated zone moreover for the deeper geologic layers dynamic boundary conditions from the 100 m dk model hip were used and altering the hydrogeological parameters for these layers would conflict with the applied 100 m dk model hip s boundary conditions the calibration parameters are shown in fig 2 they include the slope p1 and intercept p2 of the pedo transfer function to convert the clay content map into maps of hydraulic conductivity for the upper 2 m of soil parameters p3 p4 and p5 were selected as the hydraulic conductivity of the first clay layer below 2 m depth for sjælland lolland jylland and fyn respectively parameters p6 p7 and p8 describe factors representing the hydraulic conductivity ratio of the first sand to the first clay layer for sjælland lolland jylland and fyn respectively p6 p7 and p8 were selected to ensure that the clay layers hydraulic conductivity is always lower than the sand layers furthermore parameter p9 describes the rooting depth of crops parameters p10 and p11 describe the drain parameters where p10 is the drain time constant that controls the conductance of subsurface drains and p11 is the drain depth the parameters p3 to p8 were related to the hydraulic conductivity of shallow geological layers and were region dependent previously the dk model hip and the national geological model of denmark known as fohm model also divided denmark into three hydrogeologically distinct regions fyn sjælland lolland jylland epa 2020 henriksen et al 2019 højberg et al 2015 this region dependency in our models also originates from the same fact that the hydrogeologic representation originates from three regional hydrogeologic models and the calibration procedure of the dk model hip also follows this regional division five separate calibration runs were conducted with an identical setup except for different random seeds of the padds algorithm each calibration run included 500 iterations the random seed was changed to obtain different initial parameters at the beginning of each calibration run which can influence the further parameter updates of the algorithm the use of different random seeds helps to explore a wider range of possible parameter values and avoid getting stuck in a local optimum which can happen despite padds being a global optimizer the procedure of using different random seeds is also in line with suggestions by the developers of the algorithm asadzadeh and tolson 2013 after 5 calibration runs we observed that model performances was rather consistent and did not improve significantly therefore we conducted only 5 calibration runs in 5 calibration runs total 2500 model iterations were performed each iteration ran all 26 drain models and assembled results based on the multi objective function out of 2500 models iterations 5 solutions parameter sets were selected instead of only a single solution because more than one solution parameter sets can give an equally good model performance moreover including multiple solutions is considered more robust and can help to incorporate differences in model results due to parameter uncertainty the selection criteria were to choose solutions on the pareto front fig 3 with comparably good model performance while showing some variations in the parameter set and representing the trade off between kge and pbias after calibration the selected 5 parameter sets were run for all drain site models from 1990 to 2019 2 5 drain fraction df df is a measure of the average drain flow to recharge ratio for a given time to calculate the df spatially we calculated df for each grid cell of the 26 models using eq 1 1 d f t 1 n d t t 1 n r t in eq 1 d is the volume of drain flow generated in a specific cell r is the recharge volume in the same cell t is the stress period in days and n is the total number of stress periods a df of zero indicates no drain flow while a value between 0 and 1 indicates recharge is higher than drain flow df values above 1 indicate that drain flow is higher than recharge df values above 1 can occur in areas with additional sources of water to the grid e g lateral and upward groundwater fluxes maps of total drain flow and total recharge over 30 years from 1990 to 2019 were acquired from the models to produce climate normalized estimates independent of the varying observation records for each drain site simulated spatial df was calculated using the maps of 30 year recharge and 30 year drain flow for all 5 solutions finally the mean and standard deviation of the simulated spatial df map across 5 solutions were calculated for each drain site see examples in fig 5 2 6 evaluation of groundwater levels with simulated spatial df most drain sites lacked relevant groundwater level observations except two drain sites in jylland norsminde3 and gedved hence groundwater levels were not included in the model calibration however observations from these two drain sites were used to evaluate the validity of the simulated spatial df the gedved drain site was not included among the 26 drain sites used for calibration because drain flow data were only available after 2019 the two sites norsminde3 and gedved were covered by a dense network of 1 5 m deep piezometers with a screen from 0 5 m to 1 5 m norsminde3 has 31 piezometers and gedved has 28 piezometers monthly observations of groundwater levels were available only for the winter seasons between december 2019 and may 2022 for both drain sites an observation based estimate of drain flow probability was calculated using the groundwater levels for the winter months for each month if the observed groundwater level was above the drain depth we assumed there is drainage the drain flow probability was derived using the eq 2 for each piezometer 2 d r a i n f l o w p r o b a b i l i t y n o o f m o n t h s w i t h d r a i n a g e t o t a l n o o f m o n t h s this estimate of drain flow probability for each piezometer was expected to be correlated to its corresponding simulated df value spearman correlations were derived between the drain flow probability estimates and model simulated df to validate the drain model spatial df accuracy 2 7 physical control variables and spatial df correlation analysis the second objective of this study was to assess the control of physical variables on the spatial distribution of df to understand what drives the spatial patterns of drain flow different topographical and pedo geological variables were selected for the correlation analysis topographical variables were twi tpi terrain ruggedness index tri roughness slope curvature plan curvature and profile curvature all topographic variables were derived from the digital elevation model in 10 m resolution twi represents water accumulation from all upstream grid cells at a specific grid cell it is calculated as 3 t w i l n x t a n y in eq 3 x is the upslope contributing area and y is the slope angle in radians beven and kirkby 1979 mattivi et al 2019 tpi refers to the difference between the central grid cell s elevation and the average elevation of all neighboring grid cells in a specific radius gallant and wilson 2000 we calculated tpi for 10 m 20 m 100 m and 200 m radii denoted as tpi 10m tpi 20m tpi 100m and tpi 200m respectively tpi represents relative differences in topography on the other hand tri compares a central grid cell with its neighbors by taking the absolute values of the differences between the central grid cell and neighboring grid cells and averaging the result riley et al 1999 wilson et al 2007 we calculated tri in a 300 m radius denoted as tri 300m roughness is the degree of irregularity of the catchment surface it is estimated by the largest inter cell difference between a central grid cell and its adjacent cell wilson et al 2007 a slope is a change in elevation over a distance horn 1981 curvature represents the shape of a slope whether it is convex or concave the vertical shape of the slope parallel to the slope is called profile curvature the horizontal shape of the slope perpendicular to the slope is called plan curvature curvature is calculated by fitting a surface to the central cell and its neighbors it combines profile and plan curvature plan curvature affects the flow convergence or divergence while profile curvature affects the flow acceleration zevenbergen and thorne 1987 the pedo geological variables used for correlation analysis were clay content in horizon a 0 5 cm depth horizon b 5 15 cm horizon c 15 30 cm horizon d 30 60 cm the thickness of first clay layer and sand layer the clay content maps were developed by adhikari et al 2013 and they were interpolated from their native 30 m resolution to 10 m the average clay content map was also generated by taking the average clay content in horizon a to c 0 30 m the thickness of the first clay layer and the sand layer was obtained from the nationwide hydrogeological interpretation epa 2020 and they were interpolated from their native 100 m resolution to 10 m covariance among the identified physical variables was used to exclude redundant variables pearson correlation between simulated spatial df and the unique physical variables was determined for all drain sites moreover the pearson correlation was also estimated on a national scale by combining grid cells of all drain sites in one dataset 3 results 3 1 performance of 10 m resolution drain models the average pbias and kge across 5 selected solutions were 6 7 and 0 53 respectively fig 3 shows the mean model performance of 26 drain sites for the two objective functions kge and pbias each point represents one of the 2500 model iterations of the 5 calibrations this visualizes the trade off between optimal kge performance and optimal pbias the selected 5 solutions along the pareto front are indicated in red in fig 3 and the resulting calibrated parameter values are displayed in table 2 mean drain site kge across the 5 selected solutions varied between 0 1 and 0 8 fig 4 with all drain sites except vadum norsminde8 10 and lolland3 showing a mean kge above 0 4 pbias values along all drain sites varied from 52 to 40 fig 4 mean pbias value was below 25 in all drain sites except norsminde4 norsminde5 norsminde7 norsminde8 norsminde9 norsminde10 norsminde11 lillebæk3 lolland3 the variation in kge value across the 5 selected solutions was highest among the 4 lillebæk sites and lolland3 the lillebæk and lolland drain sites also depicted higher variations in pbias values compared to other drain sites the variation in kge and pbias red line fig 4 highlighted the variation in drain flow prediction among different solutions fig 4 variations in the lillebæk sites were high due to high variation in the region specific parameters p3 to p8 for the fyn region across the 5 solutions shown in table 2 3 2 spatial distribution of df after calibrating the 10 m resolution drain models we obtained the mean df across the 5 selected solutions fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of df in two drain sites gyldenholm4 and norsminde1 fig 5a the blue to cyan color indicates low df and the yellow to red color indicates high df recharge from cells with a low df or even a df of zero can also contribute to draining flow as the recharged water can travel laterally to downstream cells where it may upwell and potentially drain from there that means that df values above 1 represent areas where subsurface flow is accumulated from neighboring upstream cells or deeper layers fig 5b shows the standard deviation of df across the 5 selected solutions in gyldenholm 4 the northwestern part showed higher standard deviation than the southeastern part while in norsminde1 the standard deviation is higher only in high df areas fig 5 the difference in the standard deviation in gyldenholm4 might be because of the more rugged terrain in the northwestern part than in the southeastern part fig 5 the variation in df between different drain sites fig 6 was well captured with pearson r of 0 6 indicating that the models can differentiate between high and low dfs at the field scale despite the joint calibration fig 6 illustrates the spatial average of simulated df and observed df for calibration period of each drain site the 10 m resolution drain models underestimated df in 10 of 26 drain sites while the remaining 16 overestimated df fig 6 among all drain sites vadum has the highest standard deviation in spatial df followed by norsminde fillerup ulvsborg and gyldenholm drain sites fig 6 lolland and lillebæk drain sites show the lowest spatial standard deviation fig 6 the spatial variability in simulated df within each drain site is also shown in fig 6 using the spatial standard deviation of simulated df 3 3 spatial comparison of simulated df and drain flow probability satisfactory spearman correlations between simulated df and drain probability were observed for both gedved 0 68 and norsminde3 0 50 the spatial comparison of simulated df with drain flow probability estimates is shown in fig 7 the spearman correlation was lower in norsminde because of one outlier piezometer 1 the removal of piezometer 1 increased the spearman correlation to 0 63 fig 7 3 4 pedo geological and topographical correlations with spatial df before conducting a correlation analysis between simulated spatial df and physical variables of geology and topography described in section 2 7 a covariance matrix was used to exclude the redundant variables that are highly correlated with a pearson r 0 75 after the covariance analysis the redundant variables such as tpi 10 m tpi 100m curvature clay content a horizon clay content b horizon clay content c horizon clay content d horizon and roughness were excluded fig 8 fig 9 shows the correlation matrix between simulated spatial df and non redundant physical variables two distinct pedo geological variables that showed the highest correlation were average clay content and clay thickness while the two distinct topographical variables that showed the highest correlation were tpi 20m and twi the national scale correlations considering all drain sites together labeled as dk in fig 9 showed the highest correlation of spatial df with topographical variables tpi 20m pearson r 0 6 and twi 0 47 overall a decrease in correlation was observed from the field scale to the national scale lolland and lillebæk drain sites showed a correlation of spatial df with both pedo geological and topographical variables however gyldenholm and norsminde drain sites displayed spatial df correlation only with topographical variables in general most of the drain sites consistently showed a high correlation with topographical variables tpi 20m twi plan curvature and profile curvature however among the topographical variables the two most important variables were tpi 20m and twi as they showed the highest correlation with spatial df among the pedo geological variables average clay content showed the highest correlation with spatial df in lolland1 and 3 of the lillebæk sites clay thickness m showed a weak correlation with spatial df in lillebæk 4 and lolland1 4 discussion 4 1 performance equifinality and transferability of 10 m resolution drain models the 10 m resolution drain models simulated drain flow dynamics and overall drain flow volumes well as indicated by kge and pbias considering the combined calibration of 26 drain sites the average pbias of 6 7 across 5 selected solutions indicated a slight underestimation of drain flow in contrast the average kge of 0 53 across 5 selected solutions indicated a good ability to follow drain flow temporal dynamics especially considering the precipitation uncertainty at the event scale and field scale and the extreme peaks of drain flow many previous studies used models to simulate drain flow dynamics but mainly for single drain sites boico et al 2022 de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2019b 2019a los huertos and smith 2013 salo et al 2017 jeantet et al 2021 and motarjemi et al 2021 modeled multiple drain sites using lumped and machine learning models respectively the lumped model developed by jeantet et al 2021 for 22 drain sites showed kge ranges between 0 36 and 0 82 with overall model drain flow performance above 0 5 the drain flow results for the machine learning model developed by motarjemi et al 2021 for 53 drain stations had nash sutcliffe efficiency nse ranging from 0 94 0 77 moreover motarjemi et al 2021 simulated yearly drain flow instead of daily which is much easier to predict than daily drain flows the mike she model developed by hansen et al 2013 for 5 clustered drain sites within the lillebæk catchment showed drain flow nse value range from 1 09 0 18 therefore model performance for drain flows in these previously studied lumped models machine learning models or single catchment models was not higher than our 10 m resolution drain models a major source of uncertainty in simulated drain flows was climate forcing since precipitation was obtained from the national rain gauge network potentially struggling with field scale variations in precipitation however pbias was high 25 for many drain sites this high pbias could be due to the inaccuracy of the delineated drain site and its total area drain site delineations were provided by the projects which performed the drain flow monitoring and were based on a combination of knowledge about the actual tile drainage network and topographical delineations for small drain sites and complex tile drainage networks the uncertainty in the estimated area contributing to drain flow at the drain station was significant moreover measurement uncertainty in drain flow observations also affected model performance beven 1993 proposed the equifinality concept for hydrological modeling that states more than one solution such as one parameter set can have equally good model performance amongst others asadzadeh and tolson 2013 and anderson et al 2015 also highlighted the non uniqueness of drain models that more than one reasonable model with different combinations of parameter sets could exist we used a selection of 5 solutions with equally good performance to address the uncertainty of model parameters on generated drain flow the limitation to 5 solutions was due to the computational limitations ideally this model ensemble would have been larger however we covered a diverse range in parameter sets while selecting our 5 solutions and observed no difference in the results when the correlation between spatial df and physical control variables was estimated separately for each of the 5 selected solutions many drain models are only applicable to specific sites due to space and time specific calibration such site specific calibrated models have low transferability as they cannot replicate the dynamics for other regions montanari et al 2013 the 10 m resolution drain models are assumed to be valid and transferable to all of denmark as they were based on spatially consistent parametrization combined with a joint calibration for all 26 drain sites this ensured that parameters were not overfitted to individual sites but represented the best trade off for performance across various sites 4 2 applicability of correlation analysis the pertinency of correlation analysis and thereby the ability to generalize findings depends on the representation of the topographical and pedo geological variability of denmark s drained area by the 26 drain sites studied moller et al 2018 developed a map for denmark displaying the probability of artificial drainage systems this probability map was used to limit the following analysis to areas across denmark that are likely drained using 33 probability as a cutoff for determining the drained areas we evaluated whether the range of each physical variable across likely drained areas in denmark is covered by our 26 drain sites the range of values for the 4 most important variables for both the likely drained areas in denmark and the 26 drain sites are shown in fig 10 the variability in all topographical and pedo geological variables was covered in the 26 drain sites while clay content below 10 is underrepresented therefore our findings do not apply to regions with a low clay content below 10 the regions with low clay content were not covered due to limited drain flow data however areas with a clay content below 10 are less likely to be drained artificially 4 3 spatial df representation of tile drain site on 100 m resolution can not provide an accurate picture of spatial variation within field scale using the 10 m drain models we produced the spatial patterns of drain flow and also validated them by examining the correlation between df spatial patterns and observed drain probability on two drain sites therefore the current study provides a more detailed spatial variation of df on field scale which allow a better understanding of drain flow behavior with respect to field geology and topography this was lacking in the previously existing 100 m dk model hip a hydrological understanding of the spatial distribution of drain flow on the field scale is critical for water quality regulation in the agricultural sector this study benefits the water managers in identifying areas of high drain flows that feed agricultural water excess and nutrient loads to surface water bodies 4 4 correlation analysis of spatial df with physical control variables among all topographical and pedo geological variables tpi 20m and twi were the most important in controlling the spatial distribution of df on the national scale tpi in essence represents the localized relative difference in topography the negative correlation between tpi and spatial df indicated that localized topographical peaks tpi 0 have lower df value and drain flow twi represents the tendency of water to accumulate at a point in space a positive correlation of spatial df with twi indicated that higher water accumulation produces higher df value and drain flow at a specific point pedo geological variables showed no strong correlation with df spatial on national scale however pedo geological variables could have shown a higher correlation if they were available in higher resolution in this study pedo geological variables were downscaled from 100 m or 30 m resolution to 10 m resolution see section 2 7 all drain sites showed a similar trend to the national scale except lillebæk sites and lolland sites the spatial df patterns in lillebæk and lolland sites showed some correlation with clay content and not with topographical variables this distinct behavior in the lillebæk and lolland sites could be related to flat topography indicated by the lowest standard deviation of elevation table 1 and highest average clay content among all drain sites table 1 high clay content were translated to low hydraulic conductivities in the models low hydraulic conductivity limits groundwater flows so the topographical influence is limited as subsurface lateral flow from peaks to depressions is prevented heath 1983 this might be the reason for topographical variables not showing a significant correlation 5 conclusions the main objectives of this study were to simulate daily drain flow dynamics for 26 drain sites in 10 m resolution and identify the potentially important physical control variables to understand better the physical features that drive spatial variation in drain flow we jointly calibrated 26 high resolution physical based fully distributed models to tile drainage discharge at the outlet of 26 tile drained areas 1 120 ha the jointly calibrated models succeeded in simulating both discharge dynamics mean kge of 0 56 and overall volumes mean pbias of 6 7 for all 26 drain sites the mean pbias of 6 7 suggests a slight underestimation of drain flow by the models compared with previous studies that mainly focused on single drain sites or lumped models our high resolution models demonstrated better performance in simulating drain flows the high resolution models developed in this study also simulated the spatial variability of drain flow generation within agricultural fields the simulated spatial variability in drain flow generation was evaluated with observed shallow groundwater levels at two sites these models could be a valuable tool for understanding and managing water resources at the field scale furthermore we investigated the relationship between simulated drain flow fraction and landscape covariates a linear correlation analysis showed that the topographical position index and topographical wetness index were the primary covariates influencing the spatial distribution of drain flow fraction however in sites with a high clay content in the soil the clay content percentage was an important control on the spatial distribution of drain flow fraction these results contribute to our understanding of the key drivers behind the variability of drain flow fraction

7735,study region denmark study focus tile drainage widespread across agricultural areas in denmark significantly impacts the hydrological cycle tile drain flow dynamics and their spatial patterns are crucial for water managers to address water quality and quantity issues however these processes are challenging to simulate accurately in this study we developed 10 m resolution drain models in mike she for 26 drain sites across denmark to predict drain flow spatial and temporal dynamics joint calibration of all drain models was conducted by evaluating pbias and kge of simulated and observed drain flow subsequently we performed a correlation analysis between physical parameters and spatial patterns of simulated drain fraction df ratio of drain flow to recharge per grid cell new hydrological insights the jointly calibrated models achieved average pbias and kge of 6 7 and 0 53 respectively for drain flow predictions across 26 drain sites the correlation of df with topographical variables was highest on a national scale and on most of the drain sites including gyldenholm1 4 norsminde1 11 and other jylland drain sites lillebæk drain sites showed a high correlation with average clay content in 0 30 cm layer of soil thus in addition to developing scalable fine resolution drain models for denmark this study also identifies the control parameters for spatial patterns of drain flows across denmark graphical abstract ga1 keywords subsurface drains shallow groundwater modeling hydrogeological variables topographical variables data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction tile drainage is an agricultural technique for regulating the subsurface water level in waterlogged regions to make the land more productive and better suited for agriculture zucker and brown 1998 however there are environmental consequences associated with tile drained agricultural areas i e increased transport of high nutrient loads to surface waters skaggs et al 1994 stenberg et al 2012 these environmental consequences are due to decreased groundwater travel times schilling et al 2012 and increased annual stream flow volumes magner et al 2004 therefore investigation of tile drain flows is important for water managers to predetermine their influences on the hydrological cycle to address the changes in the hydrological cycle due to tile drains it is crucial to not only understand and quantify temporal drain flow dynamics but also their spatial flow patterns to the best of our knowledge no methods exist that directly measure the spatial distribution of drain flows across the drain site without the use of modeling techniques hansen et al 2019a and boico et al 2022 studied the spatial distribution of drain flows while many previous studies investigated only temporal drain flow dynamics using physics based models de schepper et al 2017 salo et al 2017 sammons et al 2005 turunen et al 2013 youssef et al 2021 all these studies developed models for single drain sites despite being effective for specific sites these physics based models are likely not scalable because a model tested on one or two sites might not be effective in capturing hydrological dynamics on other neighboring catchments grayson et al 1992 heuvelmans et al 2004 montanari et al 2013 developing physics based models for multiple sites is a cumbersome task due to the large number of parameters involved in the calibration process basha et al 2008 beven 1989 but it is certainly valuable for scalability of hydrololgical models for europe a physics based model called macro evaluates drain flow system performance but it is a one dimensional model and obtaining detailed spatial information is rather difficult jarvis and larsbo 2012 jeantet et al 2021 larsbo et al 2005 similarly there are also lumped and semi conceptual models that have been developed for drain flow prediction on multiple sites beskow et al 2011 jeantet et al 2021 perrin et al 2003 however lumped and semi conceptual models fail to consider physics based parameters and their spatial variability abbott et al 1986 we suggest a joint calibration of various drain sites using physics based models can help to address the scalability issue if selected drain sites cover all variability in their physical characteristics the spatial patterns of generated drain flow are complex and not only influenced by existing drain infrastructure but also controlled by physical characteristics such as geology and topography hansen et al 2013 2019a motarjemi et al 2021 the influence of topography and pedo geological variables have been studied on groundwater level and subsurface flows condon and maxwell 2015 dahl et al 2007 but not a lot of research has been conducted specifically on tile drain flows few studies have been conducted to improve the understanding of spatial drain flow patterns and to identify the most influential topographical and pedo geological variables for drain flows boico et al 2022 hansen et al 2019b 2019a motarjemi et al 2021 motarjemi et al 2021 investigated the influence of physical variables such as clay content slope topographical wetness index twi flow accumulation and topographical position index tpi these variables were studied on yearly drain flow amounts for multiple drain sites using machine learning models e g random forest neural networks support vector machines and cubist models motarjemi et al 2021 according to the authors the correlation between spatial patterns of drain flows and physical variables were not assessed in their study therefore no significant correlation was found between temporal drain flow and topographical indexes motarjemi et al 2021 boico et al 2022 studied the sensitivity of hydraulic conductivities and specific yields on spatial patterns of drain flows using hydrogeosphere however boico et al 2022 did not include the influence of topographical variables but the authors recommended it for future investigations hansen et al 2019a studied the correlation between the spatial distribution of drain flow and twi in 100 m resolution but found no significant correlation the authors also investigated the impact of deeper geological layers below the tile drain level and found geological layers upto 23 3 m depth significant for the spatial distribution of drain flow hansen et al 2019a de schepper et al 2017 examined the seasonal drain flow patterns using hydrogeosphere and mike she they concluded that shallow underground structures influence the drain flows hansen et al 2019b studied influencing parameters for the shallow drain flow using feflow and found geology below 3 m depth is also a significant parameter for accurate drain flow predictions previously researchers attempted to investigate temporal drain flow dynamics with their physical variables however a gap exists in assessing the correlations between the spatial distribution of drain flow and physical variables at the field scale the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to develop jointly calibrated physics based models to predict drain flow temporal and spatial dynamics for multiple catchments across denmark 2 to improve our understanding of how physical variables such as geology and topography influence the spatial distribution of drain flow in tile drained agricultural areas to achieve the objectives we simulated daily drain flow dynamics for 26 drain sites in 10 m resolution using mike she after joint calibration of all 26 drain sites to one common parameter set we produced spatial maps of simulated drain fraction df the ratio of drainage volume to recharge volume per grid these maps were compared to maps of potentially important physical control variables to generate a better understanding of physical features that drive spatial variation in drain flow and df the use of multiple sites in a joint calibration improves the robustness of the parameter estimation and coverage of physical control variables across drained regions in denmark 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection drain stations daily drain flow data and the area of drain sites are available across denmark for 26 drain sites table 1 all drain sites were tile drained and varied between 1 and 120 ha based on hydrogeological similarity denmark is divided into 3 main regions fyn jylland and sjælland lolland in fyn data are available for 4 sites in sjælland lolland data are available for 8 sites in total 4 sites in gyldenholm and 4 in lolland for jylland data are available for a total of 14 sites out of 14 sites 11 are in the norsminde catchment mid jylland 1 in vadum upper jylland 1 in fillerup mid jylland and 1 in ulvsborg mid jylland fig 1 shows the locations of drain sites and table 1 shows properties and their division based on regions 2 2 existing national hydrological model of denmark national hydrological model of denmark known as dk model hip was the starting point for the development of the fine scale models for all drain sites dk model hip is a distributed hydrological model with a horizontal resolution of 100 m henriksen et al 2020 stisen et al 2019 this model cannot produce spatial drain flow patterns on the field scale 1 120 ha for two reasons firstly the model is not validated against direct drain flow observations secondly the coarse resolution makes it challenging to decipher field scale controls of drain flow patterns for example the most relevant driver of drain flow patterns is water table depth with significant variations in water table depth below 100 m resolution koch et al 2021 the drain models developed in the current study were based on dk model hip but with a modified horizontal resolution of 10 m to better capture the surface groundwater processes henriksen et al 2020 the dk model hip is setup up in the mike she model code abbott et al 1986 dhi 2020 and simulates 3d subsurface flow as well as 2d overland flow river flow and a simple representation of root zone processes the model is forced by a national gridded daily dataset of precipitation 10 km resolution temperature and reference evapotranspiration 20 km resolution scharling 1999a 1999b all relevant details related to the setup and parameterization of the 100 m dk model hip can be found in henriksen et al 2020 2 3 adaptation to the 10 m resolution drain models the 10 m resolution drain models were set up in the mike she model code for each of the specific drain site area the dynamic boundary conditions and baseline model structure were used from the dk model hip the catchment area was extended in the detailed models with a buffer of 200 m to alleviate the effect of the applied dynamic boundary conditions of the dk model hip the purpose of the 10 m resolution drain models was to estimate the spatial distribution of df in higher resolution than the 100 m dk model hip therefore we refined relevant topographic geologic and drain parameters to 10 m resolution all other inputs and forcing remained the same as in the 100 m dk model hip the refined parameters included surface topography drain time constant and drain depth paved area fraction and the hydraulic conductivity of the uppermost geological layer the uppermost 2 m none of the 26 models have interference from streams and lakes pumping wells or irrigation therefore these packages were disabled in mike she we assumed drains in all model cells because the exact location of drainpipes was unknown and mike she only allows an implicit representation of drains in the model we considered this assumption reasonable as the modeled areas are known to be tile drained and drain flow in mike she will only be generated in cells when groundwater levels are above drain depth at a particular time as tile drains are located between 0 5 and 2 m depth most typically around 1 m one of the most important parameters to study drain flows was the hydraulic conductivity of the uppermost layer of the subsurface 2 m thickness in the current setup the existing dk model hip used a soil class based hydraulic conductivity map jakobsen et al 2015 however for the 10 m resolution drain models we aimed to develop a distributed hydraulic conductivity map in high resolution adhikari et al 2013 have developed clay content maps for all of denmark in 30 m resolution and we considered these maps suitable for producing hydraulic conductivity maps for our study therefore we developed a linear pedo transfer function based on the existing clay content map for denmark to produce a distributed hydraulic conductivity map in 30 m resolution 2 4 joint calibration of 10 m resolution drain models a joint automatic calibration was performed across all the drain sites to obtain a joint and robust parameter set applicable to all drain sites across denmark each drain site has daily drain flow observations for a specific period table 1 which implies that evaluation periods for each site also vary possible evaluation periods were limited to the period between 1990 and 2019 based on the availability of daily climate data and groundwater boundary conditions from the national 100 m model we used nationally coherent parameter sets this calibration was in accordance with the calibration scheme for the 100 m hip dk model which was calibrated with one national parametrization scheme of each parameter to secure spatial consistency in model results we used the ostrich calibration software the pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search padds algorithm of ostrich is a global multi objective optimizer asadzadeh and tolson 2013 matott 2017 it determines a pareto front allowing for evaluation of the trade off between multiple objective function groups without having to apply weights to these groups prior to calibration in our calibration we used two objective function groups the kling gupta efficiency kge and percentage bias pbias between daily simulated and observed drain flow at the outlet of each drain site mean kge and mean pbias across 26 drain models were used by padds algorithm to determine the pareto front see fig 3 kge and pbias were used in the objective function because kge describes the temporal drain flow performance and pbias describes whether simulated drain flows are overestimated or underestimated the selection of calibration parameters was based on past experience with the dk model henriksen et al 2020 højberg et al 2015 and past studies related to danish drain sites de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2013 the most common parameters selected in previous drain models included the hydraulic conductivity of soil shallow geologic layers and drain parameters such as drain time constant and drain depth de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2019b 2013 2019a the deeper geological layers approximately below 20 m were not included in calibration as this study focused on the shallow groundwater system influencing the drain system and has relatively low influence from lateral flows de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2013 we believe calibration of deeper geological layers to drain flow observations would not produce better parameterization for a deeper saturated zone moreover for the deeper geologic layers dynamic boundary conditions from the 100 m dk model hip were used and altering the hydrogeological parameters for these layers would conflict with the applied 100 m dk model hip s boundary conditions the calibration parameters are shown in fig 2 they include the slope p1 and intercept p2 of the pedo transfer function to convert the clay content map into maps of hydraulic conductivity for the upper 2 m of soil parameters p3 p4 and p5 were selected as the hydraulic conductivity of the first clay layer below 2 m depth for sjælland lolland jylland and fyn respectively parameters p6 p7 and p8 describe factors representing the hydraulic conductivity ratio of the first sand to the first clay layer for sjælland lolland jylland and fyn respectively p6 p7 and p8 were selected to ensure that the clay layers hydraulic conductivity is always lower than the sand layers furthermore parameter p9 describes the rooting depth of crops parameters p10 and p11 describe the drain parameters where p10 is the drain time constant that controls the conductance of subsurface drains and p11 is the drain depth the parameters p3 to p8 were related to the hydraulic conductivity of shallow geological layers and were region dependent previously the dk model hip and the national geological model of denmark known as fohm model also divided denmark into three hydrogeologically distinct regions fyn sjælland lolland jylland epa 2020 henriksen et al 2019 højberg et al 2015 this region dependency in our models also originates from the same fact that the hydrogeologic representation originates from three regional hydrogeologic models and the calibration procedure of the dk model hip also follows this regional division five separate calibration runs were conducted with an identical setup except for different random seeds of the padds algorithm each calibration run included 500 iterations the random seed was changed to obtain different initial parameters at the beginning of each calibration run which can influence the further parameter updates of the algorithm the use of different random seeds helps to explore a wider range of possible parameter values and avoid getting stuck in a local optimum which can happen despite padds being a global optimizer the procedure of using different random seeds is also in line with suggestions by the developers of the algorithm asadzadeh and tolson 2013 after 5 calibration runs we observed that model performances was rather consistent and did not improve significantly therefore we conducted only 5 calibration runs in 5 calibration runs total 2500 model iterations were performed each iteration ran all 26 drain models and assembled results based on the multi objective function out of 2500 models iterations 5 solutions parameter sets were selected instead of only a single solution because more than one solution parameter sets can give an equally good model performance moreover including multiple solutions is considered more robust and can help to incorporate differences in model results due to parameter uncertainty the selection criteria were to choose solutions on the pareto front fig 3 with comparably good model performance while showing some variations in the parameter set and representing the trade off between kge and pbias after calibration the selected 5 parameter sets were run for all drain site models from 1990 to 2019 2 5 drain fraction df df is a measure of the average drain flow to recharge ratio for a given time to calculate the df spatially we calculated df for each grid cell of the 26 models using eq 1 1 d f t 1 n d t t 1 n r t in eq 1 d is the volume of drain flow generated in a specific cell r is the recharge volume in the same cell t is the stress period in days and n is the total number of stress periods a df of zero indicates no drain flow while a value between 0 and 1 indicates recharge is higher than drain flow df values above 1 indicate that drain flow is higher than recharge df values above 1 can occur in areas with additional sources of water to the grid e g lateral and upward groundwater fluxes maps of total drain flow and total recharge over 30 years from 1990 to 2019 were acquired from the models to produce climate normalized estimates independent of the varying observation records for each drain site simulated spatial df was calculated using the maps of 30 year recharge and 30 year drain flow for all 5 solutions finally the mean and standard deviation of the simulated spatial df map across 5 solutions were calculated for each drain site see examples in fig 5 2 6 evaluation of groundwater levels with simulated spatial df most drain sites lacked relevant groundwater level observations except two drain sites in jylland norsminde3 and gedved hence groundwater levels were not included in the model calibration however observations from these two drain sites were used to evaluate the validity of the simulated spatial df the gedved drain site was not included among the 26 drain sites used for calibration because drain flow data were only available after 2019 the two sites norsminde3 and gedved were covered by a dense network of 1 5 m deep piezometers with a screen from 0 5 m to 1 5 m norsminde3 has 31 piezometers and gedved has 28 piezometers monthly observations of groundwater levels were available only for the winter seasons between december 2019 and may 2022 for both drain sites an observation based estimate of drain flow probability was calculated using the groundwater levels for the winter months for each month if the observed groundwater level was above the drain depth we assumed there is drainage the drain flow probability was derived using the eq 2 for each piezometer 2 d r a i n f l o w p r o b a b i l i t y n o o f m o n t h s w i t h d r a i n a g e t o t a l n o o f m o n t h s this estimate of drain flow probability for each piezometer was expected to be correlated to its corresponding simulated df value spearman correlations were derived between the drain flow probability estimates and model simulated df to validate the drain model spatial df accuracy 2 7 physical control variables and spatial df correlation analysis the second objective of this study was to assess the control of physical variables on the spatial distribution of df to understand what drives the spatial patterns of drain flow different topographical and pedo geological variables were selected for the correlation analysis topographical variables were twi tpi terrain ruggedness index tri roughness slope curvature plan curvature and profile curvature all topographic variables were derived from the digital elevation model in 10 m resolution twi represents water accumulation from all upstream grid cells at a specific grid cell it is calculated as 3 t w i l n x t a n y in eq 3 x is the upslope contributing area and y is the slope angle in radians beven and kirkby 1979 mattivi et al 2019 tpi refers to the difference between the central grid cell s elevation and the average elevation of all neighboring grid cells in a specific radius gallant and wilson 2000 we calculated tpi for 10 m 20 m 100 m and 200 m radii denoted as tpi 10m tpi 20m tpi 100m and tpi 200m respectively tpi represents relative differences in topography on the other hand tri compares a central grid cell with its neighbors by taking the absolute values of the differences between the central grid cell and neighboring grid cells and averaging the result riley et al 1999 wilson et al 2007 we calculated tri in a 300 m radius denoted as tri 300m roughness is the degree of irregularity of the catchment surface it is estimated by the largest inter cell difference between a central grid cell and its adjacent cell wilson et al 2007 a slope is a change in elevation over a distance horn 1981 curvature represents the shape of a slope whether it is convex or concave the vertical shape of the slope parallel to the slope is called profile curvature the horizontal shape of the slope perpendicular to the slope is called plan curvature curvature is calculated by fitting a surface to the central cell and its neighbors it combines profile and plan curvature plan curvature affects the flow convergence or divergence while profile curvature affects the flow acceleration zevenbergen and thorne 1987 the pedo geological variables used for correlation analysis were clay content in horizon a 0 5 cm depth horizon b 5 15 cm horizon c 15 30 cm horizon d 30 60 cm the thickness of first clay layer and sand layer the clay content maps were developed by adhikari et al 2013 and they were interpolated from their native 30 m resolution to 10 m the average clay content map was also generated by taking the average clay content in horizon a to c 0 30 m the thickness of the first clay layer and the sand layer was obtained from the nationwide hydrogeological interpretation epa 2020 and they were interpolated from their native 100 m resolution to 10 m covariance among the identified physical variables was used to exclude redundant variables pearson correlation between simulated spatial df and the unique physical variables was determined for all drain sites moreover the pearson correlation was also estimated on a national scale by combining grid cells of all drain sites in one dataset 3 results 3 1 performance of 10 m resolution drain models the average pbias and kge across 5 selected solutions were 6 7 and 0 53 respectively fig 3 shows the mean model performance of 26 drain sites for the two objective functions kge and pbias each point represents one of the 2500 model iterations of the 5 calibrations this visualizes the trade off between optimal kge performance and optimal pbias the selected 5 solutions along the pareto front are indicated in red in fig 3 and the resulting calibrated parameter values are displayed in table 2 mean drain site kge across the 5 selected solutions varied between 0 1 and 0 8 fig 4 with all drain sites except vadum norsminde8 10 and lolland3 showing a mean kge above 0 4 pbias values along all drain sites varied from 52 to 40 fig 4 mean pbias value was below 25 in all drain sites except norsminde4 norsminde5 norsminde7 norsminde8 norsminde9 norsminde10 norsminde11 lillebæk3 lolland3 the variation in kge value across the 5 selected solutions was highest among the 4 lillebæk sites and lolland3 the lillebæk and lolland drain sites also depicted higher variations in pbias values compared to other drain sites the variation in kge and pbias red line fig 4 highlighted the variation in drain flow prediction among different solutions fig 4 variations in the lillebæk sites were high due to high variation in the region specific parameters p3 to p8 for the fyn region across the 5 solutions shown in table 2 3 2 spatial distribution of df after calibrating the 10 m resolution drain models we obtained the mean df across the 5 selected solutions fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of df in two drain sites gyldenholm4 and norsminde1 fig 5a the blue to cyan color indicates low df and the yellow to red color indicates high df recharge from cells with a low df or even a df of zero can also contribute to draining flow as the recharged water can travel laterally to downstream cells where it may upwell and potentially drain from there that means that df values above 1 represent areas where subsurface flow is accumulated from neighboring upstream cells or deeper layers fig 5b shows the standard deviation of df across the 5 selected solutions in gyldenholm 4 the northwestern part showed higher standard deviation than the southeastern part while in norsminde1 the standard deviation is higher only in high df areas fig 5 the difference in the standard deviation in gyldenholm4 might be because of the more rugged terrain in the northwestern part than in the southeastern part fig 5 the variation in df between different drain sites fig 6 was well captured with pearson r of 0 6 indicating that the models can differentiate between high and low dfs at the field scale despite the joint calibration fig 6 illustrates the spatial average of simulated df and observed df for calibration period of each drain site the 10 m resolution drain models underestimated df in 10 of 26 drain sites while the remaining 16 overestimated df fig 6 among all drain sites vadum has the highest standard deviation in spatial df followed by norsminde fillerup ulvsborg and gyldenholm drain sites fig 6 lolland and lillebæk drain sites show the lowest spatial standard deviation fig 6 the spatial variability in simulated df within each drain site is also shown in fig 6 using the spatial standard deviation of simulated df 3 3 spatial comparison of simulated df and drain flow probability satisfactory spearman correlations between simulated df and drain probability were observed for both gedved 0 68 and norsminde3 0 50 the spatial comparison of simulated df with drain flow probability estimates is shown in fig 7 the spearman correlation was lower in norsminde because of one outlier piezometer 1 the removal of piezometer 1 increased the spearman correlation to 0 63 fig 7 3 4 pedo geological and topographical correlations with spatial df before conducting a correlation analysis between simulated spatial df and physical variables of geology and topography described in section 2 7 a covariance matrix was used to exclude the redundant variables that are highly correlated with a pearson r 0 75 after the covariance analysis the redundant variables such as tpi 10 m tpi 100m curvature clay content a horizon clay content b horizon clay content c horizon clay content d horizon and roughness were excluded fig 8 fig 9 shows the correlation matrix between simulated spatial df and non redundant physical variables two distinct pedo geological variables that showed the highest correlation were average clay content and clay thickness while the two distinct topographical variables that showed the highest correlation were tpi 20m and twi the national scale correlations considering all drain sites together labeled as dk in fig 9 showed the highest correlation of spatial df with topographical variables tpi 20m pearson r 0 6 and twi 0 47 overall a decrease in correlation was observed from the field scale to the national scale lolland and lillebæk drain sites showed a correlation of spatial df with both pedo geological and topographical variables however gyldenholm and norsminde drain sites displayed spatial df correlation only with topographical variables in general most of the drain sites consistently showed a high correlation with topographical variables tpi 20m twi plan curvature and profile curvature however among the topographical variables the two most important variables were tpi 20m and twi as they showed the highest correlation with spatial df among the pedo geological variables average clay content showed the highest correlation with spatial df in lolland1 and 3 of the lillebæk sites clay thickness m showed a weak correlation with spatial df in lillebæk 4 and lolland1 4 discussion 4 1 performance equifinality and transferability of 10 m resolution drain models the 10 m resolution drain models simulated drain flow dynamics and overall drain flow volumes well as indicated by kge and pbias considering the combined calibration of 26 drain sites the average pbias of 6 7 across 5 selected solutions indicated a slight underestimation of drain flow in contrast the average kge of 0 53 across 5 selected solutions indicated a good ability to follow drain flow temporal dynamics especially considering the precipitation uncertainty at the event scale and field scale and the extreme peaks of drain flow many previous studies used models to simulate drain flow dynamics but mainly for single drain sites boico et al 2022 de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2019b 2019a los huertos and smith 2013 salo et al 2017 jeantet et al 2021 and motarjemi et al 2021 modeled multiple drain sites using lumped and machine learning models respectively the lumped model developed by jeantet et al 2021 for 22 drain sites showed kge ranges between 0 36 and 0 82 with overall model drain flow performance above 0 5 the drain flow results for the machine learning model developed by motarjemi et al 2021 for 53 drain stations had nash sutcliffe efficiency nse ranging from 0 94 0 77 moreover motarjemi et al 2021 simulated yearly drain flow instead of daily which is much easier to predict than daily drain flows the mike she model developed by hansen et al 2013 for 5 clustered drain sites within the lillebæk catchment showed drain flow nse value range from 1 09 0 18 therefore model performance for drain flows in these previously studied lumped models machine learning models or single catchment models was not higher than our 10 m resolution drain models a major source of uncertainty in simulated drain flows was climate forcing since precipitation was obtained from the national rain gauge network potentially struggling with field scale variations in precipitation however pbias was high 25 for many drain sites this high pbias could be due to the inaccuracy of the delineated drain site and its total area drain site delineations were provided by the projects which performed the drain flow monitoring and were based on a combination of knowledge about the actual tile drainage network and topographical delineations for small drain sites and complex tile drainage networks the uncertainty in the estimated area contributing to drain flow at the drain station was significant moreover measurement uncertainty in drain flow observations also affected model performance beven 1993 proposed the equifinality concept for hydrological modeling that states more than one solution such as one parameter set can have equally good model performance amongst others asadzadeh and tolson 2013 and anderson et al 2015 also highlighted the non uniqueness of drain models that more than one reasonable model with different combinations of parameter sets could exist we used a selection of 5 solutions with equally good performance to address the uncertainty of model parameters on generated drain flow the limitation to 5 solutions was due to the computational limitations ideally this model ensemble would have been larger however we covered a diverse range in parameter sets while selecting our 5 solutions and observed no difference in the results when the correlation between spatial df and physical control variables was estimated separately for each of the 5 selected solutions many drain models are only applicable to specific sites due to space and time specific calibration such site specific calibrated models have low transferability as they cannot replicate the dynamics for other regions montanari et al 2013 the 10 m resolution drain models are assumed to be valid and transferable to all of denmark as they were based on spatially consistent parametrization combined with a joint calibration for all 26 drain sites this ensured that parameters were not overfitted to individual sites but represented the best trade off for performance across various sites 4 2 applicability of correlation analysis the pertinency of correlation analysis and thereby the ability to generalize findings depends on the representation of the topographical and pedo geological variability of denmark s drained area by the 26 drain sites studied moller et al 2018 developed a map for denmark displaying the probability of artificial drainage systems this probability map was used to limit the following analysis to areas across denmark that are likely drained using 33 probability as a cutoff for determining the drained areas we evaluated whether the range of each physical variable across likely drained areas in denmark is covered by our 26 drain sites the range of values for the 4 most important variables for both the likely drained areas in denmark and the 26 drain sites are shown in fig 10 the variability in all topographical and pedo geological variables was covered in the 26 drain sites while clay content below 10 is underrepresented therefore our findings do not apply to regions with a low clay content below 10 the regions with low clay content were not covered due to limited drain flow data however areas with a clay content below 10 are less likely to be drained artificially 4 3 spatial df representation of tile drain site on 100 m resolution can not provide an accurate picture of spatial variation within field scale using the 10 m drain models we produced the spatial patterns of drain flow and also validated them by examining the correlation between df spatial patterns and observed drain probability on two drain sites therefore the current study provides a more detailed spatial variation of df on field scale which allow a better understanding of drain flow behavior with respect to field geology and topography this was lacking in the previously existing 100 m dk model hip a hydrological understanding of the spatial distribution of drain flow on the field scale is critical for water quality regulation in the agricultural sector this study benefits the water managers in identifying areas of high drain flows that feed agricultural water excess and nutrient loads to surface water bodies 4 4 correlation analysis of spatial df with physical control variables among all topographical and pedo geological variables tpi 20m and twi were the most important in controlling the spatial distribution of df on the national scale tpi in essence represents the localized relative difference in topography the negative correlation between tpi and spatial df indicated that localized topographical peaks tpi 0 have lower df value and drain flow twi represents the tendency of water to accumulate at a point in space a positive correlation of spatial df with twi indicated that higher water accumulation produces higher df value and drain flow at a specific point pedo geological variables showed no strong correlation with df spatial on national scale however pedo geological variables could have shown a higher correlation if they were available in higher resolution in this study pedo geological variables were downscaled from 100 m or 30 m resolution to 10 m resolution see section 2 7 all drain sites showed a similar trend to the national scale except lillebæk sites and lolland sites the spatial df patterns in lillebæk and lolland sites showed some correlation with clay content and not with topographical variables this distinct behavior in the lillebæk and lolland sites could be related to flat topography indicated by the lowest standard deviation of elevation table 1 and highest average clay content among all drain sites table 1 high clay content were translated to low hydraulic conductivities in the models low hydraulic conductivity limits groundwater flows so the topographical influence is limited as subsurface lateral flow from peaks to depressions is prevented heath 1983 this might be the reason for topographical variables not showing a significant correlation 5 conclusions the main objectives of this study were to simulate daily drain flow dynamics for 26 drain sites in 10 m resolution and identify the potentially important physical control variables to understand better the physical features that drive spatial variation in drain flow we jointly calibrated 26 high resolution physical based fully distributed models to tile drainage discharge at the outlet of 26 tile drained areas 1 120 ha the jointly calibrated models succeeded in simulating both discharge dynamics mean kge of 0 56 and overall volumes mean pbias of 6 7 for all 26 drain sites the mean pbias of 6 7 suggests a slight underestimation of drain flow by the models compared with previous studies that mainly focused on single drain sites or lumped models our high resolution models demonstrated better performance in simulating drain flows the high resolution models developed in this study also simulated the spatial variability of drain flow generation within agricultural fields the simulated spatial variability in drain flow generation was evaluated with observed shallow groundwater levels at two sites these models could be a valuable tool for understanding and managing water resources at the field scale furthermore we investigated the relationship between simulated drain flow fraction and landscape covariates a linear correlation analysis showed that the topographical position index and topographical wetness index were the primary covariates influencing the spatial distribution of drain flow fraction however in sites with a high clay content in the soil the clay content percentage was an important control on the spatial distribution of drain flow fraction these results contribute to our understanding of the key drivers behind the variability of drain flow fraction

7736,study region yangcheng lake is located northeast of suzhou city one of the most economically developed cities in the yangtze river delta plain china yangcheng lake serves as a storage pool for flood control and water diversion as well as a potable water source for suzhou city in recent years summer cyanobacterial blooms began appearing in yangcheng lake which urgently requires a health evaluation study focus currently there is a three tier analysis system consisting of national provincial and local assessments in china however each tier has a unique set of standards meaning that 1 evaluations between tiers are not comparable and 2 conducting a unified survey and analyzing the results is exceedingly difficult how to develop ways to standardize existing river and lake health evaluation systems in china become a global concern new hydrological insights for the region although the evaluation index system and assessment techniques are consistent throughout all three methods they differ in their handling of index weights and assignment criteria the health evaluation scores of yangcheng lake are in the healthy to sub healthy range with gradually decreasing health from east to west this work synthesized the existing chinese national provincial local health evaluation system and suggested standardizing the index system index weights and evaluation process to provide theoretical support for water resources management and water ecology restoration in freshwater water bodies in china graphical abstract ga1 keywords health assessment normalization aquatic ecological health ecological integrity yangcheng lake data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in addition to serving as the backbone of human sustenance and the source of civilization rivers and lakes are the foundation of socio economic development strategic economic resources and ecological environment controls loïc et al 2021 however in response to dam construction urbanization global warming and other anthropogenic disturbances grill et al 2019 lu et al 2020 trisos et al 2020 freshwater environments and the ecosystems have experienced water shortages physical and chemical pollution eutrophication and various other problems bilal et al 2021 ding et al 2022 yitong et al 2022 which has led to water resource scarcity and the destruction of fish and other aquatic habitats newbold et al 2016 determining how to assess aquatic ecosystem health and implement effective river and lake management and ecological restoration is a prerequisite for restoring the water bodies natural properties and achieving a harmonious coexistence between humans and nature the concept of river and lake health was first mentioned in the water pollution control amendments of the united states 1972 finlayson and brizga 2000 where diagnostic indicators of ecosystem health were listed as physical biological and chemical factors that can maintain the natural structure and function of the ecosystem subsequently australia s health river commission hrc suggested that in addition to maintaining the stability of the river and lake ecosystem s structure and function a healthy river should also meet the needs of regional and watershed economic production in addition the society for ecological restoration science policy working group scr proposed that river health is a certain state or condition that corresponds to the river s local ecological development process and that dynamic changes should stay within a normal range defined by the river s location moreover researchers such as karr 1993 1999 frey 1977 schofield and davies 1996 l mj 1997 simpson and norris 2000 and others have provided insights on river health from different professional backgrounds and perspectives thus the concept of river ecosystem health has been continuously developed and refined at the 2nd yellow river international forum in 2004 li guoying china s minister of water resources advised investing time and resources into maintaining healthy rivers this marked the beginning of china s efforts to assess the health of freshwater ecosystems li 2004 and was followed by the yangtze river and pearl river water resources commissions publicly supporting the concepts of a healthy yangtze river and pearl river respectively jin et al 2009 however since the concept of river ecosystem health is not clearly defined internationally or domestically academicians from the chinese academy of engineering sciences gathered in 2007 to discuss the definition and meaning of river health eventually they unified the various river health definitions and declared that a healthy river or lake should meet reasonable anthropogenic needs while maintaining its own structural and functional stability i e sustainable development wen et al 2007 health assessment methods for rivers and lakes were identified and refined along with a common understanding of what is meant by river and lake health however the initial river and lake health evaluation methods only used a single physical or chemical indicator to make a health determination norris and thoms 1999 over time as collective understanding of the definition of river and lake health deepened the health evaluation methods gradually matured currently river and lake health evaluation methodologies are primarily grouped into two categories biological monitoring methods and comprehensive index methods su et al 2021 the biological monitoring methods are designed to evaluate qualitative or quantitative monitoring data of fish macroinvertebrates algae and aquatic plants in the water body chen et al 2014 liu et al 2019 schofield and davies 1996 sudaryanti et al 2001 wright et al 1984 these methods are suitable for large scale river and lake health surveys as they require a low workload typical biological monitoring methods include the river invertebrate prediction and classification scheme rivpacs wright et al 1984 the australian river assessment scheme ausrivas john 2004 and the eu water framework guidelines wfd kallis and butler 2001 the comprehensive index methods are all inclusive assessments that takes into account the physical chemical biological and social service indicators of rivers and lakes gupta et al 2020 ladson et al 1999 petersen jr 1992 su et al 2020 while these methods involve a large workload they enable a comprehensive look at specific problems associated with river and lake health typical comprehensive index methods include sweden s riparian and riverine environment specifications rce petersen jr 1992 and the australian stream condition index isc ladson et al 1999 using both previously described methods respectively china has conducted numerous health evaluations on rivers lakes reservoirs and other water bodies and has achieved abundant and various results pan et al 2021 ren et al 2022 shan et al 2021 however because most of these evaluations were conducted for research purposes the evaluation methods within and between regions are inconsistent and the reliability of the results needs further verification in order to form an established methodology nationwide in 2010 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china launched a pilot health assessment of important rivers and lakes in 2020 they organized nationally renowned water research institutions to compile the river and lake health evaluation guide trial which specified the index system scoring criteria and scoring methods for the first time these newly developed guidelines were implemented in lasa river tibet zhang et al 2021 currently there is a three tier analysis system consisting of national provincial and local assessments each of which has its own unique set of standards the similarities and differences between the three tier evaluation system were carried out from the definition of lake health evaluation index system indicator weights allocation health status classification criteria and health condition assignment method there is a lack of analysis of the similarities and paradoxes between the three tier system thus the aim of this study was unify the standard for river and lake health evaluations across all three tiers and adjust the methodology proposed by the ministry of water resources such that it is appropriate for rivers and lakes in various environments e g plateau mountainous and plains areas to this end the health evaluation methods proposed by the ministry of water resources jiangsu province and suzhou city were jointly used to evaluate yangcheng lake a typical lake in suzhou jiangsu province subsequently the results were analyzed to 1 what are the similarities and differences between different tiers of the evaluation system 2 which method works better for lake health evaluations in various environments and why 3 how to develop ways to standardize existing lake health evaluation systems in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area yangcheng lake is one of the most important freshwater lakes in taihu lake basin in addition to its unique ecology yangcheng lake serves as a storage pool for flood control drainage water diversion and irrigation as well as a potable water source for suzhou city jiangsu province china xue et al 2022 yangcheng lake is located northeast of suzhou city at 31 21 31 29 n latitude and 120 39 120 50 e longitude the topography of yangcheng lake is higher in the west than in the east and thus slopes in the west to east direction the lake is 17 km long north to south and 11 km wide east to west comprising a total area of 117 4 km2 yangcheng lake is divided into three parts that are interconnected by rivers and branches east lake l7 l9 middle lake l4 l6 and west lake l1 l3 east lake covers 51 7 km2 and accounts for 44 1 of yangcheng lake middle lake is 34 1 km2 and accounts for 29 0 and west lake is 31 6 km2 and accounts for 26 9 the yangcheng lake area is shown in fig 1 yangcheng lake was selected as the study area primarily because 1 yangcheng lake is located in the most economically developed yangtze river delta plain in china and the region has formed a representative national provincial local three level normative system 2 yangcheng lake serves as a storage pool for flood control drainage water diversion and irrigation as well as a potable water source for suzhou city and 3 in recent years summer cyanobacterial blooms began appearing in yangcheng lake which urgently requires a health evaluation and environmental remediation 2 2 data acquisition yangcheng lake health evaluation data was obtained from actual measurements field surveys and survey statistics specifically water quality ecological flow eutrophication degree and values for similar indicators were measured values acquired from the jiangsu hydrological and water resources report 2020 2021 macroinvertebrate phytoplankton and other biological data were obtained using on site survey monitoring data lake area shoreline vegetation cover flood control projects lake shoreline management and values for similar indicators were procured from the chinese hydrological year book 2020 2021 while public satisfaction was evaluated by means of a public satisfaction questionnaire 2 3 national evaluation methods g method the river and lake health evaluation guide trial i e the g method was issued by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2020 the guideline is based on ecosystem structural integrity ecosystem resilience against disturbance and sustainability of social service functions furthermore the national level normative evaluation index system proposes 20 evaluation indicators for lake health including the lake connectivity percentage of lake area shrinkage and riparian naturalness etc table 1 of these 20 indicators 9 are mandatory 11 are alternative mandatory indicators must be used in all rivers and lakes whereas alternative indicators are only required in provincial and national level rivers and lakes as well as any assessments concerning the yangtze river 2 4 provincial evaluation methods p method the ecological river and lake condition evaluation specification i e the p method was issued by the jiangsu water resources department jiangsu provincial water resources department 2019 it defines five index categories water security aquatic organisms aquatic habitats physical habitats and public satisfaction as well as 14 evaluation indicators such as flood protection phytoplankton density lake connectivity and ecological flow guarantee rate etc table 2 2 5 local evaluation methods c method the river and lake health evaluation code c method was issued by the suzhou water bureau and is the first local standard for municipal river and lake health evaluations in china suzhou water bureau 2021 it defines four index categories ecological health service functions interference level and management level as well as 20 evaluation indexes including riparian naturalness water quality of inflow rivers water quality of drinking water source etc table 3 three health assessment indicator systems and calculation methods show in the supplementary data table s1 2 6 methods evaluation the similarities and differences between the three tier evaluation system were carried out from the definition of lake health evaluation index system indicator weights allocation health status classification criteria and health condition assignment method the three methods evaluation results were compared in three aspects yangcheng lake s health status overall rating spatial distribution characteristics and limiting factors the health status overall rating and its limiting factors were analyzed by radar maps the spatial distribution characteristics of health status were analyzed by cloud images data processing and radar maps were implemented using the software r version 4 0 3 and cloud images were implemented using the software arcgis version 10 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of the three evaluation methods 3 1 1 defining lake health while the specific definitions of lake health for assessment evaluation purposes vary slightly among the various levels the central themes are largely consistent table 4 these recurring themes include 1 integrity and stability of the river lake ecosystem structure and function 2 resilience of the lake to external disturbances and the ability to repair restore its own disrupted ecological functions and 3 lake s ability to sustainably meet reasonable anthropogenic needs such that natural and social functions are harmonious and unified 3 1 2 indicator system the evaluation system in all three evaluation methods draws on the logical framework of the analytic hierarchy process ahp to decompose the problem starting at the bottom and working up the complex lake health evaluation problem is treated as a system the target is then decomposed into multiple criteria then further decomposed into several levels of multiple indicators in the actual evaluation process the bottom up order is used to assign scores to the data in the indicator criterion target layers the g method evaluation system strictly follows the ahp framework to decompose the problem and contains the target criterion and indicator levels it primarily differs from the other two methods in that it divides the evaluation indicators into alternative and mandatory of the total 20 evaluation indicators 9 are mandatory fig 2 a only when evaluating a river or lake under provincial jurisdiction is it necessary to add alternative indicators this setup increases the operability and applicability of the method to all the provinces in china the p method evaluation index system has only two levels consisting of indicator types categories and indicators i e there is no target layer it primarily differs from the other two methods in that it sets up a one vote veto system using three indicators consisting of centralized drinking water source water quality standards water quality and public satisfaction the river lake is directly classified as unqualified if 1 the centralized drinking water source undergoes sudden water pollution problems a water supply crisis or other abnormal water quality events 2 the water quality evaluation result is level v or 3 public satisfaction is 75 points the c method evaluation index system is more complicated than the other two methods in this case an element layer is added between the target category and indicator layers to further specify the category layer in addition the evaluation index contains 20 indicators the largest number of evaluation indexes among the three methods and requires a lot of work for high demand requirements fig 2 c 3 1 3 indicator weights in the g method only criterion layer weights are assigned specifically physical habitat aquatic habitat aquatic organisms and social services are weighted 0 2 0 3 0 2 and 0 3 respectively specific weights are not assigned to other indicator layers because this evaluation method is applicable to each province and municipality in china due to differences in the positioning of river morphology water quality benchmark values and river functions in each province setting weights for the indicator layer is delegated to provincial staff to improve method applicability since the c method exclusively evaluates the health of rivers and lakes in suzhou city jiangsu province detailed weights are specified for each category element and indicator layer this setup is beneficial for standardization but problematic for extrapolating the method to larger areas the p method weighting system differs significantly from the g and c methods in that all the indicator layers are weighted as a whole without considering the indicators that comprise each layer thus all the indicator layer weights add up to one instead of each indicator within the layer being weighted individually however because the constraints of each indicator layer are not considered there is a risk of mutual redundancy of some indicators shan et al 2020 zhao et al 2019a for example the water safety indicators in the water functional area layer and the water quality compliance rate indicators and water habitat indicators in the water quality indicators layer may have too high a correlation resulting in the indicators being allocated if the weight of any two indicators are relatively close the weight of other indicators will be too high or too low 3 1 4 health status classification criteria the g method guidelines classify the health status of rivers and lakes into five categories consisting of nature 90 v 100 healthy 75 v 90 sub healthy 60 v 75 unhealthy 40 v 60 and morbid v 40 fig 3 a in contrast the p and c methods classify lake conditions into four categories the p method classification consists of nature 90 v 100 healthy 75 v 90 sub healthy 60 v 75 and morbid v 60 fig 3 b compared with the g method the p method has stricter standards for classifying something as morbid the former considers rivers and lakes scoring 40 as morbid while the latter classifies rivers and lakes scoring 60 as morbid the c method classification consists of nature 80 v 100 healthy 60 v 80 sub healthy 40 v 60 and morbid v 40 fig 3 c compared with the g method the c method classification criteria are more lenient when the score is 60 for example when the score is 76 the g method classifies the lake as sub healthy while the c method classification is healthy 3 1 5 assignment method when lake health were comprehensively evaluated by each of the three evaluation methods all three methods were calculated according to the bottom up layer by layer weighting method to obtain the final evaluation results note that the p method requires a one vote veto before a comprehensive health score can be assigned once the decision is made that indicator is recorded as 0 points 3 1 6 similarities and differences between different tiers of the evaluation system the similarities and differences between the three tier evaluation system were carried out from the definition of lake health evaluation index system indicator weights allocation health status classification criteria and health condition assignment method table 5 although the evaluation index system and assessment techniques are consistent throughout all three methods they differ in their handling of index weights and assignment criteria 3 2 comparison of evaluation results 3 2 1 yangcheng lake health status overall rating health evaluations are an important technical tool for assessing a lake s health status scientifically analyzing its potential problems and customizing an ecological management plan and restoration project fig 4 a shows the total health evaluation scores for yangcheng lake under different evaluation methods yangcheng lake scored 77 90 sub healthy using the g method 85 05 healthy using the p method and 77 67 healthy using the c method while the results show that p g c the quantitative physical significance of the lake s health status is called into question since the p and c methods define yangcheng lake as healthy whereas the g method defines it as sub healthy fig 1 shows that all 13 evaluation indicators assessed in the p method are also applied in the g and c methods however the p method evaluation score is higher than the g and c method scores by 7 points an analysis showed that this discrepancy is mainly due to the p method indicator weight calculation method being different from that of the g and c methods essentially the difference in weight calculation methods results in a single indicator score being too high or too low and in turn the total score has a greater impact for example if all three scoring methods include the degree of water quality indicators the p method indicator weights are not multiplied with the guidelines layer or the weight of the target layer thus in this case the indicator weight is 0 080 in contrast the g and c method indicator weights are multiplied by each level to obtain the final indicator weight which reduces the impact of single indicators on the overall score as such the g and c method indicator weights are 0 060 and 0 064 respectively when eq 1 is used to calculate single indicator results the water quality superiority and inferiority degree score is 54 50 the contribution of the indicator to the target layer from the p g and c methods is 4 36 3 27 and 3 49 respectively note that the p method score is 1 point higher than that of the g and c methods 3 2 2 analysis of limiting factors for the health status of yangcheng lake the main control factors that induce changes in the health status of lakes were elucidated by analyzing the individual indicator scores of each scoring method the results then provided a theoretical basis for precise ecological management and restoration of lake environments fig 4 b c d the p method indicators with scores below the unhealthy or pathological level 60 are the water quality p9 and trophic level index p10 in the aquatic habitats criterion layer as well as the lake s trophic level index c6 and the riparian utilization c14 in the lake disturbance criterion layer the main limiting factors associated with yangcheng lake s health condition are shown in table 6 a lake s physical habitat reflects the ecological spatial integrity of rivers and lakes provides places for lake ecological hydrological processes and maintains the health and stability of aquatic ecosystems in addition it also ensures water security for various forms of ecological space kraemer et al 2021 schindler and scheuerell 2002 including river and lake waters water connotation areas centralized drinking water sources aquatic germplasm resource protection areas shorelines erosion prevention areas flood storage sites and other regional areas involving water functions that are important for maintaining the structure and function of river and lake ecosystems material circulation and energy flow according to the suzhou statistical yearbook the surface area of yangcheng lake was 139 3 km2 in 1988 and 117 4 km2 in 2020 thus the total shrinkage area and shrinkage ratio over this period was 22 km2 and 15 7 respectively yangcheng lake s lakeside zone vegetation cover is poor west lake 39 04 i e medium density vegetation cover middle lake 13 08 i e sparse vegetation cover and east lake 20 43 i e sparse vegetation cover it is recommended to optimize yangcheng lake s water extraction system strictly control the water consumption and significantly restrict development on the lake s shoreline as development is likely to reduce the lake s area other recommendations include carefully implementing and monitoring an ecological restoration project on yangcheng lake s shoreline and distributing woody herbaceous and large water holding plants at the land water interface as these plant communities will help improve yangcheng lake s physical habitat condition gortner 1934 yangcheng lake s aquatic habitat water quantity and water quality is mainly reflected in the ecological water quantity and water environment conditions sufficient ecological water quantity in rivers and lakes is necessary to support a high quality water environment quality condition is the necessary embodiment of the health of the water body itself belongs to the natural properties of the lake and occupies a central position in the lake health water quality indicator monitoring results for yangcheng lake show that the total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are high and in fact exceed the standard limit for type ⅲ water see see table s2 in the supplementary data in addition escalating urbanization and climate change have contributed to the summer cyanobacteria blooms observed in yangcheng lake in recent years li et al 2022 as such the lake s nutrient levels require improvement the degree of disturbance to the lake reflects the resilience of the lake ecosystem to external disturbances yangcheng lake is characterized by low intensity external disturbance factors and thus depicts a high degree of stability a necessary characteristic of healthy rivers and lakes yangcheng lake is an important hairy crab aquaculture and tourist area in suzhou according to statistics the yangcheng lake shoreline utilization area currently totals 29 34 km i e 14 39 of the total shoreline length in this case it is necessary to carefully balance the natural lake system requirements with the moderate demand of anthropogenic activities to support economic and social development while enhancing the integrity of the ecosystem 3 2 3 spatial distribution characteristics of yangcheng lake s health status results from the three evaluation methods for each sub lake in yangcheng lake are shown in fig 5 using the g evaluation method west lake scored 73 17 middle lake scored 75 58 and east lake scored 75 68 using the p evaluation method west lake scored 85 10 middle lake scored 86 68 and east lake scored 87 32 the spatial interpolation results show that in general the health of east lake middle lake west lake fig 6 the rivers entering yangcheng lake are mainly distributed in west lake while the rivers exiting the lake are mainly distributed in east lake as previously mentioned the flow direction in yangcheng lake is primarily from west to east chen et al 2012 the lake has a certain enhancing effect on water quality and nutrient retention and plays the role of sink or transformer wei et al 2014 therefore yangcheng lake s aquatic habitat gradually improves from west to east in addition since suzhou s main industrial park xiangcheng district is mainly located in west lake there is a risk that significant amounts of wastewater from printing dyeing other industrial facilities will directly discharge into the river and yangcheng lake which facilitates deterioration of west lake s health industrial transformation needs to be further strengthened to reduce wastewater discharge and bolster source control the qiputang dredging water diversion project implemented in middle lake was completed in 2016 and played a large role in drawing yangtze river water into yangcheng lake in 2018 and 2019 the qiputang yangtze river hub diverted 262 million m3 and 733 million m3 of water into yangcheng lake respectively totaling 1 2 2018 and 3 5 2019 times the amount of water stored in the yangcheng lake area about 210 million m3 the higher flow rate of diverted water from qiputang accelerates the renewal rate and reduces the hydraulic residence time of the lake helps reduce eutrophication and enhances the lake s self purification capacity chen et al 2020 li et al 2013 east lake is yangcheng lake s main aquaculture area according to the suzhou municipal water bureau statistics in 2020 the total nitrogen concentration in yangcheng lake s farming and purification ponds was 4 53 and 3 31 mg l respectively the high concentration of nitrogen containing aquaculture tailwater discharge will negatively impact the yangcheng lake basin s water quality to improve the water quality of the yangcheng lake area the water bureau and yangcheng lake aquaculture jointly carried out vigorous reform in response yangcheng lake aquaculture area was reduced from its peak of 94 67 km2 to the current 10 67 km2 moreover aquaculture seines were removed aquatic plants were gradually restored and the area became conducive to water purification 3 3 proposed standardized evaluation system in the current health evaluation work on chinese rivers and lakes there is a three tier analysis system consisting of national provincial and local assessments however each tier has a unique set of standards and thus is comprised of different evaluation indexes index weight determination methods and index assignment criteria etc these inconsistencies make it very difficult for administrators to uniformly map the health status of chinese rivers and lakes or analyze the main ecological and environmental problems threatening rivers and lakes in each region as such it is necessary to explore methodologies for standardizing the numerous existing evaluation systems based on the existing health evaluation work the ultimate goal is to design a health evaluation that is applicable to rivers and lakes in various provinces and cities and that reflects the health status and main limiting factors of each region in a comprehensive manner with respect to constructing the indicator system since the guidelines for river and lake health evaluation for trial implementation have been piloted across the country and certain results have been achieved to conveniently integrate and compare evaluation results it is recommended that provinces and municipalities 1 arrange the indicators according to the guidelines classification criteria 2 retain the function of alternative indicators and 3 categorize the indicators unique to each region and those not included in the guidelines as alternative indicators of major categories in determining the indicator weights it is recommended to use the approach adopted by the guidelines and suzhou city in which the indicator layers are considered separately to avoid the mutual redundancy phenomenon that occurs when indicators are assigned scores at the same time in addition by calculating the indicator weights layer by layer the weight values of each individual indicator can be appropriately balanced which circumvents the problem of some weights being too large and erroneously producing high or low scoring results concerning the evaluation criteria it is recommended to use the five levels suggested in the guidelines due to evaluation time sampling method and operational standardization of sampling personnel there are uncertainties in the current river and lake health evaluation system that cause health evaluation results to have large cumulative uncertainties for example using different sampling personnel may result in varied sampling and evaluation times which produces large differences in health evaluation results over the same time period increasing the scoring interval s grading level and improving the results flexibility are conducive to eliminating evaluation results uncertainty regarding evaluation methods the purpose of conducting river and lake health evaluations is to diagnose the main water ecological environmental problems in rivers and lakes compile a list of issues then design customized river and lake management plans and ecological restoration projects as such providing fast and accurate health evaluation results for government departments to use in decision making is a pivotal part of this process however large index systems extensive index evaluation data collection and long processing times substantially hinder this effort and thus it is among the urgent engineering problems that require a solution to resolve this issue it is suggested that when conducting river and lake health evaluations different evaluation processes be set up for emergency and standard scenarios fig 7 in emergency situations e g when river and lake health in the jurisdictional area drastically deteriorates or there is a water ecological and environmental crisis eutrophication black smelly water bodies etc it is recommended to default to the one vote veto methodology that was implemented in jiangsu province in this case one indicator that most affects river and lake health as well as individual and societal health is selected in each guideline layer to form a one vote veto group the overall evaluation process is 1 1 1 2 1 or 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 which two paths are chosen depends on whether the one vote veto system is passed in a non emergency standard situation i e daily release of the jurisdiction s rivers and lakes health status and the health status s main limiting factors the evaluation process is 1 1 2 3 4 5 by standardizing the existing river and lake health evaluation process government entity awareness of river and lake protection requirements improves as does the awareness and enthusiasm of residents to safeguard rivers and lakes 4 conclusion in this work we analyzed the similarities and differences between national provincial jiangsu province and local suzhou city river and lake health evaluation standards and used all three methods to evaluate the health of yangcheng lake suzhou jiangsu province china the results show that the differences in the evaluation index system and index assignment methods among the three evaluation methods are small but the differences in index weights and assignment criteria are large in jiangsu province the evaluation method index weights were calculated by taking all the index layers as a whole without considering the weight of each individual index layer which runs the risk of a single indicator influencing the final result in addition the national evaluation method s assignment criteria are more detailed and stringent thus the evaluation results may be artificially low the yangcheng lake health evaluation results from the three different evaluation methods were basically the same with yangcheng lake s health status in the healthy sub healthy range and gradually decreasing from west to east the existing chinese national provincial local three level health evaluation system is integrated and methods for standardizing the index system index weights and evaluation process are proposed to provide theoretical support for water resources management and water ecology restoration in freshwater bodies such as rivers and lakes in china yangcheng lake in suzhou city jiangsu province was selected as the research object for this study herein the existing ministry of water resources lake health evaluation method jiangsu province lake health evaluation method and suzhou city river and lake health evaluation method were used to respectively evaluate the health of yangcheng lake and propose a process for standardizing river and lake health evaluation however this paper is only an example analysis in which jiangsu province and yangcheng lake were assessed to obtain partial results at present sichuan guizhou and guangdong provinces in china have individualized health evaluation methods based on their own river and lake characteristics large rivers small and medium rivers river ratio mountain rivers and plain rivers and have used these non standardized protocols to perform river and lake health evaluations thus it is recommended that future studies should include follow up work designed 1 using simulation studies as validations 2 using more lakes in various environments e g plateau mountainous and plains areas to evaluate whether those two evaluation processes are effective in the long term 3 using several provinces and cities to verify the rationality of the standardized evaluation process proposed in this paper although the g method has set mandatory and alternative indicators it cannot be applied to all lakes in plain land plateau mountain area and urban area due to the influence of climate change and geographical conditions such as altitude the index weight calculation method set by the p method will lead to a large difference in calculation results the index system set by the c method is only for lakes in suzhou city which cannot be promoted to overcome the shortcomings of the existing methods the novel proposed method retains the function of alternative indicators and categorizes the indicators unique to each region and those not included in the guidelines as alternative indicators of major categories using the five levels suggested in the guidelines increasing the scoring interval s grading level and improving the results flexibility and proposed two evaluation processes general situations mode and emergency situations mode in this paper three methods are only used to evaluate the health of lakes for river health diagnosis only part of the evaluation indicators is replaced by the three evaluation methods and the health status classification criteria and s health condition assignment method are consistent with the lakes it is recommended that future studies should select different rivers for health evaluation of the three methods and the proposed new methods to verify the consistency of the methods in rivers and lakes credit authorship contribution statement yifan su conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology writing

7736,study region yangcheng lake is located northeast of suzhou city one of the most economically developed cities in the yangtze river delta plain china yangcheng lake serves as a storage pool for flood control and water diversion as well as a potable water source for suzhou city in recent years summer cyanobacterial blooms began appearing in yangcheng lake which urgently requires a health evaluation study focus currently there is a three tier analysis system consisting of national provincial and local assessments in china however each tier has a unique set of standards meaning that 1 evaluations between tiers are not comparable and 2 conducting a unified survey and analyzing the results is exceedingly difficult how to develop ways to standardize existing river and lake health evaluation systems in china become a global concern new hydrological insights for the region although the evaluation index system and assessment techniques are consistent throughout all three methods they differ in their handling of index weights and assignment criteria the health evaluation scores of yangcheng lake are in the healthy to sub healthy range with gradually decreasing health from east to west this work synthesized the existing chinese national provincial local health evaluation system and suggested standardizing the index system index weights and evaluation process to provide theoretical support for water resources management and water ecology restoration in freshwater water bodies in china graphical abstract ga1 keywords health assessment normalization aquatic ecological health ecological integrity yangcheng lake data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in addition to serving as the backbone of human sustenance and the source of civilization rivers and lakes are the foundation of socio economic development strategic economic resources and ecological environment controls loïc et al 2021 however in response to dam construction urbanization global warming and other anthropogenic disturbances grill et al 2019 lu et al 2020 trisos et al 2020 freshwater environments and the ecosystems have experienced water shortages physical and chemical pollution eutrophication and various other problems bilal et al 2021 ding et al 2022 yitong et al 2022 which has led to water resource scarcity and the destruction of fish and other aquatic habitats newbold et al 2016 determining how to assess aquatic ecosystem health and implement effective river and lake management and ecological restoration is a prerequisite for restoring the water bodies natural properties and achieving a harmonious coexistence between humans and nature the concept of river and lake health was first mentioned in the water pollution control amendments of the united states 1972 finlayson and brizga 2000 where diagnostic indicators of ecosystem health were listed as physical biological and chemical factors that can maintain the natural structure and function of the ecosystem subsequently australia s health river commission hrc suggested that in addition to maintaining the stability of the river and lake ecosystem s structure and function a healthy river should also meet the needs of regional and watershed economic production in addition the society for ecological restoration science policy working group scr proposed that river health is a certain state or condition that corresponds to the river s local ecological development process and that dynamic changes should stay within a normal range defined by the river s location moreover researchers such as karr 1993 1999 frey 1977 schofield and davies 1996 l mj 1997 simpson and norris 2000 and others have provided insights on river health from different professional backgrounds and perspectives thus the concept of river ecosystem health has been continuously developed and refined at the 2nd yellow river international forum in 2004 li guoying china s minister of water resources advised investing time and resources into maintaining healthy rivers this marked the beginning of china s efforts to assess the health of freshwater ecosystems li 2004 and was followed by the yangtze river and pearl river water resources commissions publicly supporting the concepts of a healthy yangtze river and pearl river respectively jin et al 2009 however since the concept of river ecosystem health is not clearly defined internationally or domestically academicians from the chinese academy of engineering sciences gathered in 2007 to discuss the definition and meaning of river health eventually they unified the various river health definitions and declared that a healthy river or lake should meet reasonable anthropogenic needs while maintaining its own structural and functional stability i e sustainable development wen et al 2007 health assessment methods for rivers and lakes were identified and refined along with a common understanding of what is meant by river and lake health however the initial river and lake health evaluation methods only used a single physical or chemical indicator to make a health determination norris and thoms 1999 over time as collective understanding of the definition of river and lake health deepened the health evaluation methods gradually matured currently river and lake health evaluation methodologies are primarily grouped into two categories biological monitoring methods and comprehensive index methods su et al 2021 the biological monitoring methods are designed to evaluate qualitative or quantitative monitoring data of fish macroinvertebrates algae and aquatic plants in the water body chen et al 2014 liu et al 2019 schofield and davies 1996 sudaryanti et al 2001 wright et al 1984 these methods are suitable for large scale river and lake health surveys as they require a low workload typical biological monitoring methods include the river invertebrate prediction and classification scheme rivpacs wright et al 1984 the australian river assessment scheme ausrivas john 2004 and the eu water framework guidelines wfd kallis and butler 2001 the comprehensive index methods are all inclusive assessments that takes into account the physical chemical biological and social service indicators of rivers and lakes gupta et al 2020 ladson et al 1999 petersen jr 1992 su et al 2020 while these methods involve a large workload they enable a comprehensive look at specific problems associated with river and lake health typical comprehensive index methods include sweden s riparian and riverine environment specifications rce petersen jr 1992 and the australian stream condition index isc ladson et al 1999 using both previously described methods respectively china has conducted numerous health evaluations on rivers lakes reservoirs and other water bodies and has achieved abundant and various results pan et al 2021 ren et al 2022 shan et al 2021 however because most of these evaluations were conducted for research purposes the evaluation methods within and between regions are inconsistent and the reliability of the results needs further verification in order to form an established methodology nationwide in 2010 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china launched a pilot health assessment of important rivers and lakes in 2020 they organized nationally renowned water research institutions to compile the river and lake health evaluation guide trial which specified the index system scoring criteria and scoring methods for the first time these newly developed guidelines were implemented in lasa river tibet zhang et al 2021 currently there is a three tier analysis system consisting of national provincial and local assessments each of which has its own unique set of standards the similarities and differences between the three tier evaluation system were carried out from the definition of lake health evaluation index system indicator weights allocation health status classification criteria and health condition assignment method there is a lack of analysis of the similarities and paradoxes between the three tier system thus the aim of this study was unify the standard for river and lake health evaluations across all three tiers and adjust the methodology proposed by the ministry of water resources such that it is appropriate for rivers and lakes in various environments e g plateau mountainous and plains areas to this end the health evaluation methods proposed by the ministry of water resources jiangsu province and suzhou city were jointly used to evaluate yangcheng lake a typical lake in suzhou jiangsu province subsequently the results were analyzed to 1 what are the similarities and differences between different tiers of the evaluation system 2 which method works better for lake health evaluations in various environments and why 3 how to develop ways to standardize existing lake health evaluation systems in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area yangcheng lake is one of the most important freshwater lakes in taihu lake basin in addition to its unique ecology yangcheng lake serves as a storage pool for flood control drainage water diversion and irrigation as well as a potable water source for suzhou city jiangsu province china xue et al 2022 yangcheng lake is located northeast of suzhou city at 31 21 31 29 n latitude and 120 39 120 50 e longitude the topography of yangcheng lake is higher in the west than in the east and thus slopes in the west to east direction the lake is 17 km long north to south and 11 km wide east to west comprising a total area of 117 4 km2 yangcheng lake is divided into three parts that are interconnected by rivers and branches east lake l7 l9 middle lake l4 l6 and west lake l1 l3 east lake covers 51 7 km2 and accounts for 44 1 of yangcheng lake middle lake is 34 1 km2 and accounts for 29 0 and west lake is 31 6 km2 and accounts for 26 9 the yangcheng lake area is shown in fig 1 yangcheng lake was selected as the study area primarily because 1 yangcheng lake is located in the most economically developed yangtze river delta plain in china and the region has formed a representative national provincial local three level normative system 2 yangcheng lake serves as a storage pool for flood control drainage water diversion and irrigation as well as a potable water source for suzhou city and 3 in recent years summer cyanobacterial blooms began appearing in yangcheng lake which urgently requires a health evaluation and environmental remediation 2 2 data acquisition yangcheng lake health evaluation data was obtained from actual measurements field surveys and survey statistics specifically water quality ecological flow eutrophication degree and values for similar indicators were measured values acquired from the jiangsu hydrological and water resources report 2020 2021 macroinvertebrate phytoplankton and other biological data were obtained using on site survey monitoring data lake area shoreline vegetation cover flood control projects lake shoreline management and values for similar indicators were procured from the chinese hydrological year book 2020 2021 while public satisfaction was evaluated by means of a public satisfaction questionnaire 2 3 national evaluation methods g method the river and lake health evaluation guide trial i e the g method was issued by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2020 the guideline is based on ecosystem structural integrity ecosystem resilience against disturbance and sustainability of social service functions furthermore the national level normative evaluation index system proposes 20 evaluation indicators for lake health including the lake connectivity percentage of lake area shrinkage and riparian naturalness etc table 1 of these 20 indicators 9 are mandatory 11 are alternative mandatory indicators must be used in all rivers and lakes whereas alternative indicators are only required in provincial and national level rivers and lakes as well as any assessments concerning the yangtze river 2 4 provincial evaluation methods p method the ecological river and lake condition evaluation specification i e the p method was issued by the jiangsu water resources department jiangsu provincial water resources department 2019 it defines five index categories water security aquatic organisms aquatic habitats physical habitats and public satisfaction as well as 14 evaluation indicators such as flood protection phytoplankton density lake connectivity and ecological flow guarantee rate etc table 2 2 5 local evaluation methods c method the river and lake health evaluation code c method was issued by the suzhou water bureau and is the first local standard for municipal river and lake health evaluations in china suzhou water bureau 2021 it defines four index categories ecological health service functions interference level and management level as well as 20 evaluation indexes including riparian naturalness water quality of inflow rivers water quality of drinking water source etc table 3 three health assessment indicator systems and calculation methods show in the supplementary data table s1 2 6 methods evaluation the similarities and differences between the three tier evaluation system were carried out from the definition of lake health evaluation index system indicator weights allocation health status classification criteria and health condition assignment method the three methods evaluation results were compared in three aspects yangcheng lake s health status overall rating spatial distribution characteristics and limiting factors the health status overall rating and its limiting factors were analyzed by radar maps the spatial distribution characteristics of health status were analyzed by cloud images data processing and radar maps were implemented using the software r version 4 0 3 and cloud images were implemented using the software arcgis version 10 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of the three evaluation methods 3 1 1 defining lake health while the specific definitions of lake health for assessment evaluation purposes vary slightly among the various levels the central themes are largely consistent table 4 these recurring themes include 1 integrity and stability of the river lake ecosystem structure and function 2 resilience of the lake to external disturbances and the ability to repair restore its own disrupted ecological functions and 3 lake s ability to sustainably meet reasonable anthropogenic needs such that natural and social functions are harmonious and unified 3 1 2 indicator system the evaluation system in all three evaluation methods draws on the logical framework of the analytic hierarchy process ahp to decompose the problem starting at the bottom and working up the complex lake health evaluation problem is treated as a system the target is then decomposed into multiple criteria then further decomposed into several levels of multiple indicators in the actual evaluation process the bottom up order is used to assign scores to the data in the indicator criterion target layers the g method evaluation system strictly follows the ahp framework to decompose the problem and contains the target criterion and indicator levels it primarily differs from the other two methods in that it divides the evaluation indicators into alternative and mandatory of the total 20 evaluation indicators 9 are mandatory fig 2 a only when evaluating a river or lake under provincial jurisdiction is it necessary to add alternative indicators this setup increases the operability and applicability of the method to all the provinces in china the p method evaluation index system has only two levels consisting of indicator types categories and indicators i e there is no target layer it primarily differs from the other two methods in that it sets up a one vote veto system using three indicators consisting of centralized drinking water source water quality standards water quality and public satisfaction the river lake is directly classified as unqualified if 1 the centralized drinking water source undergoes sudden water pollution problems a water supply crisis or other abnormal water quality events 2 the water quality evaluation result is level v or 3 public satisfaction is 75 points the c method evaluation index system is more complicated than the other two methods in this case an element layer is added between the target category and indicator layers to further specify the category layer in addition the evaluation index contains 20 indicators the largest number of evaluation indexes among the three methods and requires a lot of work for high demand requirements fig 2 c 3 1 3 indicator weights in the g method only criterion layer weights are assigned specifically physical habitat aquatic habitat aquatic organisms and social services are weighted 0 2 0 3 0 2 and 0 3 respectively specific weights are not assigned to other indicator layers because this evaluation method is applicable to each province and municipality in china due to differences in the positioning of river morphology water quality benchmark values and river functions in each province setting weights for the indicator layer is delegated to provincial staff to improve method applicability since the c method exclusively evaluates the health of rivers and lakes in suzhou city jiangsu province detailed weights are specified for each category element and indicator layer this setup is beneficial for standardization but problematic for extrapolating the method to larger areas the p method weighting system differs significantly from the g and c methods in that all the indicator layers are weighted as a whole without considering the indicators that comprise each layer thus all the indicator layer weights add up to one instead of each indicator within the layer being weighted individually however because the constraints of each indicator layer are not considered there is a risk of mutual redundancy of some indicators shan et al 2020 zhao et al 2019a for example the water safety indicators in the water functional area layer and the water quality compliance rate indicators and water habitat indicators in the water quality indicators layer may have too high a correlation resulting in the indicators being allocated if the weight of any two indicators are relatively close the weight of other indicators will be too high or too low 3 1 4 health status classification criteria the g method guidelines classify the health status of rivers and lakes into five categories consisting of nature 90 v 100 healthy 75 v 90 sub healthy 60 v 75 unhealthy 40 v 60 and morbid v 40 fig 3 a in contrast the p and c methods classify lake conditions into four categories the p method classification consists of nature 90 v 100 healthy 75 v 90 sub healthy 60 v 75 and morbid v 60 fig 3 b compared with the g method the p method has stricter standards for classifying something as morbid the former considers rivers and lakes scoring 40 as morbid while the latter classifies rivers and lakes scoring 60 as morbid the c method classification consists of nature 80 v 100 healthy 60 v 80 sub healthy 40 v 60 and morbid v 40 fig 3 c compared with the g method the c method classification criteria are more lenient when the score is 60 for example when the score is 76 the g method classifies the lake as sub healthy while the c method classification is healthy 3 1 5 assignment method when lake health were comprehensively evaluated by each of the three evaluation methods all three methods were calculated according to the bottom up layer by layer weighting method to obtain the final evaluation results note that the p method requires a one vote veto before a comprehensive health score can be assigned once the decision is made that indicator is recorded as 0 points 3 1 6 similarities and differences between different tiers of the evaluation system the similarities and differences between the three tier evaluation system were carried out from the definition of lake health evaluation index system indicator weights allocation health status classification criteria and health condition assignment method table 5 although the evaluation index system and assessment techniques are consistent throughout all three methods they differ in their handling of index weights and assignment criteria 3 2 comparison of evaluation results 3 2 1 yangcheng lake health status overall rating health evaluations are an important technical tool for assessing a lake s health status scientifically analyzing its potential problems and customizing an ecological management plan and restoration project fig 4 a shows the total health evaluation scores for yangcheng lake under different evaluation methods yangcheng lake scored 77 90 sub healthy using the g method 85 05 healthy using the p method and 77 67 healthy using the c method while the results show that p g c the quantitative physical significance of the lake s health status is called into question since the p and c methods define yangcheng lake as healthy whereas the g method defines it as sub healthy fig 1 shows that all 13 evaluation indicators assessed in the p method are also applied in the g and c methods however the p method evaluation score is higher than the g and c method scores by 7 points an analysis showed that this discrepancy is mainly due to the p method indicator weight calculation method being different from that of the g and c methods essentially the difference in weight calculation methods results in a single indicator score being too high or too low and in turn the total score has a greater impact for example if all three scoring methods include the degree of water quality indicators the p method indicator weights are not multiplied with the guidelines layer or the weight of the target layer thus in this case the indicator weight is 0 080 in contrast the g and c method indicator weights are multiplied by each level to obtain the final indicator weight which reduces the impact of single indicators on the overall score as such the g and c method indicator weights are 0 060 and 0 064 respectively when eq 1 is used to calculate single indicator results the water quality superiority and inferiority degree score is 54 50 the contribution of the indicator to the target layer from the p g and c methods is 4 36 3 27 and 3 49 respectively note that the p method score is 1 point higher than that of the g and c methods 3 2 2 analysis of limiting factors for the health status of yangcheng lake the main control factors that induce changes in the health status of lakes were elucidated by analyzing the individual indicator scores of each scoring method the results then provided a theoretical basis for precise ecological management and restoration of lake environments fig 4 b c d the p method indicators with scores below the unhealthy or pathological level 60 are the water quality p9 and trophic level index p10 in the aquatic habitats criterion layer as well as the lake s trophic level index c6 and the riparian utilization c14 in the lake disturbance criterion layer the main limiting factors associated with yangcheng lake s health condition are shown in table 6 a lake s physical habitat reflects the ecological spatial integrity of rivers and lakes provides places for lake ecological hydrological processes and maintains the health and stability of aquatic ecosystems in addition it also ensures water security for various forms of ecological space kraemer et al 2021 schindler and scheuerell 2002 including river and lake waters water connotation areas centralized drinking water sources aquatic germplasm resource protection areas shorelines erosion prevention areas flood storage sites and other regional areas involving water functions that are important for maintaining the structure and function of river and lake ecosystems material circulation and energy flow according to the suzhou statistical yearbook the surface area of yangcheng lake was 139 3 km2 in 1988 and 117 4 km2 in 2020 thus the total shrinkage area and shrinkage ratio over this period was 22 km2 and 15 7 respectively yangcheng lake s lakeside zone vegetation cover is poor west lake 39 04 i e medium density vegetation cover middle lake 13 08 i e sparse vegetation cover and east lake 20 43 i e sparse vegetation cover it is recommended to optimize yangcheng lake s water extraction system strictly control the water consumption and significantly restrict development on the lake s shoreline as development is likely to reduce the lake s area other recommendations include carefully implementing and monitoring an ecological restoration project on yangcheng lake s shoreline and distributing woody herbaceous and large water holding plants at the land water interface as these plant communities will help improve yangcheng lake s physical habitat condition gortner 1934 yangcheng lake s aquatic habitat water quantity and water quality is mainly reflected in the ecological water quantity and water environment conditions sufficient ecological water quantity in rivers and lakes is necessary to support a high quality water environment quality condition is the necessary embodiment of the health of the water body itself belongs to the natural properties of the lake and occupies a central position in the lake health water quality indicator monitoring results for yangcheng lake show that the total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are high and in fact exceed the standard limit for type ⅲ water see see table s2 in the supplementary data in addition escalating urbanization and climate change have contributed to the summer cyanobacteria blooms observed in yangcheng lake in recent years li et al 2022 as such the lake s nutrient levels require improvement the degree of disturbance to the lake reflects the resilience of the lake ecosystem to external disturbances yangcheng lake is characterized by low intensity external disturbance factors and thus depicts a high degree of stability a necessary characteristic of healthy rivers and lakes yangcheng lake is an important hairy crab aquaculture and tourist area in suzhou according to statistics the yangcheng lake shoreline utilization area currently totals 29 34 km i e 14 39 of the total shoreline length in this case it is necessary to carefully balance the natural lake system requirements with the moderate demand of anthropogenic activities to support economic and social development while enhancing the integrity of the ecosystem 3 2 3 spatial distribution characteristics of yangcheng lake s health status results from the three evaluation methods for each sub lake in yangcheng lake are shown in fig 5 using the g evaluation method west lake scored 73 17 middle lake scored 75 58 and east lake scored 75 68 using the p evaluation method west lake scored 85 10 middle lake scored 86 68 and east lake scored 87 32 the spatial interpolation results show that in general the health of east lake middle lake west lake fig 6 the rivers entering yangcheng lake are mainly distributed in west lake while the rivers exiting the lake are mainly distributed in east lake as previously mentioned the flow direction in yangcheng lake is primarily from west to east chen et al 2012 the lake has a certain enhancing effect on water quality and nutrient retention and plays the role of sink or transformer wei et al 2014 therefore yangcheng lake s aquatic habitat gradually improves from west to east in addition since suzhou s main industrial park xiangcheng district is mainly located in west lake there is a risk that significant amounts of wastewater from printing dyeing other industrial facilities will directly discharge into the river and yangcheng lake which facilitates deterioration of west lake s health industrial transformation needs to be further strengthened to reduce wastewater discharge and bolster source control the qiputang dredging water diversion project implemented in middle lake was completed in 2016 and played a large role in drawing yangtze river water into yangcheng lake in 2018 and 2019 the qiputang yangtze river hub diverted 262 million m3 and 733 million m3 of water into yangcheng lake respectively totaling 1 2 2018 and 3 5 2019 times the amount of water stored in the yangcheng lake area about 210 million m3 the higher flow rate of diverted water from qiputang accelerates the renewal rate and reduces the hydraulic residence time of the lake helps reduce eutrophication and enhances the lake s self purification capacity chen et al 2020 li et al 2013 east lake is yangcheng lake s main aquaculture area according to the suzhou municipal water bureau statistics in 2020 the total nitrogen concentration in yangcheng lake s farming and purification ponds was 4 53 and 3 31 mg l respectively the high concentration of nitrogen containing aquaculture tailwater discharge will negatively impact the yangcheng lake basin s water quality to improve the water quality of the yangcheng lake area the water bureau and yangcheng lake aquaculture jointly carried out vigorous reform in response yangcheng lake aquaculture area was reduced from its peak of 94 67 km2 to the current 10 67 km2 moreover aquaculture seines were removed aquatic plants were gradually restored and the area became conducive to water purification 3 3 proposed standardized evaluation system in the current health evaluation work on chinese rivers and lakes there is a three tier analysis system consisting of national provincial and local assessments however each tier has a unique set of standards and thus is comprised of different evaluation indexes index weight determination methods and index assignment criteria etc these inconsistencies make it very difficult for administrators to uniformly map the health status of chinese rivers and lakes or analyze the main ecological and environmental problems threatening rivers and lakes in each region as such it is necessary to explore methodologies for standardizing the numerous existing evaluation systems based on the existing health evaluation work the ultimate goal is to design a health evaluation that is applicable to rivers and lakes in various provinces and cities and that reflects the health status and main limiting factors of each region in a comprehensive manner with respect to constructing the indicator system since the guidelines for river and lake health evaluation for trial implementation have been piloted across the country and certain results have been achieved to conveniently integrate and compare evaluation results it is recommended that provinces and municipalities 1 arrange the indicators according to the guidelines classification criteria 2 retain the function of alternative indicators and 3 categorize the indicators unique to each region and those not included in the guidelines as alternative indicators of major categories in determining the indicator weights it is recommended to use the approach adopted by the guidelines and suzhou city in which the indicator layers are considered separately to avoid the mutual redundancy phenomenon that occurs when indicators are assigned scores at the same time in addition by calculating the indicator weights layer by layer the weight values of each individual indicator can be appropriately balanced which circumvents the problem of some weights being too large and erroneously producing high or low scoring results concerning the evaluation criteria it is recommended to use the five levels suggested in the guidelines due to evaluation time sampling method and operational standardization of sampling personnel there are uncertainties in the current river and lake health evaluation system that cause health evaluation results to have large cumulative uncertainties for example using different sampling personnel may result in varied sampling and evaluation times which produces large differences in health evaluation results over the same time period increasing the scoring interval s grading level and improving the results flexibility are conducive to eliminating evaluation results uncertainty regarding evaluation methods the purpose of conducting river and lake health evaluations is to diagnose the main water ecological environmental problems in rivers and lakes compile a list of issues then design customized river and lake management plans and ecological restoration projects as such providing fast and accurate health evaluation results for government departments to use in decision making is a pivotal part of this process however large index systems extensive index evaluation data collection and long processing times substantially hinder this effort and thus it is among the urgent engineering problems that require a solution to resolve this issue it is suggested that when conducting river and lake health evaluations different evaluation processes be set up for emergency and standard scenarios fig 7 in emergency situations e g when river and lake health in the jurisdictional area drastically deteriorates or there is a water ecological and environmental crisis eutrophication black smelly water bodies etc it is recommended to default to the one vote veto methodology that was implemented in jiangsu province in this case one indicator that most affects river and lake health as well as individual and societal health is selected in each guideline layer to form a one vote veto group the overall evaluation process is 1 1 1 2 1 or 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 which two paths are chosen depends on whether the one vote veto system is passed in a non emergency standard situation i e daily release of the jurisdiction s rivers and lakes health status and the health status s main limiting factors the evaluation process is 1 1 2 3 4 5 by standardizing the existing river and lake health evaluation process government entity awareness of river and lake protection requirements improves as does the awareness and enthusiasm of residents to safeguard rivers and lakes 4 conclusion in this work we analyzed the similarities and differences between national provincial jiangsu province and local suzhou city river and lake health evaluation standards and used all three methods to evaluate the health of yangcheng lake suzhou jiangsu province china the results show that the differences in the evaluation index system and index assignment methods among the three evaluation methods are small but the differences in index weights and assignment criteria are large in jiangsu province the evaluation method index weights were calculated by taking all the index layers as a whole without considering the weight of each individual index layer which runs the risk of a single indicator influencing the final result in addition the national evaluation method s assignment criteria are more detailed and stringent thus the evaluation results may be artificially low the yangcheng lake health evaluation results from the three different evaluation methods were basically the same with yangcheng lake s health status in the healthy sub healthy range and gradually decreasing from west to east the existing chinese national provincial local three level health evaluation system is integrated and methods for standardizing the index system index weights and evaluation process are proposed to provide theoretical support for water resources management and water ecology restoration in freshwater bodies such as rivers and lakes in china yangcheng lake in suzhou city jiangsu province was selected as the research object for this study herein the existing ministry of water resources lake health evaluation method jiangsu province lake health evaluation method and suzhou city river and lake health evaluation method were used to respectively evaluate the health of yangcheng lake and propose a process for standardizing river and lake health evaluation however this paper is only an example analysis in which jiangsu province and yangcheng lake were assessed to obtain partial results at present sichuan guizhou and guangdong provinces in china have individualized health evaluation methods based on their own river and lake characteristics large rivers small and medium rivers river ratio mountain rivers and plain rivers and have used these non standardized protocols to perform river and lake health evaluations thus it is recommended that future studies should include follow up work designed 1 using simulation studies as validations 2 using more lakes in various environments e g plateau mountainous and plains areas to evaluate whether those two evaluation processes are effective in the long term 3 using several provinces and cities to verify the rationality of the standardized evaluation process proposed in this paper although the g method has set mandatory and alternative indicators it cannot be applied to all lakes in plain land plateau mountain area and urban area due to the influence of climate change and geographical conditions such as altitude the index weight calculation method set by the p method will lead to a large difference in calculation results the index system set by the c method is only for lakes in suzhou city which cannot be promoted to overcome the shortcomings of the existing methods the novel proposed method retains the function of alternative indicators and categorizes the indicators unique to each region and those not included in the guidelines as alternative indicators of major categories using the five levels suggested in the guidelines increasing the scoring

research on a high mountain stream in the peñalara massif within the sierra de guadarrama national park central spain this mountain area has a seasonal snowpack that is subject to large interannual variability in terms of thickness and duration the hydrological role of snow in this area has not yet been assessed the effect of snowmelt on the shape of the hydrograph is unclear as well as the

how routing and transit time of precipitation and snowmelt controls the catchment response for this purpose we investigated the snow dynamics and climate conditions in the catchment the isotope composition of precipitation and streamwaters twice daily streamwater and daily precipitation samples were collected over two contrasting water years 2017 which was one of the snowiest years in recent decades and 2018 which was a very poor snow year the samples were used to i evaluate how the snowpack affected runoff timing and the δ18o and δ2h isotopes in both precipitation and streamwater during the melt period ii determine whether the snowpack caused changes in the isotopic composition during the two study snow years and iii determine the existence or absence of sub daily fluctuations in the streamflow characteristics to infer the time that melt water and precipitation water took to reach the basin outlet 2 study area the study area is in the central system in the iberian peninsula in the sierra de guadarrama national park 60 km north of madrid the studied basin the peñalara catchment fig 1 has a surface area of 1 36 km2 and a maximum elevation the peñalara peak 40 51 n 3 57 w of 2428 m a s l the gauging station where runoff is measured and streamwater was sampled is located at 1936 m a s l the nearest automatic weather station aws is 2 km from the gauging station at puerto de los cotos 1857 m a s l and includes a precipitation collector durán et al 2017 palacios et al 2003 the peñalara cirque is composed by an orthogneiss substratum partially covered by quaternary deposits derived from glacial and periglacial processes such as moraines scree slopes and hollows palacios et al 2003 lópez olmedo et al 2020 these materials act in conjunction with the network of fractures and diaclases as aquifers or shallow water reservoirs in which water circulation does not usually reach more than 10 m deep discharge from these deposits results in surges and springs on the slopes of the peñalara massif with flow rates of a few litres per second yélamos et al 2019 the hydrochemical characteristics of the groundwater are like those of the surface water with low conductivity slightly acidic ph and calcium sodium bicarbonate chloride facies yélamos et al 2019 no isotope analysis of groundwater is available the vegetation is related to elevation relatively dense pinus sylvestris forests grow up to 1900 m a s l while the upper area of the catchment is dominated by shrubs cytisus oromediterraneus and juniperus alpina and terrain above 2100 m a s l is mostly covered by alpine meadows festuca curvifolia and bare rocks palacios et al 2003 peñalara lake 127 m long maximum depth 4 5 m is located within the catchment at an elevation of 2017 m a s l its drainage area encompasses approximately 30 of the total catchment area the mean annual number of days having snow cover at the cotos aws during the period 2014 2020 was 82 days the effect of snow on the hydrological regime of the catchment is shown in the delayed hydrological response to monthly precipitation fig 2 precipitation data reflected the occurrence of two wet periods november december that sums 450 mm and march april that sums 370 mm despite precipitation in the fall is larger to the one in spring the runoff peak in spring was slightly larger spring runoff peak also showed a temporal delay to the precipitation peak because of the melting of the snowpack thus runoff in may was 58 9 l s 1 with only a precipitation of 91 mm during the fall precipitation and runoff peaks were synchronous the annual minimum precipitation and streamflow period occurred from july to september 3 methods 3 1 water sampling and isotope analysis streamflow water samples for isotope analysis were collected twice daily from the peñalara stream by officers of the sierra de guadarrama national park the samples were collected manually at the gauging station fig 1 at approximately 09 00 h generally under very low snowmelt conditions and 17 00 h generally close to the daily peak melt period the samples were transported in an isothermal bag and stored at 6 c at the national park office in small bottles 10 ml with no head space to avoid evaporation the transport never lasted more than one hour so evaporation was prevented samples of precipitation water were collected from a sheltered against radiation precipitation collector early in the morning on the day following any snowfall or rainfall the precipitation samples also for isotope analyses were treated in a similar manner like the streamflow samples when precipitation was collected as snow it was slowly melted in the fridge to avoid fractionation six samples were discarded because of their suspicious deviation in d excess the continuous sampling period commenced on 2 april 2018 just prior to the maximum snow accumulation recorded that year and ceased on 3 august more samples were taken at the end of august and in early september when the minimum streamflow occurred continuous sampling commenced again on 26 january 2019 following the first substantial winter snowfall and ceased on 17 july when the typical minimum annual runoff levels were reached once a year all the water samples were transported under cold conditions to the laboratory of the pyrenean institute of ecology csic water isotope analyses of precipitation and streamwater were performed at the pyrenean institute of ecology ipe csic spain using a picarro l2130 i wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy ws crds instrument picarro inc sunnyvale ca usa for precipitation and streamwater aliquots of water were filtered and filled in 2 ml glass vials and sealed with rubber aluminium caps water was then injected using a syringe eight times directly into the vaporisation unit of the analyser and the three first values were discarded due to memory effect drift correction was made using raw data and analytical uncertainty of measurements was typically 0 1 for δ18o and 0 5 1 for δd the robustness of the results is guaranteed by calibration with international atomic energy agency iaea standards analyzed before and after every 9 10 samples oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δd isotope ratios were given in permil using the delta notation and are reported against vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow a total of 95 precipitation snowfall or rainfall and 571 streamwater samples were analyzed in this study 3 2 climate and snow data precipitation and snow depth data used in this study were obtained from the cotos meteorological station fig 1 precipitation every 10 min was measured using a geonor t200b all weather vibrating wire load gauge data were converted into daily totals two data sources were used to characterize the snowpack and to define the accumulation melt and post melt periods first the depth of the snow cover was measured every 10 min using an ultrasonic range finder campbell sr50a https www campbellsci es sr50a last accessed on 15 08 2021 installed at the cotos meteorological station second we extracted data from the sentinel 2 snow cover products that are available for the study area in the theia snow collection for the water years 2017 and 2018 gascoin et al 2020 these products provide data on the absence or presence of snow cover every five days at a grid resolution of 20 m cloud permitting given the small size of the study catchment and its 5 day revisit time sentinel 2 was the best source of satellite data to characterize the snow cover area and temporal variability 3 3 data analysis based on snow cover each snow season was separated into four periods including i the accumulation period which ran from the first appearance of snow cover until the last day that 100 of the area was snow covered ii the melt period which followed the accumulation period until the snow cover depletion date defined by the presence of snow in less than 5 of the basin iii the first month 30 days after the snow cover depletion date and iv the second month after the snow cover depletion date in this study we use water years wy i e period between october 1st of one year and september 30th of the next year instead of calendar years because part of the precipitation that falls in autumn and early winter accumulates as snow and does not drain until the following spring the isotope composition of precipitation water was differentiated according to the phase of the precipitation of the day liquid rainfall solid snowfall or mixed rainfall and snow the phase of precipitation was recorded by the observer of the weather station daily fluctuations in the isotope composition of the streamflow was calculated as the ratio of the isotope values determined for the morning and evening samples each day 4 results 4 1 snow variability in the peñalara catchment the snow depth at the cotos meteorological station showed marked interannual variability between 2014 and 2020 fig 3 in 2015 2016 and 2018 the snowpack was persistent and reached 1 m depth while in other years e g 2017 2019 and 2020 the snow cover was intermittent rarely reaching 50 cm depth and remaining present for only short periods in relatively snow rich water years such as wy2017 the catchment was completely covered by snow for almost three months in wy2018 the snowpack was ephemeral until late january with only rare snowfalls fully covering the catchment for only a few days the snowpack disappeared at the cotos meteorological station in late march only isolated snowfalls occurred during april and the catchment was completely snow free since early june the strong differences in water stored as snow in wy 2017 and 2018 also affected to the whole central system as reported by the monitoring program performed by the general directorate of water of the spanish government https www miteco gob es es agua temas evaluacion de los recursos hidricos vafn ater por cordillera tcm30 539431 png 4 2 temporal evolution of the streamflow response and stable water isotopes the marked differences in snow cover and snow duration between the water years 2017 and 2018 fig 4b resulted in very different hydrological responses in the catchment fig 4c a long and sustained period of low levels of streamflow only interrupted by isolated precipitation events observed during february and march wy2017 was followed by a period of sustained high levels of streamflow during melting period fig 4c the very wet conditions alternating solid and liquid precipitation events 547 mm of total precipitation at cotos station during march and april prior to the freshet suggest increased catchment storage that could also contribute to explain the very high levels of streamflow the hydrological response of the catchment shows a progressive depletion and it was almost exhausted one month after snow cover depleted in the entire catchment streamflow from august to november was close to 0 l s 1 the streamflow during the cold period in wy2018 generally exceeded that in the previous year despite the lower precipitation 518 and 253 mm from january to march in wy2017 and wy2018 respectively and spring streamflow during the melting period was markedly lower shown also in fig 5 with a single peak of runoff coinciding with some rain events that accumulated 160 mm that melted the modest snowpack that had accumulated by april in 75 of snowfall events δ18o ranged from 13 to 8 fig 4d however by the end of march and early april in wy2017 four snowfall days occurred on which the values ranged from 25 to 15 the rainfall isotope value δ18o ranged from 10 to 3 for 80 of the events however the values in a series of rainfall events in autumn wy2018 ranged from 15 to 10 only four events showed values higher than 3 to 0 the streamwater isotopic signal δ18o showed values close to 13 at the beginning of the sampling period early april wy2017 following the very low snowfall values recorded in the preceding days later the streamwater isotope values became progressively higher with a steeper rise during the first part of the melt period until early june followed by a more gentle increase the increase was even slower from the snow cover depletion date until the sampling ceased the end of august at that time the streamwater isotopic signal was approximately 10 the melt period in wy2018 began with markedly lower values in the streamwater δ18o value of 12 2 compared with wy2017 δ18o value of 10 1 during the entire sampling year there was a progressive change in the isotopic signal independently of the occurrence of precipitation events or of the observed runoff peak from 10 2 in early february until values of 9 5 at the end of the sampling period early august wy2018 in both years the isotope composition of precipitation varied markedly among rain and snow events but no direct influence of the precipitation type on the streamwater isotopic composition was found as the isotopic composition gradually evolved from the cold to the warm periods fig 5 summarizes the temporal evolution of streamflow and streamwater δ18o during the periods when the catchment was fully covered by snow in the period of snow cover depletion melting and in the first and second months after the snow was completely depleted this figure clearly illustrates the impact of a winter that had more precipitation and a thicker snowpack wy2017 which generated high levels of sustained runoff during melting on dates exceeding one month after the snow depletion date the catchment runoff was very low in both years with values that rarely exceeded 5 l s 1 δ18o values showed an inverse but synchronous pattern with the lowest δ18o and the highest values occurring during the main accumulation and melt periods and a marked increase in δ18o values during the first month during the snow free period in wy2017 or later on wy2018 differences among periods were much more marked during wy2017 the δ18o values at the end of the sampling period for wy2017 were similar to those recorded in wy2018 at the beginning of the sampling period when the basin was completely covered by snow an anova analysis revealed that isotopic composition of streamwater was not statistically different when compared to snow covered and snow melting periods nor when 1st and 2nd snow free months are compared however there are statistically significant differences p 0 01 between values for snow covered and snow melting periods and between the values of 1st and 2nd snow free months 4 3 daily fluctuations of streamflow and the streamwater isotopic signal daily fluctuations in the streamflow ratio between maximum and minimum daily values were very low when the catchment was completely covered by snow and at the very end of the melt period but the streamflow showed marked sub daily fluctuations during the main melt period fig 6 during the months following snow depletion the fluctuations again increased as the streamflow declined and approached the base flow conditions the daily fluctuations of streamflow during the warm period may have been associated with the daily cycle of evapotranspiration similarly to what has been found in other alpine catchments lundquist and cayan 2002 woelber et al 2018 the daily fluctuations during the melt period were markedly more intense and sustained over time during the snow rich year wy2017 some other periods in january and march 2017 and november 2018 show high daily fluctuations of streamflow out of the main melting periods it corresponds to periods with very low streamflow values for which small variations of streamflow in absolute e g liquid precipitations events may lead to high relative variations in contrast the daily fluctuations of δ18o were very low with almost no temporal pattern the major fluctuations were observed during days when liquid precipitation occurred but most were similar to or lower than the instrument measurement error 5 discussion lower and more variable isotope compositions were found during snowfall and higher and less variable isotope values were associated with rainfall events during both years the streamwater isotope values showed a continuous increase from the beginning of the melt period to the end of the sampling period this temporal evolution is very similar to that reported in other studies focused on melt waters dietermann and weiler 2013 fan et al 2014 feng et al 2002 holko et al 2013 lee et al 2010 this pattern is generally associated with a transition in the relative contributions from snowmelt to more rain and groundwater to the stream as temperature is warmer and also with isotope fractionation during ablation sublimation and refreezing of the snowpack during the melt period dietermann and weiler 2013 fan et al 2014 research conducted in other snow dominated sites also point out that the isotopic composition of snowfall is very variable in time and space due to the source of the atmospheric moisture and to altitudinal effects beria et al 2018 niewodnizański et al 1981 however the isotopic composition of the snowpack becomes more homogeneous specially at the melting time holko et al 2020 2013 penna et al 2014 in this sense the occurrence of rain on snow events can also isotopically enrich the snowpack composition the results strongly suggest that the different snow accumulations in the two study years led to marked differences in the streamwater isotope values and their temporal evolution the δ18o and δ2h values were consistently lower during wy2017 snow abundant than wy2018 low snow year and the highest values reached in the warm period of wy2018 were very close to those at the beginning of the melt period of that year however the differences cannot be associated only with the larger volume of melted snow during the snow abundant year they must also be related to the very low values for solid precipitation just prior to the commencement of the melting period in wy2017 this finding is consistent with those of lee et al 2010 who found that the initial isotope composition of snowfall is important in determining the evolution of the isotope composition of the snowpack and its meltwaters leading to marked interannual variability in the streamwater isotopic signal such interannual variability indicates the existing uncertainty when using stable water isotopes to determine the contribution of snowmelt to total runoff without isotope measurements of the precipitation the increase in δ18o over the late melt seasons and following months in each of the two study years was not strongly influenced by rainfall inputs into the snowpack and the slope of the increase did not change significantly when snowmelt finished and the basin was free of snow this pattern and the very small sub daily fluctuations in the isotopic signal during the accumulation melt and post melt phases suggest a long transit time in the catchment for water inputs from snowmelt and precipitation this is somewhat surprising given the small size of the catchment and its impermeable granitic lithology and large areas of rocky outcrops it is likely that peñalara lake which drains 34 of the catchment surface area and has a mean turnover time of 9 days toro et al 2006 plays a role in mixing water inputs over several days and so buffers some of the potential daily and sub daily variability in water inputs leach and laudon 2019 however this is not a sufficient explanation of the steady evolution of isotope enrichment and the absence of sub daily fluctuations the most plausible explanation is groundwater storage in coarse sediments e g talus and moraines that act as alpine aquifers hayashi 2020 tague and grant 2009 these types of deposits are abundant in the catchment and have an important role in the underground hydrology yélamos et al 2019 the importance of the groundwater storage must explain that single isotope inputs are not quickly transferred to stream response although the runoff has a relatively direct response to water inputs showing sub daily cycles in particular during snowmelt period in snow dominated catchments krogh et al 2022 the absence of variability in the isotope composition suggests that alpine aquifers acted as an intermediate reservoir the peñalara massif has greater subsurface drainage than the surrounding mountains where most of the streams are dry or have very low baseflow during the warmest and driest period suggesting the importance of groundwater contributions yélamos et al 2019 thus as has been hypothesized for river basins of svalbard blaen et al 2014 we assume that daily melt water or rainfall infiltrates into alpine aquifers and displaces the previously stored water piston flow rather than following a direct meltwater or rainfall runoff scheme yang et al 2012 a similar process has been observed in other alpine areas dominated by snowmelt balestra et al 2022 woelber et al 2018 future research should consider a more intense spatial and temporal water sampling in the catchment including vertical gradients of precipitation snowpack water of the lake groundwater and springs this data would confirm the hypotheses developed in this study about the hydrological functioning of the catchment and would open the possibility to perform model analyses to quantitatively discern the role of snowmelt and liquid precipitation in the hydrological response during spring and early summer 6 conclusions the results of this study highlight the marked influence of snow on the peñalara catchment hydrology the high interannual variability of isotope values in streamwater and the importance of alpine aquifers in the catchment which is representative of many mountain areas in central spain the different snow conditions affected the magnitude of the spring freshet by delaying and increasing the spring peakflow during the snow abundant year but also the h and o isotopic signals in the streamwater the streamwater δ18o and δ2h values showed in both analysed years increasing values from the beginning of the melt period to the warm and dry summer period however the values in the warm period of wy2017 were similar to those at the beginning of the melt period in the snow poor wy2018 this interannual variability highlights the difficulty in establishing reference values for streamflow coming from snowmelt however such reference values are often used in mixing models attempting to quantify the contribution of melt to total runoff the steady isotope enrichment independent of the occurrence of precipitation events or the complete depletion of snow cover in the basin and the absence of daily fluctuations in the isotope composition of the water suggest the involvement of alpine aquifers in storing and mixing melt water and precipitation this stored water is displaced to the river channel through subsurface flow in direct proportion to new inputs of water entering the aquifer explaining the occurrence of marked daily and sub daily fluctuations in streamflow during the melt period credit authorship contribution statement juan ignacio lópez moreno conceptualization

delay to the precipitation peak because of the melting of the snowpack thus runoff in may was 58 9 l s 1 with only a precipitation of 91 mm during the fall precipitation and runoff peaks were synchronous the annual minimum precipitation and streamflow period occurred from july to september 3 methods 3 1 water sampling and isotope analysis streamflow water samples for isotope analysis were collected twice daily from the peñalara stream by officers of the sierra de guadarrama national park the samples were collected manually at the gauging station fig 1 at approximately 09 00 h generally under very low snowmelt conditions and 17 00 h generally close to the daily peak melt period the samples were transported in an isothermal bag and stored at 6 c at the national park office in small bottles 10 ml with no head space to avoid evaporation the transport never lasted more than one hour so evaporation was prevented samples of precipitation water were collected from a sheltered against radiation precipitation collector early in the morning on the day following any snowfall or rainfall the precipitation samples also for isotope analyses were treated in a similar manner like the streamflow samples when precipitation was collected as snow it was slowly melted in the fridge to avoid fractionation six samples were discarded because of their suspicious deviation in d excess the continuous sampling period commenced on 2 april 2018 just prior to the maximum snow accumulation recorded that year and ceased on 3 august more samples were taken at the end of august and in early september when the minimum streamflow occurred continuous sampling commenced again on 26 january 2019 following the first substantial winter snowfall and ceased on 17 july when the typical minimum annual runoff levels were reached once a year all the water samples were transported under cold conditions to the laboratory of the pyrenean institute of ecology csic water isotope analyses of precipitation and streamwater were performed at the pyrenean institute of ecology ipe csic spain using a picarro l2130 i wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy ws crds instrument picarro inc sunnyvale ca usa for precipitation and streamwater aliquots of water were filtered and filled in 2 ml glass vials and sealed with rubber aluminium caps water was then injected using a syringe eight times directly into the vaporisation unit of the analyser and the three first values were discarded due to memory effect drift correction was made using raw data and analytical uncertainty of measurements was typically 0 1 for δ18o and 0 5 1 for δd the robustness of the results is guaranteed by calibration with international atomic energy agency iaea standards analyzed before and after every 9 10 samples oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δd isotope ratios were given in permil using the delta notation and are reported against vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow a total of 95 precipitation snowfall or rainfall and 571 streamwater samples were analyzed in this study 3 2 climate and snow data precipitation and snow depth data used in this study were obtained from the cotos meteorological station fig 1 precipitation every 10 min was measured using a geonor t200b all weather vibrating wire load gauge data were converted into daily totals two data sources were used to characterize the snowpack and to define the accumulation melt and post melt periods first the depth of the snow cover was measured every 10 min using an ultrasonic range finder campbell sr50a https www campbellsci es sr50a last accessed on 15 08 2021 installed at the cotos meteorological station second we extracted data from the sentinel 2 snow cover products that are available for the study area in the theia snow collection for the water years 2017 and 2018 gascoin et al 2020 these products provide data on the absence or presence of snow cover every five days at a grid resolution of 20 m cloud permitting given the small size of the study catchment and its 5 day revisit time sentinel 2 was the best source of satellite data to characterize the snow cover area and temporal variability 3 3 data analysis based on snow cover each snow season was separated into four periods including i the accumulation period which ran from the first appearance of snow cover until the last day that 100 of the area was snow covered ii the melt period which followed the accumulation period until the snow cover depletion date defined by the presence of snow in less than 5 of the basin iii the first month 30 days after the snow cover depletion date and iv the second month after the snow cover depletion date in this study we use water years wy i e period between october 1st of one year and september 30th of the next year instead of calendar years because part of the precipitation that falls in autumn and early winter accumulates as snow and does not drain until the following spring the isotope composition of precipitation water was differentiated according to the phase of the precipitation of the day liquid rainfall solid snowfall or mixed rainfall and snow the phase of precipitation was recorded by the observer of the weather station daily fluctuations in the isotope composition of the streamflow was calculated as the ratio of the isotope values determined for the morning and evening samples each day 4 results 4 1 snow variability in the peñalara catchment the snow depth at the cotos meteorological station showed marked interannual variability between 2014 and 2020 fig 3 in 2015 2016 and 2018 the snowpack was persistent and reached 1 m depth while in other years e g 2017 2019 and 2020 the snow cover was intermittent rarely reaching 50 cm depth and remaining present for only short periods in relatively snow rich water years such as wy2017 the catchment was completely covered by snow for almost three months in wy2018 the snowpack was ephemeral until late january with only rare snowfalls fully covering the catchment for only a few days the snowpack disappeared at the cotos meteorological station in late march only isolated snowfalls occurred during april and the catchment was completely snow free since early june the strong differences in water stored as snow in wy 2017 and 2018 also affected to the whole central system as reported by the monitoring program performed by the general directorate of water of the spanish government https www miteco gob es es agua temas evaluacion de los recursos hidricos vafn ater por cordillera tcm30 539431 png 4 2 temporal evolution of the streamflow response and stable water isotopes the marked differences in snow cover and snow duration between the water years 2017 and 2018 fig 4b resulted in very different hydrological responses in the catchment fig 4c a long and sustained period of low levels of streamflow only interrupted by isolated precipitation events observed during february and march wy2017 was followed by a period of sustained high levels of streamflow during melting period fig 4c the very wet conditions alternating solid and liquid precipitation events 547 mm of total precipitation at cotos station during march and april prior to the freshet suggest increased catchment storage that could also contribute to explain the very high levels of streamflow the hydrological response of the catchment shows a progressive depletion and it was almost exhausted one month after snow cover depleted in the entire catchment streamflow from august to november was close to 0 l s 1 the streamflow during the cold period in wy2018 generally exceeded that in the previous year despite the lower precipitation 518 and 253 mm from january to march in wy2017 and wy2018 respectively and spring streamflow during the melting period was markedly lower shown also in fig 5 with a single peak of runoff coinciding with some rain events that accumulated 160 mm that melted the modest snowpack that had accumulated by april in 75 of snowfall events δ18o ranged from 13 to 8 fig 4d however by the end of march and early april in wy2017 four snowfall days occurred on which the values ranged from 25 to 15 the rainfall isotope value δ18o ranged from 10 to 3 for 80 of the events however the values in a series of rainfall events in autumn wy2018 ranged from 15 to 10 only four events showed values higher than 3 to 0 the streamwater isotopic signal δ18o showed values close to 13 at the beginning of the sampling period early april wy2017 following the very low snowfall values recorded in the preceding days later the streamwater isotope values became progressively higher with a steeper rise during the first part of the melt period until early june followed by a more gentle increase the increase was even slower from the snow cover depletion date until the sampling ceased the end of august at that time the streamwater isotopic signal was approximately 10 the melt period in wy2018 began with markedly lower values in the streamwater δ18o value of 12 2 compared with wy2017 δ18o value of 10 1 during the entire sampling year there was a progressive change in the isotopic signal independently of the occurrence of precipitation events or of the observed runoff peak from 10 2 in early february until values of 9 5 at the end of the sampling period early august wy2018 in both years the isotope composition of precipitation varied markedly among rain and snow events but no direct influence of the precipitation type on the streamwater isotopic composition was found as the isotopic composition gradually evolved from the cold to the warm periods fig 5 summarizes the temporal evolution of streamflow and streamwater δ18o during the periods when the catchment was fully covered by snow in the period of snow cover depletion melting and in the first and second months after the snow was completely depleted this figure clearly illustrates the impact of a winter that had more precipitation and a thicker snowpack wy2017 which generated high levels of sustained runoff during melting on dates exceeding one month after the snow depletion date the catchment runoff was very low in both years with values that rarely exceeded 5 l s 1 δ18o values showed an inverse but synchronous pattern with the lowest δ18o and the highest values occurring during the main accumulation and melt periods and a marked increase in δ18o values during the first month during the snow free period in wy2017 or later on wy2018 differences among periods were much more marked during wy2017 the δ18o values at the end of the sampling period for wy2017 were similar to those recorded in wy2018 at the beginning of the sampling period when the basin was completely covered by snow an anova analysis revealed that isotopic composition of streamwater was not statistically different when compared to snow covered and snow melting periods nor when 1st and 2nd snow free months are compared however there are statistically significant differences p 0 01 between values for snow covered and snow melting periods and between the values of 1st and 2nd snow free months 4 3 daily fluctuations of streamflow and the streamwater isotopic signal daily fluctuations in the streamflow ratio between maximum and minimum daily values were very low when the catchment was completely covered by snow and at the very end of the melt period but the streamflow showed marked sub daily fluctuations during the main melt period fig 6 during the months following snow depletion the fluctuations again increased as the streamflow declined and approached the base flow conditions the daily fluctuations of streamflow during the warm period may have been associated with the daily cycle of evapotranspiration similarly to what has been found in other alpine catchments lundquist and cayan 2002 woelber et al 2018 the daily fluctuations during the melt period were markedly more intense and sustained over time during the snow rich year wy2017 some other periods in january and march 2017 and november 2018 show high daily fluctuations of streamflow out of the main melting periods it corresponds to periods with very low streamflow values for which small variations of streamflow in absolute e g liquid precipitations events may lead to high relative variations in contrast the daily fluctuations of δ18o were very low with almost no temporal pattern the major fluctuations were observed during days when liquid precipitation occurred but most were similar to or lower than the instrument measurement error 5 discussion lower and more variable isotope compositions were found during snowfall and higher and less variable isotope values were associated with rainfall events during both years the streamwater isotope values showed a continuous increase from the beginning of the melt period to the end of the sampling period this temporal evolution is very similar to that reported in other studies focused on melt waters dietermann and weiler 2013 fan et al 2014 feng et al 2002 holko et al 2013 lee et al 2010 this pattern is generally associated with a transition in the relative contributions from snowmelt to more rain and groundwater to the stream as temperature is warmer and also with isotope fractionation during ablation sublimation and refreezing of the snowpack during the melt period dietermann and weiler 2013 fan et al 2014 research conducted in other snow dominated sites also point out that the isotopic composition of snowfall is very variable in time and space due to the source of the atmospheric moisture and to altitudinal effects beria et al 2018 niewodnizański et al 1981 however the isotopic composition of the snowpack becomes more homogeneous specially at the melting time holko et al 2020 2013 penna et al 2014 in this sense the occurrence of rain on snow events can also isotopically enrich the snowpack composition the results strongly suggest that the different snow accumulations in the two study years led to marked differences in the streamwater isotope values and their temporal evolution the δ18o and δ2h values were consistently lower during wy2017 snow abundant than wy2018 low snow year and the highest values reached in the warm period of wy2018 were very close to those at the beginning of the melt period of that year however the differences cannot be associated only with the larger volume of melted snow during the snow abundant year they must also be related to the very low values for solid precipitation just prior to the commencement of the melting period in wy2017 this finding is consistent with those of lee et al 2010 who found that the initial isotope composition of snowfall is important in determining the evolution of the isotope composition of the snowpack and its meltwaters leading to marked interannual variability in the streamwater isotopic signal such interannual variability indicates the existing uncertainty when using stable water isotopes to determine the contribution of snowmelt to total runoff without isotope measurements of the precipitation the increase in δ18o over the late melt seasons and following months in each of the two study years was not strongly influenced by rainfall inputs into the snowpack and the slope of the increase did not change significantly when snowmelt finished and the basin was free of snow this pattern and the very small sub daily fluctuations in the isotopic signal during the accumulation melt and post melt phases suggest a long transit time in the catchment for water inputs from snowmelt and precipitation this is somewhat surprising given the small size of the catchment and its impermeable granitic lithology and large areas of rocky outcrops it is likely that peñalara lake which drains 34 of the catchment surface area and has a mean turnover time of 9 days toro et al 2006 plays a role in mixing water inputs over several days and so buffers some of the potential daily and sub daily variability in water inputs leach and laudon 2019 however this is not a sufficient explanation of the steady evolution of isotope enrichment and the absence of sub daily fluctuations the most plausible explanation is groundwater storage in coarse sediments e g talus and moraines that act as alpine aquifers hayashi 2020 tague and grant 2009 these types of deposits are abundant in the catchment and have an important role in the underground hydrology yélamos et al 2019 the importance of the groundwater storage must explain that single isotope inputs are not quickly transferred to stream response although the runoff has a relatively direct response to water inputs showing sub daily cycles in particular during snowmelt period in snow dominated catchments krogh et al 2022 the absence of variability in the isotope composition suggests that alpine aquifers acted as an intermediate reservoir the peñalara massif has greater subsurface drainage than the surrounding mountains where most of the streams are dry or have very low baseflow during the warmest and driest period suggesting the importance of groundwater contributions yélamos et al 2019 thus as has been hypothesized for river basins of svalbard blaen et al 2014 we assume that daily melt water or rainfall infiltrates into alpine aquifers and displaces the previously stored water piston flow rather than following a direct meltwater or rainfall runoff scheme yang et al 2012 a similar process has been observed in other alpine areas dominated by snowmelt balestra et al 2022 woelber et al 2018 future research should consider a more intense spatial and temporal water sampling in the catchment including vertical gradients of precipitation snowpack water of the lake groundwater and springs this data would confirm the hypotheses developed in this study about the hydrological functioning of the catchment and would open the possibility to perform model analyses to quantitatively discern the role of snowmelt and liquid precipitation in the hydrological response during spring and early summer 6 conclusions the results of this study highlight the marked influence of snow on the peñalara catchment hydrology the high interannual variability of isotope values in streamwater and the importance of alpine aquifers in the catchment which is representative of many mountain areas in central spain the different snow conditions affected the magnitude of the spring freshet by delaying and increasing the spring peakflow during the snow abundant year but also the h and o isotopic signals in the streamwater the streamwater δ18o and δ2h values showed in both analysed years increasing values from the beginning of the melt period to the warm and dry summer period however the values in the warm period of wy2017 were similar to those at the beginning of the melt period in the snow poor wy2018 this interannual variability highlights the difficulty in establishing reference values for streamflow coming from snowmelt however such reference values are often used in mixing models attempting to quantify the contribution of melt to total runoff the steady isotope enrichment independent of the occurrence of precipitation events or the complete depletion of snow cover in the basin and the absence of daily fluctuations in the isotope composition of the water suggest the involvement of alpine aquifers in storing and mixing melt water and precipitation this stored water is displaced to the river channel through subsurface flow in direct proportion to new inputs of water entering the aquifer explaining the occurrence of marked daily and sub daily fluctuations in streamflow during the melt period credit authorship contribution statement juan ignacio lópez moreno conceptualization

groundwater potential zones of northern ethiopia s geba drainage basin nine groundwater indicators were used as inputs including lithology geomorphology lineament density drainage density slope elevation land use and land cover rainfall and soil according to their relative influence on groundwater potentiality the thematic layers and their classes were assigned appropriate weights based on saaty s 1 9 judgment scale the assigned weights were then normalized using an eigen vector based analytical hierarchy process by superimposing all the normalized layers in the gis environment a groundwater potential map was developed new hydrological insights for the region five distinct groundwater potential zones very good good moderate poor and very poor were found in the study area the areal distribution showed that majority of the area 45 fell within the poor groundwater potential zone the groundwater potential zones of moderate very poor good and very good cover approximately 27

the geba drainage basin is a region in ethiopia s northern highlands characterized by a semi arid climate and a fragile landscape the coupling effects of intense seasonal rainfall steep slopes and livestock densities greatly amplify soil erosion and land degradation vanmaercke et al 2008 this makes the area the most water stressed and food in secure gebreyohannes et al 2017 in the study area there is limited information to provide as a basis for the selection of groundwater supply sites such as boreholes as a result both the governmental and private sectors have been relied on traditional experiences existing water point sites to select groundwater supply sites identifying groundwater potential zones in relation to groundwater indicators such as elevation slope drainage density geomorphology lithology soil lineament density land use and land cover and rainfall is a viable option for tackling the existing problem in this context hence the current work is an attempt to delineate the geba drainage basin s groundwater potential zones using remotely sensed data and a gis based analytical hierarchy process the following three main objectives have been addressed for this purpose i to identify and extract groundwater governing thematic layers from various sources including remote sensing imagery and existing sources ii to identify potential groundwater resource areas using a gis based weighted linear combination of different thematic layers and iii to validate the potential capability of remotely sensed data coupled with a gis based analytical hierarch process in predicting groundwater potential zones the output of the study can be used as preliminary information by planners and decision makers in the planning and management of groundwater resources in the study area it specifically provides first hand knowledge for a variety of practical reasons including selecting groundwater extraction locations prior to undertaking geophysical and hydrogeological investigations 2 method and materials 2 1 description of the study area the study was undertaken on the geba river basin in northern ethiopia it is the main tributary of the tekeze river basin which is situated in the upper part of the nile river basin it lies at a latitude of 12 55 00 to 14 10 00 north and a longitude of 38 45 00 to 39 35 00 east on the geographic grid system fig 1 it originates at an elevation of 3300 m mugulat mountain and runs 240 kilometers south west till it reaches the mouth tekeze main stream at an elevation of 926 m above mean sea level the basin covers a total drainage area of 5137 km2 majority of which is accumulated at elevations ranging from 2300 to 2500 m the drainage basin is in a mountainous area with a tropical climate only three months mid june to mid september are considered as rainy seasons while the rest of the months have prolonged dry weather based on data from meteorological stations inside and near the drainage basin for the past 13 years 2006 2018 the annual rainfall ranges from 450 mm to 950 mm with a mean of 624 mm the average temperature varies from 7 to 32 degrees celsius the drainage basin s geological layers include mesozoic sediments pre cambrian rocks tertiary volcanic rocks and palaeozoic sediments gebreyohannes et al 2013 the soil types stratified in the drainage basin are orthic acrisols dystric cambisols eutric cambisols humic cambisols eutric nitosols and cambic arenosols the major land cover use classes detected by satellite image analysis for the year 2018 comprise agricultural land bare land brush land forests settlements and water bodies according to hydrogeological studies major aquifers are not prevalent in the area and aquitards are used for water extraction instead tesfamichael 2009 2 2 data and data sources there are many factors that influence the occurrence distribution and storage of groundwater however in the current study only nine thematic layers including lithology geomorphology drainage density lineament density slope soil land use and cover rainfall and elevation were taken into consideration extensive literature review the availability of datasets and field observation are the determinant factors to select the specified layers some of those layers were derived from existing sources while others from remote sensing imagery the drainage density geomorphology slope and elevation layers were extracted from 30 m srtm dem currently accessible at http earthexplorer usgs gov the lineament density and land use land cover layers were generated using landsat 8 oli data obtained from http earthexplorer usgs gov the lithological layer was digitized from the geological map of ethiopia scale1 2 000 000 developed by the geological survey of ethiopia egs 1972 due to inadequate local data the soil layer was downloaded from 1 5 000 000 scale digital soil map of the world developed by the food and agricultural organization fao currently available at https data apps fao org to develop the rainfall layer long term annual rainfall data for the period 2006 2018 was collected from the ethiopian meteorological agency ema in addition to the thematic layers other sources of data were also used for various purposes topographic map scale 1 50 000 used to update the raw srtm dem was collected from the ethiopian mapping agency ema groundwater yield data of boreholes constructed by governmental and none governmental organizations were collected and utilized to validate the results of the employed method the data sources and their details are presented in table 1 2 3 preparation of thematic layers input data bases the lithology and soil layers were retrieved from the ethiopian geological map and the fao world digital soil map respectively the elevation and slope percent layers were generated from the srtm dem directly some procedural works were undertaken in order to prepare the other thematic layers the geomorphology layer was produced from dem using sayre s et al 2014 land form classification system according to this classification system land forms with 1 15 m relief and less than 8 slope are considered flat plains land forms with 15 30 m relief and less than 8 slope are categorized as smooth plains and land forms with a common slope 8 but varying in relief as 30 90 m 90 150 m 150 400 m and 400 m are defined as hills breaks low mountains and high mountains respectively the land use cover layer of the study area was extracted from landsat 8 oli dataset path 69 row 50 path 69 row 51 and path 68 row 50 of the year 2018 using erdas imagine software bands 3 4 and 5 of landsat 8 oli which represent the green red and near infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum were combined to create false colour composite fcc an effective combination for detecting land cover gupta and srivastava 2010 using this composite image supervised classification with a maximum likelihood algorithm was used to identify each class ghorbani nejad et al 2017 kaliraj et al 2015 this was enhanced by selecting training samples for each class and verifying with google earth image band 8 of the landsat 8 oli tirs imagery was utilized to determine lineament density layer in contrast to the other bands associated with landsat 8 oli band 8 has a high spatial resolution 15 m that allows for easy detection of lineaments the detected lineaments in the specified band were automatically extracted using geomatica software s line processing tool numerous studies confirm the performance of this tool in lineament extraction berhanu and hatiye 2020 ibrahim and mutua 2014 tolche 2021 recharging the groundwater system is the result of rainfall s long term influence berhanu and hatiye 2020 thus in the present study the rainfall layer was developed from 13 years of annual rainfall from 9 meteorological stations within and close to the drainage basin fig 1 to estimate the distribution of rainfall across the entire area the mean annual rainfall recorded at each meteorological station was spatially interpolated using the inverse distance weight idw algorithm in the arcgis spatial analyst tool abijith et al 2020 drainage density was derived from dem to improve accuracy the raw dem was first reconditioned with natural streams digitized from a topographic map in arcgis s arc hydro tool fenta et al 2017 to extract the drainage network an initiation value threshold value of 10 pixels was assigned it s worth noted that the drainage density obtained may differ depending on the threshold value chen et al 2018 reported that for dem data with the same spatial resolution drainage density reduces as the threshold value increases the detailed methodology employed in this study is displayed in fig 2 2 4 weight assignment and normalization when some particular focus is affected by multiple factors the degree of influence of each factor is usually weighted in order to make priorities the influencing factors are either measurable or unmeasurable the measurable multi criteria are directly weighted based on well defined units and hence the process of decision making for priorities is objective and consistent in the case of unmeasurable multi criteria priority is often made by verbal judgments and hence lacks objectivity and consistency to keep the objectivity and consistency of the subjective judgments decision making techniques are needed the analytic hierarchy process ahp introduced by saaty 1977 is among the multi criteria decision making techniques this technique is preferable due to its capability in translating the qualitative judgments in to quantitative measures so that objectivity and consistency are maintained varis 1989 siraj et al 2015 the decision making process in the ahp is based on the pair wise comparison in which only two criteria are compared at a time siraj et al 2015 suppose one common focus groundwater potentiality in this case is influenced by n number of criteria c 1 c 2 c n in this case geomorphology lithology soil etc with assigned weights of w 1 w 2 w n respectively then n n pair wise comparison matrix which satisfies a a ij w i w j is generated in eq 1 as follows 1 a c 1 c 2 c n c 1 c 2 c n w 1 w 1 w 1 w 2 w 1 w n w 2 w 1 w 2 w 2 w 2 w n w n w 1 w n w 2 w n w n c 1 c 2 c n c 1 c 2 c n a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 a nn this matrix holds the following properties 1 it is a square matrix implying that the number of comparison elements in the row matrix equals the number of elements in the column matrix 2 it is an inverse matrix implying that a a 1 1 where a a ij and a 1 1 a ji and 3 its diagonal elements are unity a 11 a 22 a nn 1 confirming that when one criteria is compared against itself it contributes the same influence on the common focus two important aspects are considered in the pair wise comparison 1 which criteria is more important than the other and 2 how strongly one criterion influences over the other taking this into account saaty 1980 proposed verbal judgment scales ranging from 1 to 9 table 2 shows saaty s 1 9 judgment scales and their verbal explanation in this study ten pair wise comparison matrices were developed one for thematic layer prioritizing and nine for their individual classes prioritization was undertaken after constructing the comparison matrix and assigning judgment scales to all thematic layers and their individual classes in order to determine the priority vectors normalized weights in this case the most used prioritization approaches are eigen vector ev saaty 1977 and geometric mean gm crawford 1987 the eigen value ev approach was chosen for this study this method unlike the others is based on matrix based algorithms rather than optimization siraj et al 2015 there are numerous processing tools software available to aid in the prioritization process expert choice forman et al 1983 hipre hämäläinen and raimo 1995 priority estimation tool priest siraj et al 2015 and ahp excel template goepel 2018 are the most often used the ahp excel template was chosen for this work this tool is effective in visualizing inconsistencies observed in pair wise comparisons one of the manifestations of verbal judgments is inconsistency among the causes of inconsistency include psychological factors frequent errors made by decision makers and poor hierarchical organization of structures sugden 1985 saaty 1980 proposed the consistency ratio cr as one of the consistency measures on which judgments are accepted or rejected it is represented in eq 2 as follows 2 cr ci ri in this case ri is a random index given for the number of factors included in the comparison table 3 and ci is the consistency index obtained from eq 3 3 ci λ max n n 1 where λ max is the eigen value of the comparison matrix and n represents the number of influencing factors considered in the pair wise comparison for cr 0 1 all judgments in a paired wise comparison are accepted saaty 1980 2 5 generation of groundwater potential map after preparing a data base of all weighted thematic layers and their classes a groundwater potential map was developed by superimposing all the thematic layers using the linear combination method lcm in arcgis to do this each layer was resampled to a common 20 m x 20 m grid and projected with the wgs 1984 datum and utm zone 37 north coordinate system the superimposed map was then classified into distinct groundwater potential zones based on the groundwater potential index gwpi calculated from eq 4 malczewski 1999 4 gwpi j 1 m i 1 n n wj n wi where n wj is the normalized weight of the jth thematic layer n wi the normalized weight of the ith class of thematic layers m the total number of thematic layers and n the total number of classes in each thematic layer 2 6 validation of results this work focuses on remotely sensed data and gis based analytical hierarchical process to delineate groundwater potential zones the output obtained through this method only provides a qualitative description of the possibility in order to ensure the applicability of the method it is necessary to carry out quantitative validation using actual data taking this into account the output of the applied method was cross validated against the groundwater yield of boreholes distributed in the study area two validation approaches were employed overlay analysis and correlation analysis the overlay analysis was performed by superimposing borehole yield over the groundwater potential map whereas the correlation analysis was performed based on the degree of association between groundwater yield data and groundwater potential index gwpi values 3 results and discussion 3 1 priority ranking and normalized weights of thematic layers this study took into consideration nine factors that govern the occurrence of groundwater including lithology geomorphology lineament density drainage density slope elevation soil land use land cover and rainfall these factors have been widely used in groundwater potential mapping at various times and locations mukherjee et al 2012 manap et al 2013a 2013b thapa et al 2017 berhanu and hatiye 2020 saranya and saravanan 2020 however there is no general agreement on the priority ranking of each layer personal experience and local knowledge are frequently considered for example berhanu and hatiye 2020 assigned the highest weight to lithology and the lowest to elevation saranya and saravanan 2020 assigned the highest weight to geomorphology and the lowest to elevation and manap et al 2013a 2013b assigned the highest weight to lineament density and the lowest to land use cover in the current study the degree of variability of each layer across the drainage basin was used to determine priority ranking in comparison to the other thematic layers lithology shows the highest variation across the drainage basin resulting in a high spatial variation of groundwater potential with respect to lithology as a result the highest judgment scale has been assigned to lithology land use cover on the other hand shows less spatial variation agriculture dominates more than 50 of the area implying less spatial variability of groundwater with respect to land use cover therefore lowest judgment scale was given for the land use cover layer table 4 shows the pair wise comparison and normalized weight for each of the thematic layers 3 2 impact of thematic layers on the groundwater potential 3 2 1 lithology and groundwater potential the occurrence of groundwater is primarily determined by the permeability and porosity of various rock types deepa et al 2016 singh et al 2019 and is thus included in the current study in the study area seven lithological types were identified basement rocks 24 mixture of sand stone shale tillite 3 permian sand stone 5 jurassic sand stone 9 mixture of lime stone shale marl 48 cretaceous sand stone 2 and volcanic rocks 9 fig 3 hydraulic characteristics of each of the rock types such as conductivity gebreyohannes et al 2017 average yield ministry of water resources 1998 and discharge rate hagos et al 2015 were taken into consideration to rank their relative importance on the groundwater potentiality based on this jurassic sandstones were given the highest judgment score followed in order by cretaceous sand stone permian sand stone mixture of limestone shale marl volcanic rocks mixture of sandstone shale tillite and basement rocks table 5 3 2 2 geomorphology and groundwater potential different geomorphic parameters such as surface runoff infiltration rate drainage pattern overland flow and flow path are influenced by geomorphology ali and singh 2002 in the study area six types of landforms have been specified flat plains 1 smooth plains 5 hills 34 breaks 26 low mountains 32 and high mountains and deep canyons 2 fig 4 flat planes are allotted the highest weight in terms of groundwater suitability followed by smooth plains then hills breaks low mountains and finally high mountains and canyons berhanu and hatiye 2020 fenta et al 2015 table 6 presents the pair wise comparison matrix and normalized weight of the individual classes 3 2 3 land use cover and groundwater potential land use and land cover have a large impact on hydrologic processes such as evapotranspiration groundwater recharge and surface runoff the main classes stratified in the geba river basin are bare land 21 settlement area 1 sparse vegetation 23 dense vegetation 2 agricultural land 53 and water body 0 013 fig 7 the underlined classes influence the condition of groundwater in various ways for example vegetation has both negative and positive effects muralitharan and palanivel 2015 on the one hand it facilitates evapotranspiration thereby reducing the likelihood of groundwater condition on the other hand it reduces surface runoff which enhances the possibility of groundwater condition surface runoff is high in bare lands resulting in a low infiltration capability surfaces in settlement areas are less permeable which reduces infiltration by increasing surface runoff due to the soil s voids infiltration is more pronounced in agricultural areas etikala et al 2019 taking the aforementioned facts into account water bodies were given highest weight followed by agricultural areas dense vegetation areas sparse vegetation areas settlements and bare land areas nasir et al 2018 table 7 displays the pair wise comparison matrix and normalized weights for each class 3 2 4 soil and groundwater potential the source of water for infiltration rainfall interacts first with the soils found in the earth s top layer water infiltration to the ground is thus determined by the permeability and water holding capacity of these soil types kumar et al 2016 according to the food and agriculture organization fao six dominant soil types have been identified in the study area including orthic acrisols 7 dystric cambisols 11 eutric cambisols 8 humic cambisols 15 eutric nitosols 46 and cambic arenosols 13 fig 6 the relative percentages of sand silt and clay in each soil type were estimated by averaging their topsoil and subsoil fractions to compare their relative importance to groundwater potentiality based on these estimates the textural classes of each soil type were interpreted against to the soil textural classification system used by the united states department of agriculture united states department of agriculture 1987 the fao soil types and their corresponding usda textural classes are given in table 8 it is evident that as soil texture becomes coarser permeability increases and as soil texture becomes finer permeability decreases saunders 2001 consequently the highest judgment scale was allocated to cambic arenosols followed in a decreasing order by humic cambisols eutric cambisols eutric nitosols dystric cambisols and orthic acrisols table 9 displays the pair wise comparison and normalized weights of each of the soil classes 3 2 5 rainfall and groundwater potential rainfall determines the amount of water available to infiltrate into the groundwater system agarwal et al 2013 particularly in monsoon climatic regions sophocleous 2005 understanding its nature and characteristics thus aids in predicting its potential impact on the groundwater system the interpolated rainfall map using the inverse distance weight idw was classified into six mean annual rainfall ranges 455 538 mm 5 539 620 mm 56 621 702 mm 23 703 785 mm 12 786 867 mm 3 and 868 950 mm 1 fig 7 water infiltration is much more likely in areas where rainfall intensity is high wang et al 2020 taking this into account the highest preference scale was assigned to areas with high annual rainfall and the lowest to areas with low annual rainfall the pair wise matrix comparison and normalized weights of the rainfall classes are shown in table 10 3 2 6 lineament density and groundwater potential lineaments are linear features that are commonly observed on the earth s surface faults fractures elongated and linear geologic structures linear topographic formations and stream straight paths are examples of these pradhan 2009 in terrains with impermeable rocks lineaments increase secondary porosity and permeability thereby facilitating water percolation into the groundwater system al saud 2010 because they are linear features their length density which is the ratio of the total length of the lineaments to the total area greenbaum 1985 is commonly incorporated in groundwater studies using the equal interval classification method the extracted lineament density was classified into five categories fig 8 these are 0 0 3 km km2 26 0 4 0 7 km km2 31 0 8 1 0 km km2 32 1 1 1 3 km km2 8 and 1 4 1 7 km km2 3 high lineament density is known to increase secondary porosity and facilitate the occurrence of groundwater thus highest weight is given to the highest lineament density while lowest weight is given to the lowest lineament density table 11 displays the pairwise comparison and normalized weights for each lineament class 3 2 7 drainage density and groundwater potential drainage density as defined by the total length of drainage networks per unit area horton 1932 has a major impact on groundwater occurrence based on the gis based natural break classification the resulting drainage density was classified into five categories 3 3 8 7 km km2 7 8 8 11 7 km km2 10 11 8 14 1 km km2 29 14 2 15 8 km km2 37 and 15 9 19 3 km km2 17 fig 9 it is known that drainage density and permeability are negatively correlated jaiswal et al 2003 meaning that denser drainage networks are more likely to lead to surface runoff which reduces the likelihood of groundwater recharge therefore in this study smallest weight was assigned to the largest drainage density and the highest value was given to the lowest drainage density table 12 3 2 8 slope and groundwater potential a surface s steepness or gentleness is expressed by its slope its inclusion in groundwater mapping is critical because it directly controls surface runoff and percolation of water from rainfall subba et al 2006 following the classification of slope on the soil and terrain model soter model of the european commission european commission 2012 table 13 the generated slope percent was classified into six categories flat 3 gently undulating 14 undulating 15 rolling 25 moderately steep 24 and steep 19 fig 10 this classification system was also adopted by elewa and qaddah 2011 in mapping groundwater potentiality in sinai peninsula egypt in areas with steep slopes the force of gravity increases the downward flow of water resulting in insufficient time for infiltration in contrast flowing water on flat surfaces has a high retention period for infiltration and is therefore favorable to the occurrence of groundwater thapa et al 2017 hence in terms of groundwater suitability flat surfaces were given highest weight and steep slopes the lowest al saud 2010 table 14 presents the pair wise comparison matrix and normalized weights for each of the slope classes 3 2 9 elevation and groundwater potential topographic elevation can have a variety of effects on the groundwater system groundwater recharge is predicted to be high in the highlands under normal conditions due to abundant rainfall however the base flow into the lowlands aided by gravity reduces the storability of the recharged water therefore water is held considerably better in lowlands than in highlands mahalingam et al 2015 according to the dem analysis of the study area the elevation ranges from 929 m at the outlet to 3301 m at the source using an automated gis equal interval classification system it was classified into six categories 929 1324 m 1 1325 1720 m 13 1721 2115 m 30 2116 2510 m 42 2511 2906 m 13 and 2907 3301 m 1 fig 11 because a decrease in topographic elevation increases groundwater storability berhanu and hatiye 2020 the highest weight was allocated to the lowest elevation and the lowest weight to the highest elevation table 15 shows a pair wise comparison of each elevation classes the percentage wise distribution and areal coverage of the classes in each thematic layer is summarized in table 16 3 3 delineation of the groundwater potential zones after all thematic layers and their classes were assigned normalized weights the groundwater potential map fig 12 was developed using the gis based linear combination procedure the groundwater potential index gwpi which represents the overall score of the weights and serves as a basis for delineating groundwater potential zones is determined using eq 5 5 gwpi 0 29 lt wi 0 21 ge wi 0 15 sl wi 0 11 ld wi 0 08 dd wi 0 06 rf w i 0 04 el wi 0 03 so wi 0 02 lu wi where lt wi ge wi sl wi ld wi dd wi rf wi el wi so wi and lu wi are the normalized weights of individual classes of lithology geomorphology slope lineament density drainage density rainfall elevation soil and use cover the estimation results indicate that the minimum value of the gwpi is 0 013 and the maximum value is 0 278 the distribution s mean and standard deviation are 0 014 and 0 038 respectively the normality of the data distribution was tested by plotting the gwpi values against their frequency on a histogram the curve connecting the cell values in the display was found to be skewed to the left indicating that gwpi values are not distributed evenly across the drainage basin this fact led to the use of jenks 1967 natural break classification system to delineate the entire drainage basin into five groundwater potential zones mallick et al 2015b these include very poor gwpi 0 013 0 070 poor gwpi 0 071 0 100 moderate gwpi 0 101 0 135 good gwpi 0 136 0 177 and very good gwpi 0 178 0 278 table 17 the very good gwpzs in the south west and north of the drainage basin cover 301 km2 6 of the total area are attributed to jurassic sandstones cambic arenosols hill land forms and flat slopes good gwpzs mainly in the central south west and northern portions of the drainage basin cover 529 km2 10 of the total area this zone is constituted by low drainage density jurassic sandstones high lineament densities low mountain land form and moderately steep slopes moderate gwpzs which encompass 27 1394 km2 of the total area and located in most portions of the drainage basin are underlined by cretaceous sandstones eutric nitosols low mountains and agricultural land classes the poor gwpzs mainly concentrated at the central portion of the drainage basin constitute 45 2288 km2 of the total area are characterized by lime stone shale marl eutric nitosols moderately steep slopes and bare land classes the very poor gwpzs situated in the west and north east of the drainage basin cover 612 km2 12 of the total area and are dominated by volcanic and basement rocks eutric nitosols high drainage density low land forms and moderately steep slopes the layer wise distribution of the gwpzs agrees with the findings of earlier investigations manap et al 2013a 2013b determined high groundwater potential zones with flat slope low drainage density and high lineament density rahmati et al 2015 on the other hand identified low groundwater potential zones in areas with steep terrain high drainage density and impermeable lithology furthermore pande et al 2018 reported that locations with unconsolidated sediments such as gravel sand silt and clay possess high groundwater potential zones 3 4 validation results validation is an essential component of modeling without it conclusions aren t of any scientific significance pourghasemi and beheshtirad 2015 inadequate understanding of the validation techniques and considerations can limit the utility of remotely sensed data congalton 1991 in this study 71 boreholes distributed across the drainage basin were utilized for validation twelve of the total boreholes are situated in very poor gwpzs fourteen in poor gwpzs sixteen in moderate gwpzs eighteen in good gwpzs and eleven in very good gwpzs prior to the validation analysis the borehole yields were classified into five categories there is no standardized classification scheme for borehole yields site specific conditions field knowledge and hydrologists suggestions are often taken in to account das et al 2019 in this study borehole data were classified based on the information obtained from the tigray region water bureau ethiopian ministry of water resources mwr 1998 and the hydrogeological map of ethiopia gse 1988 based on this the boreholes with yields of 2 l s 3 6 l s 7 10 l s 11 15 l s and 15 l s were designated as very poor poor moderate good and very good respectively a series of step by step processes were used in the overlay analysis firstly the validation points boreholes were prepared in excel format along with their classified yields and location coordinates the excel data was then imported into the arc gis platform and projected to wgs 1984 utm zone 37 n a common coordinate system with the gis derived groundwater potential map the projected location points were then converted to shapefile point data and superimposed on the generated groundwater potential map fig 12 to predict the possibility of overlap raster values from the delineated groundwater potential map were extracted to the classified borehole yields using the extract values to points menu in the spatial analyst extension tool of arcgis using the frequency menu in arcgis s analysis tool extension tool a frequency table displaying the number of predictions that matched with the validation points was generated finally the information displayed in the frequency table was converted to an error matrix format using the pivot table menu of the data management tools of the arc gis extension tool an error matrix is a matrix based accuracy assessment that is used to evaluate the accuracy of information derived from remotely sensed data story and congalton 1986 it is mainly composed of a square array of values arranged in rows and columns with the columns representing filed data and the rows representing information obtained from remotely sensed data there are two recognized accuracy assessments according to congalton 1991 exclusion accuracy assessment and inclusion accuracy assessment the exclusion accuracy assessment indicates the probability that the ground data for validation is correctly classified in the defined area the inclusion accuracy assessment on the other hand reveals the likelihood that the information extracted from remotely sensed data accurately represents the reality on the ground story and congalton 1986 the goal of this study is to validate the likelihood that the delineated groundwater potential represents the actual borehole yield hence the inclusion accuracy assessment was used al saud 2010 has utilized a similar approach in an efferent to map possible locations for groundwater storage in the wadi aurnah basin western arabian peninsula the error matrix used for validation analysis is displayed in table 18 the matrix s row elements represent the delineated groundwater potential zones the matrix s column elements represent the classified borehole yields and the matrix s major diagonal represents the number of coincided classified values of boreholes over each of the delineated groundwater potential zones the percentage coincidence of individual borehole yield classes in each of the corresponding groundwater potential zones was computed by dividing the number of coincident boreholes yields over each groundwater potential zone by the total number of rows and multiplying the result by 100 accordingly 7 of 12 58 boreholes correctly coincided over the very poor gwpz 9 of 14 64 boreholes correctly coincided over the poor gwpz 12 of 16 75 boreholes correctly coincided over the moderate gwpz 14 of 18 77 boreholes correctly coincided over the good gwpz and 9 of 11 81 boreholes correctly coincided over the very good gwpz the overall accuracy of coincidence was calculated by dividing the sum of the error matrix s major diagonal elements 7 9 12 14 9 51 by the total number of boreholes 71 and multiplying by 100 as shown in eq 6 6 overall percentage of coincidence sum of diagonal elements total number of samples 100 51 71 100 72 therefore there is a similarity of approximately 72 between the delineated groundwater potential zones using the employed approach and the actual ground data this result is consistent to the findings of previous similar studies conducted in various semi arid regions for instance abdulkerim et al 2022 reported 72 agreement between actual data and gis derived groundwater recharge potential zones in sude district southern ethiopia similarly das et al 2019 approved 71 43 similarity in predicting groundwater potential zones in the puruliya district of west bengal india the current study s result however is much less accurate when compared to other study results such as the study report of berhanu and hatiye 2020 in the megesh watershed ethiopia in which 78 5 agreement was found between existing groundwater inventory data and identified groundwater potential zones and the study report of tolche 2021 in the dhungeta ramis sub basin ethiopia in which 89 coincidence was estimated between the output of the applied method and ground points the discrepancy in the results could be attributable to the number of validation points collected increasing the number of validation points may increase the degree of coincidence between the actual data and the classified groundwater potential zones in addition to the overlay analysis correlation analysis was carried out by plotting the gwpi range values against the average borehole yield in each of the gwpzs fig 13 table 19 shows the average yield of boreholes in each gwpi range the plot s linear regression coefficient r2 0 9042 indicates that the predicted and observed results are strongly correlated asuero et al 2006 4 conclusion the field based techniques that have been used for years to study groundwater are reliable and efficient for small scale studies however these methods aren t feasible to use on a large scale and are not able to reach remote and inaccessible locations such uncertainties have been solved with the advent of geospatial technologies such as remote sensing and gis the potential effectiveness of these methods has been confirmed in many parts of the world but they have yet to be tested in areas where infrastructure for these technologies is limited the purpose of the present study was to delineate the groundwater potential zones of the geba drainage basin in northern ethiopia where water stress and food insecurity are prevalent this was accomplished using weighted linear combination wlc of various groundwater indicators such as lithology geomorphology lineament density drainage density slope elevation rainfall soil and land use cover remote sensing technology was used as a data source analytic hierarchy process ahp was used to normalize the judgment scales and gis was used as a platform to generate the groundwater potential map five distinct groundwater potential zones were identified in the study area these are very good good moderate poor and very poor each covering an area of 301 km2 529 km2 1394 km2 2288 km2 and 625 km2 respectively the combined effects of jurassic sand stones loamy sand soils flat slopes low drainage densities and high lineament densities are concluded to be promising for the development of good and very good groundwater potential zones the presence of basement rocks sandy clay loam soils steep slopes bare land classes and high drainage densities on the other hand are accountable for the poor and very poor groundwater potential zones the groundwater potential map generated using the current methodology was validated using the borehole yield data and the results showed a 72 similarity which is an acceptable level of reliability the adoption and implementation of remote sensing and gis based analytical hierarch is therefore found to be the alternative option for groundwater potential mapping of the geba drainage basin the outcome of these techniques are qualitative judgments that only determine the likelihood of groundwater occurrence and its spatial distribution it can however provide preliminary information for site specific investigations and site selection thereby saving time and money the developed groundwater potential map is therefore recommended for use by water public bodies planners and decision makers as a preliminary reference for groundwater resource management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

7738,study region the study was undertaken in the geba drainage basin major tributary of the tekeze drainage basin in northern ethiopia study focus the objective of this study is to identify the groundwater potential zones of northern ethiopia s geba drainage basin nine groundwater indicators were used as inputs including lithology geomorphology lineament density drainage density slope elevation land use and land cover rainfall and soil according to their relative influence on groundwater potentiality the thematic layers and their classes were assigned appropriate weights based on saaty s 1 9 judgment scale the assigned weights were then normalized using an eigen vector based analytical hierarchy process by superimposing all the normalized layers in the gis environment a groundwater potential map was developed new hydrological insights for the region five distinct groundwater potential zones very good good moderate poor and very poor were found in the study area the areal distribution showed that majority of the area 45 fell within the poor groundwater potential zone the groundwater potential zones of moderate very poor good and very good cover approximately 27 12 10 and 6 of the total area respectively the results were compared to the groundwater yield of boreholes collected from the study area the validation analysis revealed a 72 similarity which is representative the employed method is therefore a reasonable option for groundwater development in the geba drainage basin graphical abstract ga1 keywords remote sensing gis analytical hierarchy

surface particularly beneath the water table mallick et al 2015b the pores in rocks sediments and soils are ideal for retaining water in its saturated state heath 1998 kidanewold et al 2014 according to studies the total amount of water contained in the earth s hydrosphere is around 1386 million km3 shiklomanov 1998 out of this total 1351 million km3 97 5 is concentrated in the oceans as salt water while the remaining 35 million km3 2 5 is fresh water contributed by the land mass gleick 1993 about three fourths of total fresh water comes from glaciers and ice caps with the remaining one

remaining 10 for industry hiscock and bense 2014 the rapid growth of the world s population along with increasing irrigation and other agricultural practices has resulted in a threefold increase in groundwater obstruction over the past forty years world bank 2007 this issue is most apparent in the world s arid and semi arid regions where the trend of total groundwater depletion has more than doubled in the last forty years wada et al 2010 ethiopia possesses 12 large drainage basins with a total annual water potential of 125 60 billion m3 of which 123 billion m3 98 comes from the surface

2013 several field based experiments such as geophysical hydrogeological and geological approaches have been used in groundwater investigations over the years mcneill 1988 these methods are more reliable and standardized however they require huge expenditure and are not feasible to apply on a wide scale mukherjee et al 2012 singh et al 2019 these limitations have been overcome as remote sensing and gis technologies have advanced remote sensing technology is spatially extensive multi temporal cost effective and covers inaccessible and data scarce regions ekneligoda and henkel 2010 machiwal et al 2011 tweed et al 2007 whereas gis technology can classify and manage remotely sensed data jagannathan 1996 the integrated use of rs and gis in groundwater assessment is based on an analysis of the several factors that affect groundwater occurrence however these factors do not have the same level of influence on groundwater potentiality as a result understanding weighting

livestock densities greatly amplify soil erosion and land degradation vanmaercke et al 2008 this makes the area the most water stressed and food in secure gebreyohannes et al 2017 in the study area there is limited information to provide as a basis for the selection of groundwater supply sites such as boreholes as a result both the governmental and private sectors have been relied on traditional experiences existing water point sites to select groundwater supply sites identifying groundwater potential zones in relation to groundwater indicators such as elevation slope drainage density geomorphology lithology soil lineament density land use and land cover and rainfall is a viable option for tackling the existing problem in this context hence the current work is an attempt to delineate the geba drainage basin s groundwater potential zones using remotely sensed data and a gis based analytical hierarchy process the following three main objectives have been addressed for this purpose i to identify and extract groundwater governing thematic layers from various sources including remote sensing imagery and existing sources ii to identify potential groundwater resource areas using a gis based weighted linear combination of different thematic layers and iii to validate the potential capability of remotely sensed data coupled with a gis based analytical hierarch process in predicting groundwater potential zones the output of the study can be used as preliminary information by planners and decision makers in the planning and management of groundwater resources in the study area it specifically provides first hand knowledge for a variety of practical reasons including selecting groundwater extraction locations prior to undertaking geophysical and hydrogeological investigations 2 method and materials 2 1 description of the study area the study was undertaken on the geba river basin in northern ethiopia it is the main tributary of the tekeze river basin which is situated in the upper part of the nile river basin it lies at a latitude of 12 55 00 to 14 10 00 north and a longitude of 38 45 00 to 39 35 00 east on the geographic grid system fig 1 it originates at an elevation of 3300 m mugulat mountain and runs 240 kilometers south west till it reaches the mouth tekeze main stream at an elevation of 926 m above mean sea level the basin covers a total drainage area of 5137 km2 majority of which is accumulated at elevations ranging from 2300 to 2500 m the drainage basin is in a mountainous area with a tropical climate only three months mid june to mid september are considered as rainy seasons while the rest of the months have prolonged dry weather based on data from meteorological stations inside and near the drainage basin for the past 13 years 2006 2018 the annual rainfall ranges from 450 mm to 950 mm with a mean of 624 mm the average temperature varies from 7 to 32 degrees celsius the drainage basin s geological layers include mesozoic sediments pre cambrian rocks tertiary volcanic rocks and palaeozoic sediments gebreyohannes et al 2013 the soil types stratified in the drainage basin are orthic acrisols dystric cambisols eutric cambisols humic cambisols eutric nitosols and cambic arenosols the major land cover use classes detected by satellite image analysis for the year 2018 comprise agricultural land bare land brush land forests settlements and water bodies according to hydrogeological studies major aquifers are not prevalent in the area and aquitards are used for water extraction instead tesfamichael 2009 2 2 data and data sources there are many factors that influence the occurrence distribution and storage of groundwater however in the current study only nine thematic layers including lithology geomorphology drainage density lineament density slope soil land use and cover rainfall and elevation were taken into consideration extensive literature review the availability of datasets and field observation are the determinant factors to select the specified layers some of those layers were derived from existing sources while others from remote sensing imagery the drainage density geomorphology slope and elevation layers were extracted from 30 m srtm dem currently accessible at http earthexplorer usgs gov the lineament density and land use land cover layers were generated using landsat 8 oli data obtained from http earthexplorer usgs gov the lithological layer was digitized from the geological map of ethiopia scale1 2 000 000 developed by the geological survey of ethiopia egs 1972 due to inadequate local data the soil layer was downloaded from 1 5 000 000 scale digital soil map of the world developed by the food and agricultural organization fao currently available at https data apps fao org to develop the rainfall layer long term annual rainfall data for the period 2006 2018 was collected from the ethiopian meteorological agency ema in addition to the thematic layers other sources of data were also used for various purposes topographic map scale 1 50 000 used to update the raw srtm dem was collected from the ethiopian mapping agency ema groundwater yield data of boreholes constructed by governmental and none governmental organizations were collected and utilized to validate the results of the employed method the data sources and their details are presented in table 1 2 3 preparation of thematic layers input data bases the lithology and soil layers were retrieved from the ethiopian geological map and the fao world digital soil map respectively the elevation and slope percent layers were generated from the srtm dem directly some procedural works were undertaken in order to prepare the other thematic layers the geomorphology layer was produced from dem using sayre s et al 2014 land form classification system according to this classification system land forms with 1 15 m relief and less than 8 slope are considered flat plains land forms with 15 30 m relief and less than 8 slope are categorized as smooth plains and land forms with a common slope 8 but varying in relief as 30 90 m 90 150 m 150 400 m and 400 m are defined as hills breaks low mountains and high mountains respectively the land use cover layer of the study area was extracted from landsat 8 oli dataset path 69 row 50 path 69 row 51 and path 68 row 50 of the year 2018 using erdas imagine software bands 3 4 and 5 of landsat 8 oli which represent the green red and near infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum were combined to create false colour composite fcc an effective combination for detecting land cover gupta and srivastava 2010 using this composite image supervised classification with a maximum likelihood algorithm was used to identify each class ghorbani nejad et al 2017 kaliraj et al 2015 this was enhanced by selecting training samples for each class and verifying with google earth image band 8 of the landsat 8 oli tirs imagery was utilized to determine lineament density layer in contrast to the other bands associated with landsat 8 oli band 8 has a high spatial resolution 15 m that allows for easy detection of lineaments the detected lineaments in the specified band were automatically extracted using geomatica software s line processing tool numerous studies confirm the performance of this tool in lineament extraction berhanu and hatiye 2020 ibrahim and mutua 2014 tolche 2021 recharging the groundwater system is the result of rainfall s long term influence berhanu and hatiye 2020 thus in the present study the rainfall layer was developed from 13 years of annual rainfall from 9 meteorological stations within and close to the drainage basin fig 1 to estimate the distribution of rainfall across the entire area the mean annual rainfall recorded at each meteorological station was spatially interpolated using the inverse distance weight idw algorithm in the arcgis spatial analyst tool abijith et al 2020 drainage density was derived from dem to improve accuracy the raw dem was first reconditioned with natural streams digitized from a topographic map in arcgis s arc hydro tool fenta et al 2017 to extract the drainage network an initiation value threshold value of 10 pixels was assigned it s worth noted that the drainage density obtained may differ depending on the threshold value chen et al 2018 reported that for dem data with the same spatial resolution drainage density reduces as the threshold value increases the detailed methodology employed in this study is displayed in fig 2 2 4 weight assignment and normalization when some particular focus is affected by multiple factors the degree of influence of each factor is usually weighted in order to make priorities the influencing factors are either measurable or unmeasurable the measurable multi criteria are directly weighted based on well defined units and hence the process of decision making for priorities is objective and consistent in the case of unmeasurable multi criteria priority is often made by verbal judgments and hence lacks objectivity and consistency to keep the objectivity and consistency of the subjective judgments decision making techniques are needed the analytic hierarchy process ahp introduced by saaty 1977 is among the multi criteria decision making techniques this technique is preferable due to its capability in translating the qualitative judgments in to quantitative measures so that objectivity and consistency are maintained varis 1989 siraj et al 2015 the decision making process in the ahp is based on the pair wise comparison in which only two criteria are compared at a time siraj et al 2015 suppose one common focus groundwater potentiality in this case is influenced by n number of criteria c 1 c 2 c n in this case geomorphology lithology soil etc with assigned weights of w 1 w 2 w n respectively then n n pair wise comparison matrix which satisfies a a ij w i w j is generated in eq 1 as follows 1 a c 1 c 2 c n c 1 c 2 c n w 1 w 1 w 1 w 2 w 1 w n w 2 w 1 w 2 w 2 w 2 w n w n w 1 w n w 2 w n w n c 1 c 2 c n c 1 c 2 c n a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 a nn this matrix holds the following properties 1 it is a square matrix implying that the number of comparison elements in the row matrix equals the number of elements in the column matrix 2 it is an inverse matrix implying that a a 1 1 where a a ij and a 1 1 a ji and 3 its diagonal elements are unity a 11 a 22 a nn 1 confirming that when one criteria is compared against itself it contributes the same influence on the common focus two important aspects are considered in the pair wise comparison 1 which criteria is more important than the other and 2 how strongly one criterion influences over the other taking this into account saaty 1980 proposed verbal judgment scales ranging from 1 to 9 table 2 shows saaty s 1 9 judgment scales and their verbal explanation in this study ten pair wise comparison matrices were developed one for thematic layer prioritizing and nine for their individual classes prioritization was undertaken after constructing the comparison matrix and assigning judgment scales to all thematic layers and their individual classes in order to determine the priority vectors normalized weights in this case the most used prioritization approaches are eigen vector ev saaty 1977 and geometric mean gm crawford 1987 the eigen value ev approach was chosen for this study this method unlike the others is based on matrix based algorithms rather than optimization siraj et al 2015 there are numerous processing tools software available to aid in the prioritization process expert choice forman et al 1983 hipre hämäläinen and raimo 1995 priority estimation tool priest siraj et al 2015 and ahp excel template goepel 2018 are the most often used the ahp excel template was chosen for this work this tool is effective in visualizing inconsistencies observed in pair wise comparisons one of the manifestations of verbal judgments is inconsistency among the causes of inconsistency include psychological factors frequent errors made by decision makers and poor hierarchical organization of structures sugden 1985 saaty 1980 proposed the consistency ratio cr as one of the consistency measures on which judgments are accepted or rejected it is represented in eq 2 as follows 2 cr ci ri in this case ri is a random index given for the number of factors included in the comparison table 3 and ci is the consistency index obtained from eq 3 3 ci λ max n n 1 where λ max is the eigen value of the comparison matrix and n represents the number of influencing factors considered in the pair wise comparison for cr 0 1 all judgments in a paired wise comparison are accepted saaty 1980 2 5 generation of groundwater potential map after preparing a data base of all weighted thematic layers and their classes a groundwater potential map was developed by superimposing all the thematic layers using the linear combination method lcm in arcgis to do this each layer was resampled to a common 20 m x 20 m grid and projected with the wgs 1984 datum and utm zone 37 north coordinate system the superimposed map was then classified into distinct groundwater potential zones based on the groundwater potential index gwpi calculated from eq 4 malczewski 1999 4 gwpi j 1 m i 1 n n wj n wi where n wj is the normalized weight of the jth thematic layer n wi the normalized weight of the ith class of thematic layers m the total number of thematic layers and n the total number of classes in each thematic layer 2 6 validation of results this work focuses on remotely sensed data and gis based analytical hierarchical process to delineate groundwater potential zones the output obtained through this method only provides a qualitative description of the possibility in order to ensure the applicability of the method it is necessary to carry out quantitative validation using actual data taking this into account the output of the applied method was cross validated against the groundwater yield of boreholes distributed in the study area two validation approaches were employed overlay analysis and correlation analysis the overlay analysis was performed by superimposing borehole yield over the groundwater potential map whereas the correlation analysis was performed based on the degree of association between groundwater yield data and groundwater potential index gwpi values 3 results and discussion 3 1 priority ranking and normalized weights of thematic layers this study took into consideration nine factors that govern the occurrence of groundwater including lithology geomorphology lineament density drainage density slope elevation soil land use land cover and rainfall these factors have been widely used in groundwater potential mapping at various times and locations mukherjee et al 2012 manap et al 2013a 2013b thapa et al 2017 berhanu and hatiye 2020 saranya and saravanan 2020 however there is no general agreement on the priority ranking of each layer personal experience and local knowledge are frequently considered for example berhanu and hatiye 2020 assigned the highest weight to lithology and the lowest to elevation saranya and saravanan 2020 assigned the highest weight to geomorphology and the lowest to elevation and manap et al 2013a 2013b assigned the highest weight to lineament density and the lowest to land use cover in the current study the degree of variability of each layer across the drainage basin was used to determine priority ranking in comparison to the other thematic layers lithology shows the highest variation across the drainage basin resulting in a high spatial variation of groundwater potential with respect to lithology as a result the highest judgment scale has been assigned to lithology land use cover on the other hand shows less spatial variation agriculture dominates more than 50 of the area implying less spatial variability of groundwater with respect to land use cover therefore lowest judgment scale was given for the land use cover layer table 4 shows the pair wise comparison and normalized weight for each of the thematic layers 3 2 impact of thematic layers on the groundwater potential 3 2 1 lithology and groundwater potential the occurrence of groundwater is primarily determined by the permeability and porosity of various rock types deepa et al 2016 singh et al 2019 and is thus included in the current study in the study area seven lithological types were identified basement rocks 24 mixture of sand stone shale tillite 3 permian sand stone 5 jurassic sand stone 9 mixture of lime stone shale marl 48 cretaceous sand stone 2 and volcanic rocks 9 fig 3 hydraulic characteristics of each of the rock types such as conductivity gebreyohannes et al 2017 average yield ministry of water resources 1998 and discharge rate hagos et al 2015 were taken into consideration to rank their relative importance on the groundwater potentiality based on this jurassic sandstones were given the highest judgment score followed in order by cretaceous sand stone permian sand stone mixture of limestone shale marl volcanic rocks mixture of sandstone shale tillite and basement rocks table 5 3 2 2 geomorphology and groundwater potential different geomorphic parameters such as surface runoff infiltration rate drainage pattern overland flow and flow path are influenced by geomorphology ali and singh 2002 in the study area six types of landforms have been specified flat plains 1 smooth plains 5 hills 34 breaks 26 low mountains 32 and high mountains and deep canyons 2 fig 4 flat planes are allotted the highest weight in terms of groundwater suitability followed by smooth plains then hills breaks low mountains and finally high mountains and canyons berhanu and hatiye 2020 fenta et al 2015 table 6 presents the pair wise comparison matrix and normalized weight of the individual classes 3 2 3 land use cover and groundwater potential land use and land cover have a large impact on hydrologic processes such as evapotranspiration groundwater recharge and surface runoff the main classes stratified in the geba river basin are bare land 21 settlement area 1 sparse vegetation 23 dense vegetation 2 agricultural land 53 and water body 0 013 fig 7 the underlined classes influence the condition of groundwater in various ways for example vegetation has both negative and positive effects muralitharan and palanivel 2015 on the one hand it facilitates evapotranspiration thereby reducing the likelihood of groundwater condition on the other hand it reduces surface runoff which enhances the possibility of groundwater condition surface runoff is high in bare lands resulting in a low infiltration capability surfaces in settlement areas are less permeable which reduces infiltration by increasing surface runoff due to the soil s voids infiltration is more pronounced in agricultural areas etikala et al 2019 taking the aforementioned facts into account water bodies were given highest weight followed by agricultural areas dense vegetation areas sparse vegetation areas settlements and bare land areas nasir et al 2018 table 7 displays the pair wise comparison matrix and normalized weights for each class 3 2 4 soil and groundwater potential the source of water for infiltration rainfall interacts first with the soils found in the earth s top layer water infiltration to the ground is thus determined by the permeability and water holding capacity of these soil types kumar et al 2016 according to the food and agriculture organization fao six dominant soil types have been identified in the study area including orthic acrisols 7 dystric cambisols 11 eutric cambisols 8 humic cambisols 15 eutric nitosols 46 and cambic arenosols 13 fig 6 the relative percentages of sand silt and clay in each soil type were estimated by averaging their topsoil and subsoil fractions to compare their relative importance to groundwater potentiality based on these estimates the textural classes of each soil type were interpreted against to the soil textural classification system used by the united states department of agriculture united states department of agriculture 1987 the fao soil types and their corresponding usda textural classes are given in table 8 it is evident that as soil texture becomes coarser permeability increases and as soil texture becomes finer permeability decreases saunders 2001 consequently the highest judgment scale was allocated to cambic arenosols followed in a decreasing order by humic cambisols eutric cambisols eutric nitosols dystric cambisols and orthic acrisols table 9 displays the pair wise comparison and normalized weights of each of the soil classes 3 2 5 rainfall and groundwater potential rainfall determines the amount of water available to infiltrate into the groundwater system agarwal et al 2013 particularly in monsoon climatic regions sophocleous 2005 understanding its nature and characteristics thus aids in predicting its potential impact on the groundwater system the interpolated rainfall map using the inverse distance weight idw was classified into six mean annual rainfall ranges 455 538 mm 5 539 620 mm 56 621 702 mm 23 703 785 mm 12 786 867 mm 3 and 868 950 mm 1 fig 7 water infiltration is much more likely in areas where rainfall intensity is high wang et al 2020 taking this into account the highest preference scale was assigned to areas with high annual rainfall and the lowest to areas with low annual rainfall the pair wise matrix comparison and normalized weights of the rainfall classes are shown in table 10 3 2 6 lineament density and groundwater potential lineaments are linear features that are commonly observed on the earth s surface faults fractures elongated and linear geologic structures linear topographic formations and stream straight paths are examples of these pradhan 2009 in terrains with impermeable rocks lineaments increase secondary porosity and permeability thereby facilitating water percolation into the groundwater system al saud 2010 because they are linear features their length density which is the ratio of the total length of the lineaments to the total area greenbaum 1985 is commonly incorporated in groundwater studies using the equal interval classification method the extracted lineament density was classified into five categories fig 8 these are 0 0 3 km km2 26 0 4 0 7 km km2 31 0 8 1 0 km km2 32 1 1 1 3 km km2 8 and 1 4 1 7 km km2 3 high lineament density is known to increase secondary porosity and facilitate the occurrence of groundwater thus highest weight is given to the highest lineament density while lowest weight is given to the lowest lineament density table 11 displays the pairwise comparison and normalized weights for each lineament class 3 2 7 drainage density and groundwater potential drainage density as defined by the total length of drainage networks per unit area horton 1932 has a major impact on groundwater occurrence based on the gis based natural break classification the resulting drainage density was classified into five categories 3 3 8 7 km km2 7 8 8 11 7 km km2 10 11 8 14 1 km km2 29 14 2 15 8 km km2 37 and 15 9 19 3 km km2 17 fig 9 it is known that drainage density and permeability are negatively correlated jaiswal et al 2003 meaning that denser drainage networks are more likely to lead to surface runoff which reduces the likelihood of groundwater recharge therefore in this study smallest weight was assigned to the largest drainage density and the highest value was given to the lowest drainage density table 12 3 2 8 slope and groundwater potential a surface s steepness or gentleness is expressed by its slope its inclusion in groundwater mapping is critical because it directly controls surface runoff and percolation of water from rainfall subba et al 2006 following the classification of slope on the soil and terrain model soter model of the european commission european commission 2012 table 13 the generated slope percent was classified into six categories flat 3 gently undulating 14 undulating 15 rolling 25 moderately steep 24 and steep 19 fig 10 this classification system was also adopted by elewa and qaddah 2011 in mapping groundwater potentiality in sinai peninsula egypt in areas with steep slopes the force of gravity increases the downward flow of water resulting in insufficient time for infiltration in contrast flowing water on flat surfaces has a high retention period for infiltration and is therefore favorable to the occurrence of groundwater thapa et al 2017 hence in terms of groundwater suitability flat surfaces were given highest weight and steep slopes the lowest al saud 2010 table 14 presents the pair wise comparison matrix and normalized weights for each of the slope classes 3 2 9 elevation and groundwater potential topographic elevation can have a variety of effects on the groundwater system groundwater recharge is predicted to be high in the highlands under normal conditions due to abundant rainfall however the base flow into the lowlands aided by gravity reduces the storability of the recharged water therefore water is held considerably better in lowlands than in highlands mahalingam et al 2015 according to the dem analysis of the study area the elevation ranges from 929 m at the outlet to 3301 m at the source using an automated gis equal interval classification system it was classified into six categories 929 1324 m 1 1325 1720 m 13 1721 2115 m 30 2116 2510 m 42 2511 2906 m 13 and 2907 3301 m 1 fig 11 because a decrease in topographic elevation increases groundwater storability berhanu and hatiye 2020 the highest weight was allocated to the lowest elevation and the lowest weight to the highest elevation table 15 shows a pair wise comparison of each elevation classes the percentage wise distribution and areal coverage of the classes in each thematic layer is summarized in table 16 3 3 delineation of the groundwater potential zones after all thematic layers and their classes were assigned normalized weights the groundwater potential map fig 12 was developed using the gis based linear combination procedure the groundwater potential index gwpi which represents the overall score of the weights and serves as a basis for delineating groundwater potential zones is determined using eq 5 5 gwpi 0 29 lt wi 0 21 ge wi 0 15 sl wi 0 11 ld wi 0 08 dd wi 0 06 rf w i 0 04 el wi 0 03 so wi 0 02 lu wi where lt wi ge wi sl wi ld wi dd wi rf wi el wi so wi and lu wi are the normalized weights of individual classes of lithology geomorphology slope lineament density drainage density rainfall elevation soil and use cover the estimation results indicate that the minimum value of the gwpi is 0 013 and the maximum value is 0 278 the distribution s mean and standard deviation are 0 014 and 0 038 respectively the normality of the data distribution was tested by plotting the gwpi values against their frequency on a histogram the curve connecting the cell values in the display was found to be skewed to the left indicating that gwpi values are not distributed evenly across the drainage basin this fact led to the use of jenks 1967 natural break classification system to delineate the entire drainage basin into five groundwater potential zones mallick et al 2015b these include very poor gwpi 0 013 0 070 poor gwpi 0 071 0 100 moderate gwpi 0 101 0 135 good gwpi 0 136 0 177 and very good gwpi 0 178 0 278 table 17 the very good gwpzs in the south west and north of the drainage basin cover 301 km2 6 of the total area are attributed to jurassic sandstones cambic arenosols hill land forms and flat slopes good gwpzs mainly in the central south west and northern portions of the drainage basin cover 529 km2 10 of the total area this zone is constituted by low drainage density jurassic sandstones high lineament densities low mountain land form and moderately steep slopes moderate gwpzs which encompass 27 1394 km2 of the total area and located in most portions of the drainage basin are underlined by cretaceous sandstones eutric nitosols low mountains and agricultural land classes the poor gwpzs mainly concentrated at the central portion of the drainage basin constitute 45 2288 km2 of the total area are characterized by lime stone shale marl eutric nitosols moderately steep slopes and bare land classes the very poor gwpzs situated in the west and north east of the drainage basin cover 612 km2 12 of the total area and are dominated by volcanic and basement rocks eutric nitosols high drainage density low land forms and moderately steep slopes the layer wise distribution of the gwpzs agrees with the findings of earlier investigations manap et al 2013a 2013b determined high groundwater potential zones with flat slope low drainage density and high lineament density rahmati et al 2015 on the other hand identified low groundwater potential zones in areas with steep terrain high drainage density and impermeable lithology furthermore pande et al 2018 reported that locations with unconsolidated sediments such as gravel sand silt and clay possess high groundwater potential zones 3 4 validation results validation is an essential component of modeling without it conclusions aren t of any scientific significance pourghasemi and beheshtirad 2015 inadequate understanding of the validation techniques and considerations can limit the utility of remotely sensed data congalton 1991 in this study 71 boreholes distributed across the drainage basin were utilized for validation twelve of the total boreholes are situated in very poor gwpzs fourteen in poor gwpzs sixteen in moderate gwpzs eighteen in good gwpzs and eleven in very good gwpzs prior to the validation analysis the borehole yields were classified into five categories there is no standardized classification scheme for borehole yields site specific conditions field knowledge and hydrologists suggestions are often taken in to account das et al 2019 in this study borehole data were classified based on the information obtained from the tigray region water bureau ethiopian ministry of water resources mwr 1998 and the hydrogeological map of ethiopia gse 1988 based on this the boreholes with yields of 2 l s 3 6 l s 7 10 l s 11 15 l s and 15 l s were designated as very poor poor moderate good and very good respectively a series of step by step processes were used in the overlay analysis firstly the validation points boreholes were prepared in excel format along with their classified yields and location coordinates the excel data was then imported into the arc gis platform and projected to wgs 1984 utm zone 37 n a common coordinate system with the gis derived groundwater potential map the projected location points were then converted to shapefile point data and superimposed on the generated groundwater potential map fig 12 to predict the possibility of overlap raster values from the delineated groundwater potential map were extracted to the classified borehole yields using the extract values to points menu in the spatial analyst extension tool of arcgis using the frequency menu in arcgis s analysis tool extension tool a frequency table displaying the number of predictions that matched with the validation points was generated finally the information displayed in the frequency table was converted to an error matrix format using the pivot table menu of the data management tools of the arc gis extension tool an error matrix is a matrix based accuracy assessment that is used to evaluate the accuracy of information derived from remotely sensed data story and congalton 1986 it is mainly composed of a square array of values arranged in rows and columns with the columns representing filed data and the rows representing information obtained from remotely sensed data there are two recognized accuracy assessments according to congalton 1991 exclusion accuracy assessment and inclusion accuracy assessment the exclusion accuracy assessment indicates the probability that the ground data for validation is correctly classified in the defined area the inclusion accuracy assessment on the other hand reveals the likelihood that the information extracted from remotely sensed data accurately represents the reality on the ground story and congalton 1986 the goal of this study is to validate the likelihood that the delineated groundwater potential represents the actual borehole yield hence the inclusion accuracy assessment was used al saud 2010 has utilized a similar approach in an efferent to map possible locations for groundwater storage in the wadi aurnah basin western arabian peninsula the error matrix used for validation analysis is displayed in table 18 the matrix s row elements represent the delineated groundwater potential zones the matrix s column elements represent the classified borehole yields and the matrix s major diagonal represents the number of coincided classified values of boreholes over each of the delineated groundwater potential zones the percentage coincidence of individual borehole yield classes in each of the corresponding groundwater potential zones was computed by dividing the number of coincident boreholes yields over each groundwater potential zone by the total number of rows and multiplying the result by 100 accordingly 7 of 12 58 boreholes correctly coincided over the very poor gwpz 9 of 14 64 boreholes correctly coincided over the poor gwpz 12 of 16 75 boreholes correctly coincided over the moderate gwpz 14 of 18 77 boreholes correctly coincided over the good gwpz and 9 of 11 81 boreholes correctly coincided over the very good gwpz the overall accuracy of coincidence was calculated by dividing the sum of the error matrix s major diagonal elements 7 9 12 14 9 51 by the total number of boreholes 71 and multiplying by 100 as shown in eq 6 6 overall percentage of coincidence sum of diagonal elements total number of samples 100 51 71 100 72 therefore there is a similarity of approximately 72 between the delineated groundwater potential zones using the employed approach and the actual ground data this result is consistent to the findings of previous similar studies conducted in various semi arid regions for instance abdulkerim et al 2022 reported 72 agreement between actual data and gis derived groundwater recharge potential zones in sude district southern ethiopia similarly das et al 2019 approved 71 43 similarity in predicting groundwater potential zones in the puruliya district of west bengal india the current study s result however is much less accurate when compared to other study results such as the study report of berhanu and hatiye 2020 in the megesh watershed ethiopia in which 78 5 agreement was found between existing groundwater inventory data and identified groundwater potential zones and the study report of tolche 2021 in the dhungeta ramis sub basin ethiopia in which 89 coincidence was estimated between the output of the applied method and ground points the discrepancy in the results could be attributable to the number of validation points collected increasing the number of validation points may increase the degree of coincidence between the actual data and the classified groundwater potential zones in addition to the overlay analysis correlation analysis was carried out by plotting the gwpi range values against the average borehole yield in each of the gwpzs fig 13 table 19 shows the average yield of boreholes in each gwpi range the plot s linear regression coefficient r2 0 9042 indicates that the predicted and observed results are strongly correlated asuero et al 2006 4 conclusion the field based techniques that have been used for years to study groundwater are reliable and efficient for small scale studies however these methods aren t feasible to use on a large scale and are not able to reach remote and inaccessible locations such uncertainties have been solved with the advent of geospatial technologies such as remote sensing and gis the potential effectiveness of these methods has been confirmed in many parts of the world but they have yet to be tested in areas where infrastructure for these technologies is limited the purpose of the present study was to delineate the groundwater potential zones of the geba drainage basin in northern ethiopia where water stress and food insecurity are prevalent this was accomplished using weighted linear combination wlc of various groundwater indicators such as lithology geomorphology lineament density drainage density slope elevation rainfall soil and land use cover remote sensing technology was used as a data source analytic hierarchy process ahp was used to normalize the judgment scales and gis was used as a platform to generate the groundwater potential map five distinct groundwater potential zones were identified in the study area these are very good good moderate poor and very poor each covering an area of 301 km2 529 km2 1394 km2 2288 km2 and 625 km2 respectively the combined effects of jurassic sand stones loamy sand soils flat slopes low drainage densities and high lineament densities are concluded to be promising for the development of good and very good groundwater potential zones the presence of basement rocks sandy clay loam soils steep slopes bare land classes and high drainage densities on the other hand are accountable for the poor and very poor groundwater potential zones the groundwater potential map generated using the current methodology was validated using the borehole yield data and the results showed a 72 similarity which is an acceptable level of reliability the adoption and implementation of remote sensing and gis based analytical hierarch is therefore found to be the alternative option for groundwater potential mapping of the geba drainage basin the outcome of these techniques are qualitative judgments that only determine the likelihood of groundwater occurrence and its spatial distribution it can however provide preliminary information for site specific investigations and site selection thereby saving time and money the developed groundwater potential map is therefore recommended for use by water public

7739,study region rift valley awash river basin ethiopia study focus irrigation schemes in awash basin ethiopia are severely affected by the buildup of soil salinity the main source of the salinity is shallow groundwater heightened by improper irrigation practices and management however salinity predictions have not been developed based on direct measured data for the basin therefore this study aims predicting topsoil salinity in irrigated land from basic hydrological parameters using two approaches artificial neural networks anns and partial least squares regression plsr irrigation water amount water table depth precipitation and estimated canal seepage were considered for variable inputs new hydrological insights our results showed that anns were superior over plsr in predicting soil salinity explaining 77 vs 45 of the variance in soil salinity with root mean square error rmse of 0 12 vs 0 94 ds m in both models groundwater depth is the most influential variable for soil salinity prediction with relative contributions of 63 and 65 for plsr and anns respectively though irrigation water is non saline river water it contributes to the rising groundwater table which contains high salinity our study demonstrates that proper irrigation management use of drainage system and reducing high seepage from the irrigation canal system will sustain the depth of the water table and simultaneously reduces top soil salinity accumulation and productivity loss in the rift valley region of awash basin graphical abstract ga1 keywords canal seepage groundwater irrigation machine learning algorithms soil salinity data availability r code used for this study have been attached in supplementary part 1 introduction the awash river basin is one of the most important irrigation agricultural areas and the most irrigated basin in ethiopia however soil salinity as a result of established irrigation schemes compromises the agricultural productivity particularly in the arid and semi arid parts of the area the arid climate with insufficient rainfall precludes natural salt leaching from the topsoil zone daba and qureshi 2021 each year hundreds of hectares of productive land turn into saline abandoned land consequently in the awash river basin soil salinity has brought a long term major environmental economic and social challenge for farmers dependent on irrigation and livestock agriculture the salinity has its origin from evaporation of groundwater which is recharged by the awash river flowing to the afar plane which geologically is known as a highly saline aquifer with shallow water table taddese 2001 ayenew et al 2008 in this basin irrigation schemes function without drainage facilities taddese 2001 high seepage from earthen irrigation conveyance systems and traditional flood irrigation methods contribute to rising groundwater table and in the long run this aggravates soil salinization on a global scale in arid and semi arid climates irrigated land is vulnerable to soil salinity as a consequence of applying saline irrigation water letey et al 1985 devkota et al 2015 marcos et al 2018 however for arid and semi arid of awash basin irrigation water comes from the highland area and contains low salinity 0 34 ds m while the shallow groundwater is highly saline gelaye et al 2019a thus it is expected that the shallow groundwater table is the main consequence for topsoil salinity accumulation through capillary rise and evapotranspiration process in areas where the water table is close to the ground surface capillary rise results in the movement of water and salts towards the soil surface potentially leading to salt accumulation in the root zone northey et al 2006 topsoil salinity accumulation varies with groundwater level below surface and its salinity content topography or structure of the irrigation conveyances availability of drainage facilities and soil texture benyamini et al 2005 gelaye et al 2019a for instance in a field with sandy loam soil deep percolation from flood irrigation was a significant source of shallow groundwater recharge ochoa et al 2007 similarly a recent study in awash basin revealed that for sandy textured soils the extent of salinity accumulation with the shallow groundwater is unexpectedly high gelaye et al 2019a in this regard however these salinity heightened factors shall be studied and predicted their influence on salinity accumulation to advance the future salinity mitigation practices and irrigation and environmental managements for good irrigation management practice spatial and temporal information about the vulnerability to salinity is needed as well as resolved measures reducing this vulnerability in this context the study of farm resolved seasonal salinity and groundwater table fluctuation can aid in devising proper irrigation management measures to tackle soil salinity in irrigation areas however in awash basin studies based on measured data have not been conducted to predict irrigated land salinity accumulation therefore this study attempts to predict land salinity by comparing two machine learning algorithms artificial neural networks ann and partial least squares pls in predicting irrigated fields topsoil soil salinity accumulation in the semi arid part of awash basin pls was developed in 1960 s by herman o a wold originally pls was used in econometrics pls derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many noisy collinear and even incomplete variables in both variable inputs x and responses y wold et al 2001 to date different disciplines use pls for prediction analysis for instance soil salinity was effectively predicted using pls algorithms zhang huang 2019 qu et al 2008 fan et al 2015 ann are a computing algorithm that was vaguely inspired by the biological brain system mcculloch and pitts 1943 anns are arranged in successive feed forward multilayer perceptrons mlp rumelhart et al 1986 and the information flows unidirectional through hidden layers from the input to the output layer sahour et al 2020 lek and park 2008 ann models have considerable potential for modeling complex and non linear systems such as soil salinity for instance previous study at different shallow water table locations revealed that ann potentially predicts for salt buildup in the crop root zone patel et al 2002 the present study aims to compare soil salinity predicting potential of anns and pls algorithms and to find the main influential factors for the soil salinity accumulation in the semi arid part of awash basin ethiopia 2 methodology 2 1 description of the research area the study was performed in irrigated sugarcane fields of middle awash basin great rift valley in afar regional state of ethiopia fig 1 located from 9 7 44 4432 to 9 10 3 3924 n and 39 59 2 598 to 40 5 18 33 e at an elevation of 770 m above sea level the soil texture in the experimental fields is dominantly sandy loam the salinity and ph of the soil varied from 3 1 to 7 9 ds m and 7 7 9 1 respectively gelaye et al 2019b mean annual rainfall is 541 mm and temperature varies from mean minima of 15 c to mean maxima of 38 c in december and june respectively the source of irrigation water is from water of the kesem dam being recharged with water from the ethiopian highland with low salt content 0 34 ds m a representative site for the study was chosen on a part of a 106 ha sugarcane irrigation project established in 2008 this irrigation scheme was set up without any irrigation drainage system the sides of the fields opposite of the water inlet were blocked with soil bunds such that surplus water cannot flow out during the experiment which lasted from february 2016 to january 2017 the studied fields deepest and the shallowest groundwater depth were 2 8 m and 0 6 m respectively table 1 the open canal lines were covered with a geomembrane in some parts of the canal membranes and structures were deteriorated and high infiltration was observed especially affecting sandy loam soil profiles hence due to high water infiltration next to the primary canal parts of the field changed to swampland and saline abandoned after some years of cultivation fig 1 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 soil and water salinity measurement to determine salinity variability of the one year 2016 2017 irrigation period representative soil samples up to 60 cm soil depth were taken from various parts of four adjacent irrigated sugarcane fields during a one year study time for each field a total of 14 composited 500 g soil samples were taken throughout 12 months sugarcane growing period in monthly intervals soil salinity ec1 5 was measured at a 5 g 25 ml soil water ratio khorsandi and yazdi 2011 for irrigation water the salinity in the primary secondary and tertiary canals hydro flume water was directly measured in four month intervals using a portable hi 991300 meter salinity measuring device hanna instruments usa thus the average season salinity level of the irrigation water was 0 32 ds m the ph was 7 6 and the total dissolved solids tds of the water was 375 mg l and the average groundwater salinity was 24 ds m 2 2 2 applied irrigation water and precipitation from the dam irrigation water is conveyed to the fields by an open primary canal to tertiary canals and then by hydro flume discharge to the field furrows the hydro flumes have 20 outlets and the estimated amount of water discharged at each outlet was 5 l s fig 1 for each furrow water flows until it reaches the other end opposite end of the field the quantity of irrigation water for the different fields was estimated based on the farm operators records irrigation diagram these include irrigated field area ha irrigation interval days and irrigation hours from irrigation diagram data the monthly applied irrigation amount was estimated daily precipitation data were obtained from the ethiopian sugar corporation research and training division and is based on the kesem irrigation scheme meteorological station 2 2 3 groundwater depth assessment for groundwater level measurement two boreholes in the middle parts of the four experimental fields were drilled down to maximum three meters below surface using a drill bucket auger with different lengths 0 5 3 m of extension shafts the depth of the water table was measured manually every four weeks throughout the experimental period at the same time groundwater and soil samples were taken for temporal depth wise salinity assessments soil samples were taken at each 30 cm depth increments extending down to the level of the water table both the soil and groundwater samples were analyzed for salinity in all experimental fields the topsoils and the layers near the groundwater table showed higher salinity than the middle part of the profiles 2 2 4 canal seepage estimation in the study area irrigation water flows permanently flows through the primary canals other lower connivance system water gate opens to irrigate sugarcane fields hence for seepage estimation we considered only the primary earthen conveyance which is aligned with the experimental fields seepage estimation was performed using the approach of the egyptian irrigation department for estimating conveyance losses of canals with the empirical formula of molesworth and yennidunia quoted by bakry and awad 1997

analysis illuminates the neural hidden layers by retrieving information of the anns model pizarroso et al 2020 for this model the sigmoid function eq 3 of partial derivative sensitivity analysis was applied minai and williams 1993 3 f z 1 1 exp z where z refers to the input value of the neuron in eq 2 2 3 2 partial least squares regression plsr the plsr utilizes and combines the theories of principal components analysis and multiple linear regression abdi 2007 the linear plsr model finds a few new variables which are estimates of the latent variables wold et al 2001 these new variables are called x scores t a the x scores are predictors of y and also model x all parameters of the model determined by the plsr algorithm simpls de jong 1993 below the notations wold et al 2001 of the factors x and response y of the plsr model are given eqs 4 6 4 x t p e where t is score matrix where the columns are t a p is loading matrix and e is the matrix of x residuals 5 t x w where w is matrix of transformed plsr weights 6 y t c f where c is the y weight matrix and f is the matrix of y residuals 2 3 3 models assumptions the following assumptions underlay our plsr and ann models topsoil salinity accumulates and shallow groundwater rises over irrigation seasons simultaneously extreme seepage from earthen conveyance canals recharges collinear to groundwater and further raises the highly saline groundwater depth on the other hand extensive precipitation reduces the irrigation amount in this regard the plsr and ann algorithm is supposed to deals with collinearities between applied irrigation water seepage and water table fluctuations and between precipitation and applied irrigation water therefore the following factors were considered for predicting soil salinity response irrigation water quantity groundwater depth precipitation and canal seepages 2 3 4 data analysis and validation for both models the main dataset n 56 was divided into a training n 44 and testing n 12 dataset three datasets from four experimental fields were sorted for testing data distribution based on the timing of data collection hence at the beginning middle and end of the data collection seasons for the plsr model the full dataset n 56 was used to determine the number of significant components however at the testing stage and to cross validate the significant components 12 randomly selected segments n 12 were used the estimated number of significant components was selected with the one sigma method kalivas 1997 the plsr training and testing process was performed on auto scale mode with the leave one out cross validation loocv method lachenbruch and mickey 1968 of the simpls algorithm before computing the ann both datasets were normalized then ann was performed in non linear mode at 0 1 threshold level the number of hidden layers for soil salinity was selected with a repeated trial and error method gholami and sahour 2022 and hidden layers with minimum error were selected error 0 31 steps 285 the two models r codes are available as supplementary material code 1 and code 2 the plsr and ann model performances were evaluated by comparing observed and predicted values using root mean square error rmse and determination coefficients r2 eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 σ i 1 n o i y i 2 n rm5e 8 r 2 1 0 i y i o i 2 y i 2 n where oi is the observed data yi is mean of the predicted values of soil salinity and n is the number of observations rsme indicates the discrepancy between the observed and predicted values the lower the rsme the more accurate the prediction is 2 4 descriptive statistics of the dataset as shown in table 1 topsoil salinity of the experimental fields ranges from 3 1 to 7 9 ds m and its standard deviation was 1 27 ds m the groundwater depth ranged between 0 6 and 2 8 m the shallowest water table was recorded in a sugarcane field near to the primary conveyance system as the study site is located in a semi arid area the mean monthly precipitation is not more than 45 mm applied irrigation water and conveyance system seepage was estimated from the first date of the experiment and sequentially added to the following day until the end of the experiment table 1 fig 2 shows predictor variables collinearity and the relationship between predictor variables and response salinity among predictors groundwater depth vs irrigation and irrigation vs seepage showed significant correlations at p value of 0 01 and 0 05 respectively groundwater depth showed a highly significant p 0 001 negative correlation with the response salinity and seepage showed a significant p 0 05 correlation with salinity 3 results 3 1 plsr model fig 4 shows the plsr model training evaluation where a single significant component was selected out of the four presented components to perform the salinity prediction it explained 38 27 loocv 1 009 of the variance fig 5 with the corresponding component the plsr model explained 46 of the variance of soil salinity in the study area fig 6 table 2 shows the model accuracy parameters for training and validations of salinity predictions for the plsr model the estimated variations between observed and predicted salinity rmse for training and validation was 0 94 and 1 3 ds m respectively and the model r2 for training and validation showed a comparable soil salinity variance 45 and 46 respectively fig 7 although plsr showed less satisfactory values of r2 and rmse a better consistency was shown between the training and testing stages the predictors influences groundwater table applied irrigation precipitation and seepage on the soil salinity are shown in fig 5 among the four predictors groundwater has a negative loading and was the most influential factor in predicting soil salinity thus groundwater depth is the most influencing 63 variable for this model hence the soil salinity was lower for irrigated fields with deeper groundwater table fig 5 other predictors show a minor and positive influence load with the topsoil salinity the predictor regression coefficient shows that groundwater table and applied irrigation have a negative relationship for predicting the soil salinity for the study area this indicate that topsoil salinity is reduced when the groundwater is deeper and more irrigation is applied in addition precipitation and seepage factors are contribute for water table recharge so both factors shown have a positive relationship with topsoil salinity accumulation 3 2 anns model the anns model could interpret 77 variance of soil salinity fig 6 the rmse confirms the variations between observed and predicted salinity for training and validation which are 0 11 and 0 21 ds m respectively and the r2 was 77 and 55 respectively table 2 for the ann model rmse and r2 values indicated less consistency between training and testing of soil salinity estimated partial derivatives for the relative contributions of input variables for the prediction of soil salinity accumulation are shown in fig 8 among the four input variables the groundwater table was the most influential factor 65 in the prediction of soil salinity in the study area next to groundwater seepage and applied irrigation contributes 29 and 22 respectively while precipitation was evaluated as the least important factor 16 influencing soil salinity in the ann model except for seepage all other input variables had a negative influence on soil salinity fig 8 4 discussion in this study the ann model predicted soil salinity better than plsr table 2 several authors also highlighted the predicting potentials of anns for soil salinity patel et al 2002 akramkhanov and vlek 2011 guan et al 2013 jiang et al 2018 although overall salinity prediction performed well with the ann model the training and testing showed higher variation than in the plsr model table 3 as the ann hidden layers are a black box in the modeling process minimal causality is provided regarding the inputs to the system park and lek 2016 pizarroso et al 2020 thus anns input variables were evaluated with the partial derivatives method of sensitivity analysis while direct information about the predictors influence was obtained from the plsr model for both plsr and anns approaches groundwater table depth was identified as the most influencing variable for predicting topsoil salinity accumulations however the groundwater influence in salinity prediction is more considerable for plsr model than anns figs 5 and 8 in the study area irrigation water or seepages from irrigation canal contains less salinity 0 32 ds m while the groundwater water salinity 24 ds m is extremely high gelaye et al 2019a in this regard it is a plausible result that the depth of the groundwater table was the principal predictor in both models still it needs to be emphasized that the other input variables irrigation precipitation and seepage from irrigation canals directly contribute to groundwater recharge foster et al 2018 as a result collinearity between the groundwater table and all the other predictors likely contributed to the identification of the groundwater table as the most influencing factor for soil salinity prediction in our study fig 2 for instance the water from earthen irrigation conveyance recharges the groundwater also the furrow irrigation method plays a significant role in the rising of the groundwater table and thus also can contribute to topsoil salinity rising of the groundwater table to the topsoil zone and increased soil salinity are expected to occur during irrigation seasons in the study area irrigation is practiced without a drainage system and the surplus irrigation water applied with furrow irrigation contributes to shallow the groundwater liu et al 2012 gutiérrez jurado et al 2017 foster et al 2018 groundwater is recharged and getting shallower as a consequence the topsoil salinity becomes more saline and land productivity has deteriorated surface irrigation events introduce large volumes of freshwater which infiltrate into the root zone over a relatively short period northey et al 2006 especially in presence of macropores furrow irrigation water may readily infiltrate and cause rising of the groundwater table consequently in both of the tested modeling approaches groundwater table was the most important factor in predicting topsoil salinity in the study area from the surveyed fields in our study fields with sandy soil had a shallower water table and higher concentrations of salinity compared to fields with clayey and clay loam soils this study area sugarcane productivity varied with both the depth of the groundwater table and soil type when high saline groundwater fluctuating to evapotranspiration zone it heightens the rapid contribute for soil salinity amplified soil salinity due to groundwater results for unfavorable environmental and hydrological situation that restricts usual crop production through the year rahman et al 2017 the severity of soil salinity due to the shallow water table is more pronounced in sandy textured than clay textured fields the sandy soil fields of irrigation farms are severely affected by saline due to fast fluctuation during irrigation seasons in the study area the productivity span of the furrow irrigated sandy loam fields were approx 4 years after which 80 of the fields become unproductive or less productive 5 summary and conclusions the main goal of this study was to compare the plsr and anns model for prediction of topsoil salinity and to determine the most influential factor in the soil salinization process in awash basin ethiopia for this study area anns predicted soil salinity better than the plsr model however the plsr model showed a more consistent prediction potential between the training and validation process compared to ann in both models the groundwater table was the principal factor for soil salinity accumulation and more important than applied irrigation conveyance seepage and precipitation however the latter factors are all contributors to groundwater during the irrigation period in this regard lowering or maintaining the groundwater table at the lower lever through improved irrigation management and drainage facilities is expected to reduce soil salinity and improve the productivity of the irrigated land in awash basin ethiopia for future studies additional predictors e g geology elevation soil properties and long term data could reduce the collinearity between predictors and improve the models salinity predictions credit

higher salinity than the middle part of the profiles 2 2 4 canal seepage estimation in the study area irrigation water flows permanently flows through the primary canals other lower connivance system water gate opens to irrigate sugarcane fields hence for seepage estimation we considered only the primary earthen conveyance which is aligned with the experimental fields seepage estimation was performed using the approach of the egyptian irrigation department for estimating conveyance losses of canals with the empirical formula of molesworth and yennidunia quoted by bakry and awad 1997

topsoil salinity accumulates and shallow groundwater rises over irrigation seasons simultaneously extreme seepage from earthen conveyance canals recharges collinear to groundwater and further raises the highly saline groundwater depth on the other hand extensive precipitation reduces the irrigation amount in this regard the plsr and ann algorithm is supposed to deals with collinearities between applied irrigation water seepage and water table fluctuations and between precipitation and applied irrigation water therefore the following factors were considered for predicting soil salinity response irrigation water quantity groundwater depth precipitation and canal seepages 2 3 4 data analysis and validation for both models the main dataset n 56 was divided into a training n 44 and testing n 12 dataset three datasets from four experimental fields were sorted for testing data distribution based on the timing of data collection hence at the beginning middle and end of the data collection seasons for the plsr model the full dataset n 56 was used to determine the number of significant components however at the testing stage and to cross validate the significant components 12 randomly selected segments n 12 were used the estimated number of significant components was selected with the one sigma method kalivas 1997 the plsr training and testing process was performed on auto scale mode with the leave one out cross validation loocv method lachenbruch and mickey 1968 of the simpls algorithm before computing the ann both datasets were normalized then ann was performed in non linear mode at 0 1 threshold level the number of hidden layers for soil salinity was selected with a repeated trial and error method gholami and sahour 2022 and hidden layers with minimum error were selected error 0 31 steps 285 the two models r codes are available as supplementary material code 1 and code 2 the plsr and ann model performances were evaluated by comparing observed and predicted values using root mean square error rmse and determination coefficients r2 eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 σ i 1 n o i y i 2 n rm5e 8 r 2 1 0 i y i o i 2 y i 2 n where oi is the observed data yi is mean of the predicted values of soil salinity and n is the number of observations rsme indicates the discrepancy between the observed and predicted values the lower the rsme the more accurate the prediction is 2 4 descriptive statistics of the dataset as shown in table 1 topsoil salinity of the experimental fields ranges from 3 1 to 7 9 ds m and its standard deviation was 1 27 ds m the groundwater depth ranged between 0 6 and 2 8 m the shallowest water table was recorded in a sugarcane field near to the primary conveyance system as the study site is located in a semi arid area the mean monthly precipitation is not more than 45 mm applied irrigation water and conveyance system seepage was estimated from the first date of the experiment and sequentially added to the following day until the end of the experiment table 1 fig 2 shows predictor variables collinearity and the relationship between predictor variables and response salinity among predictors groundwater depth vs irrigation and irrigation vs seepage showed significant correlations at p value of 0 01 and 0 05 respectively groundwater depth showed a highly significant p 0 001 negative correlation with the response salinity and seepage showed a significant p 0 05 correlation with salinity 3 results 3 1 plsr model fig 4 shows the plsr model training evaluation where a single significant component was selected out of the four presented components to perform the salinity prediction it explained 38 27 loocv 1 009 of the variance fig 5 with the corresponding component the plsr model explained 46 of the variance of soil salinity in the study area fig 6 table 2 shows the model accuracy parameters for training and validations of salinity predictions for the plsr model the estimated variations between observed and predicted salinity rmse for training and validation was 0 94 and 1 3 ds m respectively and the model r2 for training and validation showed a comparable soil salinity variance 45 and 46 respectively fig 7 although plsr showed less satisfactory values of r2 and rmse a better consistency was shown between the training and testing stages the predictors influences groundwater table applied irrigation precipitation and seepage on the soil salinity are shown in fig 5 among the four predictors groundwater has a negative loading and was the most influential factor in predicting soil salinity thus groundwater depth is the most influencing 63 variable for this model hence the soil salinity was lower for irrigated fields with deeper groundwater table fig 5 other predictors show a minor and positive influence load with the topsoil salinity the predictor regression coefficient shows that groundwater table and applied irrigation have a negative relationship for predicting the soil salinity for the study area this indicate that topsoil salinity is reduced when the groundwater is deeper and more irrigation is applied in addition precipitation and seepage factors are contribute for water table recharge so both factors shown have a positive relationship with topsoil salinity accumulation 3 2 anns model the anns model could interpret 77 variance of soil salinity fig 6 the rmse confirms the variations between observed and predicted salinity for training and validation which are 0 11 and 0 21 ds m respectively and the r2 was 77 and 55 respectively table 2 for the ann model rmse and r2 values indicated less consistency between training and testing of soil salinity estimated partial derivatives for the relative contributions of input variables for the prediction of soil salinity accumulation are shown in fig 8 among the four input variables the groundwater table was the most influential factor 65 in the prediction of soil salinity in the study area next to groundwater seepage and applied irrigation contributes 29 and 22 respectively while precipitation was evaluated as the least important factor 16 influencing soil salinity in the ann model except for seepage all other input variables had a negative influence on soil salinity fig 8 4 discussion in this study the ann model predicted soil salinity better than plsr table 2 several authors also highlighted the predicting potentials of anns for soil salinity patel et al 2002 akramkhanov and vlek 2011 guan et al 2013 jiang et al 2018 although overall salinity prediction performed well with the ann model the training and testing showed higher variation than in the plsr model table 3 as the ann hidden layers are a black box in the modeling process minimal causality is provided regarding the inputs to the system park and lek 2016 pizarroso et al 2020 thus anns input variables were evaluated with the partial derivatives method of sensitivity analysis while direct information about the predictors influence was obtained from the plsr model for both plsr and anns approaches groundwater table depth was identified as the most influencing variable for predicting topsoil salinity accumulations however the groundwater influence in salinity prediction is more considerable for plsr model than anns figs 5 and 8 in the study area irrigation water or seepages from irrigation canal contains less salinity 0 32 ds m while the groundwater water salinity 24 ds m is extremely high gelaye et al 2019a in this regard it is a plausible result that the depth of the groundwater table was the principal predictor in both models still it needs to be emphasized that the other input variables irrigation precipitation and seepage from irrigation canals directly contribute to groundwater recharge foster et al 2018 as a result collinearity between the groundwater table and all the other predictors likely contributed to the identification of the groundwater table as the most influencing factor for soil salinity prediction in our study fig 2 for instance the water from earthen irrigation conveyance recharges the groundwater also the furrow irrigation method plays a significant role in the rising of the groundwater table and thus also can contribute to topsoil salinity rising of the groundwater table to the topsoil zone and increased soil salinity are expected to occur during irrigation seasons in the study area irrigation is practiced without a drainage system and the surplus irrigation water applied with furrow irrigation contributes to shallow the groundwater liu et al 2012 gutiérrez jurado et al 2017 foster et al 2018 groundwater is recharged and getting shallower as a consequence the topsoil salinity becomes more saline and land productivity has deteriorated surface irrigation events introduce large volumes of freshwater which infiltrate into the root zone over a relatively short period northey et al 2006 especially in presence of macropores furrow irrigation water may readily infiltrate and cause rising of the groundwater table consequently in both of the tested modeling approaches groundwater table was the most important factor in predicting topsoil salinity in the study area from the surveyed fields in our study fields with sandy soil had a shallower water table and higher concentrations of salinity compared to fields with clayey and clay loam soils this study area sugarcane productivity varied with both the depth of the groundwater table and soil type when high saline groundwater fluctuating to evapotranspiration zone it heightens the rapid contribute for soil salinity amplified soil salinity due to groundwater results for unfavorable environmental and hydrological situation that restricts usual crop production through the year rahman et al 2017 the severity of soil salinity due to the shallow water table is more pronounced in sandy textured than clay textured fields the sandy soil fields of irrigation farms are severely affected by saline due to fast fluctuation during irrigation seasons in the study area the productivity span of the furrow irrigated sandy loam fields were approx 4 years after which 80 of the fields become unproductive or less productive 5 summary and conclusions the main goal of this study was to compare the plsr and anns model for prediction of topsoil salinity and to determine the most influential factor in the soil salinization process in awash basin ethiopia for this study area anns predicted soil salinity better than the plsr model however the plsr model showed a more consistent prediction potential between the training and validation process compared to ann in both models the groundwater table was the principal factor for soil salinity accumulation and more important than applied irrigation conveyance seepage and precipitation however the latter factors are all contributors to groundwater during the irrigation period in this regard lowering or maintaining the groundwater table at the lower lever through improved irrigation management and drainage facilities is expected to reduce soil salinity and improve the productivity of the irrigated land in awash basin ethiopia for future studies additional predictors e g geology elevation soil properties and long term data could reduce the collinearity between predictors and improve the models salinity predictions credit
