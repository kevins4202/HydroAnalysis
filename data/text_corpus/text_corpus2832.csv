14160,integrative performance evaluation of constructed wetland in removal different aspects of bacteria under specific local environmental conditions needs to be explored in detail to ensure selection of appropriate and highly efficient macrophytes candidates to achieve this integrative purification performance evaluation approach that holistically considers all the aspects of pathogenic bacterial biology colony numbers functional gene species virulent pathogenicity and resistant genes needs to be adopted rather than the commonly known unidimensional approaches that take into account a single bacterial aspect this study experimentally evaluated the individual performance of three native and one exotic winter tolerant submerged macrophytes combined with a single emergent macrophyte in eradicating faecal related bacterial species and pathotypes across horizontal surface flow constructed wetland it involved the new multi dimensional approach that integrated the faecal bacterial colony numbers functional gene copies species survival virulent and pathogenicity as well as antimicrobial resistant in constructed wetland purification evaluation the results showed elodea nuttallii and myriophyllum spicatum as the best candidate partners to typha latifolia for the highest purification efficiency p 0 05 of above 97 for removal of faecal bacteria colonies and functional genes and more than 75 for removal of faecal bacterial strains pathotypes virulent and well as resistant genes however m spicatum being a chinese native species should be much preferred to the invasive e nuttallii therefore the study recommends the application of local macrophytes such as m spicatum as the best candidates and the decision should emanate from such a multidimensional intergrative purification based evaluation approach keywords constructed wetlands faecal bacteria macrophytes pathotypes purification efficiency 1 introduction constructed wastewater wetlands have shown high capability in treating different kinds of raw wastewater 1 2 several studies have focused on the potential of constructed wetlands in the treatment of grey and black water from domestic effluents 3 paule et al 2013 marzec et al 2019 domestic raw wastewater contains various pollutants that range from organic matter nutrients to pathogenic microorganisms and these pollutants do find their way into the major water bodies 4 previously majority of studies had given much attention on organic matter and nutrients removal as opposed to pathogenic pollutants removal 3 the macrophytes role in raw wastewater purification occurs in many ways they stabilize the surface of the beds provide good conditions for physical filtration prevent vertical flow systems from clogging insulate the surface against frost during winter and provide a huge surface area for attached microbial growth 3 5 constructed wetlands with mixed macrophytes that occur in high abundances have proved to provide high removal of enteric bacteria but the treatment effect may vary among systems nature of plants and the design of the constructed wetlands 6 despite hybrid and sub surface flow constructed wetlands being the most effective in raw wastewater purification the use of surface flow constructed wetland is still preferred due to its low installation and cost of maintenance muhsin et al 2009 the complexities in wetland functionalities call for several alternative testing methodologies that could provide adequate information on precise sources movements and purification efficiencies of faecal pathogenic bacteria 7 indeed the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in raw wastewater pose a risk to public health when untreated or inappropriately treated raw wastewater is discharged into surface waters these facts represent a major hygienic concern which needs to be effectively handled 8 faecal pathogens in raw wastewater can cause waterborne illnesses such as diarrhoea typhoid fever dysentery cholera and ineffective hepatitis and the main exposure root to these illnesses is through faecal oral contamination that involves the consumption of water or food containing the illnesses causing pathogens shakoor et al 2012 a study by simachew et al 2018 identified the co occurrence of both single and multidrug resistant bacterial isolates in raw wastewater in ethiopia africa their finding indicated that significant number of antibiotic resistant bacteria were removed in vegetated broken brick and gravel bed constructed wetlands than the non vegetated gravel bed wetlands furthermore ricardo and eloy 2013 showed that constructed wetland was better than conventional raw wastewater treatment plant in the removal of bacteria and not the drug resistant genes from raw wastewater they recommended the identification and use of correct wetlands macrophytes for a better removal of the drug resistant genes by constructed wetlands wetland ecological studies have emphasized that plant species selection is the best way to further maximize pollutant removal in cws 6 9 and that native plant species of polluted sites have proved to be good candidates 10 according to shah et al 11 the application of macrophytes in municipal raw wastewater treatment under specific local environmental conditions needs to be explored in detail this is very essential because apart from their performance being comparable to conventional raw wastewater treatment plants they have low operation and management costs 6 dimuro et al 2014 georgios et al 2018 irwin et al 2018 moreover one of the tricky tasks prior to the designing of a constructed wetland treatment facility is the selection of the appropriate aquatic plant 6 12 additionally the influence of weather condition mediated environmental parameters effects on the integrity of constructed wetlands has continued to draw attention from domestic wastewater researchers practitioners and regulators 13 specifically most wetlands in china have recorded a low purification efficiency in pollutant removal during winter season due to the inability of most macrophytes to withstand the cold winter temperatures yan and xu 2014 mo et al 2017 furthermore the growth performance of most macrophytes is always hindered by the cold winter conditions making the performance of most constructed wetlands to drop during the winter seasons 13 ottor and hook 2005 marianna et al 2012 in this regard more studies are currently focusing on the utility of aquatic macrophytes for the simulated conditions to improve raw wastewater purification efficiencies based on the existing environmental conditions or seasons 3 the available information regarding the ideal combination of species to acquire close to 100 wastewater purification efficiencies in constructed wetlands is still inadequate in most regions 12 14 moreover most study designs that have focused on evaluating the purification performance of constructed wetlands in the removal of faecal pathogenic and resistant genes have only focused on individual aspects of the bacterial biology such as colony forming units 15 gene copy numbers 16 virulence and pathogenicity 17 and resistance 18 faecal indicators reductions of 1 4 log that accounts to approximately 85 purification efficiency had been recorded in echinochloa pyramidalis under horizontal surface flow constructed wetland 19 maria et al recorded pe of 90 on bulrush under surface flow constructed wetland while juncus effusus l scirpus validus l and typha latifolia l all recorded a reduction of three order of magnitude 75 purification efficiency 20 elodea nuttallii hydrilla verticillata elodea canadensis myriophullum spicatum and potamogeton crispus in wastewater polishing pond enclosures gave a purification efficiency of more than 90 in the removal of bacterial colony units 6 therefore this study evaluated the individual performances of three chinese native types of winter tolerant submerged macrophytes hydrilla verticillata myriophyllum spicatum and potamogeton crispus and one exotic species of japanese origin elodea nuttallii 21 each combined with emergent macrophyte typha latifolia in eradicating faecal related bacterial pathotypes and virulence across horizontal surface flow constructed wetlands during the winter season it employed the new multi dimensional purification performance evaluation approach that integrated the removal evaluation for faecal bacterial colony numbers functional gene copies species survival virulent and pathogenicity as well as antimicrobial resistant genes 2 methods 2 1 experimental set up the experimental set up consisted of a physical microcosm model of raw wastewater treatment plant that was constructed within the domestic wastewater experimental field station at lake dianchi between 102035ʹ to 102050ʹ e and 24040ʹ to 25000ʹ n in kunming city of yunnan province of the peoples republic of china the field station was run by the institute of hydrobiology of the chinese academy of sciences 6 this study was conducted through 6 batch experimental runs with every experimental run lasting for 18 days between the winter months of october 2016 to december 2017 the experiment was set up as illustrated in fig 1 part a it involved four pairs of experimental tanks plus additional one pair as control each pair was made of two interconnected plastic tanks with each tank measuring 1 2 m in length 0 6 m in width 0 6 m in depth the first tanks were marked a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 while the second tanks were marked b1 b2 b3 b4 and b5 respectively for pairs 1 2 3 4 and 5 in pairs 1 to 4 the a tanks were filled with substrate of mixed soil sediment silt sand and clay of fine particles 0 25 0 5 mm diameter from lake bottom with porosity values of 0 17 0 27 to 20 cm wet depth and emergent macrophyte typha latifolia tl planted into them the b tanks were filled with the same substrate to 10 cm depth and different submerged macrophytes planted into them hydrilla verticillate hv in b1 elodea nuttallii en in b2 myriophyllum spicatum ms in b3 and potamogeton crispus pc in b4 the 5th pair of tanks was used as control c with the same setting but no macrophytes planted in them fig 1 part b the plant density was 20 individuals per tank and 30 individuals per tanks respectively for submerged and emergent macrophytes the root depth was within the range of 5 to 10 cm and 10 to 15 cm respectively for submerged and emergent macrophytes the experiment was carried out after one month from the macrophyte planting time and ended before the flowering stage all the pairs had a common reservoir that supplied domestic raw wastewater into the system through a tanks to b tanks up to the 55 cm height the raw wastewater had the initial characteristics of 60 mg l 6 mg l 0 2 mg l 1 2 0 mg l 200 mg l and 6 8 mg l respectively for chemical oxygen demand cod nitrate nitrite ammonium total suspended solids and total nitrogen the flow rate of water into the a tanks was 400 ml min 3 45 107 mm day while the hydraulic retention time between the inflow points at as and out flow points at bs was approximately 2 days on average for each set of tanks the lower hydraulic retention time of 2 days was chosen based on the recommendation by maria et al 2015 which showed that the lower hydraulic retention time enables constructed wetland to exhibit the highest pollutant removal efficiency all the experimental tanks were acclimatized to raw domestic wastewater condition through flashing by the raw wastewater prior to the study 2 2 sampling and analyses for each of the experimental run sampling was done in triplicate after every six days giving a total of 18 sampling episodes during every sampling episode measurement of physico chemical parameters temperature dissolved oxygen do conductivity total dissolved solids tds salinity and ph was done in situ using ysi proodotm handheld multi parameter meter usa this was carried out in triplicate in influent and in all the a and b tanks the samples for bacterial analysis were obtained from the inflowing raw wastewater prior to its introduction into the a tanks the raw wastewater that leaves a tanks enter b tanks and raw wastewater that leaves b tanks in addition samples for bacterial analysis were also obtained from the sediment and biofilm in all the tanks the bacterial analyses involved membrane filtration technique mft polymerase chain reaction pcr real time quantitative pcr qpcr and dna sequencing to determine the abundances of total coliforms e coli and faecal streptococci strains and virulence pathotypes of dominant persistent members of enterobacteriaceae and enterococcaceae at different treatment points 2 3 determination of bacterial abundances through mft bacterial abundances across the treatment tanks was measured using membrane filtration techniques mft as outlined in american public health association apha 22 public health england phe 23 and as summarised in donde et al 24 in summary the laboratory analysis was done within 24 hours after sampling to eliminate errors in bacterial counts as a result of bacterial growth or die off there was strict adherence to aseptic techniques the abundance of coliforms and intestinal enterococci were determined using selective chromocult coliform agar merck and enterococcus selective agar sigma aldrich respectively incubation conditions were 37 c for 24 hours for coliform bacteria and 44 c for 36 hours for enterococcus bacteria 2 4 determination of bacterial abundances through pcr bacterial abundances across the treatment tanks was also achived by quantifying the functional gene copies through realtime qpcr following the procedure under quirós et al 2015 and as previously summarized in donde et al 24 this was carried out in all the samples from inflowing raw wastewater prior to its introduction into the a tanks the raw wastewater that leaves a tanks enters b tanks and raw wastewater that leaves b tanks in addition realtime qpcr was also carried out for samples obtained from the sediment and biofilm in all the tanks 2 5 macrophytes purification efficiencies purification efficiencies was determined by comparing the quality of water that enters and leaves a tanks a inlet against a outlet quality of water that enters and leaves b tanks b inlet against b outlet as well as comparing the quality of water that enter a tanks verses what leaves b tanks a inlet against b outlet 2 6 variation in escherichia and enterococcus strains across the treatment tanks the variation in the species of escherichia and streptococci across the constructed wetland treatment system was evaluated through sequencing of 16s rrna gene using primers 27f 5 gagtttgatcctggctcag 3 and 1492r 5 ggttaccttacgactt 3 the detailed procedure is previously outlined in donde et al 6 2 7 detection of escherichia and streptococci pathotypes and resistant genes detection of genes that are associated with five types of diarrheagenic e coli dec entero pathogenic e coli epec enterohemorrhagic e coli ehec enterotoxigenic e coli etec entero aggregative e coli eaec and entero invasive e coli eiec was done for the detection of e coli diarrheagenic genes two multiplex pcr assays were used together with appropriate primers for detection of enterococcus pathotypes genes associated with eterococcus faecalis and e faecasum were targeted and detected using appropriate primers all the analysis procedure used in this section are described in detail in donde et al 6 detection of antimicrobial resistant genes was performed according to the protocol described in momtaz et al 25 3 results 3 1 physico chemical parameters across the tanks the values of physico chemical parameters temperature do conductivity tds salinity and ph were as provided in table 1 there was statistical difference in temperature do and ph values between and within most of the a tanks and b tanks in pairs 1 to 4 conductivity tds and salinity did not show statistical difference between tanks 2 to 5 however temperature do and ph showed significant difference across all the tanks 3 2 bacterial abundances through mft the reduction trend in total coliform e coli and faecal streptococci values through mft were as provided in figs 2 a 2b and 2c the raw water prior to treatment had higher values than that at the semi treatment stage b inlets and the one after the full treatment b water there were statistical differences between the semi treated wastewater and the one after full treatment across all the pairs tanks 1 to 4 showed higher purification efficiencies for total coliform e coli and faecal streptococci as compared to tank 5 control 3 3 variation in bacterial abundances through qpcr across the tanks the reduction trend in median values for gene copy numbers for lacz uida and cyd through qpcr were as provided in figs 3 a 3b and 3c the median values for gene copies numbers in raw water were higher than what was in the semi treatment stage b inlets and the one after the full treatment b water in pairs 1 to 4 however the values for control tank 5 were significantly higher at the semi treatment stage 5b inlet with slightly lower values than the one in raw water lacz and cyd or higher values than the one in raw water uida the values at the semi treatment stage of tank 5 5b inlet recorded a wider range in median 25th and 75th percentile values than in all other tanks 3 4 variation in colony forming units and functional genes across the treatment tanks the purification efficiencies pe values were calculated based on the reduction trends in total coliforms e coli and faecal streptococci as well as for lacz uida and cyd genes across the treatment tanks the pe values are provided in tables 2 and 3 pe were calculated using the formula pe inlet outlet inlet 100 are provided in the pe were calculated for a tanks a nlet a outlet a inlet 100 b tanks b inlet b outlet b inlet 100 as well as for fully treated wastewater from a inlet to b outlet a inlet b outlet a inlet 100 for fully treated wastewater from a inlet to b outlet the pe for total coliform was highest at tank 2 and lowest at tank 5 for e coli was highest at tank 2 and lowest at tank 5 for faecal streptococci was highest at tank 3 and lowest at tank 5 for lacz genes was highest at tank 4 and lowest at tank 3 for uida gene was highest at tank 1 and lowest at tank 3 while for cyd was highest at tank 4 and lowest at tank 5 the average pe for the removal of viable indicator bacteria and faecal pathogenic bacterial functional genes is provided in fig 4 3 5 variation in escherichia and enterococcus strains across the treatment tanks the detection of various species of escherichia and streptococci are recorded in table 4 a total of 13 escherichia strains were detected in raw water from the source reservoir the following were the consequent total number of escherichia strains recoded at the outflows from a tanks and out flows from b tanks 7 and 3 6 and 1 5 and 1 7 and 5 12 and 9 respectively for tanks 1 2 3 4 and 5 generally low e coli species were recorded in tanks 2 and 3 than in tanks 1 4 and 5 e coli o157 h7 and its closest relative e coli strain tyn 130606 6 showed the highest resistant to the treatment process as compared to the other species across all the tanks a total of 7 enterococcus strains were detected in raw water from the source reservoir the following were the consequent total number of enterococcus strains recoded at the outflows from a tanks and outflows from b tanks 5 and 3 4 and 2 3 and 1 5 and 4 7 and 6 respectively for tanks 1 2 3 4 and 5 lowest number of enterococcus strains were recorded in tank 3 the average pe based based on the removal of escherichia and enterococcus strains across the treatment tanks is provided in fig 5 3 6 detection of escherichia pathotypes and its and antimicrobial resistant genes across the treatment tanks as highlighted in the methodology section multiplex pcr technique 6 26 27 was run to detect the presence of virulence genes associated with various e coli pathotypes and those associated with two enterococcus species there were total of 18 multiplex pcr runs that corresponded to each sampling episode as described in the sampling and analyses section the detection of gene markers for enterotoxigenic e coli etec entero aggregative e coli eaec typical and atypical enterohemorrhagic e coli ehec typical and atypical entero pathogenic e coli epec and entero invasive e coli eiec as well as those for enterococcus species are provided in table 5 and fig 6 tanks 2 and 3 recorded the lowest values of both the e coli pathotypes and enterococcus related genes the results on the purification efficiency based on the detection of resistant genes across the treatment tanks are provided in table 6 tanks 2 and 3 proved to be the most effective in the eradication of e coli related resistant genes the average pe based on the removal of e coli pathotypes enterococcus related genes and antimicrobial resistant genes across the treatment tanks is provided in figs 6 and 7 considering the purification efficiency pe in the removal of all the faecal bacterial characteristics tanks 2 and 3 further showed higher pes values which were of more than 75 for each characteristic e coli colony cfu total coliforms cfus faecal streptococci cfus e coli resistant genes escherichia and streptococci strains and e coli pathotypes fig 4 12 and the average pe across the tanks based on all the studied parameters is provided in fig 8 a and 8b 4 discussion several studies have shown significant reduction of e coli between constructed wetland influent and effluent and suggested to be due to the dynamics in the nature and quantity of nutrients competition predation by other microorganisms release of bactericidal exudates by plants as well as bacterial die off that occurs across the treatment system 3 8 the reduction of e coli was an evident of the significant removal of pathogens that may enter into the surface water from different forms and sources of raw wastewater the removal of the main pollutants from the raw wastewater would ensure clean and safe environment and reduced outbreak of water related illnesses 17 the effects of physico chemical parameters on the survival of bacteria have been extensively studied 28 changes in the physico chemical parameter values between the a tanks and b tanks for each set was more noticeable for dissolved oxygen than for all the other parameters the small general decline in do values between the a tanks and the b tanks could be due to the increase in temperatures between the a tanks and b tanks as a result of the increased ability of the sun s radiation to penetrate through the floating macrophytes as opposed to the emergent macrophyte cattail the statistical differences in temperature do and ph values between most of the a tanks and b tanks in pairs 1 to 4 could be attributed to the consequential variation in bacterial counts as earlier reported in salem et al 29 and rop et al 4 the relatively higher values of do could be as a result of aeration that was caused by the supplying water pump as well as the strong wind previous studies have shown a reduction trend in the bacterial colony counts across the constructed wetland systems a study by ibekwe and murinda had showed significant reduction in e coli populations from wetland influent to the final effluent and recommended the use of continuous flow constructed wetlands in reducing contaminants from different waste water sources 17 generally constructed wetlands were found to be more efficient than algae based systems in bacterial removal efficiencies 30 under stable environmental conditions the percentage removal efficiencies have been over 90 but no integrative efficiency evaluation has been done during the harsh season when the environmental conditions are unfavorable to the survival of most macrophytes 8 the present study showed that raw water had the highest bacterial counts for total coliforms e coli and faecal streptococci than the water that was leaving all the a and b tanks the bacterial colony forming units at the outlets of b tanks for sets 1 to 4 were all lower than that at the out let of the control set 5b the trend was replicated in the functional gene copy numbers of lacz uida and cyd through qpcr this was an evidence that macrophytes play significant role in faecal pathogenic bacteria removal and combining both the two sets of macrophytes emergent and submerged was key to achieving that however of interest to note was the lower mft values for total coliforms e coli and faecal streptococci as well as the lower qpcr values for lacz uida and cyd copies in tank 5b than the a tanks in sets 1 to 4 this raises an interesting argument where the control 5b with no macrophyte depicting some sort of faecal bacterial removal this unexpected finding could hypothetically be attributed to the role of ultraviolet radiation from the short sunny periods that occurred during the experiment and contributed in eradicating faecal bacterial pathogen the control set of tanks were open with no macrophytes hence the microbes could have been directly exposed to the ultraviolet radiation that caused their reduction in counts due to die off as had been showed in studies by donde et al 31 and alvarez et al 32 this finding leads to a suggestion that integrating uv radiation into constructed wetland technology may be fundamental in achieving the highest raw wastewater purification efficiencies in a much more sustainable manner the t latifolia has been recorded to be a better macrophyte for removal of bacterial cells from domestic wastewater with a purification efficiency of greater than 90 33 the have been high removal of epiphytic bacterial community from raw wastewater flowing across h verticillata with a removal efficiency of greater than 95 34 35 sun et al 36 showed the good ability of myriophyllum sp in the removal of nitrite oxidizing bacteria from swine raw wastewater the over 88 performance of p crispus in the removal epiphytic and other bacteria communities have also been documented 37 38 the allelopathy of e nuttallii is one of its characteristics that has made it to be greatly considered in constructed wetlands for treatment of wastewater containing pathogenic bacteria species especially cyanobacteria in epiphytic biofilms 39 40 based on this characteristic e nuttallii has achieve an efficiency of above 94 in the removal of most pathogenic microorganisms from both raw industrial and domestic wastewater 6 41 the present study considered the reduction trends for both the colony forming units cfu of total coliforms e coli and faecal streptococci through mft and the gene copy numbers for lacz uida and cyd through qpcr in calculating the system s pes emphasis was given to the pe values for the entire treatment process from a inlet to b outlet as it covered the reduction trends across each of entire set a and b combined based on this the pe for total coliform was highest at tank 2 and lowest at tank 5 for e coli it was highest at tank 2 and lowest at tank 5 for faecal streptococci it was highest at tank 3 and lowest at tank 5 for lacz genes it was highest at tank 4 and lowest at tank 3 for uida gene it was highest at tank 1 and lowest at tank 3 while for cyd was it highest at tank 4 and lowest at tank 5 by considering the pe values tank 2 was the best set and the control tank 5 was the poorest set this finding not only validated the role of macrophyte in raw wastewater treatment but also proved that integrating both emergent and submerged macrophyte makes the process more efficient indeed out of the known submerged macrophyte e nuttallii and m spicatum proved to be the best candidate partners to t latifolia in achieving the highest pe in removing faecal pathogenic bacteria moreover shah et al 11 and phillippe et al 10 had recommended the use of locally adopted and available plants as the best candidates in constructed wetland technology faecal pathogenic bacterial strains exhibit different resistance to treatment efforts 42 43 the 13 strains of escherichia and 7 enterococcus strains detected in raw water untreated wastewater drastically declined in all the subsequent treatment sets indeed b tanks recorded lower numbers than a tanks in all the sets the control set tank 5 recorded higher number of both escherichia and enterococcus strains than other sets tanks e coli o157 h7 and its closest relative e coli strain tyn 130606 exhibited higher resistance to more treatment alternatives sets than all the other strains tanks 2 and 3 recorded the lowest number of escherichia strains the decline in detection of escherichia and enterococcus strains in all the treatment sets as compared to raw water and the water within the control unit tanks 5 was a prove that macrophytes additionally play a significant role in the elimination of faecal pathogenic bacterial strains from raw wastewater the faecal bacteria removal mechanisms within a wetland system inhabited by macrophytes have been documented to include natural die off owing to starvation or predation sedimentation filtration and adsorption 3 6 in most systems the removal potential by these mechanisms depend on the physical chemical and biological nature of the wetlands 5 a reduction values of e coli has been recorded at 1 7 log10 cfu 100 ml in fall spring and summer as compared to 1 0 log10 cfu 100 ml recorded in winter 44 additionally higher purification efficiencies have been recorded in horizontal subsurface flow cws than in surface flow cws and emphasis have been laid on hybrid cws that have further improved the removal of e coli total coliforms and faecal coliforms by 1 5 1 2 0 3 log10 cfu 100 ml respectively 44 indeed hybrid wetlands systems that incorporate different macrophytes varied flow regimes as well as uv radiation may be the best alternative for dealing with some of the deadliest and highly persistent forms of faecal pathogenic bacterial strains such as the e coli o157 h7 and its closest relative e coli strain tyn 130606 studies have demonstrated varying survival capabilities of different faecal bacterial pathotypes and the abundance in their respective virulence genes across a wetland ecosystem 6 26 45 ibekwe et al 2016 more markers for various e coli pathotypes and those for e faecalis and e faecium detected in raw water than in treated wastewater was indicative of potential role of macrophyte dominated wetland system in eradicating faecal pathogenic bacteria pathotypes indeed a tanks within sets 1 to 4 recorded the higher detection levels of dna markers for various e coli pathotypes and those for e faecalis and e faecium than the b tanks this was a further prove that having a system that combines emergent and submerged macrophytes ensures a proper raw wastewater purification through elimination of more virulence genes the recorded lower detection values within tanks 2 and 3 can support the decision on the most appropriate submerged macrophyte that can provide the best partner to t latifolia for higher efficiency in raw wastewater purification additionally the high purification efficiency for tanks 2 and 3 in the removal of e coli multi drug resistant genes further showed elodea nuttallii and myriophylum spicatum as the best candidates in faecal bacterial eradication based on the prevailing conditions comparing the performance of all the tanks based on their respective combined potential in the removal of faecal bacterial colony numbers functional gene copies species survival virulent and pathogenicity as well as antimicrobial resistant genes provide a prudent decision on the best macrophyte combination for efficient domestic raw wastewater treatment this integrated approach increases the reliability and accuracy in making decision for putting up and modifying any constructed wetland system because it is multi parameter based it is therefore an improvement on the single parameter based constructed wetland studies such as study on coliforms and enteric bacteria abundances by domingo and lowe 16 on resistant genes by chen et al 18 on bacterial community by wang et al 15 and on e coli abundances by ibekwe and murinda 17 in each of these studies only a single parameter aspect was considered in making the conclusion on their respective constructed wetland purification efficiencies however the present study employed the new multi parameter multi aspect purification performance evaluation approach that integrated the removal evaluation for faecal bacterial colony numbers functional gene copies species survival virulent and pathogenicity as well as antimicrobial resistant genes in determining the best winter tolerant macrophytes combination of the highest purification efficiency based on the prevailing winter condition 5 conclusion and recommendations macrophyte play a role in faecal pathogenic bacteria eradication and combination of the local emergent and submerged macrophytes species is key in achieving high pes indeed multi parameter multi aspect purification based evaluation approach provides a more reliable and conclusive decision on the best macrophyte combination in faecal bacterial elimination according to this study e nuttallii and m spicatum were the best candidate partners to t latifolia for the highest purification efficiency p 0 05 of above 97 for removal of faecal bacteria colonies and functional genes and more than 75 for removal of faecal bacterial strains pathotypes virulent as well as resistant genes however more preference should be given to the native e nuttallii as opposed to invasive m spicatum therefore the study confirmed that macrophytes play significant role in the elimination of faecal pathogenic bacterial strains and pathotypes from raw wastewater additionally ultraviolet radiation from the sun light may have played a significant role in the removal of faecal bacterial pathogens in this regard for efficient domestic raw wastewater treatment local macrophytes that are well adapted to the existing environmental and seasonal conditions should be the best candidates and the decision should emanate from a multi parameter multi aspect purification evaluation approach we also recommend further research that will investigate the possibility of integrating uv radiation into various types of constructed wastewater treatment system as well as studies to unlock the resistant mechanisms by various forms of faecal pathogenic bacteria for better control of their health related implications declaration of competing interest there is no conflict of interest between the authors and the funder acknowledgement we sincerely

14160,integrative performance evaluation of constructed wetland in removal different aspects of bacteria under specific local environmental conditions needs to be explored in detail to ensure selection of appropriate and highly efficient macrophytes candidates to achieve this integrative purification performance evaluation approach that holistically considers all the aspects of pathogenic bacterial biology colony numbers functional gene species virulent pathogenicity and resistant genes needs to be adopted rather than the commonly known unidimensional approaches that take into account a single bacterial aspect this study experimentally evaluated the individual performance of three native and one exotic winter tolerant submerged macrophytes combined with a single emergent macrophyte in eradicating faecal related bacterial species and pathotypes across horizontal surface flow constructed wetland it involved the new multi dimensional approach that integrated the faecal bacterial colony numbers functional gene copies species survival virulent and pathogenicity as well as antimicrobial resistant in constructed wetland purification evaluation the results showed elodea nuttallii and myriophyllum spicatum as the best candidate partners to typha latifolia for the highest purification efficiency p 0 05 of above 97 for removal of faecal bacteria colonies and functional genes and more than 75 for removal of faecal bacterial strains pathotypes virulent and well as resistant genes however m spicatum being a chinese native species should be much preferred to the invasive e nuttallii therefore the study recommends the application of local macrophytes such as m spicatum as the best candidates and the decision should emanate from such a multidimensional intergrative purification based evaluation approach keywords constructed wetlands faecal bacteria macrophytes pathotypes purification efficiency 1 introduction constructed wastewater wetlands have shown high capability in treating different kinds of raw wastewater 1 2 several studies have focused on the potential of constructed wetlands in the treatment of grey and black water from domestic effluents 3 paule et al 2013 marzec et al 2019 domestic raw wastewater contains various pollutants that range from organic matter nutrients to pathogenic microorganisms and these pollutants do find their way into the major water bodies 4 previously majority of studies had given much attention on organic matter and nutrients removal as opposed to pathogenic pollutants removal 3 the macrophytes role in raw wastewater purification occurs in many ways they stabilize the surface of the beds provide good conditions for physical filtration prevent vertical flow systems from clogging insulate the surface against frost during winter and provide a huge surface area for attached microbial growth 3 5 constructed wetlands with mixed macrophytes that occur in high abundances have proved to provide high removal of enteric bacteria but the treatment effect may vary among systems nature of plants and the design of the constructed wetlands 6 despite hybrid and sub surface flow constructed wetlands being the most effective in raw wastewater purification the use of surface flow constructed wetland is still preferred due to its low installation and cost of maintenance muhsin et al 2009 the complexities in wetland functionalities call for several alternative testing methodologies that could provide adequate information on precise sources movements and purification efficiencies of faecal pathogenic bacteria 7 indeed the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in raw wastewater pose a risk to public health when untreated or inappropriately treated raw wastewater is discharged into surface waters these facts represent a major hygienic concern which needs to be effectively handled 8 faecal pathogens in raw wastewater can cause waterborne illnesses such as diarrhoea typhoid fever dysentery cholera and ineffective hepatitis and the main exposure root to these illnesses is through faecal oral contamination that involves the consumption of water or food containing the illnesses causing pathogens shakoor et al 2012 a study by simachew et al 2018 identified the co occurrence of both single and multidrug resistant bacterial isolates in raw wastewater in ethiopia africa their finding indicated that significant number of antibiotic resistant bacteria were removed in vegetated broken brick and gravel bed constructed wetlands than the non vegetated gravel bed wetlands furthermore ricardo and eloy 2013 showed that constructed wetland was better than conventional raw wastewater treatment plant in the removal of bacteria and not the drug resistant genes from raw wastewater they recommended the identification and use of correct wetlands macrophytes for a better removal of the drug resistant genes by constructed wetlands wetland ecological studies have emphasized that plant species selection is the best way to further maximize pollutant removal in cws 6 9 and that native plant species of polluted sites have proved to be good candidates 10 according to shah et al 11 the application of macrophytes in municipal raw wastewater treatment under specific local environmental conditions needs to be explored in detail this is very essential because apart from their performance being comparable to conventional raw wastewater treatment plants they have low operation and management costs 6 dimuro et al 2014 georgios et al 2018 irwin et al 2018 moreover one of the tricky tasks prior to the designing of a constructed wetland treatment facility is the selection of the appropriate aquatic plant 6 12 additionally the influence of weather condition mediated environmental parameters effects on the integrity of constructed wetlands has continued to draw attention from domestic wastewater researchers practitioners and regulators 13 specifically most wetlands in china have recorded a low purification efficiency in pollutant removal during winter season due to the inability of most macrophytes to withstand the cold winter temperatures yan and xu 2014 mo et al 2017 furthermore the growth performance of most macrophytes is always hindered by the cold winter conditions making the performance of most constructed wetlands to drop during the winter seasons 13 ottor and hook 2005 marianna et al 2012 in this regard more studies are currently focusing on the utility of aquatic macrophytes for the simulated conditions to improve raw wastewater purification efficiencies based on the existing environmental conditions or seasons 3 the available information regarding the ideal combination of species to acquire close to 100 wastewater purification efficiencies in constructed wetlands is still inadequate in most regions 12 14 moreover most study designs that have focused on evaluating the purification performance of constructed wetlands in the removal of faecal pathogenic and resistant genes have only focused on individual aspects of the bacterial biology such as colony forming units 15 gene copy numbers 16 virulence and pathogenicity 17 and resistance 18 faecal indicators reductions of 1 4 log that accounts to approximately 85 purification efficiency had been recorded in echinochloa pyramidalis under horizontal surface flow constructed wetland 19 maria et al recorded pe of 90 on bulrush under surface flow constructed wetland while juncus effusus l scirpus validus l and typha latifolia l all recorded a reduction of three order of magnitude 75 purification efficiency 20 elodea nuttallii hydrilla verticillata elodea canadensis myriophullum spicatum and potamogeton crispus in wastewater polishing pond enclosures gave a purification efficiency of more than 90 in the removal of bacterial colony units 6 therefore this study evaluated the individual performances of three chinese native types of winter tolerant submerged macrophytes hydrilla verticillata myriophyllum spicatum and potamogeton crispus and one exotic species of japanese origin elodea nuttallii 21 each combined with emergent macrophyte typha latifolia in eradicating faecal related bacterial pathotypes and virulence across horizontal surface flow constructed wetlands during the winter season it employed the new multi dimensional purification performance evaluation approach that integrated the removal evaluation for faecal bacterial colony numbers functional gene copies species survival virulent and pathogenicity as well as antimicrobial resistant genes 2 methods 2 1 experimental set up the experimental set up consisted of a physical microcosm model of raw wastewater treatment plant that was constructed within the domestic wastewater experimental field station at lake dianchi between 102035ʹ to 102050ʹ e and 24040ʹ to 25000ʹ n in kunming city of yunnan province of the peoples republic of china the field station was run by the institute of hydrobiology of the chinese academy of sciences 6 this study was conducted through 6 batch experimental runs with every experimental run lasting for 18 days between the winter months of october 2016 to december 2017 the experiment was set up as illustrated in fig 1 part a it involved four pairs of experimental tanks plus additional one pair as control each pair was made of two interconnected plastic tanks with each tank measuring 1 2 m in length 0 6 m in width 0 6 m in depth the first tanks were marked a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 while the second tanks were marked b1 b2 b3 b4 and b5 respectively for pairs 1 2 3 4 and 5 in pairs 1 to 4 the a tanks were filled with substrate of mixed soil sediment silt sand and clay of fine particles 0 25 0 5 mm diameter from lake bottom with porosity values of 0 17 0 27 to 20 cm wet depth and emergent macrophyte typha latifolia tl planted into them the b tanks were filled with the same substrate to 10 cm depth and different submerged macrophytes planted into them hydrilla verticillate hv in b1 elodea nuttallii en in b2 myriophyllum spicatum ms in b3 and potamogeton crispus pc in b4 the 5th pair of tanks was used as control c with the same setting but no macrophytes planted in them fig 1 part b the plant density was 20 individuals per tank and 30 individuals per tanks respectively for submerged and emergent macrophytes the root depth was within the range of 5 to 10 cm and 10 to 15 cm respectively for submerged and emergent macrophytes the experiment was carried out after one month from the macrophyte planting time and ended before the flowering stage all the pairs had a common reservoir that supplied domestic raw wastewater into the system through a tanks to b tanks up to the 55 cm height the raw wastewater had the initial characteristics of 60 mg l 6 mg l 0 2 mg l 1 2 0 mg l 200 mg l and 6 8 mg l respectively for chemical oxygen demand cod nitrate nitrite ammonium total suspended solids and total nitrogen the flow rate of water into the a tanks was 400 ml min 3 45 107 mm day while the hydraulic retention time between the inflow points at as and out flow points at bs was approximately 2 days on average for each set of tanks the lower hydraulic retention time of 2 days was chosen based on the recommendation by maria et al 2015 which showed that the lower hydraulic retention time enables constructed wetland to exhibit the highest pollutant removal efficiency all the experimental tanks were acclimatized to raw domestic wastewater condition through flashing by the raw wastewater prior to the study 2 2 sampling and analyses for each of the experimental run sampling was done in triplicate after every six days giving a total of 18 sampling episodes during every sampling episode measurement of physico chemical parameters temperature dissolved oxygen do conductivity total dissolved solids tds salinity and ph was done in situ using ysi proodotm handheld multi parameter meter usa this was carried out in triplicate in influent and in all the a and b tanks the samples for bacterial analysis were obtained from the inflowing raw wastewater prior to its introduction into the a tanks the raw wastewater that leaves a tanks enter b tanks and raw wastewater that leaves b tanks in addition samples for bacterial analysis were also obtained from the sediment and biofilm in all the tanks the bacterial analyses involved membrane filtration technique mft polymerase chain reaction pcr real time quantitative pcr qpcr and dna sequencing to determine the abundances of total coliforms e coli and faecal streptococci strains and virulence pathotypes of dominant persistent members of enterobacteriaceae and enterococcaceae at different treatment points 2 3 determination of bacterial abundances through mft bacterial abundances across the treatment tanks was measured using membrane filtration techniques mft as outlined in american public health association apha 22 public health england phe 23 and as summarised in donde et al 24 in summary the laboratory analysis was done within 24 hours after sampling to eliminate errors in bacterial counts as a result of bacterial growth or die off there was strict adherence to aseptic techniques the abundance of coliforms and intestinal enterococci were determined using selective chromocult coliform agar merck and enterococcus selective agar sigma aldrich respectively incubation conditions were 37 c for 24 hours for coliform bacteria and 44 c for 36 hours for enterococcus bacteria 2 4 determination of bacterial abundances through pcr bacterial abundances across the treatment tanks was also achived by quantifying the functional gene copies through realtime qpcr following the procedure under quirós et al 2015 and as previously summarized in donde et al 24 this was carried out in all the samples from inflowing raw wastewater prior to its introduction into the a tanks the raw wastewater that leaves a tanks enters b tanks and raw wastewater that leaves b tanks in addition realtime qpcr was also carried out for samples obtained from the sediment and biofilm in all the tanks 2 5 macrophytes purification efficiencies purification efficiencies was determined by comparing the quality of water that enters and leaves a tanks a inlet against a outlet quality of water that enters and leaves b tanks b inlet against b outlet as well as comparing the quality of water that enter a tanks verses what leaves b tanks a inlet against b outlet 2 6 variation in escherichia and enterococcus strains across the treatment tanks the variation in the species of escherichia and streptococci across the constructed wetland treatment system was evaluated through sequencing of 16s rrna gene using primers 27f 5 gagtttgatcctggctcag 3 and 1492r 5 ggttaccttacgactt 3 the detailed procedure is previously outlined in donde et al 6 2 7 detection of escherichia and streptococci pathotypes and resistant genes detection of genes that are associated with five types of diarrheagenic e coli dec entero pathogenic e coli epec enterohemorrhagic e coli ehec enterotoxigenic e coli etec entero aggregative e coli eaec and entero invasive e coli eiec was done for the detection of e coli diarrheagenic genes two multiplex pcr assays were used together with appropriate primers for detection of enterococcus pathotypes genes associated with eterococcus faecalis and e faecasum were targeted and detected using appropriate primers all the analysis procedure used in this section are described in detail in donde et al 6 detection of antimicrobial resistant genes was performed according to the protocol described in momtaz et al 25 3 results 3 1 physico chemical parameters across the tanks the values of physico chemical parameters temperature do conductivity tds salinity and ph were as provided in table 1 there was statistical difference in temperature do and ph values between and within most of the a tanks and b tanks in pairs 1 to 4 conductivity tds and salinity did not show statistical difference between tanks 2 to 5 however temperature do and ph showed significant difference across all the tanks 3 2 bacterial abundances through mft the reduction trend in total coliform e coli and faecal streptococci values through mft were as provided in figs 2 a 2b and 2c the raw water prior to treatment had higher values than that at the semi treatment stage b inlets and the one after the full treatment b water there were statistical differences between the semi treated wastewater and the one after full treatment across all the pairs tanks 1 to 4 showed higher purification efficiencies for total coliform e coli and faecal streptococci as compared to tank 5 control 3 3 variation in bacterial abundances through qpcr across the tanks the reduction trend in median values for gene copy numbers for lacz uida and cyd through qpcr were as provided in figs 3 a 3b and 3c the median values for gene copies numbers in raw water were higher than what was in the semi treatment stage b inlets and the one after the full treatment b water in pairs 1 to 4 however the values for control tank 5 were significantly higher at the semi treatment stage 5b inlet with slightly lower values than the one in raw water lacz and cyd or higher values than the one in raw water uida the values at the semi treatment stage of tank 5 5b inlet recorded a wider range in median 25th and 75th percentile values than in all other tanks 3 4 variation in colony forming units and functional genes across the treatment tanks the purification efficiencies pe values were calculated based on the reduction trends in total coliforms e coli and faecal streptococci as well as for lacz uida and cyd genes across the treatment tanks the pe values are provided in tables 2 and 3 pe were calculated using the formula pe inlet outlet inlet 100 are provided in the pe were calculated for a tanks a nlet a outlet a inlet 100 b tanks b inlet b outlet b inlet 100 as well as for fully treated wastewater from a inlet to b outlet a inlet b outlet a inlet 100 for fully treated wastewater from a inlet to b outlet the pe for total coliform was highest at tank 2 and lowest at tank 5 for e coli was highest at tank 2 and lowest at tank 5 for faecal streptococci was highest at tank 3 and lowest at tank 5 for lacz genes was highest at tank 4 and lowest at tank 3 for uida gene was highest at tank 1 and lowest at tank 3 while for cyd was highest at tank 4 and lowest at tank 5 the average pe for the removal of viable indicator bacteria and faecal pathogenic bacterial functional genes is provided in fig 4 3 5 variation in escherichia and enterococcus strains across the treatment tanks the detection of various species of escherichia and streptococci are recorded in table 4 a total of 13 escherichia strains were detected in raw water from the source reservoir the following were the consequent total number of escherichia strains recoded at the outflows from a tanks and out flows from b tanks 7 and 3 6 and 1 5 and 1 7 and 5 12 and 9 respectively for tanks 1 2 3 4 and 5 generally low e coli species were recorded in tanks 2 and 3 than in tanks 1 4 and 5 e coli o157 h7 and its closest relative e coli strain tyn 130606 6 showed the highest resistant to the treatment process as compared to the other species across all the tanks a total of 7 enterococcus strains were detected in raw water from the source reservoir the following were the consequent total number of enterococcus strains recoded at the outflows from a tanks and outflows from b tanks 5 and 3 4 and 2 3 and 1 5 and 4 7 and 6 respectively for tanks 1 2 3 4 and 5 lowest number of enterococcus strains were recorded in tank 3 the average pe based based on the removal of escherichia and enterococcus strains across the treatment tanks is provided in fig 5 3 6 detection of escherichia pathotypes and its and antimicrobial resistant genes across the treatment tanks as highlighted in the methodology section multiplex pcr technique 6 26 27 was run to detect the presence of virulence genes associated with various e coli pathotypes and those associated with two enterococcus species there were total of 18 multiplex pcr runs that corresponded to each sampling episode as described in the sampling and analyses section the detection of gene markers for enterotoxigenic e coli etec entero aggregative e coli eaec typical and atypical enterohemorrhagic e coli ehec typical and atypical entero pathogenic e coli epec and entero invasive e coli eiec as well as those for enterococcus species are provided in table 5 and fig 6 tanks 2 and 3 recorded the lowest values of both the e coli pathotypes and enterococcus related genes the results on the purification efficiency based on the detection of resistant genes across the treatment tanks are provided in table 6 tanks 2 and 3 proved to be the most effective in the eradication of e coli related resistant genes the average pe based on the removal of e coli pathotypes enterococcus related genes and antimicrobial resistant genes across the treatment tanks is provided in figs 6 and 7 considering the purification efficiency pe in the removal of all the faecal bacterial characteristics tanks 2 and 3 further showed higher pes values which were of more than 75 for each characteristic e coli colony cfu total coliforms cfus faecal streptococci cfus e coli resistant genes escherichia and streptococci strains and e coli pathotypes fig 4 12 and the average pe across the tanks based on all the studied parameters is provided in fig 8 a and 8b 4 discussion several studies have shown significant reduction of e coli between constructed wetland influent and effluent and suggested to be due to the dynamics in the nature and quantity of nutrients competition predation by other microorganisms release of bactericidal exudates by plants as well as bacterial die off that occurs across the treatment system 3 8 the reduction of e coli was an evident of the significant removal of pathogens that may enter into the surface water from different forms and sources of raw wastewater the removal of the main pollutants from the raw wastewater would ensure clean and safe environment and reduced outbreak of water related illnesses 17 the effects of physico chemical parameters on the survival of bacteria have been extensively studied 28 changes in the physico chemical parameter values between the a tanks and b tanks for each set was more noticeable for dissolved oxygen than for all the other parameters the small general decline in do values between the a tanks and the b tanks could be due to the increase in temperatures between the a tanks and b tanks as a result of the increased ability of the sun s radiation to penetrate through the floating macrophytes as opposed to the emergent macrophyte cattail the statistical differences in temperature do and ph values between most of the a tanks and b tanks in pairs 1 to 4 could be attributed to the consequential variation in bacterial counts as earlier reported in salem et al 29 and rop et al 4 the relatively higher values of do could be as a result of aeration that was caused by the supplying water pump as well as the strong wind previous studies have shown a reduction trend in the bacterial colony counts across the constructed wetland systems a study by ibekwe and murinda had showed significant reduction in e coli populations from wetland influent to the final effluent and recommended the use of continuous flow constructed wetlands in reducing contaminants from different waste water sources 17 generally constructed wetlands were found to be more efficient than algae based systems in bacterial removal efficiencies 30 under stable environmental conditions the percentage removal efficiencies have been over 90 but no integrative efficiency evaluation has been done during the harsh season when the environmental conditions are unfavorable to the survival of most macrophytes 8 the present study showed that raw water had the highest bacterial counts for total coliforms e coli and faecal streptococci than the water that was leaving all the a and b tanks the bacterial colony forming units at the outlets of b tanks for sets 1 to 4 were all lower than that at the out let of the control set 5b the trend was replicated in the functional gene copy numbers of lacz uida and cyd through qpcr this was an evidence that macrophytes play significant role in faecal pathogenic bacteria removal and combining both the two sets of macrophytes emergent and submerged was key to achieving that however of interest to note was the lower mft values for total coliforms e coli and faecal streptococci as well as the lower qpcr values for lacz uida and cyd copies in tank 5b than the a tanks in sets 1 to 4 this raises an interesting argument where the control 5b with no macrophyte depicting some sort of faecal bacterial removal this unexpected finding could hypothetically be attributed to the role of ultraviolet radiation from the short sunny periods that occurred during the experiment and contributed in eradicating faecal bacterial pathogen the control set of tanks were open with no macrophytes hence the microbes could have been directly exposed to the ultraviolet radiation that caused their reduction in counts due to die off as had been showed in studies by donde et al 31 and alvarez et al 32 this finding leads to a suggestion that integrating uv radiation into constructed wetland technology may be fundamental in achieving the highest raw wastewater purification efficiencies in a much more sustainable manner the t latifolia has been recorded to be a better macrophyte for removal of bacterial cells from domestic wastewater with a purification efficiency of greater than 90 33 the have been high removal of epiphytic bacterial community from raw wastewater flowing across h verticillata with a removal efficiency of greater than 95 34 35 sun et al 36 showed the good ability of myriophyllum sp in the removal of nitrite oxidizing bacteria from swine raw wastewater the over 88 performance of p crispus in the removal epiphytic and other bacteria communities have also been documented 37 38 the allelopathy of e nuttallii is one of its characteristics that has made it to be greatly considered in constructed wetlands for treatment of wastewater containing pathogenic bacteria species especially cyanobacteria in epiphytic biofilms 39 40 based on this characteristic e nuttallii has achieve an efficiency of above 94 in the removal of most pathogenic microorganisms from both raw industrial and domestic wastewater 6 41 the present study considered the reduction trends for both the colony forming units cfu of total coliforms e coli and faecal streptococci through mft and the gene copy numbers for lacz uida and cyd through qpcr in calculating the system s pes emphasis was given to the pe values for the entire treatment process from a inlet to b outlet as it covered the reduction trends across each of entire set a and b combined based on this the pe for total coliform was highest at tank 2 and lowest at tank 5 for e coli it was highest at tank 2 and lowest at tank 5 for faecal streptococci it was highest at tank 3 and lowest at tank 5 for lacz genes it was highest at tank 4 and lowest at tank 3 for uida gene it was highest at tank 1 and lowest at tank 3 while for cyd was it highest at tank 4 and lowest at tank 5 by considering the pe values tank 2 was the best set and the control tank 5 was the poorest set this finding not only validated the role of macrophyte in raw wastewater treatment but also proved that integrating both emergent and submerged macrophyte makes the process more efficient indeed out of the known submerged macrophyte e nuttallii and m spicatum proved to be the best candidate partners to t latifolia in achieving the highest pe in removing faecal pathogenic bacteria moreover shah et al 11 and phillippe et al 10 had recommended the use of locally adopted and available plants as the best candidates in constructed wetland technology faecal pathogenic bacterial strains exhibit different resistance to treatment efforts 42 43 the 13 strains of escherichia and 7 enterococcus strains detected in raw water untreated wastewater drastically declined in all the subsequent treatment sets indeed b tanks recorded lower numbers than a tanks in all the sets the control set tank 5 recorded higher number of both escherichia and enterococcus strains than other sets tanks e coli o157 h7 and its closest relative e coli strain tyn 130606 exhibited higher resistance to more treatment alternatives sets than all the other strains tanks 2 and 3 recorded the lowest number of escherichia strains the decline in detection of escherichia and enterococcus strains in all the treatment sets as compared to raw water and the water within the control unit tanks 5 was a prove that macrophytes additionally play a significant role in the elimination of faecal pathogenic bacterial strains from raw wastewater the faecal bacteria removal mechanisms within a wetland system inhabited by macrophytes have been documented to include natural die off owing to starvation or predation sedimentation filtration and adsorption 3 6 in most systems the removal potential by these mechanisms depend on the physical chemical and biological nature of the wetlands 5 a reduction values of e coli has been recorded at 1 7 log10 cfu 100 ml in fall spring and summer as compared to 1 0 log10 cfu 100 ml recorded in winter 44 additionally higher purification efficiencies have been recorded in horizontal subsurface flow cws than in surface flow cws and emphasis have been laid on hybrid cws that have further improved the removal of e coli total coliforms and faecal coliforms by 1 5 1 2 0 3 log10 cfu 100 ml respectively 44 indeed hybrid wetlands systems that incorporate different macrophytes varied flow regimes as well as uv radiation may be the best alternative for dealing with some of the deadliest and highly persistent forms of faecal pathogenic bacterial strains such as the e coli o157 h7 and its closest relative e coli strain tyn 130606 studies have demonstrated varying survival capabilities of different faecal bacterial pathotypes and the abundance in their respective virulence genes across a wetland ecosystem 6 26 45 ibekwe et al 2016 more markers for various e coli pathotypes and those for e faecalis and e faecium detected in raw water than in treated wastewater was indicative of potential role of macrophyte dominated wetland system in eradicating faecal pathogenic bacteria pathotypes indeed a tanks within sets 1 to 4 recorded the higher detection levels of dna markers for various e coli pathotypes and those for e faecalis and e faecium than the b tanks this was a further prove that having a system that combines emergent and submerged macrophytes ensures a proper raw wastewater purification through elimination of more virulence genes the recorded lower detection values within tanks 2 and 3 can support the decision on the most appropriate submerged macrophyte that can provide the best partner to t latifolia for higher efficiency in raw wastewater purification additionally the high purification efficiency for tanks 2 and 3 in the removal of e coli multi drug resistant genes further showed elodea nuttallii and myriophylum spicatum as the best candidates in faecal bacterial eradication based on the prevailing conditions comparing the performance of all the tanks based on their respective combined potential in the removal of faecal bacterial colony numbers functional gene copies species survival virulent and pathogenicity as well as antimicrobial resistant genes provide a prudent decision on the best macrophyte combination for efficient domestic raw wastewater treatment this integrated approach increases the reliability and accuracy in making decision for putting up and modifying any constructed wetland system because it is multi parameter based it is therefore an improvement on the single parameter based constructed wetland studies such as study on coliforms and enteric bacteria abundances by domingo and lowe 16 on resistant genes by chen et al 18 on bacterial community by wang et al 15 and on e coli abundances by ibekwe and murinda 17 in each of these studies only a single parameter aspect was considered in making the conclusion on their respective constructed wetland purification efficiencies however the present study employed the new multi parameter multi aspect purification performance evaluation approach that integrated the removal evaluation for faecal bacterial colony numbers functional gene copies species survival virulent and pathogenicity as well as antimicrobial resistant genes in determining the best winter tolerant macrophytes combination of the highest purification efficiency based on the prevailing winter condition 5 conclusion and recommendations macrophyte play a role in faecal pathogenic bacteria eradication and combination of the local emergent and submerged macrophytes species is key in achieving high pes indeed multi parameter multi aspect purification based evaluation approach provides a more reliable and conclusive decision on the best macrophyte combination in faecal bacterial elimination according to this study e nuttallii and m spicatum were the best candidate partners to t latifolia for the highest purification efficiency p 0 05 of above 97 for removal of faecal bacteria colonies and functional genes and more than 75 for removal of faecal bacterial strains pathotypes virulent as well as resistant genes however more preference should be given to the native e nuttallii as opposed to invasive m spicatum therefore the study confirmed that macrophytes play significant role in the elimination of faecal pathogenic bacterial strains and pathotypes from raw wastewater additionally ultraviolet radiation from the sun light may have played a significant role in the removal of faecal bacterial pathogens in this regard for efficient domestic raw wastewater treatment local macrophytes that are well adapted to the existing environmental and seasonal conditions should be the best candidates and the decision should emanate from a multi parameter multi aspect purification evaluation approach we also recommend further research that will investigate the possibility of integrating uv radiation into various types of constructed wastewater treatment system as well as studies to unlock the resistant mechanisms by various forms of faecal pathogenic bacteria for better control of their health related implications declaration of competing interest there is no conflict of interest between the authors and the funder acknowledgement we sincerely

14161,developing countries have vast areas and large population groups where access to electricity and safe drinking water is still limited or inexistent in mexico 1 1 million people do not have access to electricity while more than 3 million people lack access to clean water however mexico presents one of the best locations to exploit solar sources therefore off grid photovoltaic pv systems and solar water disinfection sodis are two promising options to develop rural electrification and to improve the coverage of drinking water access in this regard the technology proposed consists of a hybrid photovoltaic and solar disinfection system solwat that comprises a photovoltaic module and a water disinfection reactor fully integrated into a single unit its effectiveness was tested for the first time in a rural community of oaxaca mexico on the basis of natural climatic conditions and available drinking water sources main results showed that despite the meteorological conditions were not the most favourable the strong solar irradiation conditions of mexico allowed complete inactivation of e coli and total coliforms after 3 h of sun exposure furthermore although the solwat pv module presented a decrease in isc the refrigeration effect of the water being purified on top of the pv cells compensated this loss in conclusion the present work confirms the feasibility of the solwat system to contribute to mitigate the lack of access to safe drinking water and energy in developing countries since under real operation conditions it was able to simultaneously produce clean water and electricity keywords solwat field case study photovoltaic drinking water sodis 1 introduction the lack of safe drinking water and electricity supply is one of the main challenging problems of the 21th century some developing countries have large population groups without electricity distribution grids sometimes due to its remote location and low population density in the case of mexico with 190 000 settlements with less than 5000 inhabitants a total of 1 1 million people most of them located in indigenous and rural communities have no access to electricity 1 furthermore more than 3 million people lack access to safe drinking water sources in mexico and although it is estimated that 21 7 million rural inhabitants of this country have access to improved drinking water sources 2 the qualified as improved sources under the international monitoring criteria protected wells and springs public taps household connection rainwater harvesting are not necessarily safe hence the population without access to a real safe drinking water source is likely to be significant higher than the estimated despite there are numerous methods to make water drinkable such as chlorination ozonation uv lamps filtration etc they present drawbacks difficult to overcome in developing countries dependence on chemicals difficult or expensive to obtain lack of electricity supply high cost of infrastructures and maintenance lack of trained operators or the social rejection of water after treatment because its unsatisfactory taste and odour 3 most of the regions in need of electricity and clean water are located between latitudes 35 n and 35 s fig 1 where high irradiance conditions make solar radiation an appropriate method for water disinfection solar water disinfection is a world health organization who approved point of use water treatment technique 4 sodis makes use of the bactericidal effect of solar radiation to reduce the faecal microbial load of water it is simple and inexpensive does not requires heavy maintenance tasks neither chemicals nor electricity supply the conventional method consists of placing plastic bottles typically polyethylene terephthalate pet under the sun for at least 6 h 5 and its effectiveness to contribute to mitigate the incidence of waterborne diseases has been widely demonstrated 6 10 reporting a range of 16 57 reduction of the incidence of diarrhoea including cholera in the communities adopting this practise 11 sodis is currently daily used by 4 5 million people in 50 countries 11 13 nevertheless one disadvantage offered by potential users is the small amount of treated water provided by the plastic bottles the conventional sodis reactor generally bottles have volumes of 0 5 2 l of capacity other limitation is the long time needed to treat water sodis guidelines recommend 6 h of sun exposure in sunny days and two days if cloudy 5 another disadvantage refers to the tasks associated with sodis compliance that implies behaviours changes in the final user user must organize bottles wash and fill them with water put them into the sun and collect the water afterwards 13 moreover sunlight can transform the plastic material of bottles into photoproducts than can migrate from the containers into water this constitutes a significant barrier for the increase usage of sodis despite photodegradation products or other harmful substances have not been detected in concentrations above the limit set for drinking water quality 14 16 oaxaca a federative community located in the south of mexico presents the lowest levels of progress in terms of electricity and water access of the country with the highest rates of housing occupants without electric power 2 87 and piped water 13 05 1 however mexico has one of the best locations to exploit solar sources as it can be observed in fig 1 mexico is completely within latitudes 35 n to 35 s one of the most favourable belts that lies for solar technologies applications with solar radiation levels of approximately 5 35 kw h m2 17 therefore mini grid or stand alone photovoltaic systems and solar water disinfection are two promising options both exclusively based on solar energy usage to develop rural electrification and to improve the coverage of safe drinking water access in this regard the technology proposed based on the exclusive utilization of solar radiation consists of an autonomous hybrid photovoltaic and solar water disinfection system solwat which comprises two devices a pv module and a water disinfection reactor fully integrated into a single unit which uses the solar spectrum more efficiently visible near infrared for photovoltaic electricity generation and far infrared uv for solar thermal and uv water disinfection and that has the capability of providing renewable energy and safe drinking water simultaneously the solwat system is up scalable so its size could be modified according to the needs the final amount of treated water and energy of the place where it will be installed it is a safer system in relation to plastic bottles since it is made by inert materials that do not alter the chemical quality of the water it could be automatized minimizing water handling by the final user thus reducing the tasks associated with conventional sodis and decreasing the risk of contamination of treated water in addition the solwat system provides other benefits such as the no dependence on chemicals and electricity supply the use and generation of renewable energy plus the compact and long lasting characteristics with a simple and low cost design the feasibility of this technology has been demonstrated in previous works 18 19 which show that the solwat system integrates the functions of solar water disinfection and photovoltaic electricity generation these studies also showed that the solwat disinfection results are always higher than the conventional sodis reactor pet bottle for all the faecal indicator analysed e coli total coliforms enterococcus spp and clostridium perfringens and regardless of the uv and temperature conditions pichel et al 2018 20 have also demonstrated that under strong climate conditions these faecal indicators are completely inactivated after 3 h of solar treatment reducing by half the treatment time recommended for conventional sodis reactors 6 h in addition the cited works show that the pv module integrated into solwat does not lead to major losses caused by the reduced solar irradiation received lower current i as such losses are compensated by the cooling effect of the water layer being purified on top of the module higher voltage v which is maximum at the beginning of the treatment process despite previous works allow to better understand the behaviour of the solwat technology which was tested simulating as far as possible real operation conditions natural water source containing wild bacteria strains natural solar radiation and no controlled temperature its performance has not yet been assessed on field as a feasible drinking water and electricity point of use system at household level in rural and or remote communities of developing countries so the aim of the present work is to assess for the first time the effectiveness of the new hybrid technology solwat on field on the basis of natural climatic conditions uv levels and ambient temperature and available local water sources in order to determine its feasibility under realistic operation conditions to contribute to palliate the situation of a population living under vulnerable conditions 2 materials and methods the first field assessment of the solwat technology was jointly conducted in the mexican state of oaxaca by the university of jaén spain the imdea water institute spain and the benito juarez autonomous university mexico in june 2017 the mexican team is currently working in different indigenous communities of oaxaca to improve their access to clean water while promoting autonomous management they are in continuous communication with the communities which allowed the spanish team to work in one of them having access to the drinking water sources available at household level and also to the main water source feeding some of the houses at the neighbourhood the spanish team travelled to oaxaca to carried out the experimentation providing the solwat technology and also the meteorological and electrical measurement equipment and reagents and material for the microbiological analysis of water the field work started with the identification and analysis of the main water sources available at the rural community then one of these sources presenting faecal contamination was selected and sampled again to assess the solwat feasibility under real operation conditions fig 2 shows a sectional view of the experimental set up 2 1 study location the experiment was performed in the indigenous community of santa rosa buenavista located in the region of valles centrales fig 3 the santa rosa buenavista neighbourhood was selected as a pilot rural community where the solwat system could be implemented so the work there developed was based on the identification sampling and characterisation of the main local water resources along with the effectiveness assessment of the solwat technology on the basis of natural climatic conditions 2 2 water sources many people in developing countries rely upon untreated groundwater supplies for their drinking water such sources usually have better quality than some traditional sources of supply as ponds and rivers however the lack of adequate sanitation facilities causes the infiltration of pathogenic bacteria into the surrounding groundwaters through soil media causing a health risk for the population consuming well water 21 for this reason main water resources available at the rural community of santa rosa buenavista were first identified and then analysed these sources were based on groundwater wells which were divided into three groups irrigation wells private wells for domestic use and the community well a total of four wells were studied the community well feeding the neighbourhood fig 4 a one of the wells used for irrigation fig 4b and two of the private wells that some neighbours have in their properties fig 4c d samples from each well were subjected under a

technology was conducted in summer in oaxaca mexico under partially cloudy conditions for 3 h of sun exposure using water from a real source daily used by a family containing environmental bacteria strains of e coli and other coliforms fig 8 shows the climatic conditions during the 3 h of sun exposure including the variations of global irradiance and uv irradiance average global irradiance levels were of 760 w m2 and average uv levels were of 43 w m2 the cumulative uv radiation received during the experimental time was of 129 wh m2 464 kj m2 ambient temperature reached a maximum of 30 3 c with an average value of 27 4 c 3 1 disinfection results from the faecal microbiological indicators studied initially detected in raw water with a concentration of 24 9 cfu 100 ml for e coli and in the order of 105 103 cfu 100 ml for total coliforms results show that complete inactivation was reached after 3 h of sun exposure using the solwat technology thus water could be considered safe to drink according to the who 24 water temperature within the hybrid system reached values above 45 c for more than 1 5 h with a maximum of 49 9 c fig 9 exceeding maximum ambient temperature in 19 6 c since this study constitutes the first evaluation of the solwat technology on field the results here obtained were compared with previous works assessing the suitability of solar disinfection in developing countries under real operation conditions natural water sources natural sunlight and no controlled temperature and also with our previous works testing the solwat technology in madrid spain using natural river water with wild bacteria strains natural sunlight and no controlled temperature in this regard oates et al 26 tested in haiti the feasibility of 1 5 l pet bottles painted half black to purify water from natural sources spring water tap water and an irrigation stream assessing the presence or absence of e coli and total coliforms pet bottles were exposed to the sun for different period of time and under different climatic conditions no microbial inactivation was reached under 718 w m2 and water temperatures above 45 c for 2 h only when irradiance was about 752 w m2 and with water temperature above 45 c for more than 5 h total disinfection was achieved in another work martín dominguez et al 27 carried out sodis pet bottles tests using water from a medical clinic well in mexico and wild strains of total coliforms as faecal indicator water was exposed for a total of 8 h to sunlight always reaching complete inactivation with initial bacteria concentrations of 2400 5200 3100 3700 270 900 nmp 100 ml and with corresponding average global irradiance levels of 650 690 727 776 805 and 831 w m2 mustafa et al 28 conducted pet bottles tests monitoring coliform bacteria in water from the public supply of two localities of pakistan in this work different reactor configurations were used absorptive black painted reflective aluminium foil back and transmissive just the bottle different climatic conditions were also evaluated weak radiation levels between 200 480 w m2 moderate 480 700 w m2 and strong 700 900 w m2 water with an initial concentration of 830 cfu 100 ml was exposed to natural sunlight for 8 h and total inactivation was only achieved at the absorptive reactor under strong climatic conditions and with 50 c of water temperature under the same conditions transmissive pet bottle only reached 41 c not achieving complete bacteria inactivation harvested rainwater was also subjected under sodis treatment over the span of a year in south eastern uganda by nalwanga et al 29 fifty households using roof harvested rainwater tanks were selected and trained in the solar disinfection treatment method 2 l pet bottles were exposed for a minimum of 6 h in sunny days and for two days if cloudy analysing e coli faecal enterococci and clostridium perfringens solar treatment was demonstrated to be effective in all seasons for e coli however total inactivation was not always reached in our experiment complete inactivation of e coli and total coliforms was achieved after 3 h under global irradiance levels of 760 w m2 and water temperatures above 45 c for 1 h 40 min while under similar conditions 752 w m2 and water temperature above 45 c 5 h were required to achieve the same results using pet bottles 26 in addition treatment times of 6 h 8 h or even 2 days if cloudy were reported 26 29 the solwat technology allowed obtaining potable drinking water after 3 h of treatment despite the experiment was carried out under partially cloudy conditions this result is also aligned with pichel et al 20 work who showed that under strong climatic conditions average global irradiance of 850 w m2 average uv levels of 45 w m2 and water temperatures above 45 c the solwat technology could reduce by half the treatment time recommended for conventional sodis reactors 6 h 5 water temperature plays a crucial role in the solar disinfection treatment process specially when using natural water sources containing a mixture of nutrients and wild bacteria strains as it occurs in field studies it was suggested that water temperature trigger both synergetic and antagonistic effects on the sodis treatment process 30 32 for the case of mesophiles such as e coli and total coliforms growth peak rate 30 6 42 1 c water temperatures within their optimal of growth 30 c 45 c hamper the disinfection process since bacteria growth has an antagonistic effect on the uv disinfection conversely temperatures above 45 c accelerate the sodis process since uv radiation and water temperature work in synergy the solwat system easily reached the 45 c water temperature threshold that accelerate the solar disinfection process favouring the synergy between uv and temperature and thus improving bacteria inactivation however water temperatures within plastic bottles rarely reached this threshold usually working at mild temperatures 30 c 45 c which slow down the process in this regard some of the studies presented modified the external configuration of bottles to increase the radiation received reflective surfaces and or to raise the water temperature 26 28 e g mustafa et al 28 showed like a plastic bottle without any modification achieved less disinfection results than a modified one these results are also in agreement with our previous works 18 20 where the solwat and pet bottles performance was compared at real time conditions experiments were conducted in madrid spain using natural river water with wild strains of escherichia coli total coliforms enterococcus spp and clostridium perfringens water was exposed to natural sunlight for 6 h results showed that the solwat system always presented higher disinfection efficiencies than the pet bottle for all the microbiological indicator analysed and regardless of the uv and temperature conditions 18 19 in addition under the same condition the solwat disinfection reactor worked about 10 c above the temperature of the bottle these differences in effectiveness between solwat and pet bottles received irradiance and reached water temperature which could be mainly attributed to their different structural characteristics flat vs cylindrical borosilicate vs pet and 18 mm vs 85 mm of water height could determine that complete bacteria inactivation was reached or not resulting in safe unsafe drinking water 3 2 electrical results as to the photovoltaic performance under operation conditions the solwat energy output is affected by the water purification reactor water being purified and borosilicate glass located above the pv module due to absorption and dispersion effects of sunlight that resulted in a reduction of isc thus the pv module integrated into the hybrid system received about 9 less solar radiation than at standard test conditions 0 30 a at stc vs 0 23 a under operation conditions attending the isc values however the water being purified on top has a refrigerated effect on the pv solar cells with an average working temperature of 46 c improving their power generation efficiency and thus compensating the reduction of the sunlight received these results are in accordance with pichel et al 18 20 who reported that the photovoltaic module integrated into the hybrid system received from 5 to 7 less solar radiation in terms of isc than at standard test conditions without the water purification reactor on top of the pv panel however these losses in received irradiance were neutralized by the cooling effect of the water being purified which allowed the pv cells to work about 9 c below than a single pv module as result of this compensating effect both solwat and single pv modules generate the same energy after 6 h of sun exposure in our findings 9 less solar radiation in terms of isc was received by the solwat photovoltaic module which worked at 46 c on average 4 conclusions the hybrid solwat system integrating the functions of photovoltaic energy generation and solar water disinfection was tested for the first time on field specifically in oaxaca mexico under local climatic conditions and available water sources for demonstrating its feasibility to simultaneously produce clean water and electricity under real operation conditions main results show that after 3 h of sun exposure e coli and total coliforms achieved complete inactivation under high uv levels and water temperatures above 45 c for more than half of the experiment so although the day was partially cloudy the strong solar irradiation conditions of mexico favoured that complete disinfection of the faecal indicators used was reached in 3 h reducing by half the treatment time recommended for conventional sodis reactors 6 h when using this new hybrid technology furthermore although the solwat pv module presented a decrease in isc the cooling effect of the water being purified on top of the pv solar cells compensated the light transmittance losses affecting the isc caused by the water disinfection reactor located above the pv module in conclusion the present work confirms the feasibility of the solwat system to contribute to mitigate the lack of access to safe drinking water and electricity in developing countries this new technology working under realistic operation conditions natural water sources wild bacteria strains natural sunlight and no controlled temperature was able to simultaneously produce clean water and electricity reducing by half the treatment time required for conventional reactors 6 h even in a partially

14161,developing countries have vast areas and large population groups where access to electricity and safe drinking water is still limited or inexistent in mexico 1 1 million people do not have access to electricity while more than 3 million people lack access to clean water however mexico presents one of the best locations to exploit solar sources therefore off grid photovoltaic pv systems and solar water disinfection sodis are two promising options to develop rural electrification and to improve the coverage of drinking water access in this regard the technology proposed consists of a hybrid photovoltaic and solar disinfection system solwat that comprises a photovoltaic module and a water disinfection reactor fully integrated into a single unit its effectiveness was tested for the first time in a rural community of oaxaca mexico on the basis of natural climatic conditions and available drinking water sources main results showed that despite the meteorological conditions were not the most favourable the strong solar irradiation conditions of mexico allowed complete inactivation of e coli and total coliforms after 3 h of sun exposure furthermore although the solwat pv module presented a decrease in isc the refrigeration effect of the water being purified on top of the pv cells compensated this loss in conclusion the present work confirms the feasibility of the solwat system to contribute to mitigate the lack of access to safe drinking water and energy in developing countries since under real operation conditions it was able to simultaneously produce clean water and electricity keywords solwat field case study photovoltaic drinking water sodis 1 introduction the lack of safe drinking water and electricity supply is one of the main challenging problems of the 21th century some developing countries have large population groups without electricity distribution grids sometimes due to its remote location and low population density in the case of mexico with 190 000 settlements with less than 5000 inhabitants a total of 1 1 million people most of them located in indigenous and rural communities have no access to electricity 1 furthermore more than 3 million people lack access to safe drinking water sources in mexico and although it is estimated that 21 7 million rural inhabitants of this country have access to improved drinking water sources 2 the qualified as improved sources under the international monitoring criteria protected wells and springs public taps household connection rainwater harvesting are not necessarily safe hence the population without access to a real safe drinking water source is likely to be significant higher than the estimated despite there are numerous methods to make water drinkable such as chlorination ozonation uv lamps filtration etc they present drawbacks difficult to overcome in developing countries dependence on chemicals difficult or expensive to obtain lack of electricity supply high cost of infrastructures and maintenance lack of trained operators or the social rejection of water after treatment because its unsatisfactory taste and odour 3 most of the regions in need of electricity and clean water are located between latitudes 35 n and 35 s fig 1 where high irradiance conditions make solar radiation an appropriate method for water disinfection solar water disinfection is a world health organization who approved point of use water treatment technique 4 sodis makes use of the bactericidal effect of solar radiation to reduce the faecal microbial load of water it is simple and inexpensive does not requires heavy maintenance tasks neither chemicals nor electricity supply the conventional method consists of placing plastic bottles typically polyethylene terephthalate pet under the sun for at least 6 h 5 and its effectiveness to contribute to mitigate the incidence of waterborne diseases has been widely demonstrated 6 10 reporting a range of 16 57 reduction of the incidence of diarrhoea including cholera in the communities adopting this practise 11 sodis is currently daily used by 4 5 million people in 50 countries 11 13 nevertheless one disadvantage offered by potential users is the small amount of treated water provided by the plastic bottles the conventional sodis reactor generally bottles have volumes of 0 5 2 l of capacity other limitation is the long time needed to treat water sodis guidelines recommend 6 h of sun exposure in sunny days and two days if cloudy 5 another disadvantage refers to the tasks associated with sodis compliance that implies behaviours changes in the final user user must organize bottles wash and fill them with water put them into the sun and collect the water afterwards 13 moreover sunlight can transform the plastic material of bottles into photoproducts than can migrate from the containers into water this constitutes a significant barrier for the increase usage of sodis despite photodegradation products or other harmful substances have not been detected in concentrations above the limit set for drinking water quality 14 16 oaxaca a federative community located in the south of mexico presents the lowest levels of progress in terms of electricity and water access of the country with the highest rates of housing occupants without electric power 2 87 and piped water 13 05 1 however mexico has one of the best locations to exploit solar sources as it can be observed in fig 1 mexico is completely within latitudes 35 n to 35 s one of the most favourable belts that lies for solar technologies applications with solar radiation levels of approximately 5 35 kw h m2 17 therefore mini grid or stand alone photovoltaic systems and solar water disinfection are two promising options both exclusively based on solar energy usage to develop rural electrification and to improve the coverage of safe drinking water access in this regard the technology proposed based on the exclusive utilization of solar radiation consists of an autonomous hybrid photovoltaic and solar water disinfection system solwat which comprises two devices a pv module and a water disinfection reactor fully integrated into a single unit which uses the solar spectrum more efficiently visible near infrared for photovoltaic electricity generation and far infrared uv for solar thermal and uv water disinfection and that has the capability of providing renewable energy and safe drinking water simultaneously the solwat system is up scalable so its size could be modified according to the needs the final amount of treated water and energy of the place where it will be installed it is a safer system in relation to plastic bottles since it is made by inert materials that do not alter the chemical quality of the water it could be automatized minimizing water handling by the final user thus reducing the tasks associated with conventional sodis and decreasing the risk of contamination of treated water in addition the solwat system provides other benefits such as the no dependence on chemicals and electricity supply the use and generation of renewable energy plus the compact and long lasting characteristics with a simple and low cost design the feasibility of this technology has been demonstrated in previous works 18 19 which show that the solwat system integrates the functions of solar water disinfection and photovoltaic electricity generation these studies also showed that the solwat disinfection results are always higher than the conventional sodis reactor pet bottle for all the faecal indicator analysed e coli total coliforms enterococcus spp and clostridium perfringens and regardless of the uv and temperature conditions pichel et al 2018 20 have also demonstrated that under strong climate conditions these faecal indicators are completely inactivated after 3 h of solar treatment reducing by half the treatment time recommended for conventional sodis reactors 6 h in addition the cited works show that the pv module integrated into solwat does not lead to major losses caused by the reduced solar irradiation received lower current i as such losses are compensated by the cooling effect of the water layer being purified on top of the module higher voltage v which is maximum at the beginning of the treatment process despite previous works allow to better understand the behaviour of the solwat technology which was tested simulating as far as possible real operation conditions natural water source containing wild bacteria strains natural solar radiation and no controlled temperature its performance has not yet been assessed on field as a feasible drinking water and electricity point of use system at household level in rural and or remote communities of developing countries so the aim of the present work is to assess for the first time the effectiveness of the new hybrid technology solwat on field on the basis of natural climatic conditions uv levels and ambient temperature and available local water sources in order to determine its feasibility under realistic operation conditions to contribute to palliate the situation of a population living under vulnerable conditions 2 materials and methods the first field assessment of the solwat technology was jointly conducted in the mexican state of oaxaca by the university of jaén spain the imdea water institute spain and the benito juarez autonomous university mexico in june 2017 the mexican team is currently working in different indigenous communities of oaxaca to improve their access to clean water while promoting autonomous management they are in continuous communication with the communities which allowed the spanish team to work in one of them having access to the drinking water sources available at household level and also to the main water source feeding some of the houses at the neighbourhood the spanish team travelled to oaxaca to carried out the experimentation providing the solwat technology and also the meteorological and electrical measurement equipment and reagents and material for the microbiological analysis of water the field work started with the identification and analysis of the main water sources available at the rural community then one of these sources presenting faecal contamination was selected and sampled again to assess the solwat feasibility under

in sunny days and for two days if cloudy analysing e coli faecal enterococci and clostridium perfringens solar treatment was demonstrated to be effective in all seasons for e coli however total inactivation was not always reached in our experiment complete inactivation of e coli and total coliforms was achieved after 3 h under global irradiance levels of 760 w m2 and water temperatures above 45 c for 1 h 40 min while under similar conditions 752 w m2 and water temperature above 45 c 5 h were required to achieve the same results using pet bottles 26 in addition treatment times of 6 h 8 h or even 2 days if cloudy were reported 26 29 the solwat technology allowed obtaining potable drinking water after 3 h of treatment despite the experiment was carried out under partially cloudy conditions this result is also aligned with pichel et al 20 work who showed that under strong climatic conditions average global irradiance of 850 w m2 average uv levels of 45 w m2 and water temperatures above 45 c the solwat technology could reduce by half the treatment time recommended for conventional sodis reactors 6 h 5 water temperature plays a crucial role in the solar disinfection treatment process specially when using natural water sources containing a mixture of nutrients and wild bacteria strains as it occurs in field studies it was suggested that water temperature trigger both synergetic and antagonistic effects on the sodis treatment process 30 32 for the case of mesophiles such as e coli and total coliforms growth peak rate 30 6 42 1 c water temperatures within their optimal of growth 30 c 45 c hamper the disinfection process since bacteria growth has an antagonistic effect on the uv disinfection conversely temperatures above 45 c accelerate the sodis process since uv radiation and water temperature work in synergy the solwat system easily reached the 45 c water temperature threshold that accelerate the solar disinfection process favouring the synergy between uv and temperature and thus improving bacteria inactivation however water temperatures within plastic bottles rarely reached this threshold usually working at mild temperatures 30 c 45 c which slow down the process in this regard some of the studies presented modified the external configuration of bottles to increase the radiation received reflective surfaces and or to raise the water temperature 26 28 e g mustafa et al 28 showed like a plastic bottle without any modification achieved less disinfection results than a modified one these results are also in agreement with our previous works 18 20 where the solwat and pet bottles performance was compared at real time conditions experiments were conducted in madrid spain using natural river water with wild strains of escherichia coli total coliforms enterococcus spp and clostridium perfringens water was exposed to natural sunlight for 6 h results showed that the solwat system always presented higher disinfection efficiencies than the pet bottle for all the microbiological indicator analysed and regardless of the uv and temperature conditions 18 19 in addition under the same condition the solwat disinfection reactor worked about 10 c above the temperature of the bottle these differences in effectiveness between solwat and pet bottles received irradiance and reached water temperature which could be mainly attributed to their different structural characteristics flat vs cylindrical borosilicate vs pet and 18 mm vs 85 mm of water height could determine that complete bacteria inactivation was reached or not resulting in safe unsafe drinking water 3 2 electrical results as to the photovoltaic performance under operation conditions the solwat energy output is affected by the water purification reactor water being purified and borosilicate glass located above the pv module due to absorption and dispersion effects of sunlight that resulted in a reduction of isc thus the pv module integrated into the hybrid system received about 9 less solar radiation than at standard test conditions 0 30 a at stc vs 0 23 a under operation conditions attending the isc values however the water being purified on top has a refrigerated effect on the pv solar cells with an average working temperature of 46 c improving their power generation efficiency and thus compensating the reduction of the sunlight received these results are in accordance with pichel et al 18 20 who reported that the photovoltaic module integrated into the hybrid system received from 5 to 7 less solar radiation in terms of isc than at standard test conditions without the water purification reactor on top of the pv panel however these losses in received irradiance were neutralized by the cooling effect of the water being purified which allowed the pv cells to work about 9 c below than a single pv module as result of this compensating effect both solwat and single pv modules generate the same energy after 6 h of sun exposure in our findings 9 less solar radiation in terms of isc was received by the solwat photovoltaic module which worked at 46 c on average 4 conclusions the hybrid solwat system integrating the functions of photovoltaic energy generation and solar water disinfection was tested for the first time on field specifically in oaxaca mexico under local climatic conditions and available water sources for demonstrating its feasibility to simultaneously produce clean water and electricity under real operation conditions main results show that after 3 h of sun exposure e coli and total coliforms achieved complete inactivation under high uv levels and water temperatures above 45 c for more than half of the experiment so although the day was partially cloudy the strong solar irradiation conditions of mexico favoured that complete disinfection of the faecal indicators used was reached in 3 h reducing by half the treatment time recommended for conventional sodis reactors 6 h when using this new hybrid technology furthermore although the solwat pv module presented a decrease in isc the cooling effect of the water being purified on top of the pv solar cells compensated the light transmittance losses affecting the isc caused by the water disinfection reactor located above the pv module in conclusion the present work confirms the feasibility of the solwat system to contribute to mitigate the lack of access to safe drinking water and electricity in developing countries this new technology working under realistic operation conditions natural water sources wild bacteria strains natural sunlight and no controlled temperature was able to simultaneously produce clean water and electricity reducing by half the treatment time required for conventional reactors 6 h even in a partially

relationship qsar qspr by mm system behavior including kinetics and occurring chemical phenomena were described along with simultaneous determination of empirical parameters which were correlated with the structural characteristics of parent cecs using qsar qspr modeling both modeling schemes yielded accurate prediction of chosen end points hence photooxidative degradation of cecs according to

empirical parameters describing degradation kinetics of cec by products are in accordance with preferable degradation mechanism h abstraction and electron transfer by hydroxyl and sulphate radicals respectively other two empirical parameters describing the ratio of slow and fast mineralizing byproducts were found to be dependent on features of parent cec s e g compact linear structure and molecule symmetry keywords contaminants of emerging concern photooxidative water treatment hydroxyl radical sulfate radical structural relationship mechanistic modeling 1 introduction the global occurrence of organic and inorganic contaminants in water resources has raised concern about their potential negative effect on environment and human health 1 therefore many directives and protocols have been adapted during last 20 years eu introduced in 2000 list of priority substances to control the chemical quality of water list has been reevaluated and updated over the time 2 4 besides the eu directive and priority substances and pertaining watch list there are a lot of other artificial products that are classified as potential contaminants of emerging concern cecs 51 5 wastewater treatment plants wwtp are not designed to remove cecs thus the requirements for more effective methods are set 6 among destructive methods photooxidative processes using uv c irradiation in combination with strong oxidants such as h2o2 and or s2o82 were showed to be quite efficient for the degradation of recalcitrant organics like pesticides and pharmaceuticals 6 9 10 however the knowledge of system behavior optimal conditions removal rates with the most common reactive species generated by aops hydroxyl ho and sulfate so4 radicals degradation pathways and related altering of water quality parameters particularly for newly introduced cecs are still scarce 11 15 namely during the degradation process process conditions alter regarding the formation depletion of intermediates and present oxidants 16 18 usually the chemistry of such complex matrices are described by mathematical mechanistic mm modeling 16 these phenomenological approaches used in mm modeling allows capturing the relevant interactions within the system generation of different chemical species either atomic radical ionic or molecular during the degradation of parent pollutant e g cecs and interaction through chemical mechanism can be described by chemical reactions taking into account the complexicity of mms including the chemistry of detailed degradation mechanism of parent pollutant s and formed intermediates empirical parameters corresponding to the rate of degradation of cecs byproducts and distinguishing fast and slow mineralizing byproducts may by applied in order to simplify model matrix keeping the high predictivity 19 empirical parameters are assumed to be depended on the structure of parent pollutant thus they can be determined using structural relationship modeling 20 recently structural relationship modeling more precisely quantitative structure activity property relationship qsar qspr modeling approaches were successfully applied to predict different end points for a wide range of organic compounds treated by aops e g toxicity biodegradability physical and chemical properties including reaction rates 6 7 15 21 23 in such manner the important knowledge on system behavior of specific reactions within aops treatment is accumulated the objective of this study was to develop a flexible model providing a relationship between process parameters empirical parameters of mm models and the structural characteristics of present cecs this is accomplished by combining mm and qspr modeling and introducing the generalized parameters elucidating degradation kinetics of cecs byproducts and distinguishing fast and slow mineralizing byproducts all in order to overcome the complexity of degradation schemes for each cec and increase the robustness of applied

predicting system behavior of photooxidative processes are semi empirical schematics and flowchart of the models were given in the fig 1 the influence of reactions and their rates on model performance was evaluated with the purpose to simplify mm modeling by the reduction of number of species and reactions according to their significance 32 following system degradation process simplifications were

overall in mm there are only 20 reactions and 19 chemical species these reactions have been described by the set of differential equations the system of ordinary differential equations was obtained

cross validation approach while for the external validation was conducted on a two cecs with the known empirical parameters cecs used for external validation were selected based on their empirical parameter values when the data were sorted by one of the parameters ascending fifth and thirteenth cecs were used as an external validation compounds this method was used so that data fit within

variable selection over genetic algorithm ga in combination with multiple linear regression mlr this action descriptor selection and simultaneous building of single or multi variable models up to

figs s1 s8 while values are summarized in sm table s3 all calculated second order rate constants are provided in table 3 as expected direct uv c photolysis showed the lowest removal rate for all examined cecs while the addition of oxidants resulted with significantly higher degradation rates following step wise order regarding an increase of oxidant in the system as demonstrated cecs degradation rates kt were much more sensitive to variations of initial s2o8 2 concentration than to h2o2 concentration variations according to results presented in b charts of figs s1 s8 sm it is evident that processes based on so4 chemistry resulted in faster cecs degradation in almost all cases hence the apparent rate constants for uv c s2o8 2 process kt uv c s2o8 2 are higher than that of uv c h2o2 kt uv c h2o2 such effect may indicate that kso4 kho however one should be aware that kt depends on optical properties of applied oxidant ε and ф as demonstrated φs2o82 φh2o2 while the same is valid for the molar absorption coefficients ε254 na2s2o8 47 45 m 1 cm 1 ε254 h2o2 18 6 m 1 cm 1 19 in a charts figs s1 s8 sm correlations between observed photooxidative degradation rate diminished

of second order rate constants for p cba by ho or so4 kho p cba 5 0 109 m 1s 1 and kso4 p cba 3 6 108 m 1s 1 31 in order to obtain corresponding values for studied cecs the results are summarized in table 3 4 2 prediction of photooxidative degradation of cecs by mm models as can be seen from the mm flowchart fig 1 for developing a good model empirical parameters have to be optimized however such model is valid for particular pollutant while model robustness can be increased with the correlation of such optimized empirical parameters and structural characteristics of organics which is the aim of the study prior optimization of empirical parameters u and s corresponding to rates of degradation of formed by products bps by ho and so4 respectively and w and q corresponding to the ratio of fast and slow mineralizing byproducts formed by ho and so4 driven mechanisms fig 1 parameters determining direct photolysis ε and ф and reaction rates of studied compounds with ho and so4 were determined showed and discussed in subsection 4 1 for determination of optical parameters of direct photolysis determining the rate of cecs degradation modified version of ll model was used eq 1 the obtained results are summarized for all studied cecs in table 3 such obtained values are introduced into mm for each studied compound and on the basis of experimental results mm prediction was tuned by adjusting the empirical parameters u w q and s in the first step values of empirical parameters u and w for uv c h2o2 process were determined due to the fact that there is only one dominating degradation mechanism ho driven degradation in the second step during the calibration of model for uv c s2o8 2 process u and w model parameters determined in first step were kept constant for existing ho degradation mechanism and the new model parameters s and q for so4 driven degradation were determined in fig 2 an example of mm fitting corresponding to the case of oxy is provided while for all other studied cecs such graphical representations are given in supplementary material the obtained values of u w q and s are summarized in table 4 as can be seen from fig 2 the values of oxy conversion mineralization of organic content consumption of an oxidants and changes of ph during the treatment are accurately predicted uv c s2o8 2 system has slight discrepancies between predicted and experimentally obtained ph values the discrepancy in ph prediction was recorded after 10 min of the treatment and can be assigned to the fact that mm does not consider detailed degradation mechanisms of targeted cecs as it is well known degradation cecs like in the case of any aromatic water pollutant would eventually led toward dearomatization forming ring opened by products mostly aliphatic acids and or aldehydes 34 hence their formation is followed by a decrease of ph value of reaction solution hence the changes in ph can be considered as the indicator of their formation and subsequent degradation 19 as shown in previous studies on mm for photooxidative degradation of organic pollutants 27 29 20 32 35 introduction of oxalic acid as a global slow mineralizing bp of organics has been demonstrated as quite effective simplification as it is well known oxalic acid ocaa is common degradation intermediate of vast array of aromatic compounds 16 36 37 it has known reaction rate constant with ho and so4 and moreover rather low comparing to the values of other reaction rate constants in table 2 hence it can be considered as rate liming factor of mm as can be seen from the results presented in fig 2 for oxy and figs s8 s23 sm for other studied cecs such simplified model was able to successfully capture all important features of the studied systems as mentioned above u and s parameters serve as the correlation of used global reaction rate table 2 eq 1 of studied cecs with ho and so4 respectively with cecs structural features in most of the cases u s even for several times exceptions are dxt and oxy table 4 such results indicate that uv c s2o8 2 is characterized with the slower formation of intermediates eventually leading to the formation of ocaa i e in our case oxalic acid as their representative and their mineralization in comparison to uv c h2o2 process in the case of other mm empirical parameters representing the ratio of fast and slow mineralizing byproducts it can be seen that w q in most cases the exception is cbz where q is somewhat higher than w parameter table 4 4 3 structural features influencing the empirical parameters of mm models the determined empirical parameters were brought into correlation with the structural characteristics of studied cecs table 4 represented by descriptors generated through software dragon 6 and from semiempirical quantum chemical descriptors using the following methodology firstly 1 2 and 3 variable models i e with one to three descriptors were built models with higher number of variables were not considered due to the rule of thumb explained earlier in modeling part section 3 calculations every qspr model has its own applicability domain which is based on input end point data selected and nature of involved compounds descriptors used for modeling 32 it is worth of noting that determined u w s and q values formed domains from 0 150 to 0 992 0 280 to 0 939 0 190 to 0 996 and 0 019 0 796 respectively table 4 hence for different empirical parameters splitting of set of compounds on training and those for external validation was different evaluation of developed 1 2 and 3 variable models were conducted through basic statistical analysis r 2 r 2 adj f s q 2 table 5 after the selection of best models 3 variable models were found as the best in all cases further internal validation using leave many out lmo technique 38 and y scrambling test 39 were performed the corresponding graphical representations are given in fig s24 fig s25 fig s26 and fig s27 sm a for lmo and b for y scrambling test for parameters u w s and q respectively as can be seen from the obtained scatter plots in all cases q 2 lmo values lie closely to q 2 loo values of selected 3 variable models table 5 moreover q 2 lmo are not widely dispersed fig s24 a s27 a sm y scrambling test revealed that values of r 2 and q 2 loo obtained by selected 3 variable models are significantly higher than calculated r 2 y scrambling and q 2 y scrambling values fig s24 b s27 b sm proving the validity of selected 3 variable models the internal and external validation statistics are summarized in table 5 hence the selected 3 variable models eq 24 26 28 and 30 were than submitted to external validation corresponding statistics were calculated table 5 and table s3 sm in eqs 24 27 models for parameters u w s and q respectively are showed u 1 099 0 135 spmin1 bh i 2 981 1 317 rdf040u 24 1 025 0 068 nssssc 3 728 1 351 w 1 163 0 202 c 0 262 0 112 mats5s 25 0 365 0 087 mor04m 1 557 0 175 s 0

every empirical parameter in fig 3 a d it should be pointed out that experimental data lays close to the diagonal line suggesting that models have high accuracy which is also indicated by corresponding r 2 values given in table 5 fig 4 a d presents plot of residuals as can be seen from these plots all experimental data were inside 3σ mark that means that there are no evident outliers speaking in favor to model applicability for studied set of compounds of rather different structures as can be seen from eqs 24 27 each of empirical parameters is a function of several structural features of studied cecs hence empirical parameter u depends on the following 3 descriptors spmin1 bh i rdf040u and nssssc taking into account the values and indexes of coefficients in eq 24 the far highest but negative contribution to the end point of interest u has descriptor spmin1 bh i while other two coefficients rdf040u and nssssc have similar contribution however indexes of opposite direction as mentioned earlier parameter u is closely correlated to the degradation rate of intermediates oc by ho the most preferable degradation pathway of organics by ho includes h abstraction at either c ring or c substituent atom and subsequent hydroxylation 20 40 spmin1 bh i is part of burden eigenvalues descriptors weighted by ionization potential the correlation of degradation rate of oc by ho with descriptor weighted by ionization potential can be explained through the fact that ionization potential is proportional to the electronegativity of oc initial bp of parent cec thus both possessing similar structures the fact is that the electronegativity of cecs is proven to be highly correlated with reactivity of organics toward ho attack 41 20 21 42 the ho is a reactive electrophile thus rapidly reacting with the organic contaminants attacking the most electron rich sites of the molecule besides the above mentioned dominating h abstraction other two main pathways in ho driven reactions are single electron transfer and radical addition 24 43 contribution of the competing mechanisms to the observed kinetics is strongly influenced by the structural features of the substrate rdf040u is unweighted radial distribution function 040 descriptor providing the information about bond distances and ring types but also about distance distribution in the geometrical representation from eq 24 it is clear that the higher the value of rdf040u u parameter would be higher as well and accordingly oc degradation occurred at higher rate the highest values of this descriptor possess cecs with large molecules azt erm and tlc which do not have benzene ring and their atoms are dispersed on the other hand cbz has 20 times lower value of rdf040u descriptor than azt erm and tlc which is quite logical cbz has very compact tricyclic structure hence ocs formed upon initial degradation of cecs with high values of rdf040u descriptor can be broken quite easily by ho attack providing the significance of this descriptor among overall 3111 applied nssssc is atom type e state indices descriptor which represents a number of quaternary carbon atoms in cec molecule as known ho mainly targets unsaturated bonds or abstracts h atoms from ch bonds 11 especially those in α position to π systems amines ethers thioethers and carbonyls 44 so it is obvious that molecules with higher number of quaternary carbon atoms will be less sensitive to ho attacks as it is confirmed by the corresponding contribution indexes in the eq 24 analogues empirical parameter in the case of oc by uvc s2o8 2 process is s which depends on following descriptors narnhr cic5 and spposa x eq 26 all three descriptors have a negative contribution to the parameter s meaning that the increase in their values leads toward lower degradation rates of ocs formed upon initial cecs degradation by so4 narnhr belongs to the functional group counts group of descriptors it represents a number of secondary amines in the aromatic ring amine group plays the role of inductive electron withdrawing group due to the higher electronegativity of nitrogen atom compared to carbon atom so in that case it inhibits slightly the reactivity toward so4 in theory the electron donating groups indicate on enhanced reactivity toward so4 and vice versa so4 is an electrophilic radical with tendency to react with electron rich moiety i e functional group 6 12 cic5 belongs to a group of information indices as complementary information content index neighborhood symmetry of 5 order and it has similar contribution to the end point as previously discussed narnhr eq 26 the main trait of this descriptor is the indication about symmetry with higher factor of symmetry degradation rate is lower this can be explained by the fact that symmetrical structures can have localized electrons through the entire structure there is no significant electronegative or ionized part of the molecule hence since so4 is an electrophilic radical compounds with higher value of narnhr would have inhibited degradation rate of formed ocs spposa x is 2d matrix based descriptor possessing the highest contribution among descriptors in eq 26 spposa x are spectral indices calculated as function of the matrix eigenvalues it is index of positive and normalized spectral sum of the matrix of adjacency it is derived from the function of the positive eigenvalues of the matrix of adjacency and a normalization factor is applied to reduce the influence of molecule size 45 52 the correlation of other two empirical parameters w and q describing the ratio of the degradation of oc to its slow and fast mineralizing byproducts by uvc h2o2 and uvc s2o8 2 respectively with cecs structural features is showed through eqs 25 and 27 respectively hence descriptors c mats5s and mor04m contribute to the parameter w descriptor c is part of constitutional indices group of descriptors that numerically presents percentage of c atoms it is obvious that c has a negative contribution to parameter w eq 26 by fig 1 parameters w and q are factors that determines what percentage of all carbon by mass balance are going to fast mineralizing degradation byproduct ip 1 w 100 are going to slow mineralizing degradation byproduct ocaa so with higher content of c atoms it is less likely that compound would be mineralized i e degraded into ip very fast mats5s is 2d autocorrelations moran descriptor these descriptors are usually classified by term the lag with pertaining number and particular weighting scheme hence lags are calculated by summing the products of atomic weights of the terminal atoms of all paths of the considered path length while weighting scheme is related to some property related with the atoms m relative atomic mass p polarizability e sanderson electronegativity v van der waals volume i ionization potential and s i state electrotopological states 46 mats5s s lag is 5 which means that in the cec s structure strength of the relationship between relative inductive effect i stated of two atoms in a molecule and space lag of five bonds separating them 47 its negative contribution gives more sense when its weight electrotopological state is considered structure with higher values of this descriptor have more resistant structure to ho attacks due to better relationship within electron density and molecular topology 48 especially when considering that the most preferable degradation pathway of organics by ho includes h abstraction at either c ring or c substituent atom and subsequent hydroxylation 20 40 mor04m is 3d morse descriptor 3d molecule representation of structures based on electron diffraction weighed by relative atomic mass this descriptor has a positive contribution to the parameter w reactions promoted by ho depends on 3 dimensional molecular structure higher value of this descriptor is inversely proportional to relative atomic mass smaller structures would be more likely degraded into ip while bigger structures would form smaller structures e g ocaa before mineralization all three descriptors contributing to the parameter q has positive indexes gats5e spmax7 bh s and r4u the first descriptor in eq 27 gats5e is a part of 2d autocorrelations more correctly its sub group geary gats autocorrelations its positive contribution is indicator that the molecules with its higher value has more suitable distribution of electrons through the structure while is known that strong electron acceptor ability of so4 enables degradation of recalcitrant compounds through its dominant electron transfer mechanism to inorganic byproducts 50 spmax7 bh s is part of edge adjacency indices the group of topological molecular descriptors derived from the edge adjacency matrix 49 weighted by electrotopological states the connection between electrotopological states and so4 driven mechanism i e preferable mechanism over electron transfer is explained already above r maximal autocorrelation of lag 4 unweighted r4u is getaway descriptor getaway geometry topology and atom weights assembly numerical representations encode the geometrical information obtained from the molecular matrix and the topological information obtained from the molecular graph as well as the information obtained from atomic weights which are specially designed with the aim of matching the 3d molecular geometry 53 geometrical descriptors h getaway are given by influence molecular matrix while topological one r gateway are given by the influence distance matrix the later combines influence of molecular matrix with inter atomic geometrical distance like 3d morse descriptor it can be weighted by physicochemical properties m p e and v moreover the magnitude of the maximum leverage in a molecule depends on the size and shape of the molecule 46 topological distance lag is ranged from 1 to 8 corresponds with the most external atoms that are next to each other in molecular space it is in relationship with molecular shape higher lag values correspond with more compact molecules lower lag value is associated with more linear compounds because of its positive contribution it can be concluded that more compact structures and in degradation processes that means smaller structures would be more easily converted to the fast mineralizing degradation byproducts the obtained results i e models eqs 24 27 and provided discussion on the included descriptors representing particular molecular features promoting ho and so4 degradation of cecs byproducts clearly enlighten the chemistry behind empirical parameters in mm although qspr models eq 24 27 include descriptors derived through rather complicated calculation procedures it can be concluded that derived models predicting u and s parameters can be correlated with the established theories related to dominating reaction mechanisms radical addition and single electron transfer for ho and so4 respectively the models predicting w and q empirical parameters can be rather easily explained by their descriptors and weighting factors correlated with size and shape of molecules 5 conclusions the experimental studies including photooxidative degradation of 17 selected cecs by uv c h2o2 and uv c s2o8 2 were successfully applied yielding numerical values on parent pollutant conversion organic content mineralization oxidant consumption and changes of ph the behavior of studied photooxidative processes for degradation of cecs was accurately described using data acquired through experimental studies on 17 selected compounds along with simultaneous tuning of values of empirical parameters incorporated mm model diversifying specificities of structural features of studied cecs accordingly such determined empirical parameters were then correlated with structural characteristics of studied cecs using qspr modeling the derived qspr were successfully internally and externally validated providing high accuracy in correlating reaction kinetics degradation mechanisms and simplified pathway occurring in photooxidative processes applied which is described over employed empirical parameters with descriptors derived from structures of selected cecs it was found that descriptors correlated with empirical parameters u and s describing degradation kinetics of cec by products are in accordance with preferable degradation mechanism h abstraction and electron transfer by ho and so4 respectively other two empirical parameters w and q describing the ratio of slow and fast mineralizing byproducts were found to be dependent on features of parent cec s e g compact linear structure and molecule symmetry such findings increased robustness of mm model taking into account the diversity of targeted pollutant structure thus widening its applicability to the broader spectrum of organic pollutants acknowledgement we gratefully acknowledge on the financial

14162,the aim of this study is to assess the knowledge on system behavior of photooxidative degradation of contaminates of emerging concern cecs in that purpose experimental studies including photooxidative degradation of 17 selected cecs by uv c h2o2 and uv c s2o8 2 and simultaneous monitoring of parent cecs conversion organic content mineralization oxidant consumption and changes of ph

respectively other two empirical parameters describing the ratio of slow and fast mineralizing byproducts were found to be dependent on features of parent cec s e g compact linear structure and molecule symmetry keywords contaminants of emerging concern photooxidative water treatment hydroxyl radical sulfate radical structural relationship mechanistic modeling 1 introduction the global occurrence of organic and inorganic contaminants in water resources has raised concern about their potential negative effect on environment and human health 1 therefore many directives and protocols have been adapted during last 20 years eu introduced in 2000 list of priority substances to control the chemical quality of water list has been reevaluated and updated over the time 2 4 besides the eu directive and priority substances and pertaining watch list there are a lot of other artificial products that are classified as potential contaminants of emerging concern cecs 51 5 wastewater treatment plants wwtp are not designed to remove cecs thus the requirements for more effective methods are set 6 among destructive methods photooxidative processes using uv c irradiation in combination with strong oxidants such as h2o2 and or s2o82 were showed to be quite efficient for the degradation of recalcitrant organics like pesticides and pharmaceuticals 6 9 10 however the knowledge of system behavior optimal conditions removal rates with the most common reactive species generated by aops hydroxyl ho and sulfate so4 radicals degradation pathways and related altering of water quality parameters particularly for newly introduced cecs are still scarce 11 15 namely during the degradation process process conditions alter regarding the formation depletion of intermediates and present oxidants 16 18 usually the chemistry of such complex matrices are described by mathematical mechanistic mm modeling 16 these phenomenological approaches used in mm modeling allows capturing the relevant interactions within the system generation of different chemical species either atomic radical ionic or molecular during the degradation of parent pollutant e g cecs and interaction through chemical mechanism can be described by chemical reactions taking into account the complexicity of mms including the chemistry of detailed degradation mechanism of parent pollutant s and formed intermediates empirical parameters corresponding to the rate of degradation of cecs byproducts and distinguishing fast and slow mineralizing byproducts may by applied in order to simplify model matrix keeping the high predictivity 19 empirical parameters are assumed to be depended on the structure of parent pollutant thus they can be determined using structural relationship modeling 20 recently structural relationship modeling more precisely quantitative structure activity property relationship qsar qspr modeling approaches were successfully applied to predict different end points for a wide range of organic compounds treated by aops e g toxicity biodegradability physical and chemical properties including reaction rates 6 7 15 21 23 in such manner the important knowledge on system behavior of specific reactions within aops treatment is accumulated the objective of this study was to develop a flexible model providing a relationship between process parameters empirical parameters of mm models and the structural characteristics of present cecs this is accomplished by combining mm and qspr modeling and introducing the generalized parameters elucidating degradation kinetics of cecs byproducts and distinguishing fast and slow mineralizing byproducts all in order to overcome the complexity of degradation schemes for each cec and increase the robustness of applied

predicting system behavior of photooxidative processes are semi empirical schematics and flowchart of the models were given in the fig 1 the influence of reactions and their rates on model performance was evaluated with the purpose to simplify mm modeling by the reduction of number of species and reactions according to their significance 32 following system degradation process simplifications were considered i the reaction volume is constant and independent of the treatment time leading to the constant amounts of substance in the reaction mixture ii the temperature in the reactor is constant

overall in mm there are only 20 reactions and 19 chemical species these reactions have been described by the set of differential equations the system of ordinary differential equations was obtained

cross validation approach while for the external validation was conducted on a two cecs with the known empirical parameters cecs used for external validation were selected based on their empirical parameter values when the data were sorted by one of the parameters ascending fifth and thirteenth cecs were used as an external validation compounds this method was used so that data fit within

research group talete italy 4870 descriptors from possible 4885 were obtained describing the chemical diversity within studied cecs targeted qspr responses the empirical parameters of mm models were correlated with the structural characteristics of selected cecs represented by descriptors calculated either by dragon or computed directly using semiempirical approach based on rm1 method employing variable selection over genetic algorithm ga in combination with multiple linear regression mlr this action descriptor selection and simultaneous building of single or multi variable models up to

figs s1 s8 while values are summarized in sm table s3 all calculated second order rate constants are provided in table 3 as expected direct uv c photolysis showed the lowest removal rate for all examined cecs while the addition of oxidants resulted with significantly higher degradation rates following step wise order regarding an increase of oxidant in the system as demonstrated cecs degradation rates kt were much more sensitive to variations of initial s2o8 2 concentration than to h2o2 concentration variations according to results presented in b charts of figs s1 s8 sm it is evident that processes based on so4 chemistry resulted in faster cecs degradation in almost all cases hence the apparent rate constants for uv c s2o8 2 process kt uv c s2o8 2 are higher than that of uv c h2o2 kt uv c h2o2 such effect may indicate that kso4 kho however one should be aware that kt depends on optical properties of applied oxidant ε and ф as demonstrated φs2o82 φh2o2 while the same is valid for the molar absorption coefficients ε254 na2s2o8 47 45 m 1 cm 1 ε254 h2o2 18 6 m 1 cm 1 19 in a charts figs s1 s8 sm correlations between observed photooxidative degradation rate diminished

of second order rate constants for p cba by ho or so4 kho p cba 5 0 109 m 1s 1 and kso4 p cba 3 6 108 m 1s 1 31 in order to obtain corresponding values for studied cecs the results are summarized in table 3 4 2 prediction of photooxidative degradation of cecs by mm models as can be seen from the mm flowchart fig 1 for developing a good model empirical parameters have to be optimized however such model is valid for particular pollutant while model robustness can be increased with the correlation of such optimized empirical parameters and structural characteristics of organics which is the aim of the study prior optimization of empirical parameters u and s corresponding to rates of degradation of formed by products bps by ho and so4 respectively and w and q corresponding to the ratio of fast and slow mineralizing byproducts formed by ho and so4 driven mechanisms fig 1 parameters determining direct photolysis ε and ф and reaction rates of studied compounds with ho and so4 were determined showed and discussed in subsection 4 1 for determination of optical parameters of direct photolysis determining the rate of cecs degradation modified version of ll model was used eq 1 the obtained results are summarized for all studied cecs in table 3 such obtained values are introduced into mm for each studied compound and on the basis of experimental results mm prediction was tuned by adjusting the empirical parameters u w q and s in the first step values of empirical parameters u and w for uv c h2o2 process were determined due to the fact that there is only one dominating degradation mechanism ho driven degradation in the second step during the calibration of model for uv c s2o8 2 process u and w model parameters determined in first step were kept constant for existing ho degradation mechanism and the new model parameters s and q for so4 driven degradation were determined in fig 2 an example of mm fitting corresponding to the case of oxy is provided while for all other studied cecs such graphical representations are given in supplementary material the obtained values of u w q and s are summarized in table 4 as can be seen from fig 2 the values of oxy conversion mineralization of organic content consumption of an oxidants and changes of ph during the treatment are accurately predicted uv c s2o8 2 system has slight discrepancies between predicted and experimentally obtained ph values the discrepancy in ph prediction was recorded after 10 min of the treatment and can be assigned to the fact that mm does not consider detailed degradation mechanisms of targeted cecs as it is well known degradation cecs like in the case of any aromatic water pollutant would eventually led toward dearomatization forming ring opened by products mostly aliphatic acids and or aldehydes 34 hence their formation is followed by a decrease of ph value of reaction solution hence the changes in ph can be considered as the indicator of their formation and subsequent degradation 19 as shown in previous studies on mm for photooxidative degradation of organic pollutants 27 29 20 32 35 introduction of oxalic acid as a global slow mineralizing bp of organics has been demonstrated as quite effective simplification as it is well known oxalic acid ocaa is common degradation intermediate of vast array of aromatic compounds 16 36 37 it has known reaction rate constant with ho and so4 and moreover rather low comparing to the values of other reaction rate constants in table 2 hence it can be considered as rate liming factor of mm as can be seen from the results presented in fig 2 for oxy and figs s8 s23 sm for other studied cecs such simplified model was able to successfully capture all important features of the studied systems as mentioned above u and s parameters serve as the correlation of used global reaction rate table 2 eq 1 of studied cecs with ho and so4 respectively with cecs structural features in most of the cases u s even for several times exceptions are dxt and oxy table 4 such results indicate that uv c s2o8 2 is characterized with the slower formation of intermediates eventually leading to the formation of ocaa i e in our case oxalic acid as their representative and their mineralization in comparison to uv c h2o2 process in the case of other mm empirical parameters representing the ratio of fast and slow mineralizing byproducts it can be seen that w q in most cases the exception is cbz where q is somewhat higher than w parameter table 4 4 3 structural features influencing the empirical parameters of mm models the determined empirical parameters were brought into correlation with the structural characteristics of studied cecs table 4 represented by descriptors generated through software dragon 6 and from semiempirical quantum chemical descriptors using the following methodology firstly 1 2 and 3 variable models i e with one to three descriptors were built models with higher number of variables were not considered due to the rule of thumb explained earlier in modeling part section 3 calculations every qspr model has its own applicability domain which is based on input end point data selected and nature of involved compounds descriptors used for modeling 32 it is worth of noting that determined u w s and q values formed domains from 0 150 to 0 992 0 280 to 0 939 0 190 to 0 996 and 0 019 0 796 respectively table 4 hence for different empirical parameters splitting of set of compounds on training and those for external validation was different evaluation of developed 1 2 and 3 variable models were conducted through basic statistical analysis r 2 r 2 adj f s q 2 table 5 after the selection of best models 3 variable models were found as the best in all cases further internal validation using leave many out lmo technique 38 and y scrambling test 39 were performed the corresponding graphical representations are given in fig s24 fig s25 fig s26 and fig s27 sm a for lmo and b for y scrambling test for parameters u w s and q respectively as can be seen from the obtained scatter plots in all cases q 2 lmo values lie closely to q 2 loo values of selected 3 variable models table 5 moreover q 2 lmo are not widely dispersed fig s24 a s27 a sm y scrambling test revealed that values of r 2 and q 2 loo obtained by selected 3 variable models are significantly higher than calculated r 2 y scrambling and q 2 y scrambling values fig s24 b s27 b sm proving the validity of selected 3 variable models the internal and external validation statistics are summarized in table 5 hence the selected 3 variable models eq 24 26 28 and 30 were than submitted to external validation corresponding statistics were calculated table 5 and table s3 sm in eqs 24 27 models for parameters u w s and q respectively are showed u 1 099 0 135 spmin1 bh i 2 981 1 317 rdf040u 24 1 025 0 068 nssssc 3 728 1 351 w 1 163 0 202 c 0 262 0 112 mats5s 25 0 365 0 087 mor04m 1 557 0 175 s 0

every empirical parameter in fig 3 a d it should be pointed out that experimental data lays close to the diagonal line suggesting that models have high accuracy which is also indicated by corresponding r 2 values given in table 5 fig 4 a d presents plot of residuals as can be seen from these plots all experimental data were inside 3σ mark that means that there are no evident outliers speaking in favor to model applicability for studied set of compounds of rather different structures as can be seen from eqs 24 27 each of empirical parameters is a function of several structural features of studied cecs hence empirical parameter u depends on the following 3 descriptors spmin1 bh i rdf040u and nssssc taking into account the values and indexes of coefficients in eq 24 the far highest but negative contribution to the end point of interest u has descriptor spmin1 bh i while other two coefficients rdf040u and nssssc have similar contribution however indexes of opposite direction as mentioned earlier parameter u is closely correlated to the degradation rate of intermediates oc by ho the most preferable degradation pathway of organics by ho includes h abstraction at either c ring or c substituent atom and subsequent hydroxylation 20 40 spmin1 bh i is part of burden eigenvalues descriptors weighted by ionization potential the correlation of degradation rate of oc by ho with descriptor weighted by ionization potential can be explained through the fact that ionization potential is proportional to the electronegativity of oc initial bp of parent cec thus both possessing similar structures the fact is that the electronegativity of cecs is proven to be highly correlated with reactivity of organics toward ho attack 41 20 21 42 the ho is a reactive electrophile thus rapidly reacting with the organic contaminants attacking the most electron rich sites of the molecule besides the above mentioned dominating h abstraction other two main pathways in ho driven reactions are single electron transfer and radical addition 24 43 contribution of the competing mechanisms to the observed kinetics is strongly influenced by the structural features of the substrate rdf040u is unweighted radial distribution function 040 descriptor providing the information about bond distances and ring types but also about distance distribution in the geometrical representation from eq 24 it is clear that the higher the value of rdf040u u parameter would be higher as well and accordingly oc degradation occurred at higher rate the highest values of this descriptor possess cecs with large molecules azt erm and tlc which do not have benzene ring and their atoms are dispersed on the other hand cbz has 20 times lower value of rdf040u descriptor than azt erm and tlc which is quite logical cbz has very compact tricyclic structure hence ocs formed upon initial degradation of cecs with high values of rdf040u descriptor can be broken quite easily by ho attack providing the significance of this descriptor among overall 3111 applied nssssc is atom type e state indices descriptor which represents a number of quaternary carbon atoms in cec molecule as known ho mainly targets unsaturated bonds or abstracts h atoms from ch bonds 11 especially those in α position to π systems amines ethers thioethers and carbonyls 44 so it is obvious that molecules with higher number of quaternary carbon atoms will be less sensitive to ho attacks as it is confirmed by the corresponding contribution indexes in the eq 24 analogues empirical parameter in the case of oc by uvc s2o8 2 process is s which depends on following descriptors narnhr cic5 and spposa x eq 26 all three descriptors have a negative contribution to the parameter s meaning that the increase in their values leads toward lower degradation rates of ocs formed upon initial cecs degradation by so4 narnhr belongs to the functional group counts group of descriptors it represents a number of secondary amines in the aromatic ring amine group plays the role of inductive electron withdrawing group due to the higher electronegativity of nitrogen atom compared to carbon atom so in that case it inhibits slightly the reactivity toward so4 in theory the electron donating groups indicate on enhanced reactivity toward so4 and vice versa so4 is an electrophilic radical with tendency to react with electron rich moiety i e functional group 6 12 cic5 belongs to a group of information indices as complementary information content index neighborhood symmetry of 5 order and it has similar contribution to the end point as previously discussed narnhr eq 26 the main trait of this descriptor is the indication about symmetry with higher factor of symmetry degradation rate is lower this can be explained by the fact that symmetrical structures can have localized electrons through the entire structure there is no significant electronegative or ionized part of the molecule hence since so4 is an electrophilic radical compounds with higher value of narnhr would have inhibited degradation rate of formed ocs spposa x is 2d matrix based descriptor possessing the highest contribution among descriptors in eq 26 spposa x are spectral indices calculated as function of the matrix eigenvalues it is index of positive and normalized spectral sum of the matrix of adjacency it is derived from the function of the positive eigenvalues of the matrix of adjacency and a normalization factor is applied to reduce the influence of molecule size 45 52 the correlation of other two empirical parameters w and q describing the ratio of the degradation of oc to its slow and fast mineralizing byproducts by uvc h2o2 and uvc s2o8 2 respectively with cecs structural features is showed through eqs 25 and 27 respectively hence descriptors c mats5s and mor04m contribute to the parameter w descriptor c is part of constitutional indices group of descriptors that numerically presents percentage of c atoms it is obvious that c has a negative contribution to parameter w eq 26 by fig 1 parameters w and q are factors that determines what percentage of all carbon by mass balance are going to fast mineralizing degradation byproduct ip 1 w 100 are going to slow mineralizing degradation byproduct ocaa so with higher content of c atoms it is less likely that compound would be mineralized i e degraded into ip very fast mats5s is 2d autocorrelations moran descriptor these descriptors are usually classified by term the lag with pertaining number and particular weighting scheme hence lags are calculated by summing the products of atomic weights of the terminal atoms of all paths of the considered path length while weighting scheme is related to some property related with the atoms m relative atomic mass p polarizability e sanderson electronegativity v van der waals volume i ionization potential and s i state electrotopological states 46 mats5s s lag is 5 which means that in the cec s structure strength of the relationship between relative inductive effect i stated of two atoms in a molecule and space lag of five bonds separating them 47 its negative contribution gives more sense when its weight electrotopological state is considered structure with higher values of this descriptor have more resistant structure to ho attacks due to better relationship within electron density and molecular topology 48 especially when considering that the most preferable degradation pathway of organics by ho includes h abstraction at either c ring or c substituent atom and subsequent hydroxylation 20 40 mor04m is 3d morse descriptor 3d molecule representation of structures based on electron diffraction weighed by relative atomic mass this descriptor has a positive contribution to the parameter w reactions promoted by ho depends on 3 dimensional molecular structure higher value of this descriptor is inversely proportional to relative atomic mass smaller structures would be more likely degraded into ip while bigger structures would form smaller structures e g ocaa before mineralization all three descriptors contributing to the parameter q has positive indexes gats5e spmax7 bh s and r4u the first descriptor in eq 27 gats5e is a part of 2d autocorrelations more correctly its sub group geary gats autocorrelations its positive contribution is indicator that the molecules with its higher value has more suitable distribution of electrons through the structure while is known that strong electron acceptor ability of so4 enables degradation of recalcitrant compounds through its dominant electron transfer mechanism to inorganic byproducts 50 spmax7 bh s is part of edge adjacency indices the group of topological molecular descriptors derived from the edge adjacency matrix 49 weighted by electrotopological states the connection between electrotopological states and so4 driven mechanism i e preferable mechanism over electron transfer is explained already above r maximal autocorrelation of lag 4 unweighted r4u is getaway descriptor getaway geometry topology and atom weights assembly numerical representations encode the geometrical information obtained from the molecular matrix and the topological information obtained from the molecular graph as well as the information obtained from atomic weights which are specially designed with the aim of matching the 3d molecular geometry 53 geometrical descriptors h getaway are given by influence molecular matrix while topological one r gateway are given by the influence distance matrix the later combines influence of molecular matrix with inter atomic geometrical distance like 3d morse descriptor it can be weighted by physicochemical properties m p e and v moreover the magnitude of the maximum leverage in a molecule depends on the size and shape of the molecule 46 topological distance lag is ranged from 1 to 8 corresponds with the most external atoms that are next to each other in molecular space it is in relationship with molecular shape higher lag values correspond with more compact molecules lower lag value is associated with more linear compounds because of its positive contribution it can be concluded that more compact structures and in degradation processes that means smaller structures would be more easily converted to the fast mineralizing degradation byproducts the obtained results i e models eqs 24 27 and provided discussion on the included descriptors representing particular molecular features promoting ho and so4 degradation of cecs byproducts clearly enlighten the chemistry behind empirical parameters in mm although qspr models eq 24 27 include descriptors derived through rather complicated calculation procedures it can be concluded that derived models predicting u and s parameters can be correlated with the established theories related to dominating reaction mechanisms radical addition and single electron transfer for ho and so4 respectively the models predicting w and q empirical parameters can be rather easily explained by their descriptors and weighting factors correlated with size and shape of molecules 5 conclusions the experimental studies including photooxidative degradation of 17 selected cecs by uv c h2o2 and uv c s2o8 2 were successfully applied yielding numerical values on parent pollutant conversion organic content mineralization oxidant consumption and changes of ph the behavior of studied photooxidative processes for degradation of cecs was accurately described using data acquired through experimental studies on 17 selected compounds along with simultaneous tuning of values of empirical parameters incorporated mm model diversifying specificities of structural features of studied cecs accordingly such determined empirical parameters were then correlated with structural characteristics of studied cecs using qspr modeling the derived qspr were successfully internally and externally validated providing high accuracy in correlating reaction kinetics degradation mechanisms and simplified pathway occurring in photooxidative processes applied which is described over employed empirical parameters with descriptors derived from structures of selected cecs it was found that descriptors correlated with empirical parameters u and s describing degradation kinetics of cec by products are in accordance with preferable degradation mechanism h abstraction and electron transfer by ho and so4 respectively other two empirical parameters w and q describing the ratio of slow and fast mineralizing byproducts were found to be dependent on features of parent cec s e g compact linear structure and molecule symmetry such findings increased robustness of mm model taking into account the diversity of targeted pollutant structure thus widening its applicability to the broader spectrum of organic pollutants acknowledgement we gratefully acknowledge on the financial

14163,a solid solution photocatalyst tio2 zro2 was used to simultaneously remove coexisting cu ii and cr vi from wastewater by photoreduction results showed that the two heavy metal ions can be effectively removed from the hybrid wastewater simultaneously by ti0 95zr0 05 under uv irradiation with hcooh hcoona as the sacrificial agent the obtained water reached the discharge standards with a cr vi concentration of 0 5 mg l at 5 min and a cu ii concentration of 0 11 mg l at 17 min the solid solution exhibited excellent stability after four cycles with cr vi and cu ii removal rates of 100 and 91 respectively however reduction of cr vi was observed first and cu ii was subsequently reduced at an accelerated rate this behavior was ascribed to the stronger oxidization of cr vi compared to cu ii and the schottky effect of photodeposited cu keywords photoreduction solid solution cu ii cr vi simultaneous removal 1 introduction with rapid technological development the metal electroplating industry is producing a large amount of heavy metal wastewater among heavy metals cr vi and cu ii are common and usually coexist in wastewater posing a serious threat to human health common methods for treating cr vi and cu ii include electrochemical reduction 1 chemical precipitation 2 adsorption 3 4 and ion exchange 5 however addition of external reagents or a generated desorption solution during these processes could cause secondary pollution and raise the treatment cost 6 developing a green energy efficient heavy metal ion treatment process is desirable and necessary photocatalysis has been a promising green low cost technology to treat heavy metal ion pollution since it was proposed by fujishima in 1972 7 electrons generated by a photocatalyst under light irradiation can reduce some heavy metal ions to low toxicity or even nontoxic substances if the conduction band cb of the photocatalyst is low enough 8 in this process only light energy is required to excite the photocatalyst the photocatalysts tio2 9 10 zro2 11 and zno 12 are commonly employed to treat heavy metal ions in wastewater owing to their low cost and stable performance in cr vi photoreduction treatment cr vi is typically photoreduced to cr iii which has low toxicity and the ph value of the solution is then adjusted to cause the cr iii to precipitate various photocatalysts including metal oxides 13 sulfide 14 metal organic framework materials 15 and g c3n4 16 17 have been used to perform this photoreduction among them tio2 is widely accepted as the primary photocatalyst owing to its low cost and stability and zro2 can be used as an additive to obtain a binary solid solution tio2 zro2 where zro2 promotes the quantum efficiency of tio2 and enhances cr vi adsorption on the photocatalyst surface 18 19 although cu ions could be removed by g c3n4 via photoreduction tio2 based catalysts have also been widely tested for cu ii photoreduction 20 cu ii can be effectively removed by tio2 at any acidic ph value 21 by introducing a zr component into tio2 photoreduction of cu ii can be intensified 22 in the electroplating industry cr vi and cu ii often coexist in wastewater but photoreduction treatment of hybrid cr vi and cu ii solutions is rarely reported preliminary research suggests that a solid solution of tio2 zro2 is a possible candidate for one step removal of aqueous cr vi and cu ii therefore in this work a series of binary solid solutions of tio2 zro2 with different zr contents was prepared and to simultaneously remove cr vi and cu ii from water under ultraviolet uv irradiation the interaction of cr vi and cu ii in the photoreduction process was investigated and discussed in detail a possible process for simultaneously treating cr vi and cu ii by photoreduction was proposed 2 experimental 2 1 materials butyl titanate zirconium n butoxide isopropanol and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab were used as reactants to prepare the photocatalyst potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 copper sulfate pentahydrate cuso4 5h2o and nitric acid hno3 were used to prepare simulated wastewater all chemical reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from chengdu kelon reagent co ltd chengdu china and used without further purification 2 2 synthesis of tio2 zro2 butyl titanate and zirconium n butoxide were used as raw materials to synthesize catalysts by a sol gel method 22 forty milliliters of isopropanol 10 ml of a mixture of butyl titanate and zirconium n butoxide where the volume fraction of butyl titanate was x and that of zirconium n butoxide was y and an arbitrary amount of ctab were added to the beaker under magnetic stirring to obtain a mixture then a certain amount of 10 v v isopropanol aqueous solution was added dropwise to the mixture the mixture was stirred for 4 h and the gel was obtained after centrifugation then the gel was washed with deionized water tio2 zro2 was obtained after the gel was dried and calcined at z c for 4 h the obtained solid was the final product and is denoted as tixzry z the mass ratio of ti and zr in tixzry z was shown in table s1 which was analyzed by xrf axios petro netherlands 2 3 evaluation of photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic performance of three simulated wastewater samples a 20 mg l cr vi solution 20 mg l cu ii solution and cu ii cr vi hybrid solution with 20 mg l of cu ii and 20 mg l of cr vi were evaluated the ph value of the three solutions was adjusted to 3 using hno3 an arbitrary amount of tixzry z was added to 20 ml of simulated wastewater in a quartz tube and 1 ml of hcooh hcoona was added as the sacrificial reagent the quartz tube was placed in a photoreactor cel lab500 zhongjiajinyuan beijing and photoreduction was performed under uv irradiation then the solution was sampled to determine the cr vi concentration using uv vis spectrophotometry uv 1500 pc shimadzu 11 and the total concentrations of cr and cu were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icap7400 thermo fisher scientific usa 2 4 characterization the crystal phases of tio2 zro2 were investigated by powder x ray diffraction xrd dandong haoyuan dx 2700 china at scanning angles of 20 to 80 and the light response of the catalysts was characterized by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry drs perkinelmer lambda 750s perkinelmer co ltd usa in a scanning range of 250 to 900 nm fourier transform infrared spectroscopy model spectrum two li10014 perkinelmer was used to characterize the ti0 95zr0 05 300 solution and the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of ti0 95zr0 05 300 was analyzed by a micromeritics asap 2460 analyzer the brunauer emmett teller specific surface area was calculated from the n2 adsorption isotherms in a relative pressure range of 0 05 0 20 the pore size distributions were calculated from the adsorption isotherms at a relative pressure of 0 994 by the barrett joyner halenda method in addition x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps of the catalysts after photoreduction of simulated cu ii cr vi wastewater was performed using a thermo scientific x ray photoelectron spectrometer escalab 250xi usa with an al kα monochromatized x ray source e 1486 6 ev the binding energies were corrected using the c 1s line at 284 8 ev 23 further the morphologies of the catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem regulus 8230 hitachi japan and transmission electron microscopy tem fei titan g2 60 300 ac tem usa at the same time the zr cr cu ti and o distributions on the surface of the catalyst after photoreduction of the simulated cu ii cr vi wastewater for 20 min were observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy high angle annular dark field haadf stem mapping 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of tio2 zro2 solid solution the effect of the zr content of the tio2 zro2 photocatalyst on photoreduction was investigated to determine the optimal zr content for treating cu ii cr vi wastewater because the photocatalytic performance of the tio2 zro2 solid solution varied greatly depending on its composition therefore a series of solid solutions was prepared to select the optimal photocatalyst the uv vis drs results in fig 1 a show that the adsorption edges of all the solid solutions are intermediate between those of pure tio2 and zro2 but are closer to that of tio2 owing to the high tio2 content with increasing zro2 content of the solid solution the adsorption edge is blue shifted this observation suggests that the usable light spectrum of the tio2 zro2 solution is wider than that of pure zro2 but narrower than that of pure tio2 the data were converted to αһʋ 2 and һʋ values using the kubelka munk formula ahν 2 a hν e g the resulting plots fig 1b confirm that the band gaps of all the tixzry samples are between that of tio2 3 13 ev and that of zro2 5 05 ev indicating that all of the samples can be excited only by uv light however the fact that all of the calculated values for tixzry are slightly larger than 3 13 ev confirms that the tio2 component is dominant in the energy structure of the tixzry solution adding zro2 enhanced the photoreduction capacity but was not conducive to effective utilization of solar light energy xrd results fig s1a confirmed that with increasing zro2 content of the solid solution the peaks of anatase tio2 gradually weakened and the crystallinity of the tixzry samples also gradually decreased until the raw materials of n butoxide zirconium and butyl titanate reach a 1 1 ratio the acquired ti0 5zr0 5 sample can be considered to be in the amorphous state because all of the peaks vanish in this adjustment process no characteristic peak of zro2 can be detected confirming that in the series of tio2 zro2 solutions tio2 is the main component and zro2 is evenly dispersed inside the solutions the performance of the solid solutions in photoreduction of cu ii cr vi wastewater is shown in fig 1 c when the zirconium n butoxide volume fraction of the solution was intermediate 0 0 1 the cr vi removal rate was 100 and the total cr removal rate increased from 55 to 60 outside of this zr content range the total cr removal rate decreased with increasing zr content although the cr vi removal rate remained at 100 however the maximum cu ii removal was obtained at a zr content of 0 05 this result confirmed that adding zr significantly improved the photoreduction performance of tio2 which can be ascribed to enhancement of the photogenerated charge when a small amount of zr was added 18 however the addition of excessive zr instead lead to a decrease in performance owing to the wider band gap and higher acidity of zro2 compared to tio2 therefore the tio2 zro2 solution with the optimal zr content was determined to be ti0 95zr0 05 next the effect of the calcination temperature of ti0 95zr0 05 was investigated the crystal pattern of ti0 95zr0 05 in fig s1b confirmed that the peak intensity of anatase increased with increasing temperature indicating that higher temperature facilitates crystallization of the catalyst however at 700 c a transformation of ti0 95zr0 05 from anatase to rutile was observed suggesting possible degradation of the photocatalytic performance the uv vis drs result in fig s1c and calculated band gap in fig s1d confirmed the negligible effect of the calcination temperature on the solid solution s energy structure this inference is confirmed by the performance evaluation results in fig 1 d the removal rates of cr vi cu ii and total cr remained almost unchanged until the calcination temperature reached 700 c the removal rate of cu ii decreased sharply but that of total cr increased slightly this behavior should be ascribed to the appearance of rutile tio2 with a 0 9 ev electron trap on the cb and a higher surface area 24 25 at a high calcination temperature therefore 300 c was selected for calcining ti0 95zr0 05 to reduce energy use catalysts 1 g l reaction time 1 h hcooh hcoona 1 ml 3 2 optimization of photoreduction conditions the effects of the operation parameters including the catalyst concentration light intensity catalyst particle size and stirring speed on the performance of ti0 95zr0 05 300 were determined to exclude their possible influence on the photoreduction performance as shown in fig 2 a cr vi was completely removed at ti0 95zr0 05 300 contents between 1 and 5 g l and the total cr removal rate remained approximately 59 however the highest cu ii removal rate was reached at content of 3 g l this result indicated that cr vi was easier to remove than cu ii and photoreduction of cu ii was seriously affected by the catalyst content owing to the shielding effect therefore the lighting conditions were varied to determine their effect as shown in fig 2b only approximately 25 of the total cr can be removed by ti0 95zr0 05 300 in the dark which was ascribed to adsorption of the photocatalyst as shown in fig s3 a and s3 b the catalyst particle size and the stirring speed of the catalytic system had no significant effect on the photocatalytic activity of ti0 95zr0 05 300 under light which meant that the rate limiting step in this process was not diffusion the ph value of an aqueous system usually has a strong effect on photoreduction owing to differences in the h and oh concentrations and possible corrosion of solid photocatalysts fig 2 c shows the effect of ph values of 1 3 because most electroplating wastewater is strongly acidic the removal of cr vi increased gradually with increasing ph but the removal of cu ii increased significantly when the ph was 3 approximately 99 8 of the cu ii was completely removed by ti0 95zr0 05 300 by photoreduction next the photoreduction performance of ti0 95zr0 05 300 was compared with that of a typical commercial photocatalyst p25 under visible light and uv irradiation as shown in fig 2d both cr vi and cu ii in the cu ii cr vi hybrid solution can be well photoreduced by ti0 95zr0 05 300 and p25 in 30 min under uv irradiation but ti0 95zr0 05 300 exhibited better removal efficiency however ti0 95zr0 05 300 had a significantly higher total cr removal rate than p25 when visible light was used instead the cr vi and total cr removal rates of ti0 95zr0 05 300 69 1 and 41 2 were remarkably better than those of p25 32 5 and 23 5 respectively this result demonstrates that the ti0 95zr0 05 solid solution may outperform p25 when applied to treatment of cu ii cr vi hybrid wastewater the optimal operation conditions for further solid solution photocatalytic performance evaluation and investigation were determined to be 3 g l and a ph of 3 3 3 photocatalytic performance of ti0 95zr0 05 300 to determine the mechanism and kinetics of photoreduction and the possible interaction between cr vi and cu ii during photoreduction simulated solutions with a single component were used to clarify the photoreduction process using ti0 95zr0 05 300 fig 3 a shows the results of photoreduction of the cr vi solution photodegradation of cr vi was remarkably rapid with a 97 2 removal rate at 3 min at which time the cr vi concentration was lower than 0 5 mg l the chinese discharge standard for the cr vi content of wastewater gb 8978 1996 however the total cr removal behavior was different early in the process at 3 min the cr concentration also decreased however as the illumination time increased the cr content rose instead for photoreduction to pure cu ii fig 3 b shows that the degradation rate from 0 to 3 min was relatively slow so this can be regarded as a pre photoreduction stage but the rate increased between 3 and 8 min thereafter the rate decreased again until the final cu ii concentration reached 0 03 mg l after 15 min meeting the wastewater discharge standard the acceleration in the intermediate period should be ascribed to the schottky barrier effect caused by cu deposited on the photocatalyst surface 26 27 the photoreduction plot of coexisting cr vi and cu ii is shown in fig 3 c the cr vi removal rate decreased slightly compared with that of the pure cr vi solution but still reached 98 4 in 5 min meeting the wastewater discharge standard the total cr content still showed first a decrease and then an increasing tendency as the light illumination time increased it can be concluded that the presence of cu ii did not affect the photoreduction of cr vi in consideration of the total ion concentration increasing however the decrease in the cu ii concentration was significantly changed by the presence of cr vi in the first 10 min the cu ii content decreased at a negligible rate then slow photodegradation of cu ii occurred within 10 15 min in the pre photoreduction stage next the cu ii concentration decreased sharply to 0 11 mg l in 2 min the original bright yellow cu ii cr vi solution became colorless and transparent and clean water was obtained in 17 min using ti0 95zr0 05 300 under uv light inhibition of photoreduction of cu ii by cr vi was observed but cu ii could still be effectively removed although the onset of cu ii removal was delayed until the cr vi was completely converted the used ti0 95zr0 05 300 was reused after being washed with hno3 10 wt to remove the metal deposited on the surface 28 as shown in fig 3d the cr vi removal by this sample in 30 min remained unchanged both the four cycle experiment cr vi in the solution could be completely photoreduced to cr iii the removal efficiency was from 98 9 to 100 although the cu ii removal showed a slight decrease after four cycles the removal efficiency reduced from 97 5 to 91 0 confirming its excellent reusability 4 discussion 4 1 species of cu ii cr vi present on ti0 95zr0 05 according to the experimental results all the metal ions both cr vi and cu ii were effectively removed from the aqueous system and captured and immobilized by the photocatalyst therefore it is necessary to identify the cr and cu species on the ti0 95zr0 05 surface as shown by the tem images in fig 4 a and 4b the morphology of ti0 95zr0 05 before and after photoreduction was similar microsized irregular particles the only significant difference was that the used photocatalyst had a smoother surface the high resolution tem hrtem results in fig 4 c and 4d both show the typical 101 crystal plane of anatase no lattice fringes of zro2 and no cr or cu species can be detected this result should be attributed to their low concentrations and possible uniform distribution haadf stem mapping analysis was conducted to identify zr cr and cu on the used ti0 95zr0 05 300 sample as shown in fig 5 a well distributed cu cr zr ti and o were detected the distribution density of ti in fig 5 b is significantly higher than of zr in fig 5 c the distributions of cr in fig 5 d and cu in fig 5 e were relatively sparse but uniform without overlap confirming their excellent distribution and high dispersion however the detectable cu signal was approximately four times higher than that of cr indirectly confirming the unusual increase in total aqueous cr during photoreduction all the cu species can be entrapped and immobilized during photoreduction treatment but the reduced cr species was released from the photocatalyst surface to water causing the increase in the total cr content of the water the cr and cu species present on the tio2 zro2 surface were further investigated using the xps spectra of the used ti0 95zr0 05 300 sample the cr 2p and cu 2p spectra of the samples after 5 min of photoreduction and 20 min of photoreduction are shown in fig 6 a and 6b and fig 6c and 6d respectively the binding energy peaks of cr 2p at 577 4 and 586 8 ev which are attributed to cr iii could both be observed after 5 and 20 min but the peaks at 579 4 and 588 7 ev which are attributed to k2cr2o7 emerged after 5 min and vanished after 20 min of photoreduction 29 30 this behavior suggested adsorption of cr vi on the photocatalyst surface because of a large amount of n h on the surface increasing the adsorption sites for cr vi fig s2a and complete transformation of cr vi to cr iii by photoreduction with increasing illumination time however the cu signal was not observed on the photocatalyst surface after 5 min of light illumination but appeared after 20 min at 932 67 and 952 47 ev and is attributed to cu 0 31 32 this result confirmed that cr vi photoreduction occurred before cu ii photoreduction the xrd of spectra of ti0 95zr0 05 300 before and after photoreduction are compared as shown in fig 7 a before and after the catalytic reaction the phase structure of the material did not change significantly and all of them were anatase however compared with the fresh catalyst the crystallinity of the catalyst decreased significantly after the photocatalytic reaction there were no information about zr cu and cr here which may be due to the low content of the catalyst surface the uv vis drs spectra of ti0 95zr0 05 300 before and after photoreduction are also compared as shown in fig 7 b the absorption edge of ti0 95zr0 05 300 before and after use was 379 nm without an observable shift however the intensity of the response to visible light of the used photocatalyst increased significantly which can be ascribed to the localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect of cu 0 deposited on the photocatalyst under uv light 33 34 further a weak peak at 575 nm caused by excitation of spr in cu 0 was observed 35 37 this result confirmed that the cu species was cu 0 in agreement with the xps result the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of ti0 95zr0 05 300 fresh and used were shown in fig 7 c and d as shown in the inner fig 7 c and d according to iupac photocatalysts were mesoporous structure because their n2 adsorption desorption isotherm were iv isotherm the type h1 loop can be observed at p p0 0 40 0 80 whether fresh nor used ti0 95zr0 05 300 indicated that photocatalysts have a cylindrical communication channel with uniform pore diameter 38 40 and the pore size distribution curve of photocatalysts shows that the pores of ti0 95zr0 05 300 are mainly composed of mesopores with a diameter of about 4 5 4 6 nm due to cu and cr are deposited on the catalyst surface the specific surface area of the material decreased from 166 50 m2 g to 67 42 m2 g and the pore volume decreased from 0 24 cm3 g to 0 11 cm3 g after photocatalysis 4 2 photoreduction mechanism of cu ii cr vi and their interaction to determine the reason for the enhanced photoactivity of the tio2 zro2 solid solution the earlier photoreduction of cr vi to cr iii and the pre photoreduction stage of cu ii photoreduction it is necessary to understand the photoreduction mechanisms of cr vi and cu ii with ti0 95zr0 05 300 and their possible interaction xps analysis of fresh ti0 95zr0 05 300 was conducted as shown in fig 8 two distinct binding energy peaks of ti 2p fig 8a appeared at 459 02 and 464 78 ev which are separated by 5 7 ev they are attributed to ti o in tio2 the red shift of 0 5 ev in the ti 2p3 2 feature of ti0 95zr0 05 300 at 459 02 ev compared with the literature value 458 3 458 5 ev 41 43 should be ascribed to zr doping the zr 3d spectrum of ti0 95zr0 05 300 fig 8b shows binding energy peaks at 182 70 and 185 13 ev which are ascribed to zr 3d3 2 and zr 3d5 2 of zr4 respectively 44 peaks attributable to the oxygen vacancies of zro2 also appeared at 182 01 and 184 49 ev 45 46 the formation of oxygen vacancies should be ascribed to interaction between tio2 and zro2 which is consistent with the red shift of ti 2p3 2 thus tio2 and zro2 may act as the electron donor and electron acceptor respectively thus the oxygen vacancies of zro2 in the tio2 zro2 solid solution can effectively enhance the photoactivity of tio2 the electrons on the valence band of tio2 excited by uv light can be captured by these oxygen vacancies enhancing the separation of photogenerated hole electron pairs and improving the photoreduction ability 46 however the addition of excessive zr instead lead to a decrease in performance owing to the wider band gap and higher acidity of zro2 compared to tio2 adding excessive zr will decrease the material s response to light and cause a decrease in photocatalytic activity of the material after being excited and captured by the oxygen vacancies of zro2 the photogenerated electrons exhibited a strong ability to reduce metal ions such as cr vi and cu ii thus the entire photoreduction process of cr vi and cu ii can be described as follows the hole scavenger in the solution hcooh hcoona diffused and reacted with the photogenerated holes the cod value in the solution decreased from 15290 mg l to 14508 mg l and toc value in the solution decreased from 13078 mg l to 12614 mg l after 1 h illumination it indicated that some hcooh hcoona was oxided to co2 cr vi and cu ii also entered the external liquid film on the photocatalyst by diffusion and were adsorbed by the photocatalyst surface however these ions have different potentials at 1 atm and 298 15 k as follows 47 1 c r 2 o 7 2 14 h 6 e 2 c r 3 7 h 2 o e 1 33 0 0591 6 lg c r 2 o 7 2 h 14 c r 3 2 v 2 c u 2 2 e cu s e 0 34 0 0295 lg c u 2 v 3 2 h 2 e h 2 g e 0 00 0 0591 lg h v 4 c r 3 3 e cr s e 0 74 0 0197 lg c r 3 according to nernst equation the calculated redox potential of cr2o7 2 was higher than 0 83 v but cu2 and h was 0 24 and 0 18 v cr3 was lower than 0 74 ev respectively so cr vi photoreduction occurred preferentially before cu ii reduction by the excited electrons the reduced product cr iii was adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface delaying the reduction of cu ii and lowering the total cr concentration of the water this can explain the earlier photoreduction of cr vi and the delay in cu ii photoreduction when the two ions coexisted in solution however under acidic conditions the adsorbed cr iii could be released by exchange with cations such as cu2 h and na as revealed by the observation that the total cr concentration increased after reaching its lowest point a simple experiment was designed in which cr no3 3 was used to replace cr vi and 1 ml of hcooh hcoona was added to perform photoreduction with ti0 95zr0 05 300 as shown in fig 9 a the total cr concentration decreased from 0 to 3 min but increased with subsequent light irradiation this behavior confirmed the unstable adsorption of cr iii on the photocatalyst surface under acidic conditions which could result in the increase in total cr content owing to ion exchange with cr iii the result when the scavenge was removed from the solution used for photoreduction of the cr vi cu ii hybrid solution is shown in fig 9 b cu ii was not photoreduced owing to the absence of the scavenger the slight decrease in the cu concentration can be ascribed to its adsorption however the cr vi and total cr concentrations both decreased simultaneously no subsequent increase in the total cr content was detected the possible ions for exchange with the adsorbed photoreduced cr iii in this scenario were determined to be na or h introduced by the scavenger and not cu2 in the hybrid solution note however that the adsorbed cr iii on the catalyst surface can be well removed by hno3 28 48 in addition the ph of the solution changes during photoreduction after photoreduction the ph of the pure cr vi cu ii hybrid solution without the scavenger changed from 3 to 3 5 in contrast the ph changed only from 3 to 3 2 when hcooh hcoona was used as a hole scavenger if we consider also that cr iii replaces na on titanate nanotubes by ion exchange 49 it can be concluded that ion exchange between the dissociative h and adsorbed cr iii resulted in the later increase in the total cr content during photoreduction thus the delay in cu ii photoreduction can be explained because the active sites of the photocatalyst were covered by photoreduced cr iii only after the deposited cr iii was released could subsequent photoreduction of cu ii occur if the scavenger was present at the beginning of the cr iii release stage the cu ii was reduced and deposited to form cu 0 dots on the photocatalyst surface this initiated the schottky barrier effect and thus accelerated photoreduction of cu ii which had been observed in photoreduction of the pure cu ii solution consequently photoreduction of cu ii in the hybrid solution with ti0 95zr0 05 300 exhibited an initial inert stage a subsequent slow pre photoreduction stage and a final acceleration stage photoreduction of cu ii cr vi hybrid wastewater by ti0 95zr0 05 300 under uv irradiation is illustrated in scheme 1 first cu ii and cr vi in the hybrid solution diffused to the surface of ti0 95zr0 05 300 but photoreduction of the adsorbed cr vi occurred preferentially to form deposited cr iii under uv irradiation then the reduced cr iii was replaced by h releasing the active sites for cu ii photoreduction as more cu 0 was reduced and deposited on the surface the schottky barrier effect was initiated and accelerated the subsequent photoreduction of cu ii finally all the cu ii was removed from the water cr vi was completely reduced and most of the reduced cr iii was immobilized although some existed as dissociated ions in the water 5 conclusion a solid solution tio2 zro2 exhibited excellent photoreduction performance in one step treatment of cu ii and cr vi in a hybrid solution under uv irradiation the obtained water reached the discharge standards with a cr vi concentration of 0 5 mg l at 5 min and a cu ii concentration of 0 11 mg l at 17 min after four cycles the removal rates of cr vi and cu ii were still 100 and 91 respectively the photocatalytic performance of tio2 was effectively enhanced by adding zro2 to obtain ti0 95zr0 05 300 early photoreduction of cr vi occurred owing to the low reduction potential but the reduction product cr iii was released by ion exchange with h photoreduction of cu ii occurred subsequently and was effectively accelerated by the schottky barrier effect of cu 0 deposited on the photocatalyst surface in the initial stage only a small amount of low toxicity cr iii remained in the aqueous solution after photocatalysis this work showed that ti0 95zr0 05 300 can efficiently degrade cu ii and cr vi in one step by photoreduction under acidic conditions providing a reference for treating complicated wastewater with coexisting heavy

14163,a solid solution photocatalyst tio2 zro2 was used to simultaneously remove coexisting cu ii and cr vi from wastewater by photoreduction results showed that the two heavy metal ions can be effectively removed from the hybrid wastewater simultaneously by ti0 95zr0 05 under uv irradiation with hcooh hcoona as the sacrificial agent the obtained water reached the discharge standards with a cr vi concentration of 0 5 mg l at 5 min and a cu ii concentration of 0 11 mg l at 17 min the solid solution exhibited excellent stability after four cycles with cr vi and cu ii removal rates of 100 and 91 respectively however reduction of cr vi was observed first and cu ii was subsequently reduced at an accelerated rate this behavior was ascribed to the stronger oxidization of cr vi compared to cu ii and the schottky effect of photodeposited cu keywords photoreduction solid solution cu ii cr vi simultaneous removal 1 introduction with rapid technological development the metal electroplating industry is producing a large amount of heavy metal wastewater among heavy metals cr vi and cu ii are common and usually coexist in wastewater posing a serious threat to human health common methods for treating cr vi and cu ii include electrochemical reduction 1 chemical precipitation 2 adsorption 3 4 and ion exchange 5 however addition of external reagents or a generated desorption solution during these processes could cause secondary pollution and raise the treatment cost 6 developing a green energy efficient heavy metal ion treatment process is desirable and necessary photocatalysis has been a promising green low cost technology to treat heavy metal ion pollution since it was proposed by fujishima in 1972 7 electrons generated by a photocatalyst under light irradiation can reduce some heavy metal ions to low toxicity or even nontoxic substances if the conduction band cb of the photocatalyst is low enough 8 in this process only light energy is required to excite the photocatalyst the photocatalysts tio2 9 10 zro2 11 and zno 12 are commonly employed to treat heavy metal ions in wastewater owing to their low cost and stable performance in cr vi photoreduction treatment cr vi is typically photoreduced to cr iii which has low toxicity and the ph value of the solution is then adjusted to cause the cr iii to precipitate various photocatalysts including metal oxides 13 sulfide 14 metal organic framework materials 15 and g c3n4 16 17 have been used to perform this photoreduction among them tio2 is widely accepted as the primary photocatalyst owing to its low cost and stability and zro2 can be used as an additive to obtain a binary solid solution tio2 zro2 where zro2 promotes the quantum efficiency of tio2 and enhances cr vi adsorption on the photocatalyst surface 18 19 although cu ions could be removed by g c3n4 via photoreduction tio2 based catalysts have also been widely tested for cu ii photoreduction 20 cu ii can be effectively removed by tio2 at any acidic ph value 21 by introducing a zr component into tio2 photoreduction of cu ii can be intensified 22 in the electroplating industry cr vi and cu ii often coexist in wastewater but photoreduction treatment of hybrid cr vi and cu ii solutions is rarely reported preliminary research suggests that a solid solution of tio2 zro2 is a possible candidate for one step removal of aqueous cr vi and cu ii therefore in this work a series of binary solid solutions of tio2 zro2 with different zr contents was prepared and to simultaneously remove cr vi and cu ii from water under ultraviolet uv irradiation the interaction of cr vi and cu ii in the photoreduction process was investigated and discussed in detail a possible process for simultaneously treating cr vi and cu ii by photoreduction was proposed 2 experimental 2 1 materials butyl titanate zirconium n butoxide isopropanol and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab were used as reactants to prepare the photocatalyst potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 copper sulfate pentahydrate cuso4 5h2o and nitric acid hno3 were used to prepare simulated wastewater all chemical reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from chengdu kelon reagent co ltd chengdu china and used without further purification 2 2 synthesis of tio2 zro2 butyl titanate and zirconium n butoxide were used as raw materials to synthesize catalysts by a sol gel method 22 forty milliliters of isopropanol 10 ml of a mixture of butyl titanate and zirconium n butoxide where the volume fraction of butyl titanate was x and that of zirconium n butoxide was y and an arbitrary amount of ctab were added to the beaker under magnetic stirring to obtain a mixture then a certain amount of 10 v v isopropanol aqueous solution was added dropwise to the mixture the mixture was stirred for 4 h and the gel was obtained after centrifugation then the gel was washed with deionized water tio2 zro2 was obtained after the gel was dried and calcined at z c for 4 h the obtained solid was the final product and is denoted as tixzry z the mass ratio of ti and zr in tixzry z was shown in table s1 which was analyzed by xrf axios petro netherlands 2 3 evaluation of photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic performance of three simulated wastewater samples a 20 mg l cr vi solution 20 mg l cu ii solution and cu ii cr vi hybrid solution with 20 mg l of cu ii and 20 mg l of cr vi were evaluated the ph value of the three solutions was adjusted to 3 using hno3 an arbitrary amount of tixzry z was added to 20 ml of simulated wastewater in a quartz tube and 1 ml of hcooh hcoona was added as the sacrificial reagent the quartz tube was placed in a photoreactor cel lab500 zhongjiajinyuan beijing and photoreduction was performed under uv irradiation then the solution was sampled to determine the cr vi concentration using uv vis spectrophotometry uv 1500 pc shimadzu 11 and the total concentrations of cr and cu were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icap7400 thermo fisher scientific usa 2 4 characterization the crystal phases of tio2 zro2 were investigated by powder x ray diffraction xrd dandong haoyuan dx 2700 china at scanning angles of 20 to 80 and the light response of the catalysts was characterized by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry drs perkinelmer lambda 750s perkinelmer co ltd usa in a scanning range of 250 to 900 nm fourier transform infrared spectroscopy model spectrum two li10014 perkinelmer was used to characterize the ti0 95zr0 05 300 solution and the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of ti0 95zr0 05 300 was analyzed by a micromeritics asap 2460 analyzer the brunauer emmett teller specific surface area was calculated from the n2 adsorption isotherms in a relative pressure range of 0 05 0 20 the pore size distributions were calculated from the adsorption isotherms at a relative pressure of 0 994 by the barrett joyner halenda method in addition x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps of the catalysts after photoreduction of simulated cu ii cr vi wastewater was performed using a thermo scientific x ray photoelectron spectrometer escalab 250xi usa with an al kα monochromatized x ray source e 1486 6 ev the binding energies were corrected using the c 1s line at 284 8 ev 23 further the morphologies of the catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem regulus 8230 hitachi japan and transmission electron microscopy tem fei titan g2 60 300 ac tem usa at the same time the zr cr cu ti and o distributions on the surface of the catalyst after photoreduction of the simulated cu ii cr vi wastewater for 20 min were observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy high angle annular dark field haadf stem mapping 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of tio2 zro2 solid solution the effect of the zr content of the tio2 zro2 photocatalyst on photoreduction was investigated to determine the optimal zr content for treating cu ii cr vi wastewater because the photocatalytic performance of the tio2 zro2 solid solution varied greatly depending on its composition therefore a series of solid solutions was prepared to select the optimal photocatalyst the uv vis drs results in fig 1 a show that the adsorption edges of all the solid solutions are intermediate between those of pure tio2 and zro2 but are closer to that of tio2 owing to the high tio2 content with increasing zro2 content of the solid solution the adsorption edge is blue shifted this observation suggests that the usable light spectrum of the tio2 zro2 solution is wider than that of pure zro2 but narrower than that of pure tio2 the data were converted to αһʋ 2 and һʋ values using the kubelka munk formula ahν 2 a hν e g the resulting plots fig 1b confirm that the band gaps of all the tixzry samples are between that of tio2 3 13 ev and that of zro2 5 05 ev indicating that all of the samples can be excited only by uv light however the fact that all of the calculated values for tixzry are slightly larger than 3 13 ev confirms that the tio2 component is dominant in the energy structure of the tixzry solution adding zro2 enhanced the photoreduction capacity but was not conducive to effective utilization of solar light energy xrd results fig s1a confirmed that with increasing zro2 content of the solid solution the peaks of anatase tio2 gradually weakened and the crystallinity of the tixzry samples also gradually decreased until the raw materials of n butoxide zirconium and butyl titanate reach a 1 1 ratio the acquired ti0 5zr0 5 sample can be considered to be in the amorphous state because all of the peaks vanish in this adjustment process no characteristic peak of zro2 can be detected confirming that in the series of tio2 zro2 solutions tio2 is the main component and zro2 is evenly dispersed inside the solutions the performance of the solid solutions in photoreduction of cu ii cr vi wastewater is shown in fig 1 c when the zirconium n butoxide volume fraction of the solution was intermediate 0 0 1 the cr vi removal rate was 100 and the total cr removal rate increased from 55 to 60 outside of this zr content range the total cr removal rate decreased with increasing zr content although the cr vi removal rate remained at 100 however the maximum cu ii removal was obtained at a zr content of 0 05 this result confirmed that adding zr significantly improved the photoreduction performance of tio2 which can be ascribed to enhancement of the photogenerated charge when a small amount of zr was added 18 however the addition of excessive zr instead lead to a decrease in performance owing to the wider band gap and higher acidity of zro2 compared to tio2 therefore the tio2 zro2 solution with the optimal zr content was determined to be ti0 95zr0 05 next the effect of the calcination temperature of ti0 95zr0 05 was investigated the crystal pattern of ti0 95zr0 05 in fig s1b confirmed that the peak intensity of anatase increased with increasing temperature indicating that higher temperature facilitates crystallization of the catalyst however at 700 c a transformation of ti0 95zr0 05 from anatase to rutile was observed suggesting possible degradation of the photocatalytic performance the uv vis drs result in fig s1c and calculated band gap in fig s1d confirmed the negligible effect of the calcination temperature on the solid solution s energy structure this inference is confirmed by the performance evaluation results in fig 1 d the removal rates of cr vi cu ii and total cr remained almost unchanged until the calcination temperature reached 700 c the removal rate of cu ii decreased sharply but that of total cr increased slightly this behavior should be ascribed to the appearance of rutile tio2 with a 0 9 ev electron trap on the cb and a higher surface area 24 25 at a high calcination temperature therefore 300 c was selected for calcining ti0 95zr0 05 to reduce energy use catalysts 1 g l reaction time 1 h hcooh hcoona 1 ml 3 2 optimization of photoreduction conditions the effects of the operation parameters including the catalyst concentration light intensity catalyst particle size and stirring speed on the performance of ti0 95zr0 05 300 were determined to exclude their possible influence on the photoreduction performance as shown in fig 2 a cr vi was completely removed at ti0 95zr0 05 300 contents between 1 and 5 g l and the total cr removal rate remained approximately 59 however the highest cu ii removal rate was reached at content of 3 g l this result indicated that cr vi was easier to remove than cu ii and photoreduction of cu ii was seriously affected by the catalyst content owing to the shielding effect therefore the lighting conditions were varied to determine their effect as shown in fig 2b only approximately 25 of the total cr can be removed by ti0 95zr0 05 300 in the dark which was ascribed to adsorption of the photocatalyst as shown in fig s3 a and s3 b the catalyst particle size and the stirring speed of the catalytic system had no significant effect on the photocatalytic activity of ti0 95zr0 05 300 under light which meant that the rate limiting step in this process was not diffusion the ph value of an aqueous system usually has a strong effect on photoreduction owing to differences in the h and oh concentrations and possible corrosion of solid photocatalysts fig 2 c shows the effect of ph values of 1 3 because most electroplating wastewater is strongly acidic the removal of cr vi increased gradually with increasing ph but the removal of cu ii increased significantly when the ph was 3 approximately 99 8 of the cu ii was completely removed by ti0 95zr0 05 300 by photoreduction next the photoreduction performance of ti0 95zr0 05 300 was compared with that of a typical commercial photocatalyst p25 under visible light and uv irradiation as shown in fig 2d both cr vi and cu ii in the cu ii cr vi hybrid solution can be well photoreduced by ti0 95zr0 05 300 and p25 in 30 min under uv irradiation but ti0 95zr0 05 300 exhibited better removal efficiency however ti0 95zr0 05 300 had a significantly higher total cr removal rate than p25 when visible light was used instead the cr vi and total cr removal rates of ti0 95zr0 05 300 69 1 and 41 2 were remarkably better than those of p25 32 5 and 23 5 respectively this result demonstrates that the ti0 95zr0 05 solid solution may outperform p25 when applied to treatment of cu ii cr vi hybrid wastewater the optimal operation conditions for further solid solution photocatalytic performance evaluation and investigation were determined to be 3 g l and a ph of 3 3 3 photocatalytic performance of ti0 95zr0 05 300 to determine the mechanism and kinetics of photoreduction and the possible interaction between cr vi and cu ii during photoreduction simulated solutions with a single component were used to clarify the photoreduction process using ti0 95zr0 05 300 fig 3 a shows the results of photoreduction of the cr vi solution photodegradation of cr vi was remarkably rapid with a 97 2 removal rate at 3 min at which time the cr vi concentration was lower than 0 5 mg l the chinese discharge standard for the cr vi content of wastewater gb 8978 1996 however the total cr removal behavior was different early in the process at 3 min the cr concentration also decreased however as the illumination time increased the cr content rose instead for photoreduction to pure cu ii fig 3 b shows that the degradation rate from 0 to 3 min was relatively slow so this can be regarded as a pre photoreduction stage but the rate increased between 3 and 8 min thereafter the rate decreased again until the final cu ii concentration reached 0 03 mg l after 15 min meeting the wastewater discharge standard the acceleration in the intermediate period should be ascribed to the schottky barrier effect caused by cu deposited on the photocatalyst surface 26 27 the photoreduction plot of coexisting cr vi and cu ii is shown in fig 3 c the cr vi removal rate decreased slightly compared with that of the pure cr vi solution but still reached 98 4 in 5 min meeting the wastewater discharge standard the total cr content still showed first a decrease and then an increasing tendency as the light illumination time increased it can be concluded that the presence of cu ii did not affect the photoreduction of cr vi in consideration of the total ion concentration increasing however the decrease in the cu ii concentration was significantly changed by the presence of cr vi in the first 10 min the cu ii content decreased at a negligible rate then slow photodegradation of cu ii occurred within 10 15 min in the pre photoreduction stage next the cu ii concentration decreased sharply to 0 11 mg l in 2 min the original bright yellow cu ii cr vi solution became colorless and transparent and clean water was obtained in 17 min using ti0 95zr0 05 300 under uv light inhibition of photoreduction of cu ii by cr vi was observed but cu ii could still be effectively removed although the onset of cu ii removal was delayed until the cr vi was completely converted the used ti0 95zr0 05 300 was reused after being washed with hno3 10 wt to remove the metal deposited on the surface 28 as shown in fig 3d the cr vi removal by this sample in 30 min remained unchanged both the four cycle experiment cr vi in the solution could be completely photoreduced to cr iii the removal efficiency was from 98 9 to 100 although the cu ii removal showed a slight decrease after four cycles the removal efficiency reduced from 97 5 to 91 0 confirming its excellent reusability 4 discussion 4 1 species of cu ii cr vi present on ti0 95zr0 05 according to the experimental results all the metal ions both cr vi and cu ii were effectively removed from the aqueous system and captured and immobilized by the photocatalyst therefore it is necessary to identify the cr and cu species on the ti0 95zr0 05 surface as shown by the tem images in fig 4 a and 4b the morphology of ti0 95zr0 05 before and after photoreduction was similar microsized irregular particles the only significant difference was that the used photocatalyst had a smoother surface the high resolution tem hrtem results in fig 4 c and 4d both show the typical 101 crystal plane of anatase no lattice fringes of zro2 and no cr or cu species can be detected this result should be attributed to their low concentrations and possible uniform distribution haadf stem mapping analysis was conducted to identify zr cr and cu on the used ti0 95zr0 05 300 sample as shown in fig 5 a well distributed cu cr zr ti and o were detected the distribution density of ti in fig 5 b is significantly higher than of zr in fig 5 c the distributions of cr in fig 5 d and cu in fig 5 e were relatively sparse but uniform without overlap confirming their excellent distribution and high dispersion however the detectable cu signal was approximately four times higher than that of cr indirectly confirming the unusual increase in total aqueous cr during photoreduction all the cu species can be entrapped and immobilized during photoreduction treatment but the reduced cr species was released from the photocatalyst surface to water causing the increase in the total cr content of the water the cr and cu species present on the tio2 zro2 surface were further investigated using the xps spectra of the used ti0 95zr0 05 300 sample the cr 2p and cu 2p spectra of the samples after 5 min of photoreduction and 20 min of photoreduction are shown in fig 6 a and 6b and fig 6c and 6d respectively the binding energy peaks of cr 2p at 577 4 and 586 8 ev which are attributed to cr iii could both be observed after 5 and 20 min but the peaks at 579 4 and 588 7 ev which are attributed to k2cr2o7 emerged after 5 min and vanished after 20 min of photoreduction 29 30 this behavior suggested adsorption of cr vi on the photocatalyst surface because of a large amount of n h on the surface increasing the adsorption sites for cr vi fig s2a and complete transformation of cr vi to cr iii by photoreduction with increasing illumination time however the cu signal was not observed on the photocatalyst surface after 5 min of light illumination but appeared after 20 min at 932 67 and 952 47 ev and is attributed to cu 0 31 32 this result confirmed that cr vi photoreduction occurred before cu ii photoreduction the xrd of spectra of ti0 95zr0 05 300 before and after photoreduction are compared as shown in fig 7 a before and after the catalytic reaction the phase structure of the material did not change significantly and all of them were anatase however compared with the fresh catalyst the crystallinity of the catalyst decreased significantly after the photocatalytic reaction there were no information about zr cu and cr here which may be due to the low content of the catalyst surface the uv vis drs spectra of ti0 95zr0 05 300 before and after photoreduction are also compared as shown in fig 7 b the absorption edge of ti0 95zr0 05 300 before and after use was 379 nm without an observable shift however the intensity of the response to visible light of the used photocatalyst increased significantly which can be ascribed to the localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect of cu 0 deposited on the photocatalyst under uv light 33 34 further a weak peak at 575 nm caused by excitation of spr in cu 0 was observed 35 37 this result confirmed that the cu species was cu 0 in agreement with the xps result the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of ti0 95zr0 05 300 fresh and used were shown in fig 7 c and d as shown in the inner fig 7 c and d according to iupac photocatalysts were mesoporous structure because their n2 adsorption desorption isotherm were iv isotherm the type h1 loop can be observed at p p0 0 40 0 80 whether fresh nor used ti0 95zr0 05 300 indicated that photocatalysts have a cylindrical communication channel with uniform pore diameter 38 40 and the pore size distribution curve of photocatalysts shows that the pores of ti0 95zr0 05 300 are mainly composed of mesopores with a diameter of about 4 5 4 6 nm due to cu and cr are deposited on the catalyst surface the specific surface area of the material decreased from 166 50 m2 g to 67 42 m2 g and the pore volume decreased from 0 24 cm3 g to 0 11 cm3 g after photocatalysis 4 2 photoreduction mechanism of cu ii cr vi and their interaction to determine the reason for the enhanced photoactivity of the tio2 zro2 solid solution the earlier photoreduction of cr vi to cr iii and the pre photoreduction stage of cu ii photoreduction it is necessary to understand the photoreduction mechanisms of cr vi and cu ii with ti0 95zr0 05 300 and their possible interaction xps analysis of fresh ti0 95zr0 05 300 was conducted as shown in fig 8 two distinct binding energy peaks of ti 2p fig 8a appeared at 459 02 and 464 78 ev which are separated by 5 7 ev they are attributed to ti o in tio2 the red shift of 0 5 ev in the ti 2p3 2 feature of ti0 95zr0 05 300 at 459 02 ev compared with the literature value 458 3 458 5 ev 41 43 should be ascribed to zr doping the zr 3d spectrum of ti0 95zr0 05 300 fig 8b shows binding energy peaks at 182 70 and 185 13 ev which are ascribed to zr 3d3 2 and zr 3d5 2 of zr4 respectively 44 peaks attributable to the oxygen vacancies of zro2 also appeared at 182 01 and 184 49 ev 45 46 the formation of oxygen vacancies should be ascribed to interaction between tio2 and zro2 which is consistent with the red shift of ti 2p3 2 thus tio2 and zro2 may act as the electron donor and electron acceptor respectively thus the oxygen vacancies of zro2 in the tio2 zro2 solid solution can effectively enhance the photoactivity of tio2 the electrons on the valence band of tio2 excited by uv light can be captured by these oxygen vacancies enhancing the separation of photogenerated hole electron pairs and improving the photoreduction ability 46 however the addition of excessive zr instead lead to a decrease in performance owing to the wider band gap and higher acidity of zro2 compared to tio2 adding excessive zr will decrease the material s response to light and cause a decrease in photocatalytic activity of the material after being excited and captured by the oxygen vacancies of zro2 the photogenerated electrons exhibited a strong ability to reduce metal ions such as cr vi and cu ii thus the entire photoreduction process of cr vi and cu ii can be described as follows the hole scavenger in the solution hcooh hcoona diffused and reacted with the photogenerated holes the cod value in the solution decreased from 15290 mg l to 14508 mg l and toc value in the solution decreased from 13078 mg l to 12614 mg l after 1 h illumination it indicated that some hcooh hcoona was oxided to co2 cr vi and cu ii also entered the external liquid film on the photocatalyst by diffusion and were adsorbed by the photocatalyst surface however these ions have different potentials at 1 atm and 298 15 k as follows 47 1 c r 2 o 7 2 14 h 6 e 2 c r 3 7 h 2 o e 1 33 0 0591 6 lg c r 2 o 7 2 h 14 c r 3 2 v 2 c u 2 2 e cu s e 0 34 0 0295 lg c u 2 v 3 2 h 2 e h 2 g e 0 00 0 0591 lg h v 4 c r 3 3 e cr s e 0 74 0 0197 lg c r 3 according to nernst equation the calculated redox potential of cr2o7 2 was higher than 0 83 v but cu2 and h was 0 24 and 0 18 v cr3 was lower than 0 74 ev respectively so cr vi photoreduction occurred preferentially before cu ii reduction by the excited electrons the reduced product cr iii was adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface delaying the reduction of cu ii and lowering the total cr concentration of the water this can explain the earlier photoreduction of cr vi and the delay in cu ii photoreduction when the two ions coexisted in solution however under acidic conditions the adsorbed cr iii could be released by exchange with cations such as cu2 h and na as revealed by the observation that the total cr concentration increased after reaching its lowest point a simple experiment was designed in which cr no3 3 was used to replace cr vi and 1 ml of hcooh hcoona was added to perform photoreduction with ti0 95zr0 05 300 as shown in fig 9 a the total cr concentration decreased from 0 to 3 min but increased with subsequent light irradiation this behavior confirmed the unstable adsorption of cr iii on the photocatalyst surface under acidic conditions which could result in the increase in total cr content owing to ion exchange with cr iii the result when the scavenge was removed from the solution used for photoreduction of the cr vi cu ii hybrid solution is shown in fig 9 b cu ii was not photoreduced owing to the absence of the scavenger the slight decrease in the cu concentration can be ascribed to its adsorption however the cr vi and total cr concentrations both decreased simultaneously no subsequent increase in the total cr content was detected the possible ions for exchange with the adsorbed photoreduced cr iii in this scenario were determined to be na or h introduced by the scavenger and not cu2 in the hybrid solution note however that the adsorbed cr iii on the catalyst surface can be well removed by hno3 28 48 in addition the ph of the solution changes during photoreduction after photoreduction the ph of the pure cr vi cu ii hybrid solution without the scavenger changed from 3 to 3 5 in contrast the ph changed only from 3 to 3 2 when hcooh hcoona was used as a hole scavenger if we consider also that cr iii replaces na on titanate nanotubes by ion exchange 49 it can be concluded that ion exchange between the dissociative h and adsorbed cr iii resulted in the later increase in the total cr content during photoreduction thus the delay in cu ii photoreduction can be explained because the active sites of the photocatalyst were covered by photoreduced cr iii only after the deposited cr iii was released could subsequent photoreduction of cu ii occur if the scavenger was present at the beginning of the cr iii release stage the cu ii was reduced and deposited to form cu 0 dots on the photocatalyst surface this initiated the schottky barrier effect and thus accelerated photoreduction of cu ii which had been observed in photoreduction of the pure cu ii solution consequently photoreduction of cu ii in the hybrid solution with ti0 95zr0 05 300 exhibited an initial inert stage a subsequent slow pre photoreduction stage and a final acceleration stage photoreduction of cu ii cr vi hybrid wastewater by ti0 95zr0 05 300 under uv irradiation is illustrated in scheme 1 first cu ii and cr vi in the hybrid solution diffused to the surface of ti0 95zr0 05 300 but photoreduction of the adsorbed cr vi occurred preferentially to form deposited cr iii under uv irradiation then the reduced cr iii was replaced by h releasing the active sites for cu ii photoreduction as more cu 0 was reduced and deposited on the surface the schottky barrier effect was initiated and accelerated the subsequent photoreduction of cu ii finally all the cu ii was removed from the water cr vi was completely reduced and most of the reduced cr iii was immobilized although some existed as dissociated ions in the water 5 conclusion a solid solution tio2 zro2 exhibited excellent photoreduction performance in one step treatment of cu ii and cr vi in a hybrid solution under uv irradiation the obtained water reached the discharge standards with a cr vi concentration of 0 5 mg l at 5 min and a cu ii concentration of 0 11 mg l at 17 min after four cycles the removal rates of cr vi and cu ii were still 100 and 91 respectively the photocatalytic performance of tio2 was effectively enhanced by adding zro2 to obtain ti0 95zr0 05 300 early photoreduction of cr vi occurred owing to the low reduction potential but the reduction product cr iii was released by ion exchange with h photoreduction of cu ii occurred subsequently and was effectively accelerated by the schottky barrier effect of cu 0 deposited on the photocatalyst surface in the initial stage only a small amount of low toxicity cr iii remained in the aqueous solution after photocatalysis this work showed that ti0 95zr0 05 300 can efficiently degrade cu ii and cr vi in one step by photoreduction under acidic conditions providing a reference for treating complicated wastewater with coexisting heavy

safe drinking water keywords magnetic graphene oxide removal of heavy metals disinfection drinking water 1 introduction freshwater includes 3 of the total water on earth out of which only 0 01 is available for human use unfortunately this limited amount of fresh water is also at risk due to urbanization industrialization and global evolution 1 this issue is more exasperated due to the absence of proper management and economic pressure in many developing countries alike developing countries pakistan is also facing serious water deficit and deterioration in many cities people currently have no approach to safe drinking water and are forced to drink the polluted water 2 in addition to less availability the quality of drinking water is also poor due to underprivileged water supplies shallow controlling system polluted water resources and unsustainable water consumption practices 3 water pollution due to various contaminants industrial chemicals heavy metals ions organic compounds and infectious microorganisms causes public health problems 4 the presence of toxic heavy metals in the drinking water is also one of the serious threats to the environment these heavy metals are non degradable and thus may easily enter in the food chain and causes serious public health problems and even deaths 5 the drinking water can also be microbial contaminated through seepage of human excreta and lack of proper disposal system of sewage and solid waste which results in various waterborne diseases including typhoid giardiasis intestinal worms diarrhea cryptosporidium infections and gastroenteritis which alone accounts for 2 5 million deaths each year in pakistan 6 7 today s enormous challenge is to remove these pollutants from drinking water to provide clean drinking water 8 many techniques such as coagulation chemical precipitation photocatalysis oxidation and adsorption are used for water purification 9 among such techniques adsorption is one of promising technique among all the water treatment methods due to dominance in the higher removal efficiency and low cost 10 it is considered as the leading approach in terms of nontoxicity simplicity and suitability since using of adsorption as techniques for treatment many modifications like bio adsorbent nano adsorbent composite adsorbents etc were used by many researcher 9 in past many materials have been widely used as adsorbents including multi walled carbon nanotubes kaolinite metal organic framework mof and activated carbon 11 12 qiu et al described thiol functionalization of metal organic framework and applied it for the removal of hg 2 the prepared adsorbent showed high adsorption capacity 714 29 mg g 1 for hg2 adsorption from water 13 farooq et al studied the removal of ni ii using multi walled carbon nanotubes mcnts electrodes 14 so far nano materials have progressively secured a center of attention due to their advantages such as availability of high active sites presence of functional groups and large surface area 15 out of many graphene has many applications in water purification due to its phenomenal nature graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo are the main derivatives of graphene the surface of graphene oxide is decorated with many active functional groups such as oh cooh c o and other hydrophilic groups 16 17 this highly functionalized operative surface of graphene oxide makes it a potential material for removing the pollutants from water 18 many researches have conducted graphene composites for the elimination of heavy metal pollutants 19 in 2012 lee et al prepared flower like graphene oxide go tio2 hybrid for the removal of heavy metals 20 li et al examined the adsorption behavior of u vi on go and rgo he concluded that the adsorption capacity of go was more than that of rgo he found that presence of active oxygen groups plays key role in the adsorption mechanism 21 in 2014 shuang yang et al investigated the effects of humic acid on copper cu ii adsorption onto few layer reduced graphene oxide frgo 22 another study was conducted in 2016 in which sitko et al developed graphene oxide cellulose membranes in order to perform the effective adsorption of heavy metal ions cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii 23 wang et al used highly sensitive method for trace detection of selected paes in water by gas chromatography mass spectrometry after solid phase extraction spe octyl c8 modified magnetic graphene oxide mgo c8 was used as adsorbent 24 in 2019 ma et al prepared modified magnetic graphene oxide ionic liquid mgo il for the first time and used it to adsorb and remove arsenic as iii and as v ions from aqueous solution with maximum adsorption capacities of 160 65 mg g 1 for as iii and 104 13 mg g 1 for as v respectively 25 in addition the application of iron oxide nanomaterials has received much attention due to their unique properties such as extremely small size high surface area to volume ratio surface modifiability excellent magnetic properties and great biocompatibility 26 magnetic separation by an appropriate magnetic field provides a convenient and low cost way for separation without using tedious filtration or centrifugation recently a variety of synthesis approaches have been developed to produce high quality nanoparticles ma et al prepared a magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer on msio2 fe3o4 for the removal of atrazine 27 kalantari et al utilized fe3o4 talc nanocomposite for removal of cu ii ni ii and pb ii ions from aqueous solutions to resolve separation problems 28 mollahosseini et al developed polypyrrole fe3o4 nanoparticle and applied for the removal of al 3 metal ions and achieved maximum adsorption efficiency of 100 7 mg g 29 upto our knowledge magnetic graphene oxide mgo has not been used as disinfectant for the efficient removal of pathogenic bacteria including yersinia ruckeri and antobacter agglomerans the removal efficiency of ecoli yersinia ruckeri and antobacter agglomerans in real water samples for mgo was achieved upto 98 787 97 150 and 97 689 respectively in this study mgo has also been employed as adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals pb 2 cr 3 cu 2 zn 2 and ni 2 and indicated maximum removal efficiency with efficient reusability the aim of this study is to combining graphene with magnetic nano particle to enhance the removal efficiency of heavy metals from drinking water the adsorption potential of mgo was evaluated on the basis of isotherms kinetics and thermodynamic analysis in addition mgo s disinfection ability against microbial strains

fecl3 6h2o and fecl2 4h2o were prepared with a 2 1 mole ratio respectively in 100 ml of distilled water the mixed solution fecl3 fecl2 was added slowly to the go suspension at room temperature for 20 minutes under rapid agitation drop wise addition of 30 ammonia solution was used to obtain 10 ph a black colored suspension was obtained this resultant black suspension was continuously stirred for 20 minutes at 85 c followed by cooling down at room temperature the resultant product was washed with deionized water and dried in vacuum at 69 c to obtain mgo go fe3o4 fig 1 b displayed the images of mgo 2 3 characterization techniques characterization of mgo was performed using uv vis spectrometer perkin elmer lambda 35 mgoftir jasco ft ir 4100 type a scanning electron microscope tescan vega 3lmu xrd panalytical vibrating sample magnetometer model 7410 and atomic absorption spectrophotometer perkin elmer 2 4 batch adsorption experiments heavy metals including pb 2 cr 3 cu 2 zn 2 and ni 2 were selected as target pollutant the adsorption conditions were optimized i e ph 3 9 contact time 10 65 mins and adsorbent dose 0 002 to 0 016 g kinetic and isotherm experiments were conducted under the optimal adsorption conditions the adsorption thermodynamics were studied at temperature ranging from 298 k 328 k the samples were analyzed in triplicated and also tested from pcsir laboratories lahore for reliability and quality checks occasional spiking was also performed for error and reproducibility the overall standard deviations of results was 1 63 0 39 ppm the removal efficiency re of heavy metals was calculated using following equation 33 1 r c o c e c o 100 where co initial concentration of metal ion mg l ce equilibrium concentration of metal ion mg l 2 5 disinfection control the invitro antibacterial effects of the mgo nanoparticles were tested against gram negative bacterial strains e coli yersinia rucker and enterobacter agglomerans these microbes are present in the tap water of different location in lahore 34 therefore selected as target bacteria these strains were purchased from punjab university agricultural department fungal bank lahore pakistan all glass wares and solutions used in this research were autoclaved at 1210 c for 15 minutes all cultures were preserved at 4 c the death rate of bacterial colonies is determined by disc diffusion method 35 2 6

hours the antimicrobial activity for control and experimental system was measured by evaluating the inhibition zone in media surface 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of adsorbent 3 1 1 uv vis spectrum of go and mgo the uv vis spectra of synthesized go and mgo was shown in fig 2 prior to the uv vis measurements the samples were dispersed in water by sonication from the fig 2 a it is evident that uv absorption peak of go appeared at 238 nm attributed to the π π transition of aromatic c c bonds in uv vis absorption spectra of go there was also broad shoulder appeared at 300 nm corresponding to the n π transition of co bonds 36 the uv vis absorption peak of mgo is presented in fig 2 b the characteristic peak of mgo appeared at 300 nm this red shift of the peak from 238 nm to 300 nm is due to the introduction of fe3o4 particles onto the surface of go which also leads to the covalent attachment of fe3o4 onto the go nanosheets 32 36 3 2 ftir analysis of go and mgo the presence of functional groups on go and mgo were analyzed by ftir the ftir spectra of go is shown in fig 3 a it is observed that go exhibited strong absorption peak at 3368 cm 1 corresponding to the oh vibration the absorption peak at 1704 cm 1 and 1635 cm 1 contributes to the c o carboxyl groups and cc aromatic groups respectively similarly the absorption peaks at 1353 cm 1 is attributed to oh bending vibration of carboxyl group in go and the band at 1007 cm 1 is attributed to co stretching vibrations of alkoxy groups the result was similar to previous study 37 the result of ftir indicated that the nanosheets of go was loaded with abundant of oxygen containing groups due to the presence of oxygen groups the surface of go provides the binding sites for the metal ions in the adsorption process ftir analysis confirmed the formation of graphene oxide go fig 3 b represented the ft ir spectra of mgo all go peaks remained in the spectra of mgo with significantly decreased intensities after chemical deposition of iron ions onto go sheets mgo showed the following characteristics peak the intensity of oh stretching vibrations decreased in the spectra of mgo which appeared at 3271 cm 1 the peaks at 1787 cm 1 and 1428 cm 1 are corresponding to co stretching of carboxyl and carbonyl the peak at 1130 cm 1 relates to co stretching vibrations of epoxy group another new peak at 1579 cm 1 was observed which can be attributed to the skeletal vibration of graphene sheets 38 the spectrum of the mgo consists of a unique and sharp peak of fe o at 586 cm 1 contributing to the stretching vibrations 38 39 the ir analysis confirmed fe3o4 particles have been decorated on the surface of go 3 3 sem analysis of go and mgo surface morphology of go nano sheet and mgo was examined by sem analysis fig 4 a exhibited the sem images of go it is observed that go has a structure of flakes and layers revealing them to have a rippled wavy folded shape and to be in thin layers with large surface area the edges of the exfoliated go sheets are crumpled due to the oxidation process this showed that go sheet had been successfully exfoliated from graphite consisting of stacked graphene layers 40 fig 4 b showed the sem image of mgo the fe3o4 nanoparticles appeared as bright dots the surface of go provides a matrix on which the fe3o4 nps were anchored the rate of loading of fe3o4 nps increases due to large surface area of wrinkled go the fe3o4 nps were unevenly distributed and heterogeneously deposited in bunches on the thin graphene oxide sheet due to agglomeration which is similar with previous reported work 38 41 3 4 xrd analysis of go and mgo the xrd pattern of as prepared go and mgo is presented in fig 5 our experimental results were comparative with the previous reported study 42 the diffraction peak of natural graphite appears near the 2θ 26 6 location basal plane of 002 with d spacing of 0 35 nm in the spectrogram of go fig 5 a the diffraction peak of graphite disappeared and a new diffraction peak of go appeared at lower angle of the 2θ 10 361 001 crystal plane with d spacing of 0 85 nm the increase in d spacing corresponds to intercalation of water molecules and the addition of oxygen containing groups into the graphene structure because of strong oxidation process as shown in fig 5 b the xrd patterrn of mgo exhibited the seven diffaraction peaks of fe3o4 at 2θ 30 45 35 67 43 59 53 81 57 65 62 75 corresponds to 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes of magnetite fe3o4 while there is a broad small peak at 2θ 26 4 002 corresponding to the graphene sheets indicated the formation of the fe3o4 go nanocomposites 43 the broad diffarction peaks in xrd suggest that the nanoparticles have small sizes the result indicated that fe3o4 nps are attached onto go successfully 39 44 3 5 vsm analysis of mgo magnetic properties of mgo were measured using vsm at room temperature and the magnetic hysteresis loops were obtained as an s like curve as shown in fig 6 the curve exhibited a super paramagnetic behavior the saturation magnetization ms of the synthesized mgo was found to be 38 emu g however it is still enough for magnetic separation of particles 3 6 adsorption studies 3 6 1 effect of ph the ph is a key factor that control the properties of adsorbate during reaction the ph range of 3 to 8 was selected to investigate the effect of ph on adsorption capacity of mgo the maximum removal efficiency was obtained as 89 612 for pb 2 at ph 5 92 033 for cr 3 at ph 6 92 433 for cu 2 at ph 6 90 383 for zn 2 at ph 7 and 92 233 for ni 2 at ph 8 as shown in fig 7 a the effect of ph for each metal could be described on the basis of ionic size and chelation taking pb2 as an example whose ionic size is 202 pm which is larger to other heavy metals would create more steric hindrance at low ph leading to less removal efficiency the adsorbed metal ions chelates with the functional groups such as c c c o o h and carboxylic acids which are present on the surface of the mgo and affects the removal efficiency at high ph the deprotonation of mgo enhanced the chelation between mgo and heavy metal ion as observed for cr 3 cu 2 and ni 2 more will be the ionic size and more will be the steric hindrance and less will be removal efficiency the results could be more explained by the degree of ionization of the pollutants and surface charge of the adsorbent the ionic state of various functional groups on the surface of mgo is another governing factor affecting the adsorption process 45 the zeta potential of mgo was determined to quantify the magnitude of charge on adsorbent surface 46 the phpzc value of mgo was found to be 3 5 at ph phzpc the oxygen containing functional groups are gradually protonated and the surface of mgo becomes electropositive with decreasing ph the surface charge of mgo becomes more positive which would deter the adsorption of m2 thereby reducing the removal efficiency due to stronger electrostatic repulsion the adsorption capacity increases by increased ph at ph phzpc the functional groups are deprotonated and the surface of mgo becomes more negatively charged more metal ions are attracted and attached on to the surface of mgo due to the strong electrostatic attraction and the removal efficiency is increased 45 47 3 7 effect of dosage the effect of mgo dosage on the adsorption performance of heavy metal ions was studied by varying amounts of mgo ranging from 0 002 g l to 0 016 g l the dosage of adsorbents determines the contact areas between the adsorbent and adsorbate the fig 7 b displayed that metal ions adsorption capacity decreased with increasing adsorbent dose this could be due to the increase in the surface area of the adsorbent and availability of more adsorption sites the adsorption increased slightly with the further increase in the adsorbent dosage which could be due to the saturation of adsorption sites 48 higher removal efficiency of 99 972 97 783 96 651 91 883 95 283 was achieved for pb 2 cr 3 cu 2 zn 2 and ni 2 with the mgo dosage of 0 014 g l and 0 016 g l respectively 3 8 effect of contact time the uptake rate of heavy metal ions onto adsorbent was described by the adsorption kinetics fig 8 showed the effect of contact time on the adsorption performance of heavy metal ion for mgo adsorbent showed superior performance with time fig 8 displayed that adsorption rate of pb ii cu ii and ni ii raised in 25 minutes while 35 minutes were required for cr iii and zn ii to reach equilibrium the reason of this phenomenon could be the rapid diffusion of heavy metal ions into the interlayer space of mgo due to strong attractive forces between m2 and mgo 49 50 the adsorption rate gradually decreased with contact time and remained nearly constant after 40 minutes however with the increase of time more and more adsorption sites were occupied and reached its saturating adsorption capacity eventually 3 9 adsorption isotherms modeling the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich isotherm models were selected to evaluate the adsorption behavior of all the heavy metal ions on to the surface of mgo the equations for the selected models are given below 51 52 2 l a n g m u i r i s o t h e r m q e q 0 k l c e 1 k l c e 3 freundlich isotherm log q e log k f 1 n log c e 4 t e m k i n i s o t h e r m q e b log a b log c e 5 dubnin raduskevich isotherm ln q e ln q 0 β ε 2 the linearized plots for the adsorption of metal ions onto mgo were represented in fig 9 all the isotherm parameters for different heavy metals are listed in table 1 the results indicated that the coefficient of correlation r2 for langmuir isotherm was higher than other three models 50 suggesting that the langmuir isotherm was more suitable for the mgo as compared to other three models for illustrating the adsorption r2 0 906 0 951 0 917 0 947 and 0 983 for pb 2 cr 3 cu 2 zn 2 and ni 2 respectively it also indicates the monolayer adsorption of heavy metal ions on the adsorbent furthermore the rl value of langmuir for studied heavy metal ions falls in the range of 0 1 indicating that the adsorption process was favorable 45 53 the calculated qmax was found to be 200 mg g 1 for pb 2 24 330 mg g 1 for cr 3 62 893 mg g 1 for cu 2 63 694 mg g 1 for zn 2 and 51 020 mg g 1 for ni 2 table 2 showed the adsorption capacities of metals ions on various sorbent and their comparative results indicate that mgo have better capability of adsorption whereas the experimental adsorption capacity for metal ions was 107 520 mg g 1 for pb 2 65 557 mg g 1 for cr 3 79 225 mg g 1 for cu 2 74 254 mg g 1 for zn 2 and 63 727 mg g 1 for ni 2 3 10 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics is a valuable tool to determine the removal rates of different metal ions adsorption kinetics were analyzed by pseudo first order equation and pseudo second order equation the equation models 52 are expressed as below 6 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 7 l i n e a r f o r m t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qt adsorption capacity at any time mg g qe adsorption capacity at equilibrium mg g k1 pseudo first order rate constant mg g min k2 pseudo second order rate constant mg g min the kinetic plots are shown in fig 10 the results of kinetics parameters are represented in table 3 it is observed from results that the coefficient of correlation shows a better fit for pseudo second order equation conforming the chemisorption this also suggested that chemical bond was formed in adsorption process by electron relocation share and transfer 50 3 11 thermodynamics studies to explore the impact of temperature on the adsorption efficiency and to evaluate the mechanism of adsorption system following equations were used to calculate the thermodynamics parameters such as gibb s free energy change δg0 entropy change δs0 and enthalpy change δh0 54 9 δ g 0 r t l n k c 10 δ g 0 δ h 0 t δ s 0 thermodynamics parameters were measured under different temperature 298 k 308 k 318 k and 328 k the effect of temperature on the adsorption of heavy metal ions is presented in fig 11 it is determined that percentage removal of heavy metal ions increased with increase of temperature demonstrating the endothermic nature of the reaction 47 50 the results of thermodynamic parameters are listed in table 4 the negative values of δg revealed that the adsorption process was feasible and spontaneous while the small values of δg showed that adsorptive forces were sufficiently active to overcome the potential barrier 45 adsorption process is of endothermic in nature is also confirmed by the negative values of δh the magnitude of δh represents the type of sorption the chemisorption generally falls into a range of 40 120 kj mol 1 55 therefore in given study heavy metals ions adsorption by mgo may be attributed to chemical adsorption process furthermore the negative values of δs indicated the decrease of randomness at the solid solution interface 3 12 antimicrobial activity of mgo two setup control and experimental were made to investigate the antimicrobial activity of mgo in control system commercially available disinfectant was used whereas synthesized mgo was used as disinfectant in experimental system the bacterial species were exposed to different concentrations of mgo nanoparticles 0 1 0 6 mg ml the inactivation was appraised by the disc diffusion method for 60 minutes fig 12 displayed the antimicrobial activity of mgo towards different bacterial species the results obtained from the antimicrobial activity of mgo against three gram negative microbes is expressed in table 5 the percentage relative effectiveness described the removal efficiency of disinfectant comparative to control system it is indicated that mgo exhibited favorable removal for e coli yersina ruckeri and antobacter agglomerans the toxic effect and sterilization rate toward the e coli and yersina rukeria were increased with the increasing concentration of mgo within 45 minutes and for antobacter agglomerans was 40 minutes it was noticed that mgo was 98 787 effective towards e coli with the dosage of 0 5 mg ml mgo also exhibited good removal efficiency for yersina ruckeri and antobecter agglomerans for 0 5 mg of mgo effectiveness of mgo was found to be 97 150 against yersinia ruckeri and for 0 45 mg of mgo effectiveness of mgo was 97 689 against antobacter agglomerans overall the results confirmed that the synthesized graphene composites mgo contained stronger antimicrobial nature towards different bacterial strains mgo displayed a higher inactivation percentage 98 78 97 68 after 45 minutes of exposure which means the prepared mgo possessed the strongest and fastest antibacterial performance the effect of mgo dose towards bacterial species is shown in fig 13 therefore it is concluded that bacterial removal is mgo dose dependent further it is concluded that mgo showed better removal efficiency due to large surface area of mgo which provide better contact area for the attachment of microbes with mgo 3 13 desorption and reusability of mgo an ideal adsorbent is assessed by its reusability the mgo of adsorbed heavy metal ions were separated by permanent magnet the desorption of adsorbed heavy metal ions from mgo was performed by washing with 0 1 m hcl solution under stirring after desorption recycled mgo was rinsed with deionized water 50 the regenerated mgo was dried under vacuum and used for adsorption desorption experiments the reusability of mgo was evaluated by four successive adsorption desorption cycles and the results are presented in fig 14 the total adsorption capacity of mgo for heavy metals ions remained in the range of 87 51 78 12 which demonstrates that the mgo possess good reusability the decrease in removal efficiency may be due to the loss of active binding sites on the surface of mgo during the adsorption and desorption cycles therefore mgo is an economic and efficient adsorbent for water purification 4 conclusion in this study magnetic graphene oxide was prepared for the effective removal of pb 2 cr 3 cu 2 zn 2 and ni 2 ions from aqueous solution the rapid magnetization of go to yield mgo was carried out within 20 minutes the characteristic methods ftir xrd uv vis sem and vsm confirmed successful functionalization process the maximum uptake of pb 2 cr 3 cu 2 zn 2 and ni 2 ions by mgo occurred at ph of 5 6 7 and 8 respectively and adsorption increased with increasing adsorbent dose from 0 002 to 0 016 g the maximum adsorption capacities obtained from the langmuir model for pb 2 cr 3 cu 2 zn 2 and ni 2 ions were 200 00 24 330 62 893 63 694 and 51 020 mg g respectively the adsorption process is fast which could reach adsorption equilibrium within 30 min and follow the pseudo second order kinetic model thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous endothermic and chemical in nature additionally magnetic graphene oxide demonstrated excellent antimicrobial properties with maximum removal efficiency of 98 787 97 150 and 97 689 towards e coli yersina ruckeri and antobacter agglomerans respectively on the basis of the experimental results magnetic graphene oxide has promising potential for removing the heavy metal ions for contaminated aqueous media and effective disinfection control with economical reusability 5 declaration of competing interest the authors of this manuscript have no conflicts of interest acknowledgement we are grateful to the institute of

ni ii ions were 200 24 330 62 893 63 694 and 51 020 mg g respectively the adsorption processes was spontaneous and endothermic followed the langmuir adsorption isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics model mgo action against microbial activity of e coli yersina ruckeri and antobacter agglomerans was also studied the results exhibited that mgo is a competent adsorbent and disinfectant for safe drinking water keywords magnetic graphene oxide removal of heavy metals disinfection drinking water 1 introduction freshwater includes 3 of the total water on earth out of which only 0 01 is available for human use unfortunately this limited amount of fresh water is also at risk due to urbanization industrialization and global evolution 1 this issue is more exasperated due to the absence of proper management and economic pressure in many developing countries alike developing countries pakistan is also facing serious water deficit and deterioration in many cities people currently have no approach to safe drinking water and are forced to drink the polluted water 2 in addition to less availability the quality of drinking water is also poor due to underprivileged water supplies shallow controlling system polluted water resources and unsustainable water consumption practices 3 water pollution due to various contaminants industrial chemicals heavy metals ions organic compounds and infectious microorganisms causes public health problems 4 the presence of toxic heavy metals in the drinking water is also one of the serious threats to the environment these heavy metals are non degradable and thus may easily enter in the food chain and causes serious public health problems and even deaths 5 the drinking water can also be microbial contaminated through seepage of human excreta and lack of proper disposal system of sewage and solid waste which results in various waterborne diseases including typhoid giardiasis intestinal worms diarrhea cryptosporidium infections and gastroenteritis which alone accounts for 2 5 million deaths each year in pakistan 6 7 today s enormous challenge is to remove these pollutants from drinking water to provide clean drinking water 8

invitro antibacterial effects of the mgo nanoparticles were tested against gram negative bacterial strains e coli yersinia rucker and enterobacter agglomerans these microbes are present in the tap water of different location in lahore 34 therefore selected as target bacteria these strains were purchased from punjab university agricultural department fungal bank lahore pakistan all glass wares

hours the antimicrobial activity for control and experimental system was measured by evaluating the inhibition zone in media surface 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of adsorbent 3 1 1 uv vis spectrum of go and mgo the uv vis spectra of synthesized go and mgo was shown in fig 2 prior to the uv vis measurements the samples were dispersed in water by sonication from the fig 2 a it is evident that uv absorption peak of go appeared at 238 nm attributed to the π π transition of aromatic c c bonds in uv vis absorption spectra of go there was also broad shoulder appeared at 300 nm corresponding to the n π transition of co bonds 36 the uv vis absorption peak of mgo is presented in fig 2 b the characteristic peak of mgo appeared at 300 nm this red shift of the peak from 238 nm to 300 nm is due to the introduction of fe3o4 particles onto the surface of go which also leads to the covalent attachment of fe3o4 onto the go nanosheets 32 36 3 2 ftir analysis of go and mgo the presence of functional groups on go and mgo were analyzed by ftir the ftir spectra of go is shown in fig 3 a it is observed that go exhibited strong absorption peak at 3368 cm 1 corresponding to the oh vibration the absorption peak at 1704 cm 1 and 1635 cm 1 contributes to the c o carboxyl groups and cc aromatic groups respectively similarly the absorption peaks at 1353 cm 1 is attributed to oh bending vibration of carboxyl group in go and the band at 1007 cm 1 is attributed to co stretching vibrations of alkoxy groups the result was similar to previous study 37 the result of ftir indicated that the nanosheets of go was loaded with abundant of oxygen containing groups due to the presence of oxygen groups the surface of go provides the binding sites for the metal ions in the adsorption process ftir analysis confirmed the formation of graphene oxide go fig 3 b represented the ft ir spectra of mgo all go peaks remained in the spectra of mgo with significantly decreased intensities after chemical deposition of iron ions onto go sheets mgo showed the following characteristics peak the intensity of oh stretching vibrations decreased in the spectra of mgo which appeared at 3271 cm 1 the peaks at 1787 cm 1 and 1428 cm 1 are corresponding to co stretching of carboxyl and carbonyl the peak at 1130 cm 1 relates to co stretching vibrations of epoxy group another new peak at 1579 cm 1 was observed which can be attributed to the skeletal vibration of graphene sheets 38 the spectrum of the mgo consists of a unique and sharp peak of fe o at 586 cm 1 contributing to the stretching vibrations 38 39 the ir analysis confirmed fe3o4 particles have been decorated on the surface of go 3 3 sem analysis of go and mgo surface morphology of go nano sheet and mgo was examined by sem analysis fig 4 a exhibited the sem images of go it is observed that go has a structure of flakes and layers revealing them to have a rippled wavy folded shape and to be in thin layers with large surface area the edges of the exfoliated go sheets are crumpled due to the oxidation process this showed that go sheet had been successfully exfoliated from graphite consisting of stacked graphene layers 40 fig 4 b showed the sem image of mgo the fe3o4 nanoparticles appeared as bright dots the surface of go provides a matrix on which the fe3o4 nps were anchored the rate of loading of fe3o4 nps increases due to large surface area of wrinkled go the fe3o4 nps were unevenly distributed and heterogeneously deposited in bunches on the thin graphene oxide sheet due to agglomeration which is similar with previous reported work 38 41 3 4 xrd analysis of go and mgo the xrd pattern of as prepared go and mgo is presented in fig 5 our experimental results were comparative with the previous reported study 42 the diffraction peak of natural graphite appears near the 2θ 26 6 location basal plane of 002 with d spacing of 0 35 nm in the spectrogram of go fig 5 a the diffraction peak of graphite disappeared and a new diffraction peak of go appeared at lower angle of the 2θ 10 361 001 crystal plane with d spacing of 0 85 nm the increase in d spacing corresponds to intercalation of water molecules and the addition of oxygen containing groups into the graphene structure because of strong oxidation process as shown in fig 5 b the xrd patterrn of mgo exhibited the seven diffaraction peaks of fe3o4 at 2θ 30 45 35 67 43 59 53 81 57 65 62 75 corresponds to 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes of magnetite fe3o4 while there is a broad small peak at 2θ 26 4 002 corresponding to the graphene sheets indicated the formation of the fe3o4 go nanocomposites 43 the broad diffarction peaks in xrd suggest that the nanoparticles have small sizes the result indicated that fe3o4 nps are attached onto go successfully 39 44 3 5 vsm analysis of mgo magnetic properties of mgo were measured using vsm at room temperature and the magnetic hysteresis loops were obtained as an s like curve as shown in fig 6 the curve exhibited a super paramagnetic behavior the saturation magnetization ms of the synthesized mgo was found to be 38 emu g however it is still enough for magnetic separation of particles 3 6 adsorption studies 3 6 1 effect of ph the ph is a key factor that control the properties of adsorbate during reaction the ph range of 3 to 8 was selected to investigate the effect of ph on adsorption capacity of mgo the maximum removal efficiency was obtained as 89 612 for pb 2 at ph 5 92 033 for cr 3 at ph 6 92 433 for cu 2 at ph 6 90 383 for zn 2 at ph 7 and 92 233 for ni 2 at ph 8 as shown in fig 7 a the effect of ph for each metal could be described on the basis of ionic size and chelation taking pb2 as an example whose ionic size is 202 pm which is larger to other heavy metals would create more steric hindrance at low ph leading to less removal efficiency the adsorbed metal ions chelates with the functional groups such as c c c o o h and carboxylic acids which are present on the surface of the mgo and affects the removal efficiency at high ph the deprotonation of mgo enhanced the chelation between mgo and heavy metal ion as observed for cr 3 cu 2 and ni 2 more will be the ionic size and more will be the steric hindrance and less will be removal efficiency the results could be more explained by the degree of ionization of the pollutants and surface charge of the adsorbent the ionic state of various functional groups on the surface of mgo is another governing factor affecting the adsorption process 45 the zeta potential of mgo was determined to quantify the magnitude of charge on adsorbent surface 46 the phpzc value of mgo was found to be 3 5 at ph phzpc the oxygen containing functional groups are gradually protonated and the surface of mgo becomes electropositive with decreasing ph the surface charge of mgo becomes more positive which would deter the adsorption of m2 thereby reducing the removal efficiency due to stronger electrostatic repulsion the adsorption capacity increases by increased ph at ph phzpc the functional groups are deprotonated and the surface of mgo becomes more negatively charged more metal ions are attracted and attached on to the surface of mgo due to the strong electrostatic attraction and the removal efficiency is increased 45 47 3 7 effect of dosage the effect of mgo dosage on the adsorption performance of heavy metal ions was studied by varying amounts of mgo ranging from 0 002 g l to 0 016 g l the dosage of adsorbents determines the contact areas between the adsorbent and adsorbate the fig 7 b displayed that metal ions adsorption capacity decreased with increasing adsorbent dose this could be due to the increase in the surface area of the adsorbent and availability of more adsorption sites the adsorption increased slightly with the further increase in the adsorbent dosage which could be due to the saturation of adsorption sites 48 higher removal efficiency of 99 972 97 783 96 651 91 883 95 283 was achieved for pb 2 cr 3 cu 2 zn 2 and ni 2 with the mgo dosage of 0 014 g l and 0 016 g l respectively 3 8 effect of contact time the uptake rate of heavy metal ions onto adsorbent was described by the adsorption kinetics fig 8 showed the effect of contact time on the adsorption performance of heavy metal ion for mgo adsorbent showed superior performance with time fig 8 displayed that adsorption rate of pb ii cu ii and ni ii raised in 25 minutes while 35 minutes were required for cr iii and zn ii to reach equilibrium the reason of this phenomenon could be the rapid diffusion of heavy metal ions into the interlayer space of mgo due to strong attractive forces between m2 and mgo 49 50 the adsorption rate gradually decreased with contact time and remained nearly constant after 40 minutes however with the increase of time more and more adsorption sites were occupied and reached its saturating adsorption capacity eventually 3 9 adsorption isotherms modeling the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich isotherm models were selected to evaluate the adsorption behavior of all the heavy metal ions on to the surface of mgo the equations for the selected models are given below 51 52 2 l a n g m u i r i s o t h e r m q e q 0 k l c e 1 k l c e 3 freundlich isotherm log q e log k f 1 n log c e 4 t e m k i n i s o t h e r m q e b log a b log c e 5 dubnin raduskevich isotherm ln q e ln q 0 β ε 2 the linearized plots for the adsorption of metal ions onto mgo were represented in fig 9 all the isotherm parameters for different heavy metals are listed in table 1 the results indicated that the coefficient of correlation r2 for langmuir isotherm was higher than other three models 50 suggesting that the langmuir isotherm was more suitable for the mgo as compared to other three models for illustrating the adsorption r2 0 906 0 951 0 917 0 947 and 0 983 for pb 2 cr 3 cu 2 zn 2 and ni 2 respectively it also indicates the monolayer adsorption of heavy metal ions on the adsorbent furthermore the rl value of langmuir for studied heavy metal ions falls in the range of 0 1 indicating that the adsorption process was favorable 45 53 the calculated qmax was found to be 200 mg g 1 for pb 2 24 330 mg g 1 for cr 3 62 893 mg g 1 for cu 2 63 694 mg g 1 for zn 2 and 51 020 mg g 1 for ni 2 table 2 showed the adsorption capacities of metals ions on various sorbent and their comparative results indicate that mgo have better capability of adsorption whereas the experimental adsorption capacity for metal ions was 107 520 mg g 1 for pb 2 65 557 mg g 1 for cr 3 79 225 mg g 1 for cu 2 74 254 mg g 1 for zn 2 and 63 727 mg g 1 for ni 2 3 10 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics is a valuable tool to determine the removal rates of different metal ions adsorption kinetics were analyzed by pseudo first order equation and pseudo second order equation the equation models 52 are expressed as below 6 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 7 l i n e a r f o r m t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qt adsorption capacity at any time mg g qe adsorption capacity at equilibrium mg g k1 pseudo first order rate constant mg g min k2 pseudo second order rate constant mg g min the kinetic plots are shown in fig 10 the results of kinetics parameters are represented in table 3 it is observed from results that the coefficient of correlation shows a better fit for pseudo second order equation conforming the chemisorption this also suggested that chemical bond was formed in adsorption process by electron relocation share and transfer 50 3 11 thermodynamics studies to explore the impact of temperature on the adsorption efficiency and to evaluate the mechanism of adsorption system following equations were used to calculate the thermodynamics parameters such as gibb s free energy change δg0 entropy change δs0 and enthalpy change δh0 54 9 δ g 0 r t l n k c 10 δ g 0 δ h 0 t δ s 0 thermodynamics parameters were measured under different temperature 298 k 308 k 318 k and 328 k the effect of temperature on the adsorption of heavy metal ions is presented in fig 11 it is determined that percentage removal of heavy metal ions increased with increase of temperature demonstrating the endothermic nature of the reaction 47 50 the results of thermodynamic parameters are listed in table 4 the negative values of δg revealed that the adsorption process was feasible and spontaneous while the small values of δg showed that adsorptive forces were sufficiently active to overcome the potential barrier 45 adsorption process is of endothermic in nature is also confirmed by the negative values of δh the magnitude of δh represents the type of sorption the chemisorption generally falls into a range of 40 120 kj mol 1 55 therefore in given study heavy metals ions adsorption by mgo may be attributed to chemical adsorption process furthermore the negative values of δs indicated the decrease of randomness at the solid solution interface 3 12 antimicrobial activity of mgo two setup control and experimental were made to investigate the antimicrobial activity of mgo in control system commercially available disinfectant was used whereas synthesized mgo was used as disinfectant in experimental system the bacterial species were exposed to different concentrations of mgo nanoparticles 0 1 0 6 mg ml the inactivation was appraised by the disc diffusion method for 60 minutes fig 12 displayed the antimicrobial activity of mgo towards different bacterial species the results obtained from the antimicrobial activity of mgo against three gram negative microbes is expressed in table 5 the percentage relative effectiveness described the removal efficiency of disinfectant comparative to control system it is indicated that mgo exhibited favorable removal for e coli yersina ruckeri and antobacter agglomerans the toxic effect and sterilization rate toward the e coli and yersina rukeria were increased with the increasing concentration of mgo within 45 minutes and for antobacter agglomerans was 40 minutes it was noticed that mgo was 98 787 effective towards e coli with the dosage of 0 5 mg ml mgo also exhibited good removal efficiency for yersina ruckeri and antobecter agglomerans for 0 5 mg of mgo effectiveness of mgo was found to be 97 150 against yersinia ruckeri and for 0 45 mg of mgo effectiveness of mgo was 97 689 against antobacter agglomerans overall the results confirmed that the synthesized graphene composites mgo contained stronger antimicrobial nature towards different bacterial strains mgo displayed a higher inactivation percentage 98 78 97 68 after 45 minutes of exposure which means the prepared mgo possessed the strongest and fastest antibacterial performance the effect of mgo dose towards bacterial species is shown in fig 13 therefore it is concluded that bacterial removal is mgo dose dependent further it is concluded that mgo showed better removal efficiency due to large surface area of mgo which provide better contact area for the attachment of microbes with mgo 3 13 desorption and reusability of mgo an ideal adsorbent is assessed by its reusability the mgo of adsorbed heavy metal ions were separated by permanent magnet the desorption of adsorbed heavy metal ions from mgo was performed by washing with 0 1 m hcl solution under stirring after desorption recycled mgo was rinsed with deionized water 50 the regenerated mgo was dried under vacuum and used for adsorption desorption experiments the reusability of mgo was evaluated by four successive adsorption desorption cycles and the results are presented in fig 14 the total adsorption capacity of mgo for heavy metals ions remained in the range of 87 51 78 12 which demonstrates that the mgo possess good reusability the decrease in removal efficiency may be due to the loss of active binding sites on the surface of mgo during the adsorption and desorption cycles therefore mgo is an economic and efficient adsorbent for water purification 4 conclusion in this study magnetic graphene oxide was prepared for the effective removal of pb 2 cr 3 cu 2 zn 2 and ni 2 ions from aqueous solution the rapid magnetization of go to yield mgo was carried out within 20 minutes the characteristic methods ftir xrd uv vis sem and vsm confirmed successful functionalization process the maximum uptake of pb 2 cr 3 cu 2 zn 2 and ni 2 ions by mgo occurred at ph of 5 6 7 and 8 respectively and adsorption increased with increasing adsorbent dose from 0 002 to 0 016 g the maximum adsorption capacities obtained from the langmuir model for pb 2 cr 3 cu 2 zn 2 and ni 2 ions were 200 00 24 330 62 893 63 694 and 51 020 mg g respectively the adsorption process is fast which could reach adsorption equilibrium within 30 min and follow the pseudo second order kinetic model thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous endothermic and chemical in nature additionally magnetic graphene oxide demonstrated excellent antimicrobial properties with maximum removal efficiency of 98 787 97 150 and 97 689 towards e coli yersina ruckeri and antobacter agglomerans respectively on the basis of the experimental results magnetic graphene oxide has promising potential for removing the heavy metal ions for contaminated aqueous media and effective disinfection control with economical reusability 5 declaration of competing interest the authors of this manuscript have no conflicts of interest acknowledgement we are grateful to the institute of
