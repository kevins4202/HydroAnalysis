7320,uncertainties about the age of base flow discharge can have serious implications for the management of degraded environmental systems where subsurface pathways and the ongoing release of pollutants that accumulated in the subsurface during past decades dominate the water quality signal numerical groundwater models may be used to estimate groundwater return times and base flow ages and thus predict the time required for stakeholders to see the results of improved agricultural management practices however the uncertainty inherent in the relationship between i the observations of atmospherically derived tracers that are required to calibrate such models and ii the predictions of system age that the observations inform have not been investigated for example few if any studies have assessed the uncertainty of numerically simulated system ages or evaluated the uncertainty reductions that may result from the expense of collecting additional subsurface tracer data in this study we combine numerical flow and transport modeling of atmospherically derived tracers with prediction uncertainty methods to accomplish four objectives first we show the relative importance of head discharge and tracer information for characterizing response times in a uniquely data rich catchment that includes 266 age tracer measurements sf6 cfcs and 3h in addition to long term monitoring of water levels and stream discharge second we calculate uncertainty intervals for model simulated base flow ages using both linear and non linear methods and find that the prediction sensitivity vector used by linear first order second moment methods results in much larger uncertainties than non linear monte carlo methods operating on the same parameter uncertainty third by combining prediction uncertainty analysis with multiple models of the system we show that data worth calculations and monitoring network design are sensitive to variations in the amount of water leaving the system via stream discharge and irrigation withdrawals finally we demonstrate a novel model averaged computation of potential data worth that can account for these uncertainties in model structure keywords groundwater base flow age prediction uncertainty atmospheric tracers 1 introduction the age distribution of water discharging from a catchment is an important integrated descriptor of how the catchment stores and releases both rainfall and contaminants kirchner et al 2001 mcdonnell et al 2010 for stream systems in which i base flow discharge constitutes a large fraction of total streamflow and ii contaminants of interest are transported primarily through the subsurface the age distribution of the base flow component of total streamflow is of particular interest as a predictor of system response to changes in contaminant inputs these conditions i e base flow domination of streamflow and subsurface domination of contaminant transport pathways are typical of many agro ecological systems where excess nitrates have accumulated in surficial aquifers during the past century and discharge years or decades after recharge burt et al 2008 tesoriero et al 2013 for example due to the ongoing release of these legacy nitrates from many agriculturally intensive areas loads to chesapeake bay tributaries and tidal waters have continued to increase in spite of significant management interventions on the land surface hirsch et al 2010 sanford and pope 2013 uncertainties about the age of base flow discharge can have serious implications for the management of degraded environmental systems like the chesapeake bay where the time scale of ecological response may be much longer than the time scale of public opinion or legislative action for such systems robust understanding of the lag associated with groundwater return times i e the travel time of water from recharge at the water table to discharge at a receiving stream are required in order to enable stakeholders and decision makers to see the results or explain the lack of results of management improvement measures this robust understanding of the groundwater lag includes the design of monitoring strategies that reduce the uncertainty of modeled base flow ages previous studies have described theoretical frameworks for computation of stream age e g botter 2012 gomez and wilson 2013 harman 2014 or used experimental methods to derive stream age from a measured in stream tracer species e g rodhe et al 1996 ogrinc et al 2008 hrachowitz et al 2009 in most experimental studies the input and output signals of the stable isotope δ18o are measured and combined with an assumed form of the travel time distribution ttd to infer the underlying distribution of flowpath ages discharging to a stream maloszewski and zuber 1982 kirchner et al 2001 mcguire mcdonnell 2006 however δ18o cannot detect the contributions of older groundwaters to stream age mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 stewart et al 2010 and is consequently not effective for resolving transport timescales in groundwater dominated systems a few studies have used tritium 3h individually or in combination with some other conservative tracer to date streamwater michel 1992 stewart et al 2010 peters et al 2013 but in stream 3h methods are increasingly limited by the return of atmospheric 3h concentration to pre bomb levels stewart et al 2010 methods involving other atmospherically derived dissolved tracers such as cfcs or sf6 are complicated by the in stream equilibration of dissolved gaseous tracers with the atmosphere though cf sanford et al 2015 and solomon et al 2015 for methods that correct for atmospheric exchange and thus infer base flow age from in stream measurements given the limitations of calculating age from in stream measurements groundwater return times and the ttd of base flow discharge must in general be computed by models that are first calibrated against some form of subsurface age information environmental tracers have been widely used in groundwater modeling to constrain the estimation of flow and transport properties sanford 2011 leray et al 2012 erdal and cirpka 2017 the use of a calibrated groundwater model to simulate ages elsewhere in the system may be considered a form of model prediction with an associated prediction uncertainty that may be reduced by additional data collection while previous studies e g abrams 2013 sanford and pope 2013 have used forward modeling methods similar to those implemented in the present work as a basis for predicting in stream ages few if any studies have conducted an uncertainty analysis for the age predictions examined the impact of important assumptions about boundary conditions or examined the relative influence of different types of data on the resulting ages this may be in part because few sites have datasets with the substantial number of groundwater age observations required to make such a study anything but a theoretical exercise similarly while other researchers have used linear and non linear tools to i calculate uncertainty intervals for a variety of predictions and ii evaluate monitoring strategies designed to reduce that uncertainty dausman et al 2010 fienen et al 2010 herckenrath et al 2011 brunner et al 2012 as far as we are aware no studies have examined the uncertainty of simulated base flow ages or considered how additional data particularly the measurement of subsurface tracers would increase our confidence in that age this is a significant gap in the literature given the need to reduce our uncertainty about system response times in order to better understand the potential impact of expensive management actions in this study we pair a uniquely rich age tracer dataset with numerical groundwater flow and transport modeling to examine groundwater travel times as well as the impact of modeling assumptions on these travel times for an intensively farmed coastal plain watershed agricultural best management practices have been widely implemented in this watershed during the last 10 15 years two types of age predictions are considered i characteristics of the in stream base flow age ttd and ii the return time of water from a particular plot on the land surface to the stream network the former prediction provides a measure of the integrated stream response to catchment wide implementation of bmps while the latter is useful for comparing candidate sites for new bmp implementation or for estimating the time required for an individual existing bmp to contribute to catchment recovery from contamination the study accomplishes four objectives first we compare uncertainty intervals for model simulated base flow ages calculated using both linear and non linear methods in order to determine whether linear prediction uncertainty tools provide a reliable surrogate for more computationally expensive methods when using atmospherically derived tracers to constrain model parameters and predictions second we show the relative importance of head discharge and tracer information for characterizing response times in this uniquely data rich catchment third by combining prediction uncertainty analysis with multiple models of the system we show the sensitivity of data worth calculations and monitoring network design to plausible variations in the flow regime finally we demonstrate a novel model averaged computation of potential data worth to guide future monitoring given the uncertainties about these variations 2 methods 2 1 overview of study site and data multiple 3d numerical simulation models of subsurface flow and transport were developed and calibrated in order to examine groundwater return times and the age of stream base flow and to assess the impact of boundary conditions on the results in a data rich environment the 61 km2 upper chester watershed study site is a low relief agricultural watershed drained by small gaining streams the chesterville branch usgs gage 1493112 and morgan creek usgs gage 1493500 subcatchments are the focus of this paper fig 1 agriculture in the upper chester area quickly expanded during the colonial era water quality in receiving streams particularly deteriorated during the last century due to inorganic fertilizer inputs that increased after 1940 böhlke and denver in recent years a variety of management practices aimed at ameliorating these agricultural effects and improving water quality have been implemented in the watershed nelson and spies 2013 because of the centuries long history of wide spread agriculture in the area it is expected that changes to the subsurface flow regime due to agricultural intensification e g land clearing occurred before the period of interest this study consequently uses the steady state approximation of the flow system to consider the timescale of subsurface linkages between agricultural management changes and in stream response as well as the uncertainties associated with those linkages the influence of seasonally variable hydrology on the age of base flow was left to be addressed in a separate paper the upper chester study site is underlain by variably permeable unconsolidated sediments that dip to the southeast böhlke and denver 1995 the topmost fluvial deposits of the pensauken formation and the underlying marine deposits of the aquia formation together form an unconfined surficial aquifer fig 2 that is responsible for the majority of base flow discharge to both morgan creek and chesterville branch böhlke and denver 1995 the surficial aquifer is underlain by a confining unit which likewise dips to the southeast outcropping at morgan creek and forming the stream bed sediments puckett et al 2008 the confining unit separates the surficial unconfined aquifer from the hornerstown aquifer the conductivity of the confining unit and the associated proportion of older pre agricultural water that discharges to morgan creek may be an important driver of stream water chemistry in morgan creek böhlke and denver 1995 bachman et al 2002 for ease of reading the hornerstown aquifer is hereafter referred to as simply the confined aquifer fig 2 locations with flow and or transport information used in model calibration and uncertainty analysis are shown on fig 1 the study site dataset includes long term monitoring of stream discharge at morgan creek and chesterville branch along with 69 wells with 10 or more water level measurements the age tracer dataset comprises 266 cfc sf6 and 3h measurements at 31 observation wells in the active model area dunkle et al 1993 ekwurzel et al 1994 busenberg and plummer 2000 the number of observations available and the type of tracer sampled varied for each well some wells were sampled once for a single tracer while other wells were sampled multiple times for multiple tracers note that the observation wells with tracer and head measurements are distinct from the irrigation wells described below 2 2 simulation of groundwater flow and tracer transport groundwater flow for the upper chester was simulated using modflow harbaugh 2005 a finite difference implementation of the general equation for groundwater flow through porous media for all model cases the model grid consisted of 116 rows 144 columns and 26 layers with square model cells 75 m across layer thicknesses were 2 m for the top 16 layers and 3 m or 10 m for the lower layers a deterministic hydrogeologic framework for the study site was constructed using lidar elevation data from the usgs national map http nationalmap gov and regional geologic unit elevation contours digitized by the maryland geological survey andreasen et al 2007 units that fall within the model domain were sampled onto the finite difference grid and adjusted to conform to local hydrogeological data that are available from previous studies in the area e g böhlke and denver 1995 drummond 1998 bachman et al 2002 the bottom of the active simulation volume corresponds to the bottom of the confined aquifer fig 2 more details regarding the development and implementation of the groundwater flow model are provided in the supplemental materials the inference of groundwater age from measurements of environmental tracer concentrations requires specifying the ttd of the water sample leray et al 2016 and engdahl et al 2016 collectively provide a thorough overview of the physical and mathematical foundations of both steady state and transient ttds green et al 2014 used a numerical groundwater model to generate ttds and solute concentrations at wells and then attempted to reproduce these true ttds and solute concentrations by calibrating several analytical ttds against environmental tracer data they found that while the complexity of the numerical ttds was difficult to reproduce with analytical ttds the resultant estimated solute concentrations were relatively insensitive to this discrepancy in this study steady state ttds for each tracer monitoring location were calculated using the particle tracking software modpath 6 pollock 2012 to derive kinematic travel times from the numerical groundwater flow simulation particles were evenly distributed throughout a cylindrical volume centered on the well screen for each tracer monitoring location and tracked backward to their recharge locations on the land surface each particle was then weighted by the calibrated recharge flux at that point on the land surface with all particles originating from the same tracer observation well combined to generate the steady state flux weighted ttd this method of generating the ttd assumes advection only conservative transport with the exception of 3h decay these assumptions are discussed in more detail below it should be noted however that while this is a dispersion free advection only process the use of a volume as opposed to a point or line for particle origination at each well results in a distribution of travel times effectively simulating near screen mixing of multiple flowpaths and mitigating some of the dangers of kinematic formulations of age varni and carrera 1998 troldborg et al 2008 the use of a volume to generate the ttd also improves continuity between simulated tracer concentrations as those concentrations change with parameter perturbations during the estimation process transport of the atmospherically derived tracers was subsequently modeled using a discrete implementation of the convolution integral for each sampling location the concentration time series for tracer species k is 1 c k t 0 c k atm t τ e λ t g τ d τ where ck atm is the tracer input function i e the time series of recharging tracer concentration for the tracer species the system functional g τ is equal to the ttd at that location and λ is the first order decay coefficient for radioactive tracers such as 3h and is equal to 0 for sf6 and cfcs the input function ck atm for each species was derived from the tracer atmospheric mixing ratios for north america fig 3 concentrations in air were converted to aqueous concentrations using henry s law and assuming constant values of 2 cm3 l recharged excess air and 10c recharge temperature busenberg and plummer 2000 used n2 ar ratios in groundwater to estimate the recharge temperature in the upper chester to be 10 5 1 3c and they found excess air in nearly all groundwater samples to be between 0 and 3 cm3 l dunkle et al 1993 similarly estimated the recharge temperature on the delmarva to be 9 2c from their simulation of a 2d cross section in the headwaters of the chesterville branch subcatchment reilly et al 1994 concluded that hydrodynamic dispersion in the study area was very small they estimated longitudinal dispersion to be less than 0 3 m and inferred from the sharp vertical fronts between nested wells that vertical transverse dispersivity was near zero for the present study initial tests compared the performance of two different approaches to the simulation of subsurface transport an advection only simulation using modpath pollock 2012 and a fully advective dispersive model adm using mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 correlations between the porosity and dispersivity parameters and the interference of numerical dispersion common to adm solutions for low dispersion systems made it difficult to distinguish values for those transport parameters with any reasonable certainty given the findings of reilly et al 1994 hydrodynamic dispersion in the upper chester was assumed to be negligible and advection only transport of cfcs sf6 and 3h using modpath was simulated given the generally oxic character of the upper chester surficial system and the agreement between apparent piston flow ages for the multiple tracers fig 4 transport of sf6 and all cfc species was assumed to be conservative cf szabo et al 1996 hunt et al 2006 while some field and laboratory studies have observed the non conservative behavior of cfcs due to degradation or sorption in a variety of hydrogeological settings e g cook et al 1995 bauer et al 2001 happell et al 2003 there is little if any evidence of these impacts or their supporting conditions in the upper chester for example cfc sorption is often positively correlated with the fraction of organic carbon f oc in groundwater systems plummer and busenberg 2000 but the upper chester has generally low organic content with the exception of localized areas of high organic content in small depressional wetlands that have been converted to agricultural use ator et al 2013 similarly while in some settings sf6 measurements can be biased by for example subsurface sf6 sources there is not evidence of these confounding influences in the upper chester 2 3 parameter estimation methodology and the development of multiple models the models discussed below were calibrated to historical conditions by estimating the recharge horizontal hydraulic conductivity vertical anisotropy and effective porosity fields recharge and horizontal hydraulic conductivity for each hydrogeological unit were specified as spatially distributed parameters using a regular grid of pilot points see pilot point locations in supplemental figs s2 and s3 one vertical anisotropy parameter was specified for each hydrogeological unit given the conceptual model and calibration constraints recharge and effective porosity parameters are highly correlated it is assumed that recharge is more heterogeneous than effective porosity in the upper chester therefore because of the highly parameterized flexibility allowed to the recharge inputs a single spatially averaged effective porosity value was estimated for the top model layer this porosity value was then assumed to exponentially decay with depth according to a decay parameter that was also calibrated in total hydraulic conductivity recharge and effective porosity for each model were specified with 239 parameters that were estimated using the parallelized beopest implementation of the inverse modeling software pest doherty 2010 details of the calibration process and regularization methods employed to constrain the highly parameterized fields are described in the supplemental materials within the general calibration framework described in the supplemental materials we examined the impact of important model structural uncertainties by calibrating models given six scenarios while sharing identical parameterization the models differ from one another with respect to i the base flow indices used to compare simulated base flows to the observations of total streamflow in morgan creek and chesterville branch or ii the representation of irrigation withdrawals these variations are further described as follows 2 3 1 variable assignment of base flow indices due to correlation between recharge and discharge the base flow fraction of total discharge i e base flow index or bfi in morgan creek and chesterville branch could not be treated as estimated parameters moreover it was one aim of this study to examine impacts of different plausible flow regimes on the prediction uncertainty methods described below the bfi was consequently used as a scenario variable sanford et al 2011 using chemical hydrograph separation methods found that for low relief coastal plain catchments similar to the upper chester base flow could constitute as much as 85 of total streamflow in contrast some base flow separation algorithms operating on the morgan creek and chesterville branch discharge time series suggest lower long term base flow fractions for example the digital filter used by the swat modeling suite arnold et al 1995 arnold and allen 1999 calculates that in the upper chester catchments base flow accounts for 60 70 of total streamflow preliminary water balance calculations suggested that given the streamflow records and previous estimates of recharge rates in the area a long term mean base flow index of 0 70 is the approximate lower plausible limit in order to query this range of possible scenarios we considered base flow indices of 0 70 0 78 and 0 85 for both morgan creek and chesterville branch resulting in a total of nine possible combinations of base flow indices the scenarios are hereafter referred to from low to high as baseflow scenarios a b and c when the designators occur in combination the first letter refers to morgan creek and the second letter refers to chesterville branch e g base flow scenario ba refers to the model instance for which the base flow index is assumed to be 0 78 for morgan creek and 0 70 for chesterville branch preliminary calibration performance suggested that morgan creek has a higher base flow index than chesterville branch this result is consistent with landscape features including a nursery in the chesterville branch headwaters that may contribute stormwater runoff and possibly irrigation return flows to the total stream hydrograph as a result of this apparent difference in stream behavior in this paper we only discuss three of the nine possible combinations of base flow indices namely scenarios ba ca and cb note that with respect to calibration these base flow indices function as assigned parameters that convert simulated steady state base flow to annualized average total streamflow observed for the calibration period each model is consequently calibrated against an identical set of observations and weights such that the optimized objective functions of the various calibrated scenarios can be used to compare model performance 2 3 2 variable simulation of irrigation pumping with the exception of the aforementioned commercial nursery in the headwaters of chesterville branch there is little reported pumping in the study area and most reported withdrawals do not begin until the late 1990s or early 2000s however some evidence suggests that irrigation withdrawals in the upper chester are under reported masterson et al 2016 compared reported irrigation withdrawals in the north atlantic coastal plain to estimated crop water requirements using the soil water balance method westenbroek et al 2012 and found that in many locations including the upper chester reported irrigation withdrawals during many years cannot account for the known agricultural exports under known climate conditions they generated a spatially distributed dataset of estimated unreported irrigation withdrawals by mapping the supplement between reported and calculated irrigation amounts to unreported irrigation locations the unreported locations were identified using remotely sensed indicators of irrigation activity e g center pivot circles evident in satellite imagery we similarly found that the total agricultural production in kent county md as reported by the national agricultural statistics service nass appears basically constant from 1980 to 2005 with the exception of a few years in the late 1980s an exception presumably due to drought conditions this suggests that irrigation withdrawals reported more recently may in fact apply to several decades during which irrigation was unreported in summary given the available data it is uncertain whether irrigation withdrawals in the upper chester were a negligible during the 1990 2005 calibration period or in contrast b higher than recently reported rates since as early as 1980 in order to account for this uncertainty in the modeling process we considered two pumping scenarios in the first scenario no pumping is included in the simulation in the second scenario we assumed that the steady state agricultural production corresponds to a steady state distribution of pumping that combines the reported locations and rates with the supplemental dataset generated by masterson et al 2016 these contrasting scenarios are labeled nowells and withwells respectively table 1 summarizes these six model variations and shows the associated model labels which are encoded as the composite base flow indices scenario pumping scenario in the remainder of the text each model is referred to by the label shown in table 1 2 4 simulation of base flow age in receiving streams and groundwater return times from points on the landscape for each calibrated model the steady state ttd of base flow in receiving streams was simulated using travel times calculated by modpath pollock 2012 particles were uniformly distributed across the water table and tracked forward to their discharge location the travel times of discharging particles were then weighted by recharge flux and aggregated by stream i e morgan creek or chesterville branch in order to construct the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf and the associated flux weighted age characteristics for each stream multiple candidate age characteristics were considered for discussion and uncertainty analysis in this paper including the mean and median stream ages as well as site specific characteristics of interest such as i the fraction of stream flow that recharged since 1940 the approximate time at which inorganic fertilizer use in the county began to increase ii the fraction of stream flow that recharged since 1990 the approximate date of peak nitrogen loading in the county or the fraction of stream flow that recharged since 2005 the approximate date at which accelerated implementation of bmps in the study area began mean stream age is not a meaningful indicator of land surface agricultural inputs because it can be overly influenced by older portions of the ttd that are pre contaminant and pre atmospheric tracer while the date specific characteristics of stream age are considered in the discussion in general our analysis focuses on the median age and its associated uncertainty the mean travel time to discharge for recharge entering the subsurface at the hypothetical bmp plot was calculated as a subset of the forward particle simulation by filtering for only those pathlines that recharged in the area of interest 2 5 prediction uncertainty analysis for simulated base flow ages and groundwater return times several methods for characterizing the posterior parameter variance and propagating that uncertainty to model predictions have been applied to hydrological models markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods use bayesian updating to formally derive post calibration parameter uncertainty kuczera and parent 1998 gallagher and doherty 2007 given i a defined error model ii an associated likelihood function iii and a probability distribution for transitioning the parameter vector from one candidate state to the next mcmc methods generate an ensemble of parameter vectors that converge on the actual posterior probability distribution in contrast generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue requires no knowledge of the error model it is thus more flexible with respect to the likelihood function and well suited to the common case of calibrating an environmental model for which model structural error is unknown and constraints include data of different types freer et al 1996 beven and freer 2001 jin et al 2010 the practical merits and theoretical questions concerning the use of glue as a substitute for formal bayesian inference have been widely discussed in the literature e g blasone et al 2008 stedinger et al 2008 beven et al 2007 jin et al 2010 we here only note the concept of behavioral parameter set which in the glue methodology refers to a parameter set that meets a user specified likelihood threshold and is used to determine which randomly generated parameter sets should be included in the uncertainty assessment the forward run times of most three dimensional numerical groundwater simulations present significant computational obstacles to deriving parameter uncertainty with glue or mcmc methods this is due to the number of model runs that those methods require and may be exacerbated for mcmc by the serial nature of the algorithm which limits the advantages of parallel computing resources the results of hassan et al 2009 suggest that for some numerical models a functional relationship between the i parameters of a meaningful likelihood function and ii the parameters of the groundwater simulation model can be derived from a reduced number of model runs and subsequently used as a proxy for the full forward simulation during the mcmc algorithm in general however parameter and prediction uncertainty for numerical groundwater simulations must be assessed with other methods for example calibration constrained monte carlo methods such as null space monte carlo nsmc tonkin and doherty 2009 herckenrath et al 2011 reduce the required number of model runs by using the information from a sensitivity based parameter estimation process to condition the parameter space from which individual parameter realizations are constructed due to their computational efficiency linear first order second moment fosm techniques are of particular utility for uncertainty analysis of numerical groundwater models fosm methods may be implemented using a linearized bayes theory that assumes local model linearity and gaussian variability for parameters predictions and observation noise dausman et al 2010 white et al 2016 under these assumptions the post calibration parameter covariance matrix may be calculated as 2 σ θ post σ θ σ θ j t j σ θ j t σ ε 1 j σ θ where σθ is the covariance matrix of prior parameter probability distribution in this case computed from the estimated bounds on parameter values j is the jacobian matrix describing the sensitivity of observations to parameter perturbations and σε is the covariance matrix of simulation error and measurement error here defined as a diagonal matrix populated by the inverse of observation weights with all off diagonal elements equal to 0 note that σθ post is a function of i the pre calibration uncertainty 1st term on right side of eq 2 and ii the post calibration uncertainty reduction that results from conditioning the system description on observations 2nd term on right side of eq 2 while eq 2 requires no information about the parameter values themselves and may be calculated before calibration occurs we first calibrated the model and then calculated the jacobian matrix j at optimized parameter values in order to reduce the impact of any model non linearity on parameter sensitivities the post calibration prediction uncertainty of prediction s may subsequently be calculated as 3 σ s post 2 z t σ θ post z where z is a vector of prediction sensitivities to changes in parameter values in this study post calibration prediction intervals for the stream base flow age metrics were computed using eqs 2 and 3 as implemented by the pyemu python library white et al 2016 given the non linearity of the input signals for atmospheric tracers used in calibration fig 3 prediction uncertainty intervals were also derived using a monte carlo method for each calibration scenario 5000 parameter realizations were randomly drawn from the posterior parameter variance matrix computed with eq 2 for each calibration scenario i the performance of realization j was defined as 4 p ij φ b j φ b i where φ bj is the objective function value for the realization eq s2 and φ b i is the lowest objective function for the calibration scenario for each calibration scenario prediction uncertainty intervals were then generated as a function of a performance behavior threshold e g for a behavior threshold of 1 5 realizations with p 1 5 were classified as behavioral such that their base flow age metrics were aggregated into uncertainty intervals while this monte carlo method does not formally specify the posterior parameter variance it provides a useful non linear comparison to the prediction intervals generated by eqs 2 and 3 in particular because both the linear and non linear methods project prediction uncertainty from the post calibration parameter variance derived with eq 2 it highlights the role of the prediction sensitivity vector z in the same projection as calculated using eq 3 the method has similar advantages to null space monte carlo tonkin and doherty 2009 in that it conditions the parameter draw with information derived from the calibration but does not require an assumption about the dimensionality of the solution space finally eqs 2 and 3 as implemented by pyemu were used to quantify the worth of both existing and potential data to predictions of interest for all model scenarios briefly stated the value of an existing observation to a model output may be calculated by i computing a baseline prediction variance using all available information then ii removing the information that observation provides from eq 2 namely by modifying its entry in the σ ε matrix then iii re calculating the prediction variance and computing the increase from the baseline this variance increase in the absence of an observation is a measure of that observation s worth similarly the value of a potential observation to a model output may be computed by adding the sensitivity of a potential observation to the information encoded in eq 2 namely by including a potential observation in the calculation of the j matrix and computing the decrease in prediction variance given this new information note that this should be understood as a calculation of where data should be collected in order to reduce the uncertainty of predictions made with the existing conceptual model rather than a guarantee that the uncertainty will be reduced that is the possibility exists that additional data will be inconsistent with the existing data set and thus require the parameters to be re calibrated or the conceptual model to be revised altogether for a more detailed description of the use of linear bayes theory to evaluate data worth see white et al 2016 2 6 model scores and multi model averaging as noted above and further described in the supplemental materials all model calibration scenarios began with identical initial parameter values and were calibrated against identical observations and associated weights this similarity allows use of the calibrated objective function eqs s1 and s2 for each scenario as a comparative measure of model performance in the remainder of this paper we discuss both i the individual results of the model instance with the lowest objective function as well as ii the patterns and multi model averages of the full set of six calibrated models for ease of reading we refer to the calibrated model with the lowest objective function as the most likely model insofar as it entails the parameter set including the assigned base flow index that best describes the existing dataset for purposes of multi model averaging we calculated a score weight for each model proportional to the post calibration reduction in the measurement i e non regularization such that φm 0 portion of objective function value eq s2 or 5 s i φ b 0 φ b i φ b 0 φ b where si is the score of model i and φ b0 φ bi and φ b are the measurement objective function values for the initial parameter set the calibrated parameter set for model i and the calibrated parameter set for the most likely model respectively note that for this formulation the most likely model is assigned a weight of 1 and the remaining models are assigned scores between 0 and 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 how old is the base flow and how uncertain is the prediction given the existing dataset in this section we briefly describe the simulated age characteristics of the two subcatchments before examining the impact of model scenario on prediction uncertainty fig 5 considers the simulated flow systems from the perspective of recharge location on the land surface for each of the calibrated models model scenario ba nowells had the lowest objective function and is therefore considered to be the most likely model model score 1 the cb nowells in contrast was the poorest performing scenario and received a model score of less than half the most likely model the effect of the outcropping confining unit on morgan creek ages is evident from the more complicated spatial distribution of return times in that catchment this effect is discussed in more detail below note that the national hydrography dataset nhd flowlines shown for reference in fig 5 include several up gradient agricultural swales as tributaries to morgan creek while these swales may be active in some events they do not appear to act as controls on the water table under steady state recharge conditions and thus may overlap the steady state groundwater divide all models show that some recharge along the groundwater divide between the morgan creek and chesterville branch subcatchments requires more than 75 years to discharge as base flow this means that some of the flowpaths discharging to the two streams still bear recharge that pre dates agricultural intensification given the advective dominated nature of the system and the consequent lack of subsurface dispersive mixing the contribution of agricultural contaminants from these older flow paths will increase in the future and may not peak for several years or decades the simulated groundwater divide corresponds most closely to the surface water i e topographic divide for the most likely scenario however for the remaining scenarios increases in total flow through the system either as driven by higher base flow indices or by higher irrigation withdrawals result in the recruitment of recharge from the higher elevations of the morgan creek catchment towards the chesterville branch drainage network the three darkest shades of grey in fig 5 show locations in the watershed where water that recharged as recently as 1990 the approximate timing of peak nitrogen inputs has already discharged from the system the two darkest shades of grey in fig 5 show those locations at which the management practices implemented in the last decade should already impact in stream water quality figs 6 and 7 show the simulated base flow ttd for each calibrated scenario for chesterville branch and morgan creek respectively median ages predicted by the different calibrated scenarios vary from 9 to 15 years for morgan creek and from 10 to 20 years for chesterville branch due to the northwest to southeast strike of the confining unit cf fig 2 chesterville branch has a deeper unconfined system than morgan creek under most model scenarios this corresponds to older median ages for chesterville branch for both catchments the median base flow age is oldest under the most likely model scenario this is largely due to the lower overall base flow demand of that scenario that is given the assigned bfi parameters base flow discharge must satisfy a lower fraction of the total observed stream discharge which results in lower recharge rates and lower system velocities when compared to the velocity fields of other calibrated scenarios the use of linear assumptions to evaluate the uncertainty of the simulated median base flow ages results in large intervals for all calibrated scenarios see the supplemental materials for lower bounds on prediction uncertainty that may be calculated under assumptions of hydrogeologic unit homogeneity and associated reduced parameter schemes in general given the existing calibration dataset and linear methods the models cannot determine with 95 confidence whether half the water was recharged after the mid 1990 s i e the peak of inorganic fertilizer inputs or prior to the 1940 s i e the introduction of inorganic fertilizer inputs in a few cases the uncertainty intervals extend to the mid 18th century i e the colonial period of organic fertilizer inputs and beyond for morgan creek median age uncertainty is an order of magnitude larger under the most likely model than under the other scenarios fig 7 this is because changes in the calibrated flow system change the relationship between existing information and the parameter fields constrained by that information at lower recharge rates the aquia confining unit influences a larger overall portion of the morgan creek base flow ttd for the most likely model particle tracking analysis shows that nearly half of the simulated discharge to morgan creek interacts with the confining unit see panel labels on fig 7 the importance of the confining unit uncertainty to the resulting uncertainty regarding base flow age is confirmed by decomposing the total prediction uncertainty into the uncertainty contributed by each parameter group fig 8 shows this decomposition for each model scenario and prediction for most scenarios and predictions uncertainty about the hydraulic conductivity of the aquia aquifer i e the lower portion of the unconfined surficial system cf fig 2 is the most important component of prediction uncertainty however for the most likely model the total uncertainty of the morgan creek median age prediction is dominated by the uncertainty contributions from the confining unit hydraulic conductivity parameter group fig 8 this is also true to a lesser extent of the second best performing model ca nowells which is also characterized by lower recharge to and lower base flow discharge from morgan creek because the hydraulic conductivity of the confining unit i has a large prior uncertainty given lack of knowledge about its extent and permeability and ii is poorly constrained by the available data increasing the confining unit role in the median age prediction greatly increases the uncertainty of that prediction the uncertainty intervals generated using monte carlo analyses are much smaller than those generated using linear assumptions while not constituting a formal credible interval the non linear analysis of the system outputs suggests that the median recharge date did in fact occur after 1990 figs 6 and 7 this discrepancy between linear and non linear methods contrasts with the few previous comparisons of these methods for numerical groundwater simulations for example herckenrath et al 2011 compared linear prediction uncertainty intervals with the results of monte carlo analysis for a synthetic 2d saltwater intrusion groundwater model they found that linear methods resulted in a slightly larger but altogether comparable uncertainty interval for predictions of the location of the saltwater freshwater interface because both the linear and non linear methods used here employ the same parameter covariance matrix as the basis of prediction uncertainty the present study suggests that the prediction sensitivity vector z in eq 3 is an overly conservative method of projecting parameter uncertainty into prediction space that is while the observations are not used in constructing z the use of the vector nevertheless results in underestimating the amount of information available for the predictions of system age figs 6 and 7 show that the non linear prediction intervals are relatively insensitive as the definition of behavioral i e the maximum allowable realization performance as calculated with eq 4 changes from 1 5 to 2 supplemental fig 6 shows the prediction intervals over a larger range of maximum allowable realization performance while the prediction intervals increase as the quality of allowable i e behavioral models decreases in general the monte carlo realizations no matter how poorly performing did not approach simulated median ages as old as the 95 intervals calculated by the fosm methods it is not clear from the present study whether this contrast is in part due to the particular age characteristics of the upper chester system for example the calculation of the j matrix in eq 2 i e the sensitivities of the simulated equivalents of observations to changes in parameter values may sample more or less sensitive sections of the tracer input signals fig 3 though note that most subsurface cfc data in the upper chester was collected prior to the production restrictions introduced in the 1990s while linear methods may overestimate the total amount of uncertainty associated with a particular prediction these methods are still important analytical tools for understanding the cascade of information through a system from observation to prediction of interest this is especially true in the absence of computationally tractable nonlinear methods for projecting potential information onto estimated parameters in the remainder of the study linear methods are therefore used to further examine the relationships between observations both existing and potential and predictions 3 2 how do existing observations inform predictions as implied above changes to the boundary conditions result in changes to the manner in which the model and its parameters transmit information from the existing dataset to the predictions of interest in this section we further query this relationship between information and prediction by examining the worth of existing observations for characterizing system ages fig 9 shows for each prediction the marginal increase in prediction uncertainty given the removal of observations from the existing data set note that for this calculation observations were removed in the order of their individual data worth to the prediction this order of influence of observations on predictions is not necessarily the same for each scenario or each prediction as different scenarios are more or less responsive to different subsets of the available information for each prediction the upper limit on the variance increase i e the increase in variance that would result if no information is available is a measure of the total information provided by the dataset to the prediction for example with the exception of the most poorly performing model the existing dataset provides the most information to the bmp mean return time and the least information to the morgan creek median age for all scenarios 95 of the information is provided to each prediction by less than a quarter of the total observations such that under the conceptual model and weighting methodology employed here the majority of observations do not add to our confidence in the age characteristics of interest though they may of course change our best estimate of those ages this agreement among the different model scenarios about diminishing marginal data worth is an interesting result recalling that many of the observations are repeated tracer measurements at a limited number of observation locations we learn that in order to increase confidence in the age prediction of a steady state flow model there is limited value to multiple observations over time at the same location even when those observations are a function of transient input such as is the case with atmospheric tracers note that the same result would not be true for a transient flow simulation note also that this does not contradict the results of massoudieh et al 2014 who showed that multiple temporally distributed tracer measurements were important for resolving the details of the ttd in steady state systems this is because the simulated tracer concentrations are relatively insensitive to ttd complexity green et al 2014 fig 10 aggregates this importance of existing data by observation type for each model scenario and each prediction the height of each bar component indicates the utility of that data type for informing the prediction four features may be noted by examining the information distribution for the most likely model first head and tracer information are more important than discharge information for all predictions with cfc 12 measurements more important than other tracer information for most predictions this is consistent with the higher r2 achieved by the most likely model for cfc 12 measurements than for measurements from other tracer species supplemental fig s1 this also suggests that tracer information is providing an important constraint on recharge rates especially at lower rates of total flow through the system second because the majority of tracer measurements are located i in the shallow unconfined system and ii closer to the chesterville branch channel than the morgan creek channel the existing dataset is more useful for determining the 1st quartile ages of the discharge ttds than the 2nd quartile ages and more useful for predicting the stream age for chesterville branch than for morgan creek this is especially true of the tritium data third the existing dataset provides more information about the mean return time for the bmp test plot than it does about the stream ttd characteristics this is intuitive since the bmp specific prediction involves only a small fraction of the total catchment area and therefore only a small fraction of the parameters used to simulate the integrated catchment responses and therefore only a small fraction of the aggregate parameter uncertainty 3 3 at which locations should observations be made to reduce prediction uncertainty in this final results section we discuss the data worth of potential observations and create an aggregate map of potential data worth using the weighted contributions of multiple models we distributed potential observation locations on a regular grid in each hydrogeological unit therefore each combination of i prediction ii potential observation type and iii sampled hydrogeologic unit results in a distinct map of potential data worth due to considerations of space we restrict the discussion here to uncertainty reductions for one such combination namely uncertainty reductions for i the chesterville branch median age prediction that result from ii potential sf6 observations iii in the aquia aquifer note that the displayed percent reductions in prediction uncertainty for each model scenario are relative to the post calibration prediction variance for that particular scenario as such the same percent reduction in prediction uncertainty e g 3 or 15 represents a different absolute reduction in prediction uncertainty for the different model scenarios the most likely model locates the most valuable new sf6 data below the stream channel with generally diminishing data worth as new sf6 data are collected at increasing distance from the stream with the addition of pumping scenario ba withwells the relative possibilities of reducing the chesterville branch age prediction uncertainty are lower this is intuitive since with the introduction of pumping to a relatively low flow scenario some age information that previously reached the stream is now intercepted and withdrawn from the system with higher base flow discharges and corresponding higher rates of estimated recharge the spatial range across which sf6 observations transmit information to the chesterville branch prediction increases and for most scenarios it becomes much less clear where to collect additional data note that this is also apparent in fig 10 which shows that under the existing observation dataset sf6 is more important for higher rates of flow through the system as recharge increases and system ages decrease a larger portion of the subcatchment could register sf6 information that is useful for determining ages of subcatchment discharge increases in system velocity do not however explain the linkage between subcatchment base flow age in chesterville branch and potential sf6 observations in the morgan creek subcatchment fig 11 in order to explore this linkage we recall that the information provided by new observations directly impacts parameter uncertainty some combination of these reduced parameter uncertainties may then result in a reduction to a prediction uncertainty i e if the affected parameters are integral to the calculation of a prediction of interest fienen et al 2010 observed that for data worth assessment of potential head and discharge information the use of a coarsely parameterized flow model appeared to introduce artifacts into the data worth calculations attributing value to monitoring possibilities that were not spatially proximate to the predictions that these new monitoring locations were asked to inform those authors additionally observed that the use of a dense pilot point network to parameterize the hydraulic conductivity field eliminated these apparent artifacts instead locating the most valuable information near the prediction the findings of fienen et al and the apparent repetition of those findings here may be explained by examining the impact of individual potential observations on the parameter covariance matrix changes to this matrix as a result of added observations indicate the information route through which new observations reduce the uncertainty of a prediction and are therefore found to have data worth for example an additional sf6 observation at location 557 fig 11 reduces the uncertainty of the chesterville branch age prediction by more than 15 due to the information that it provides for a number of hydraulic conductivity parameters in the vicinity of chesterville branch an additional sf6 observation at location 219 is in contrast at distance from chesterville branch and in the morgan creek subcatchment yet still reduces the uncertainty of the chesterville branch age prediction by approximately 2 this is because that observation reduces the uncertainty of the porosity parameter which is assumed to be spatially constant for the model domain and is therefore a component of the chesterville branch median age calculation in other words because under the current conceptualization the porosity parameter spans the entire model domain it provides a linkage between age information in one subcatchment and age predictions in another subcatchment this conceptualization of course may or may not be valid as discussed above changes to the model structure such as controls on the total amount of flow leaving the system via base flow or irrigation change the manner in which information is transmitted through the system in order to account for this variety of information routing and dampen any idiosyncratic artifacts from a particular model scenario we calculated a multi model average of potential data worth for this multi model average the spatial distribution of potential data worth calculated by each model was weighted by that model s performance score eq 5 and combined into a weighted average fig 12 shows the multi model weighted average worth of additional sf6 and heads data as measured by the value of new observations to the chesterville branch median age prediction from a management perspective the location of the most valuable additional sf6 information is regrettably not coincident with the most valuable additional head information the model averaged map of sf6 data worth reflects the basic priorities of the most likely and therefore highest weighted model as discussed above with the most valuable information located beneath the stream in contrast the most valuable additional heads information is located upgradient of the stream this is expected since those upgradient water levels control flux and darcian velocities given the relative confidence in the porosity field as conveyed to the model by our selection of a single spatially averaged value it is noteworthy however that some overlap between sf6 and heads data worth occurs in the chesterville branch headwaters given the expense of monitoring well construction it may be of more value to the model purposes to consider the total amount of heads and tracer information available from a single well rather than the most valuable individual head or tracer observation location 4 conclusions in this study the computational efficiency of linear prediction uncertainty analysis was combined with multiple calibrated models in order to examine the impacts of model structure on calculated prediction uncertainty comparison of multiple calibrated scenarios showed that changes in boundary conditions such as the total flow discharging from the groundwater system as base flow or as irrigation withdrawals and the associated changes in the system flow regime have a large impact on prediction uncertainties and monitoring network design because those changes alter the cascade of information through the system the use of multiple scenarios can help expose important system dynamics that may be masked by the use of a single model instance for assessing prediction uncertainties while still requiring less total computational burden than that required for non linear uncertainty analysis for example at lower total rates of system flow the confining unit that outcrops at morgan creek takes on increased significance in the model predicted distribution of base flow ages the differences in prediction uncertainties and data worth assessments across the different model scenarios may suggest that the most valuable additional information are those observations that help discriminate between the range of tested scenarios for example determination of the bfi would in turn determine how useful it would be to better specify the confining unit conductivity similarly the differences in calculated prediction uncertainty and associated data worth evaluations among pumping scenarios suggest that better documentation of the irrigation history in the catchment is important for characterizing the flow regime and associated prediction uncertainties however the performance weighted averaging shown in this study provides a quantitative method for informed decision making about data collection in the absence of information that reduces the number of plausible scenarios while the different scenarios did result in notably different estimates of i observation worth and ii parameter involvement in predictions the optimized parameter sets for the various models were in relative agreement about the stream metric of interest in general predicting a median age of somewhere between 10 and 20 years for both streams this similarity across the various scenarios suggests that the uncertainty intervals calculated under linear assumptions are too high given the actual model structure and dataset and this interpretation was confirmed by the monte carlo analysis interestingly the prediction uncertainty intervals derived from the monte carlo ensembles were of similar order to the range of predictions made across the multiple scenarios this may indicate that for the combination of numerical simulation and age tracer information employed in this study the prediction uncertainty may be better represented by the range of predictions themselves rather than through the use prediction uncertainty methods applied to individual scenarios limitations of this study most notably involve the assumption of steady state flow and the results presented do not include representation of uncertainties associated with this assumption that is this study assumes that uncertainty about the spatial distribution of inputs and system properties is the main driver of total uncertainty about system behavior what has not been explored is the impact of temporal variability in model boundary conditions most importantly due to the seasonality of recharge but also including the related seasonality of irrigation withdrawals or the development of irrigation over time in contrast to the end members of with or without steady state irrigation as mentioned above the total amount of water through the groundwater system in the upper chester appears to be consistent from year to year however as engdahl et al 2016 showed with a synthetic example even periodic e g seasonal forcings can have significant impacts on ttds in the system and by extension any inferences about groundwater velocities made from environmental tracer measurements similarly the relatively simple representation of the ttd may be a limitation of this study though the results of green et al 2014 basu et al 2012 and eberts et al 2012 suggest that for steady state systems simulation of solute concentration by convolution is relatively insensitive to the method of generating the ttd for purposes of constraining a steady state flow model the tracer dataset used in this study has the advantage of measurements separated in time which massoudieh et al 2014 showed to be important for discriminating among candidate ttds finally the foregoing analysis highlights the challenges of using a simulated base flow age from a single flow and age transport model as a simple surrogate for the expected nitrate response of a stream influenced by a changing agricultural landscape even in a data rich catchment such as the upper chester the range of modeled median ages and their associated monte carlo based uncertainty intervals may correspond to a wide variety of stream nitrate export scenarios for example for a stream water sample collected in the upper chester in 2017 a median age of 10 years indicates that at least half of the base flow was recharged under i declining total catchment nitrate inputs and ii increased bmp implementation such as cover crops that further mitigated those inputs in contrast for the same 2017 sampling date a median age of 20 years indicates that at least half of the base flow was recharged prior to any bmp implementation and perhaps prior to peak nitrate inputs these uncertainties motivate both i the data collection strategies discussed in this paper as a means of better understanding catchment response times to land surface inputs as well as ii the simulation of nitrate loading and transport as is required to more fully compare the nitrate export scenarios represented by the range of flow systems considered here

7320,uncertainties about the age of base flow discharge can have serious implications for the management of degraded environmental systems where subsurface pathways and the ongoing release of pollutants that accumulated in the subsurface during past decades dominate the water quality signal numerical groundwater models may be used to estimate groundwater return times and base flow ages and thus predict the time required for stakeholders to see the results of improved agricultural management practices however the uncertainty inherent in the relationship between i the observations of atmospherically derived tracers that are required to calibrate such models and ii the predictions of system age that the observations inform have not been investigated for example few if any studies have assessed the uncertainty of numerically simulated system ages or evaluated the uncertainty reductions that may result from the expense of collecting additional subsurface tracer data in this study we combine numerical flow and transport modeling of atmospherically derived tracers with prediction uncertainty methods to accomplish four objectives first we show the relative importance of head discharge and tracer information for characterizing response times in a uniquely data rich catchment that includes 266 age tracer measurements sf6 cfcs and 3h in addition to long term monitoring of water levels and stream discharge second we calculate uncertainty intervals for model simulated base flow ages using both linear and non linear methods and find that the prediction sensitivity vector used by linear first order second moment methods results in much larger uncertainties than non linear monte carlo methods operating on the same parameter uncertainty third by combining prediction uncertainty analysis with multiple models of the system we show that data worth calculations and monitoring network design are sensitive to variations in the amount of water leaving the system via stream discharge and irrigation withdrawals finally we demonstrate a novel model averaged computation of potential data worth that can account for these uncertainties in model structure keywords groundwater base flow age prediction uncertainty atmospheric tracers 1 introduction the age distribution of water discharging from a catchment is an important integrated descriptor of how the catchment stores and releases both rainfall and contaminants kirchner et al 2001 mcdonnell et al 2010 for stream systems in which i base flow discharge constitutes a large fraction of total streamflow and ii contaminants of interest are transported primarily through the subsurface the age distribution of the base flow component of total streamflow is of particular interest as a predictor of system response to changes in contaminant inputs these conditions i e base flow domination of streamflow and subsurface domination of contaminant transport pathways are typical of many agro ecological systems where excess nitrates have accumulated in surficial aquifers during the past century and discharge years or decades after recharge burt et al 2008 tesoriero et al 2013 for example due to the ongoing release of these legacy nitrates from many agriculturally intensive areas loads to chesapeake bay tributaries and tidal waters have continued to increase in spite of significant management interventions on the land surface hirsch et al 2010 sanford and pope 2013 uncertainties about the age of base flow discharge can have serious implications for the management of degraded environmental systems like the chesapeake bay where the time scale of ecological response may be much longer than the time scale of public opinion or legislative action for such systems robust understanding of the lag associated with groundwater return times i e the travel time of water from recharge at the water table to discharge at a receiving stream are required in order to enable stakeholders and decision makers to see the results or explain the lack of results of management improvement measures this robust understanding of the groundwater lag includes the design of monitoring strategies that reduce the uncertainty of modeled base flow ages previous studies have described theoretical frameworks for computation of stream age e g botter 2012 gomez and wilson 2013 harman 2014 or used experimental methods to derive stream age from a measured in stream tracer species e g rodhe et al 1996 ogrinc et al 2008 hrachowitz et al 2009 in most experimental studies the input and output signals of the stable isotope δ18o are measured and combined with an assumed form of the travel time distribution ttd to infer the underlying distribution of flowpath ages discharging to a stream maloszewski and zuber 1982 kirchner et al 2001 mcguire mcdonnell 2006 however δ18o cannot detect the contributions of older groundwaters to stream age mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 stewart et al 2010 and is consequently not effective for resolving transport timescales in groundwater dominated systems a few studies have used tritium 3h individually or in combination with some other conservative tracer to date streamwater michel 1992 stewart et al 2010 peters et al 2013 but in stream 3h methods are increasingly limited by the return of atmospheric 3h concentration to pre bomb levels stewart et al 2010 methods involving other atmospherically derived dissolved tracers such as cfcs or sf6 are complicated by the in stream equilibration of dissolved gaseous tracers with the atmosphere though cf sanford et al 2015 and solomon et al 2015 for methods that correct for atmospheric exchange and thus infer base flow age from in stream measurements given the limitations of calculating age from in stream measurements groundwater return times and the ttd of base flow discharge must in general be computed by models that are first calibrated against some form of subsurface age information environmental tracers have been widely used in groundwater modeling to constrain the estimation of flow and transport properties sanford 2011 leray et al 2012 erdal and cirpka 2017 the use of a calibrated groundwater model to simulate ages elsewhere in the system may be considered a form of model prediction with an associated prediction uncertainty that may be reduced by additional data collection while previous studies e g abrams 2013 sanford and pope 2013 have used forward modeling methods similar to those implemented in the present work as a basis for predicting in stream ages few if any studies have conducted an uncertainty analysis for the age predictions examined the impact of important assumptions about boundary conditions or examined the relative influence of different types of data on the resulting ages this may be in part because few sites have datasets with the substantial number of groundwater age observations required to make such a study anything but a theoretical exercise similarly while other researchers have used linear and non linear tools to i calculate uncertainty intervals for a variety of predictions and ii evaluate monitoring strategies designed to reduce that uncertainty dausman et al 2010 fienen et al 2010 herckenrath et al 2011 brunner et al 2012 as far as we are aware no studies have examined the uncertainty of simulated base flow ages or considered how additional data particularly the measurement of subsurface tracers would increase our confidence in that age this is a significant gap in the literature given the need to reduce our uncertainty about system response times in order to better understand the potential impact of expensive management actions in this study we pair a uniquely rich age tracer dataset with numerical groundwater flow and transport modeling to examine groundwater travel times as well as the impact of modeling assumptions on these travel times for an intensively farmed coastal plain watershed agricultural best management practices have been widely implemented in this watershed during the last 10 15 years two types of age predictions are considered i characteristics of the in stream base flow age ttd and ii the return time of water from a particular plot on the land surface to the stream network the former prediction provides a measure of the integrated stream response to catchment wide implementation of bmps while the latter is useful for comparing candidate sites for new bmp implementation or for estimating the time required for an individual existing bmp to contribute to catchment recovery from contamination the study accomplishes four objectives first we compare uncertainty intervals for model simulated base flow ages calculated using both linear and non linear methods in order to determine whether linear prediction uncertainty tools provide a reliable surrogate for more computationally expensive methods when using atmospherically derived tracers to constrain model parameters and predictions second we show the relative importance of head discharge and tracer information for characterizing response times in this uniquely data rich catchment third by combining prediction uncertainty analysis with multiple models of the system we show the sensitivity of data worth calculations and monitoring network design to plausible variations in the flow regime finally we demonstrate a novel model averaged computation of potential data worth to guide future monitoring given the uncertainties about these variations 2 methods 2 1 overview of study site and data multiple 3d numerical simulation models of subsurface flow and transport were developed and calibrated in order to examine groundwater return times and the age of stream base flow and to assess the impact of boundary conditions on the results in a data rich environment the 61 km2 upper chester watershed study site is a low relief agricultural watershed drained by small gaining streams the chesterville branch usgs gage 1493112 and morgan creek usgs gage 1493500 subcatchments are the focus of this paper fig 1 agriculture in the upper chester area quickly expanded during the colonial era water quality in receiving streams particularly deteriorated during the last century due to inorganic fertilizer inputs that increased after 1940 böhlke and denver in recent years a variety of management practices aimed at ameliorating these agricultural effects and improving water quality have been implemented in the watershed nelson and spies 2013 because of the centuries long history of wide spread agriculture in the area it is expected that changes to the subsurface flow regime due to agricultural intensification e g land clearing occurred before the period of interest this study consequently uses the steady state approximation of the flow system to consider the timescale of subsurface linkages between agricultural management changes and in stream response as well as the uncertainties associated with those linkages the influence of seasonally variable hydrology on the age of base flow was left to be addressed in a separate paper the upper chester study site is underlain by variably permeable unconsolidated sediments that dip to the southeast böhlke and denver 1995 the topmost fluvial deposits of the pensauken formation and the underlying marine deposits of the aquia formation together form an unconfined surficial aquifer fig 2 that is responsible for the majority of base flow discharge to both morgan creek and chesterville branch böhlke and denver 1995 the surficial aquifer is underlain by a confining unit which likewise dips to the southeast outcropping at morgan creek and forming the stream bed sediments puckett et al 2008 the confining unit separates the surficial unconfined aquifer from the hornerstown aquifer the conductivity of the confining unit and the associated proportion of older pre agricultural water that discharges to morgan creek may be an important driver of stream water chemistry in morgan creek böhlke and denver 1995 bachman et al 2002 for ease of reading the hornerstown aquifer is hereafter referred to as simply the confined aquifer fig 2 locations with flow and or transport information used in model calibration and uncertainty analysis are shown on fig 1 the study site dataset includes long term monitoring of stream discharge at morgan creek and chesterville branch along with 69 wells with 10 or more water level measurements the age tracer dataset comprises 266 cfc sf6 and 3h measurements at 31 observation wells in the active model area dunkle et al 1993 ekwurzel et al 1994 busenberg and plummer 2000 the number of observations available and the type of tracer sampled varied for each well some wells were sampled once for a single tracer while other wells were sampled multiple times for multiple tracers note that the observation wells with tracer and head measurements are distinct from the irrigation wells described below 2 2 simulation of groundwater flow and tracer transport groundwater flow for the upper chester was simulated using modflow harbaugh 2005 a finite difference implementation of the general equation for groundwater flow through porous media for all model cases the model grid consisted of 116 rows 144 columns and 26 layers with square model cells 75 m across layer thicknesses were 2 m for the top 16 layers and 3 m or 10 m for the lower layers a deterministic hydrogeologic framework for the study site was constructed using lidar elevation data from the usgs national map http nationalmap gov and regional geologic unit elevation contours digitized by the maryland geological survey andreasen et al 2007 units that fall within the model domain were sampled onto the finite difference grid and adjusted to conform to local hydrogeological data that are available from previous studies in the area e g böhlke and denver 1995 drummond 1998 bachman et al 2002 the bottom of the active simulation volume corresponds to the bottom of the confined aquifer fig 2 more details regarding the development and implementation of the groundwater flow model are provided in the supplemental materials the inference of groundwater age from measurements of environmental tracer concentrations requires specifying the ttd of the water sample leray et al 2016 and engdahl et al 2016 collectively provide a thorough overview of the physical and mathematical foundations of both steady state and transient ttds green et al 2014 used a numerical groundwater model to generate ttds and solute concentrations at wells and then attempted to reproduce these true ttds and solute concentrations by calibrating several analytical ttds against environmental tracer data they found that while the complexity of the numerical ttds was difficult to reproduce with analytical ttds the resultant estimated solute concentrations were relatively insensitive to this discrepancy in this study steady state ttds for each tracer monitoring location were calculated using the particle tracking software modpath 6 pollock 2012 to derive kinematic travel times from the numerical groundwater flow simulation particles were evenly distributed throughout a cylindrical volume centered on the well screen for each tracer monitoring location and tracked backward to their recharge locations on the land surface each particle was then weighted by the calibrated recharge flux at that point on the land surface with all particles originating from the same tracer observation well combined to generate the steady state flux weighted ttd this method of generating the ttd assumes advection only conservative transport with the exception of 3h decay these assumptions are discussed in more detail below it should be noted however that while this is a dispersion free advection only process the use of a volume as opposed to a point or line for particle origination at each well results in a distribution of travel times effectively simulating near screen mixing of multiple flowpaths and mitigating some of the dangers of kinematic formulations of age varni and carrera 1998 troldborg et al 2008 the use of a volume to generate the ttd also improves continuity between simulated tracer concentrations as those concentrations change with parameter perturbations during the estimation process transport of the atmospherically derived tracers was subsequently modeled using a discrete implementation of the convolution integral for each sampling location the concentration time series for tracer species k is 1 c k t 0 c k atm t τ e λ t g τ d τ where ck atm is the tracer input function i e the time series of recharging tracer concentration for the tracer species the system functional g τ is equal to the ttd at that location and λ is the first order decay coefficient for radioactive tracers such as 3h and is equal to 0 for sf6 and cfcs the input function ck atm for each species was derived from the tracer atmospheric mixing ratios for north america fig 3 concentrations in air were converted to aqueous concentrations using henry s law and assuming constant values of 2 cm3 l recharged excess air and 10c recharge temperature busenberg and plummer 2000 used n2 ar ratios in groundwater to estimate the recharge temperature in the upper chester to be 10 5 1 3c and they found excess air in nearly all groundwater samples to be between 0 and 3 cm3 l dunkle et al 1993 similarly estimated the recharge temperature on the delmarva to be 9 2c from their simulation of a 2d cross section in the headwaters of the chesterville branch subcatchment reilly et al 1994 concluded that hydrodynamic dispersion in the study area was very small they estimated longitudinal dispersion to be less than 0 3 m and inferred from the sharp vertical fronts between nested wells that vertical transverse dispersivity was near zero for the present study initial tests compared the performance of two different approaches to the simulation of subsurface transport an advection only simulation using modpath pollock 2012 and a fully advective dispersive model adm using mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 correlations between the porosity and dispersivity parameters and the interference of numerical dispersion common to adm solutions for low dispersion systems made it difficult to distinguish values for those transport parameters with any reasonable certainty given the findings of reilly et al 1994 hydrodynamic dispersion in the upper chester was assumed to be negligible and advection only transport of cfcs sf6 and 3h using modpath was simulated given the generally oxic character of the upper chester surficial system and the agreement between apparent piston flow ages for the multiple tracers fig 4 transport of sf6 and all cfc species was assumed to be conservative cf szabo et al 1996 hunt et al 2006 while some field and laboratory studies have observed the non conservative behavior of cfcs due to degradation or sorption in a variety of hydrogeological settings e g cook et al 1995 bauer et al 2001 happell et al 2003 there is little if any evidence of these impacts or their supporting conditions in the upper chester for example cfc sorption is often positively correlated with the fraction of organic carbon f oc in groundwater systems plummer and busenberg 2000 but the upper chester has generally low organic content with the exception of localized areas of high organic content in small depressional wetlands that have been converted to agricultural use ator et al 2013 similarly while in some settings sf6 measurements can be biased by for example subsurface sf6 sources there is not evidence of these confounding influences in the upper chester 2 3 parameter estimation methodology and the development of multiple models the models discussed below were calibrated to historical conditions by estimating the recharge horizontal hydraulic conductivity vertical anisotropy and effective porosity fields recharge and horizontal hydraulic conductivity for each hydrogeological unit were specified as spatially distributed parameters using a regular grid of pilot points see pilot point locations in supplemental figs s2 and s3 one vertical anisotropy parameter was specified for each hydrogeological unit given the conceptual model and calibration constraints recharge and effective porosity parameters are highly correlated it is assumed that recharge is more heterogeneous than effective porosity in the upper chester therefore because of the highly parameterized flexibility allowed to the recharge inputs a single spatially averaged effective porosity value was estimated for the top model layer this porosity value was then assumed to exponentially decay with depth according to a decay parameter that was also calibrated in total hydraulic conductivity recharge and effective porosity for each model were specified with 239 parameters that were estimated using the parallelized beopest implementation of the inverse modeling software pest doherty 2010 details of the calibration process and regularization methods employed to constrain the highly parameterized fields are described in the supplemental materials within the general calibration framework described in the supplemental materials we examined the impact of important model structural uncertainties by calibrating models given six scenarios while sharing identical parameterization the models differ from one another with respect to i the base flow indices used to compare simulated base flows to the observations of total streamflow in morgan creek and chesterville branch or ii the representation of irrigation withdrawals these variations are further described as follows 2 3 1 variable assignment of base flow indices due to correlation between recharge and discharge the base flow fraction of total discharge i e base flow index or bfi in morgan creek and chesterville branch could not be treated as estimated parameters moreover it was one aim of this study to examine impacts of different plausible flow regimes on the prediction uncertainty methods described below the bfi was consequently used as a scenario variable sanford et al 2011 using chemical hydrograph separation methods found that for low relief coastal plain catchments similar to the upper chester base flow could constitute as much as 85 of total streamflow in contrast some base flow separation algorithms operating on the morgan creek and chesterville branch discharge time series suggest lower long term base flow fractions for example the digital filter used by the swat modeling suite arnold et al 1995 arnold and allen 1999 calculates that in the upper chester catchments base flow accounts for 60 70 of total streamflow preliminary water balance calculations suggested that given the streamflow records and previous estimates of recharge rates in the area a long term mean base flow index of 0 70 is the approximate lower plausible limit in order to query this range of possible scenarios we considered base flow indices of 0 70 0 78 and 0 85 for both morgan creek and chesterville branch resulting in a total of nine possible combinations of base flow indices the scenarios are hereafter referred to from low to high as baseflow scenarios a b and c when the designators occur in combination the first letter refers to morgan creek and the second letter refers to chesterville branch e g base flow scenario ba refers to the model instance for which the base flow index is assumed to be 0 78 for morgan creek and 0 70 for chesterville branch preliminary calibration performance suggested that morgan creek has a higher base flow index than chesterville branch this result is consistent with landscape features including a nursery in the chesterville branch headwaters that may contribute stormwater runoff and possibly irrigation return flows to the total stream hydrograph as a result of this apparent difference in stream behavior in this paper we only discuss three of the nine possible combinations of base flow indices namely scenarios ba ca and cb note that with respect to calibration these base flow indices function as assigned parameters that convert simulated steady state base flow to annualized average total streamflow observed for the calibration period each model is consequently calibrated against an identical set of observations and weights such that the optimized objective functions of the various calibrated scenarios can be used to compare model performance 2 3 2 variable simulation of irrigation pumping with the exception of the aforementioned commercial nursery in the headwaters of chesterville branch there is little reported pumping in the study area and most reported withdrawals do not begin until the late 1990s or early 2000s however some evidence suggests that irrigation withdrawals in the upper chester are under reported masterson et al 2016 compared reported irrigation withdrawals in the north atlantic coastal plain to estimated crop water requirements using the soil water balance method westenbroek et al 2012 and found that in many locations including the upper chester reported irrigation withdrawals during many years cannot account for the known agricultural exports under known climate conditions they generated a spatially distributed dataset of estimated unreported irrigation withdrawals by mapping the supplement between reported and calculated irrigation amounts to unreported irrigation locations the unreported locations were identified using remotely sensed indicators of irrigation activity e g center pivot circles evident in satellite imagery we similarly found that the total agricultural production in kent county md as reported by the national agricultural statistics service nass appears basically constant from 1980 to 2005 with the exception of a few years in the late 1980s an exception presumably due to drought conditions this suggests that irrigation withdrawals reported more recently may in fact apply to several decades during which irrigation was unreported in summary given the available data it is uncertain whether irrigation withdrawals in the upper chester were a negligible during the 1990 2005 calibration period or in contrast b higher than recently reported rates since as early as 1980 in order to account for this uncertainty in the modeling process we considered two pumping scenarios in the first scenario no pumping is included in the simulation in the second scenario we assumed that the steady state agricultural production corresponds to a steady state distribution of pumping that combines the reported locations and rates with the supplemental dataset generated by masterson et al 2016 these contrasting scenarios are labeled nowells and withwells respectively table 1 summarizes these six model variations and shows the associated model labels which are encoded as the composite base flow indices scenario pumping scenario in the remainder of the text each model is referred to by the label shown in table 1 2 4 simulation of base flow age in receiving streams and groundwater return times from points on the landscape for each calibrated model the steady state ttd of base flow in receiving streams was simulated using travel times calculated by modpath pollock 2012 particles were uniformly distributed across the water table and tracked forward to their discharge location the travel times of discharging particles were then weighted by recharge flux and aggregated by stream i e morgan creek or chesterville branch in order to construct the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf and the associated flux weighted age characteristics for each stream multiple candidate age characteristics were considered for discussion and uncertainty analysis in this paper including the mean and median stream ages as well as site specific characteristics of interest such as i the fraction of stream flow that recharged since 1940 the approximate time at which inorganic fertilizer use in the county began to increase ii the fraction of stream flow that recharged since 1990 the approximate date of peak nitrogen loading in the county or the fraction of stream flow that recharged since 2005 the approximate date at which accelerated implementation of bmps in the study area began mean stream age is not a meaningful indicator of land surface agricultural inputs because it can be overly influenced by older portions of the ttd that are pre contaminant and pre atmospheric tracer while the date specific characteristics of stream age are considered in the discussion in general our analysis focuses on the median age and its associated uncertainty the mean travel time to discharge for recharge entering the subsurface at the hypothetical bmp plot was calculated as a subset of the forward particle simulation by filtering for only those pathlines that recharged in the area of interest 2 5 prediction uncertainty analysis for simulated base flow ages and groundwater return times several methods for characterizing the posterior parameter variance and propagating that uncertainty to model predictions have been applied to hydrological models markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods use bayesian updating to formally derive post calibration parameter uncertainty kuczera and parent 1998 gallagher and doherty 2007 given i a defined error model ii an associated likelihood function iii and a probability distribution for transitioning the parameter vector from one candidate state to the next mcmc methods generate an ensemble of parameter vectors that converge on the actual posterior probability distribution in contrast generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue requires no knowledge of the error model it is thus more flexible with respect to the likelihood function and well suited to the common case of calibrating an environmental model for which model structural error is unknown and constraints include data of different types freer et al 1996 beven and freer 2001 jin et al 2010 the practical merits and theoretical questions concerning the use of glue as a substitute for formal bayesian inference have been widely discussed in the literature e g blasone et al 2008 stedinger et al 2008 beven et al 2007 jin et al 2010 we here only note the concept of behavioral parameter set which in the glue methodology refers to a parameter set that meets a user specified likelihood threshold and is used to determine which randomly generated parameter sets should be included in the uncertainty assessment the forward run times of most three dimensional numerical groundwater simulations present significant computational obstacles to deriving parameter uncertainty with glue or mcmc methods this is due to the number of model runs that those methods require and may be exacerbated for mcmc by the serial nature of the algorithm which limits the advantages of parallel computing resources the results of hassan et al 2009 suggest that for some numerical models a functional relationship between the i parameters of a meaningful likelihood function and ii the parameters of the groundwater simulation model can be derived from a reduced number of model runs and subsequently used as a proxy for the full forward simulation during the mcmc algorithm in general however parameter and prediction uncertainty for numerical groundwater simulations must be assessed with other methods for example calibration constrained monte carlo methods such as null space monte carlo nsmc tonkin and doherty 2009 herckenrath et al 2011 reduce the required number of model runs by using the information from a sensitivity based parameter estimation process to condition the parameter space from which individual parameter realizations are constructed due to their computational efficiency linear first order second moment fosm techniques are of particular utility for uncertainty analysis of numerical groundwater models fosm methods may be implemented using a linearized bayes theory that assumes local model linearity and gaussian variability for parameters predictions and observation noise dausman et al 2010 white et al 2016 under these assumptions the post calibration parameter covariance matrix may be calculated as 2 σ θ post σ θ σ θ j t j σ θ j t σ ε 1 j σ θ where σθ is the covariance matrix of prior parameter probability distribution in this case computed from the estimated bounds on parameter values j is the jacobian matrix describing the sensitivity of observations to parameter perturbations and σε is the covariance matrix of simulation error and measurement error here defined as a diagonal matrix populated by the inverse of observation weights with all off diagonal elements equal to 0 note that σθ post is a function of i the pre calibration uncertainty 1st term on right side of eq 2 and ii the post calibration uncertainty reduction that results from conditioning the system description on observations 2nd term on right side of eq 2 while eq 2 requires no information about the parameter values themselves and may be calculated before calibration occurs we first calibrated the model and then calculated the jacobian matrix j at optimized parameter values in order to reduce the impact of any model non linearity on parameter sensitivities the post calibration prediction uncertainty of prediction s may subsequently be calculated as 3 σ s post 2 z t σ θ post z where z is a vector of prediction sensitivities to changes in parameter values in this study post calibration prediction intervals for the stream base flow age metrics were computed using eqs 2 and 3 as implemented by the pyemu python library white et al 2016 given the non linearity of the input signals for atmospheric tracers used in calibration fig 3 prediction uncertainty intervals were also derived using a monte carlo method for each calibration scenario 5000 parameter realizations were randomly drawn from the posterior parameter variance matrix computed with eq 2 for each calibration scenario i the performance of realization j was defined as 4 p ij φ b j φ b i where φ bj is the objective function value for the realization eq s2 and φ b i is the lowest objective function for the calibration scenario for each calibration scenario prediction uncertainty intervals were then generated as a function of a performance behavior threshold e g for a behavior threshold of 1 5 realizations with p 1 5 were classified as behavioral such that their base flow age metrics were aggregated into uncertainty intervals while this monte carlo method does not formally specify the posterior parameter variance it provides a useful non linear comparison to the prediction intervals generated by eqs 2 and 3 in particular because both the linear and non linear methods project prediction uncertainty from the post calibration parameter variance derived with eq 2 it highlights the role of the prediction sensitivity vector z in the same projection as calculated using eq 3 the method has similar advantages to null space monte carlo tonkin and doherty 2009 in that it conditions the parameter draw with information derived from the calibration but does not require an assumption about the dimensionality of the solution space finally eqs 2 and 3 as implemented by pyemu were used to quantify the worth of both existing and potential data to predictions of interest for all model scenarios briefly stated the value of an existing observation to a model output may be calculated by i computing a baseline prediction variance using all available information then ii removing the information that observation provides from eq 2 namely by modifying its entry in the σ ε matrix then iii re calculating the prediction variance and computing the increase from the baseline this variance increase in the absence of an observation is a measure of that observation s worth similarly the value of a potential observation to a model output may be computed by adding the sensitivity of a potential observation to the information encoded in eq 2 namely by including a potential observation in the calculation of the j matrix and computing the decrease in prediction variance given this new information note that this should be understood as a calculation of where data should be collected in order to reduce the uncertainty of predictions made with the existing conceptual model rather than a guarantee that the uncertainty will be reduced that is the possibility exists that additional data will be inconsistent with the existing data set and thus require the parameters to be re calibrated or the conceptual model to be revised altogether for a more detailed description of the use of linear bayes theory to evaluate data worth see white et al 2016 2 6 model scores and multi model averaging as noted above and further described in the supplemental materials all model calibration scenarios began with identical initial parameter values and were calibrated against identical observations and associated weights this similarity allows use of the calibrated objective function eqs s1 and s2 for each scenario as a comparative measure of model performance in the remainder of this paper we discuss both i the individual results of the model instance with the lowest objective function as well as ii the patterns and multi model averages of the full set of six calibrated models for ease of reading we refer to the calibrated model with the lowest objective function as the most likely model insofar as it entails the parameter set including the assigned base flow index that best describes the existing dataset for purposes of multi model averaging we calculated a score weight for each model proportional to the post calibration reduction in the measurement i e non regularization such that φm 0 portion of objective function value eq s2 or 5 s i φ b 0 φ b i φ b 0 φ b where si is the score of model i and φ b0 φ bi and φ b are the measurement objective function values for the initial parameter set the calibrated parameter set for model i and the calibrated parameter set for the most likely model respectively note that for this formulation the most likely model is assigned a weight of 1 and the remaining models are assigned scores between 0 and 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 how old is the base flow and how uncertain is the prediction given the existing dataset in this section we briefly describe the simulated age characteristics of the two subcatchments before examining the impact of model scenario on prediction uncertainty fig 5 considers the simulated flow systems from the perspective of recharge location on the land surface for each of the calibrated models model scenario ba nowells had the lowest objective function and is therefore considered to be the most likely model model score 1 the cb nowells in contrast was the poorest performing scenario and received a model score of less than half the most likely model the effect of the outcropping confining unit on morgan creek ages is evident from the more complicated spatial distribution of return times in that catchment this effect is discussed in more detail below note that the national hydrography dataset nhd flowlines shown for reference in fig 5 include several up gradient agricultural swales as tributaries to morgan creek while these swales may be active in some events they do not appear to act as controls on the water table under steady state recharge conditions and thus may overlap the steady state groundwater divide all models show that some recharge along the groundwater divide between the morgan creek and chesterville branch subcatchments requires more than 75 years to discharge as base flow this means that some of the flowpaths discharging to the two streams still bear recharge that pre dates agricultural intensification given the advective dominated nature of the system and the consequent lack of subsurface dispersive mixing the contribution of agricultural contaminants from these older flow paths will increase in the future and may not peak for several years or decades the simulated groundwater divide corresponds most closely to the surface water i e topographic divide for the most likely scenario however for the remaining scenarios increases in total flow through the system either as driven by higher base flow indices or by higher irrigation withdrawals result in the recruitment of recharge from the higher elevations of the morgan creek catchment towards the chesterville branch drainage network the three darkest shades of grey in fig 5 show locations in the watershed where water that recharged as recently as 1990 the approximate timing of peak nitrogen inputs has already discharged from the system the two darkest shades of grey in fig 5 show those locations at which the management practices implemented in the last decade should already impact in stream water quality figs 6 and 7 show the simulated base flow ttd for each calibrated scenario for chesterville branch and morgan creek respectively median ages predicted by the different calibrated scenarios vary from 9 to 15 years for morgan creek and from 10 to 20 years for chesterville branch due to the northwest to southeast strike of the confining unit cf fig 2 chesterville branch has a deeper unconfined system than morgan creek under most model scenarios this corresponds to older median ages for chesterville branch for both catchments the median base flow age is oldest under the most likely model scenario this is largely due to the lower overall base flow demand of that scenario that is given the assigned bfi parameters base flow discharge must satisfy a lower fraction of the total observed stream discharge which results in lower recharge rates and lower system velocities when compared to the velocity fields of other calibrated scenarios the use of linear assumptions to evaluate the uncertainty of the simulated median base flow ages results in large intervals for all calibrated scenarios see the supplemental materials for lower bounds on prediction uncertainty that may be calculated under assumptions of hydrogeologic unit homogeneity and associated reduced parameter schemes in general given the existing calibration dataset and linear methods the models cannot determine with 95 confidence whether half the water was recharged after the mid 1990 s i e the peak of inorganic fertilizer inputs or prior to the 1940 s i e the introduction of inorganic fertilizer inputs in a few cases the uncertainty intervals extend to the mid 18th century i e the colonial period of organic fertilizer inputs and beyond for morgan creek median age uncertainty is an order of magnitude larger under the most likely model than under the other scenarios fig 7 this is because changes in the calibrated flow system change the relationship between existing information and the parameter fields constrained by that information at lower recharge rates the aquia confining unit influences a larger overall portion of the morgan creek base flow ttd for the most likely model particle tracking analysis shows that nearly half of the simulated discharge to morgan creek interacts with the confining unit see panel labels on fig 7 the importance of the confining unit uncertainty to the resulting uncertainty regarding base flow age is confirmed by decomposing the total prediction uncertainty into the uncertainty contributed by each parameter group fig 8 shows this decomposition for each model scenario and prediction for most scenarios and predictions uncertainty about the hydraulic conductivity of the aquia aquifer i e the lower portion of the unconfined surficial system cf fig 2 is the most important component of prediction uncertainty however for the most likely model the total uncertainty of the morgan creek median age prediction is dominated by the uncertainty contributions from the confining unit hydraulic conductivity parameter group fig 8 this is also true to a lesser extent of the second best performing model ca nowells which is also characterized by lower recharge to and lower base flow discharge from morgan creek because the hydraulic conductivity of the confining unit i has a large prior uncertainty given lack of knowledge about its extent and permeability and ii is poorly constrained by the available data increasing the confining unit role in the median age prediction greatly increases the uncertainty of that prediction the uncertainty intervals generated using monte carlo analyses are much smaller than those generated using linear assumptions while not constituting a formal credible interval the non linear analysis of the system outputs suggests that the median recharge date did in fact occur after 1990 figs 6 and 7 this discrepancy between linear and non linear methods contrasts with the few previous comparisons of these methods for numerical groundwater simulations for example herckenrath et al 2011 compared linear prediction uncertainty intervals with the results of monte carlo analysis for a synthetic 2d saltwater intrusion groundwater model they found that linear methods resulted in a slightly larger but altogether comparable uncertainty interval for predictions of the location of the saltwater freshwater interface because both the linear and non linear methods used here employ the same parameter covariance matrix as the basis of prediction uncertainty the present study suggests that the prediction sensitivity vector z in eq 3 is an overly conservative method of projecting parameter uncertainty into prediction space that is while the observations are not used in constructing z the use of the vector nevertheless results in underestimating the amount of information available for the predictions of system age figs 6 and 7 show that the non linear prediction intervals are relatively insensitive as the definition of behavioral i e the maximum allowable realization performance as calculated with eq 4 changes from 1 5 to 2 supplemental fig 6 shows the prediction intervals over a larger range of maximum allowable realization performance while the prediction intervals increase as the quality of allowable i e behavioral models decreases in general the monte carlo realizations no matter how poorly performing did not approach simulated median ages as old as the 95 intervals calculated by the fosm methods it is not clear from the present study whether this contrast is in part due to the particular age characteristics of the upper chester system for example the calculation of the j matrix in eq 2 i e the sensitivities of the simulated equivalents of observations to changes in parameter values may sample more or less sensitive sections of the tracer input signals fig 3 though note that most subsurface cfc data in the upper chester was collected prior to the production restrictions introduced in the 1990s while linear methods may overestimate the total amount of uncertainty associated with a particular prediction these methods are still important analytical tools for understanding the cascade of information through a system from observation to prediction of interest this is especially true in the absence of computationally tractable nonlinear methods for projecting potential information onto estimated parameters in the remainder of the study linear methods are therefore used to further examine the relationships between observations both existing and potential and predictions 3 2 how do existing observations inform predictions as implied above changes to the boundary conditions result in changes to the manner in which the model and its parameters transmit information from the existing dataset to the predictions of interest in this section we further query this relationship between information and prediction by examining the worth of existing observations for characterizing system ages fig 9 shows for each prediction the marginal increase in prediction uncertainty given the removal of observations from the existing data set note that for this calculation observations were removed in the order of their individual data worth to the prediction this order of influence of observations on predictions is not necessarily the same for each scenario or each prediction as different scenarios are more or less responsive to different subsets of the available information for each prediction the upper limit on the variance increase i e the increase in variance that would result if no information is available is a measure of the total information provided by the dataset to the prediction for example with the exception of the most poorly performing model the existing dataset provides the most information to the bmp mean return time and the least information to the morgan creek median age for all scenarios 95 of the information is provided to each prediction by less than a quarter of the total observations such that under the conceptual model and weighting methodology employed here the majority of observations do not add to our confidence in the age characteristics of interest though they may of course change our best estimate of those ages this agreement among the different model scenarios about diminishing marginal data worth is an interesting result recalling that many of the observations are repeated tracer measurements at a limited number of observation locations we learn that in order to increase confidence in the age prediction of a steady state flow model there is limited value to multiple observations over time at the same location even when those observations are a function of transient input such as is the case with atmospheric tracers note that the same result would not be true for a transient flow simulation note also that this does not contradict the results of massoudieh et al 2014 who showed that multiple temporally distributed tracer measurements were important for resolving the details of the ttd in steady state systems this is because the simulated tracer concentrations are relatively insensitive to ttd complexity green et al 2014 fig 10 aggregates this importance of existing data by observation type for each model scenario and each prediction the height of each bar component indicates the utility of that data type for informing the prediction four features may be noted by examining the information distribution for the most likely model first head and tracer information are more important than discharge information for all predictions with cfc 12 measurements more important than other tracer information for most predictions this is consistent with the higher r2 achieved by the most likely model for cfc 12 measurements than for measurements from other tracer species supplemental fig s1 this also suggests that tracer information is providing an important constraint on recharge rates especially at lower rates of total flow through the system second because the majority of tracer measurements are located i in the shallow unconfined system and ii closer to the chesterville branch channel than the morgan creek channel the existing dataset is more useful for determining the 1st quartile ages of the discharge ttds than the 2nd quartile ages and more useful for predicting the stream age for chesterville branch than for morgan creek this is especially true of the tritium data third the existing dataset provides more information about the mean return time for the bmp test plot than it does about the stream ttd characteristics this is intuitive since the bmp specific prediction involves only a small fraction of the total catchment area and therefore only a small fraction of the parameters used to simulate the integrated catchment responses and therefore only a small fraction of the aggregate parameter uncertainty 3 3 at which locations should observations be made to reduce prediction uncertainty in this final results section we discuss the data worth of potential observations and create an aggregate map of potential data worth using the weighted contributions of multiple models we distributed potential observation locations on a regular grid in each hydrogeological unit therefore each combination of i prediction ii potential observation type and iii sampled hydrogeologic unit results in a distinct map of potential data worth due to considerations of space we restrict the discussion here to uncertainty reductions for one such combination namely uncertainty reductions for i the chesterville branch median age prediction that result from ii potential sf6 observations iii in the aquia aquifer note that the displayed percent reductions in prediction uncertainty for each model scenario are relative to the post calibration prediction variance for that particular scenario as such the same percent reduction in prediction uncertainty e g 3 or 15 represents a different absolute reduction in prediction uncertainty for the different model scenarios the most likely model locates the most valuable new sf6 data below the stream channel with generally diminishing data worth as new sf6 data are collected at increasing distance from the stream with the addition of pumping scenario ba withwells the relative possibilities of reducing the chesterville branch age prediction uncertainty are lower this is intuitive since with the introduction of pumping to a relatively low flow scenario some age information that previously reached the stream is now intercepted and withdrawn from the system with higher base flow discharges and corresponding higher rates of estimated recharge the spatial range across which sf6 observations transmit information to the chesterville branch prediction increases and for most scenarios it becomes much less clear where to collect additional data note that this is also apparent in fig 10 which shows that under the existing observation dataset sf6 is more important for higher rates of flow through the system as recharge increases and system ages decrease a larger portion of the subcatchment could register sf6 information that is useful for determining ages of subcatchment discharge increases in system velocity do not however explain the linkage between subcatchment base flow age in chesterville branch and potential sf6 observations in the morgan creek subcatchment fig 11 in order to explore this linkage we recall that the information provided by new observations directly impacts parameter uncertainty some combination of these reduced parameter uncertainties may then result in a reduction to a prediction uncertainty i e if the affected parameters are integral to the calculation of a prediction of interest fienen et al 2010 observed that for data worth assessment of potential head and discharge information the use of a coarsely parameterized flow model appeared to introduce artifacts into the data worth calculations attributing value to monitoring possibilities that were not spatially proximate to the predictions that these new monitoring locations were asked to inform those authors additionally observed that the use of a dense pilot point network to parameterize the hydraulic conductivity field eliminated these apparent artifacts instead locating the most valuable information near the prediction the findings of fienen et al and the apparent repetition of those findings here may be explained by examining the impact of individual potential observations on the parameter covariance matrix changes to this matrix as a result of added observations indicate the information route through which new observations reduce the uncertainty of a prediction and are therefore found to have data worth for example an additional sf6 observation at location 557 fig 11 reduces the uncertainty of the chesterville branch age prediction by more than 15 due to the information that it provides for a number of hydraulic conductivity parameters in the vicinity of chesterville branch an additional sf6 observation at location 219 is in contrast at distance from chesterville branch and in the morgan creek subcatchment yet still reduces the uncertainty of the chesterville branch age prediction by approximately 2 this is because that observation reduces the uncertainty of the porosity parameter which is assumed to be spatially constant for the model domain and is therefore a component of the chesterville branch median age calculation in other words because under the current conceptualization the porosity parameter spans the entire model domain it provides a linkage between age information in one subcatchment and age predictions in another subcatchment this conceptualization of course may or may not be valid as discussed above changes to the model structure such as controls on the total amount of flow leaving the system via base flow or irrigation change the manner in which information is transmitted through the system in order to account for this variety of information routing and dampen any idiosyncratic artifacts from a particular model scenario we calculated a multi model average of potential data worth for this multi model average the spatial distribution of potential data worth calculated by each model was weighted by that model s performance score eq 5 and combined into a weighted average fig 12 shows the multi model weighted average worth of additional sf6 and heads data as measured by the value of new observations to the chesterville branch median age prediction from a management perspective the location of the most valuable additional sf6 information is regrettably not coincident with the most valuable additional head information the model averaged map of sf6 data worth reflects the basic priorities of the most likely and therefore highest weighted model as discussed above with the most valuable information located beneath the stream in contrast the most valuable additional heads information is located upgradient of the stream this is expected since those upgradient water levels control flux and darcian velocities given the relative confidence in the porosity field as conveyed to the model by our selection of a single spatially averaged value it is noteworthy however that some overlap between sf6 and heads data worth occurs in the chesterville branch headwaters given the expense of monitoring well construction it may be of more value to the model purposes to consider the total amount of heads and tracer information available from a single well rather than the most valuable individual head or tracer observation location 4 conclusions in this study the computational efficiency of linear prediction uncertainty analysis was combined with multiple calibrated models in order to examine the impacts of model structure on calculated prediction uncertainty comparison of multiple calibrated scenarios showed that changes in boundary conditions such as the total flow discharging from the groundwater system as base flow or as irrigation withdrawals and the associated changes in the system flow regime have a large impact on prediction uncertainties and monitoring network design because those changes alter the cascade of information through the system the use of multiple scenarios can help expose important system dynamics that may be masked by the use of a single model instance for assessing prediction uncertainties while still requiring less total computational burden than that required for non linear uncertainty analysis for example at lower total rates of system flow the confining unit that outcrops at morgan creek takes on increased significance in the model predicted distribution of base flow ages the differences in prediction uncertainties and data worth assessments across the different model scenarios may suggest that the most valuable additional information are those observations that help discriminate between the range of tested scenarios for example determination of the bfi would in turn determine how useful it would be to better specify the confining unit conductivity similarly the differences in calculated prediction uncertainty and associated data worth evaluations among pumping scenarios suggest that better documentation of the irrigation history in the catchment is important for characterizing the flow regime and associated prediction uncertainties however the performance weighted averaging shown in this study provides a quantitative method for informed decision making about data collection in the absence of information that reduces the number of plausible scenarios while the different scenarios did result in notably different estimates of i observation worth and ii parameter involvement in predictions the optimized parameter sets for the various models were in relative agreement about the stream metric of interest in general predicting a median age of somewhere between 10 and 20 years for both streams this similarity across the various scenarios suggests that the uncertainty intervals calculated under linear assumptions are too high given the actual model structure and dataset and this interpretation was confirmed by the monte carlo analysis interestingly the prediction uncertainty intervals derived from the monte carlo ensembles were of similar order to the range of predictions made across the multiple scenarios this may indicate that for the combination of numerical simulation and age tracer information employed in this study the prediction uncertainty may be better represented by the range of predictions themselves rather than through the use prediction uncertainty methods applied to individual scenarios limitations of this study most notably involve the assumption of steady state flow and the results presented do not include representation of uncertainties associated with this assumption that is this study assumes that uncertainty about the spatial distribution of inputs and system properties is the main driver of total uncertainty about system behavior what has not been explored is the impact of temporal variability in model boundary conditions most importantly due to the seasonality of recharge but also including the related seasonality of irrigation withdrawals or the development of irrigation over time in contrast to the end members of with or without steady state irrigation as mentioned above the total amount of water through the groundwater system in the upper chester appears to be consistent from year to year however as engdahl et al 2016 showed with a synthetic example even periodic e g seasonal forcings can have significant impacts on ttds in the system and by extension any inferences about groundwater velocities made from environmental tracer measurements similarly the relatively simple representation of the ttd may be a limitation of this study though the results of green et al 2014 basu et al 2012 and eberts et al 2012 suggest that for steady state systems simulation of solute concentration by convolution is relatively insensitive to the method of generating the ttd for purposes of constraining a steady state flow model the tracer dataset used in this study has the advantage of measurements separated in time which massoudieh et al 2014 showed to be important for discriminating among candidate ttds finally the foregoing analysis highlights the challenges of using a simulated base flow age from a single flow and age transport model as a simple surrogate for the expected nitrate response of a stream influenced by a changing agricultural landscape even in a data rich catchment such as the upper chester the range of modeled median ages and their associated monte carlo based uncertainty intervals may correspond to a wide variety of stream nitrate export scenarios for example for a stream water sample collected in the upper chester in 2017 a median age of 10 years indicates that at least half of the base flow was recharged under i declining total catchment nitrate inputs and ii increased bmp implementation such as cover crops that further mitigated those inputs in contrast for the same 2017 sampling date a median age of 20 years indicates that at least half of the base flow was recharged prior to any bmp implementation and perhaps prior to peak nitrate inputs these uncertainties motivate both i the data collection strategies discussed in this paper as a means of better understanding catchment response times to land surface inputs as well as ii the simulation of nitrate loading and transport as is required to more fully compare the nitrate export scenarios represented by the range of flow systems considered here

exchanges with an unprecented fine temporal resolution such as the rainfall event time scale the lomos mini is low cost easy to construct from individual microelectronic components and has an autonomy

underlying aquifer are critical for water quality and ecosystem health boulton et al 1998 krause et al 2011 the mixing zone between surface and subsurface water bodies known as the hyporheic zone exhibits unique physical and chemical properties supporting processes essential for the biogeochemical and ecological functioning of river corridors boano et al 2014 flipo et al 2014 in particular water and heat exchanges in the hyporheic zone determine the fate of contaminants in the river aquifer continuum the transport of nutrients along the hyporheic corridor and the formation of thermal refugia that provide habitat for river ecosystems stanford and ward 1988 malcolm et al 2005 understanding physical chemical and ecological processes in the hyporheic zone requires a sound hydrogeological description of water exchanges and heat governing these processes bencala 2000 sophocleous 2002 recent years have seen the development of a variety of experimental methods for that purpose e g kalbus et al 2006 rosenberry et al 2008 mouhri et al 2013 these methods are developed to be accurate and reliable but also low cost easy and fast to deploy in the field under the limited time and financial constraints that are always associated with field investigations wickert 2014 rosenberry 2008 introduced seepage meters providing direct measurements of exchanges across the stream aquifer interface but noted that the meters disturb the river flow field and alter measured exchanges particularly at low flow solder et al 2016 introduced a tube seepage meter allowing for estimates of vertical seepage rates and streambed hydraulic conductivity with minimal perturbation to sediment and water flow however it is based on an active change of water levels and therefore provides a snapshot estimate at the time when measurements are taken the tracking of natural tracers provides valuable information about the magnitude of stream aquifer exchanges xie et al 2016 in particular the usage of heat as a tracer of flow in the hyporheic zone has received considerable attention because it is relatively easy fast and inexpensive to measure anderson 2005 constantz 2008 a popular method consists of placing temperature sensors at different depths along a vertical profile in sediments below the stream the propagation of diurnal temperature variations with depth informs about the magnitude of water exchanges between the stream and the underlying hyporheic zone using either an analytical approximation to the heat equation with constant seepage and sinusoidal temperature boundary conditions e g hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 cuthbert et al 2010 or with the help of a numerical model solving for transient flow and heat transport along a vertical sediment column e g anibas et al 2009 cranswick et al 2014 recent analytical development by caissie and luce 2017 permit to estimate transient conductive and advective fluxes driven by diurnal and annual temperature variations from vertically distributed temperature time series but still relying on constant seepage velocity calibrated from a numerical model this paper presents a new sampling system called lomos mini local monitoring station mini which monitors vertical water and heat exchanges between a stream and its underlying aquifer at higher temporal frequency than other currently existing methods the lomos mini relies on the coupling of pressure and temperature measurements the main benefit of the lomos mini is the quantification of water and heat exchanges at a sub daily resolution e g every 15 min when used in combination with a vertically distributed hydrothermal numerical model in particular temporally varying response to particular hydrological events can be quantified rosenberry et al 2013 for example dudley southern and binley 2015 showed that the rapid rise of surface water levels after a rainfall event can lead to a temporary reversal of flow direction towards infiltration in the hyporheic zone monitoring methods available to date do not allow for the quantification of this reversal in water fluxes and associated heat fluxes at a sub daily resolution the main objective of this paper is to introduce the lomos mini designed to be easy to use inexpensive and reliable in the field the design of the pressure and temperature sensors and their implementation on the field are described and the use of a lomos mini is illustrated with a set of experimental measurements and corresponding flux estimates the deployment of several lomos mini will provide the ability to monitor water and heat fluxes between a stream and its underlying aquifer at high spatial and temporal resolution this paper is organized as follows the first part presents the sampling system the second part is dedicated to the calibration procedure particularly demonstrating the necessity of taking into account the effect of temperature when deriving hydraulic head gradients the last part describes the implementation of lomos mini in the field and illustrates its ability to monitor high frequency stream aquifer exchanges on a case study in the avenelles basin france mouhri et al 2013 where the streambed is composed of loess and underlaid by colluvium with blocks of gritstone a rarely sampled type of hyporheic zone 2 presentation of the lomos mini the lomos mini draws from lomos stations presented in mouhri et al 2013 for monitoring spatially distributed and temporally varying stream aquifer exchanges in both cases the quantification relies on a combination of hydraulic head differential and temperature measurements mouhri et al 2013 applied their methodology to a small sedimentary basin the avenelles basin france five lomos stations placed along the hydrological network monitored the stream aquifer exchange dynamics from hydraulic head and temperature measurements each lomos station consists of piezometers located in both banks of the stream and of a pressure sensor located in the stream and monitoring the stream stage all sensors also monitor temperature and constrain the boundaries of a two dimensional stream cross section heat is then used as a tracer of the flow to estimate continuous records of stream aquifer exchanges similar to the lomos the lomos mini couples hydraulic head gradient measurements with temperature measurements whereas the lomos constrains flow within a stream cross section lomos mini measurements are taken along a vertical column within the hyporheic zone at the local scale 0 1 1 m flipo et al 2014 this redesign implies to modify the monitoring system so that 1 it operates within the streambed instead of the stream banks and 2 it is able to measure hydraulic head differentials of the order of a few centimeters or less this is the role of the pressure differential sensor presented in section 3 the one dimensional 1d column along which measurements are taken is typically 40 80 cm deep although it can be easily adjusted depending on characterization needs fig 1 presents the monitoring system along a vertical cross section for the infiltrating case where hydraulic head is higher in the stream than at the bottom of the hyporheic zone and flow is directed downwards the lomos mini is designed to be installed in low order streams with a typical strahler number of 1 3 strahler 1952 and is thus adapted to monitor upstream river networks where discharge genesis usually occurs the streams need to be accessible by foot and it is recommended to make the installation when the water level in the stream is lower than 1 m to ensure that the implementation of the device in the streambed is possible the lomos mini is designed to operate under saturated conditions section 4 1 where the river and the hyporheic zone are connected brunner et al 2009 the lomos mini is a low cost system which can be constructed for about 500 including the two onset hobo data loggers as further detailed in section 4 1 the implementation of the lomos mini is robust and therefore suitable for a variety of geological environments with different compactness from soft porous media such as sandy streambeds to more compact porous media such as colluvial streambeds the first part of the lomos mini is the temperature system fig 1a temperature time series are measured in the stream and at several depths along a vertical profile in the hyporheic zone temperature sensors are typically installed along a stick at depths of 10 20 30 and 40 cm below the streambed although the depth and the spacing between probes is adjustable they monitor the propagation of temperature variations with depth with a typical sampling period of 15 min the in situ implementation of the temperature system is detailed in section 4 1 the second part is the monitoring of hydraulic head gradient between the surface and the hyporheic zone fig 1b a pressure differential sensor is installed in the direct vicinity of the temperature system and measures the differential in hydraulic head between the streambed and the bottom of the 1d column the pressure sensor samples every fifteen minutes synchronously with the temperature measurements the mechanical and electronic functioning of the pressure sensor is detailed in section 3 to the authors knowledge the lomos mini is the first system monitoring coupled water and heat exchanges at a high frequency e g 15 min and can therefore provide critical insight for better understanding hydrological geochemical and ecological processes in the hyporheic zone the potential offered by the lomos mini for quantifying stream aquifer exchanges at high frequency is further illustrated in section 4 3 3 the pressure sensor this section presents the pressure part of the lomos mini system which monitors the difference in hydraulic head between the top and the bottom of the vertical sediment column these measurements of typically a few centimeters or less are challenging to obtain with sufficient accuracy essaid et al 2008 the functioning of the pressure sensor is presented and the experimental steps for its calibration accounting for sensitivity to temperature are described 3 1 mechanical and electronic functioning of the pressure sensor the pressure sensor is built upon the technology presented in greswell et al 2009 modified by implementing an adjustable gain in the electronic circuit to better target ranges of hydraulic head differential observable between the stream and the hyporheic zone as detailed further in the section the main points of the electronic implementation are repeated here the hydraulic head differential monitoring relies on a pressure transducer converting the water pressure differential between the stream and the hyporheic zone into an electrical voltage which is measured by the data logger measuring pressure in the form of a differential between the stream and the hyporheic zone avoids the need for barometric pressure compensation the pressure transducer used in the lomos mini is the 26pca series pressure sensor designed by honeywell usa this sensor contains a piezoresistive membrane bending with an amplitude depending on the pressure differential applied on both sides of the membrane fig 2 placed between the tube going to the river and the one going to the hyporheic zone this membrane outputs an electrical voltage proportional to the difference in pressure between the top and the bottom of the sediment column the 26pca series sensor monitors pressure differentials with a magnitude of up to 1 psi 0 7 m water head in both directions and it resists to pressure differentials of up to 20 psi 14 m showing robustness to field conditions the sensor can record both negative and positive pressure differentials and is thus capable of monitoring hydraulic head differentials under both infiltration and exfiltration conditions the pressure sensor sensitivity is 8 35 mv psi 0 119 mv cm head when powered with 5 v a second part in the electronic circuit adjusts the voltage delivered by the piezoresistive membrane to the range made available by the data logger the data logger is an onset hobo and records voltages in the 0 2 5 v range an analog amplifier with adjustable gain is set such that the lomos mini monitors hydraulic head differential ranging between about 10 and 10 cm for most sites and most hydraulic conditions this range in hydraulic head differential is an overestimation of expected hydraulic head differentials between the top and the bottom of a 40 cm hyporheic zone column given the pressure sensor sensitivity the targeted hydraulic head differential range and the data logger recording range the gain is set to be on the order of 10 3 amplifying the signal delivered by the piezoresistive membrane from the order of millivolts to the order of volts notably the value chosen for the gain does not impact the final error made with the sensor finally a 1 25 v reference diode is placed in the electronic circuit to shift the final voltage range to 0 2 5 v as recorded by the onset hobo 3 2 calibration the pressure logger outputs an electrical voltage primarily function of the deformation of the membrane under the applied pressure differential besides the membrane deformation the electronic circuit is also very sensitive to temperature fluctuations the relationship between pressure differential temperature and voltage depends on the gain chosen for the amplifier but also on the temperature sensitivity of each individual component in the electronic circuit therefore each pressure system needs to be individually calibrated this section describes the experimental protocol for calibrating the pressure sensor and establishes the final relationship between hydraulic head differential voltage and temperature from presented calibration experiments 3 2 1 establishing the relationship between voltage and hydraulic head differential first the calibration of voltage measurements with respect to hydraulic head differential is performed this calibration is performed at ambient temperature during the calibration period temperature is close to constant and automatically monitored at a high frequency e g every 1 min a specific design is constructed for the calibration between hydraulic head differential and voltage fig 3 a two tubes the left reproducing the river stage h riv and the right reproducing the hyporheic zone hydraulic head h hz are placed vertically and are connected to the pressure sensor the water height in each tube is modified and the hydraulic head differential and the electrical voltage measured by the pressure sensor are reported for multiple configurations of water heights h riv and h hz the entire range of hydraulic head differential is covered until reaching the saturation of the data logger at 0 and 2 5 v fig 3b the measurements indicate a linear relationship between voltage u and hydraulic head differential δ h δ h h hz h riv until saturation of the data logger is reached a linear curve is then fitted to measurements not included in the data logger saturation zone the fitting relationship is presented in eq 1 where fitted coefficients α and β are estimated from measurements of the calibration experiment 1 δ h u t ref α β u 3 2 2 sensitivity to temperature as mentioned in greswell et al 2009 the electrical voltage measured at the output of the pressure sensor is sensitive to the ambient temperature at which measurements are taken this section presents the calibration method used to quantify the sensitivity of the pressure sensor to temperature conditions experiments used to establish the sensitivity of voltage measurements to temperature variations are conducted in a climatic chamber fig 4 a the climatic chamber is convenient because it enables the control of temperature in the environment where pressure measurements are taken the behavior of the pressure sensor can be tested in a wide range of temperature settings controlled via a programming interface a thermostatically controlled water bath with programmable temperature variations can equivalently be used when available three separate experiments are conducted for each sensor in each experiment a fixed hydraulic head differential is applied to the pressure sensor in the climatic chamber where temperature is programmed to vary linearly in ranges corresponding to temperature conditions that lomos mini can experience in the field the voltage and ambient temperature in the climatic chamber are recorded with a one minute periodicity these experiments show that for a fixed hydraulic head differential the measured difference in electrical potential varies with temperature in a linear fashion fig 4b the voltage signal is noisy this is due to the vibration of the climatic chamber caused by the motor control only the linear fit of voltage variations is considered when interpreting the signal 3 2 3 establishing the relationship between δ h u and t calibration experiments described in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 allow the quantification of measurement errors when the effect of temperature is not taken into account the error quantification is achieved by the mean of a calibration relationship between hydraulic head differential δ h output voltage u and temperature t first coefficients α and β from eq 1 are estimated based on data from experiment 3 2 1 then data from experiment 3 2 2 are used to calculate the hydraulic head differential δ h fit corresponding to the voltage measured in the climatic chamber when using eq 1 which does not account for the effect of temperature finally δ h fit is compared to the hydraulic head differential δ h meas applied during the experiment in the climatic chamber the difference between the fitted hydraulic head differential δ h fit and the hydraulic head differential applied in the climatic chamber δ h meas informs on the estimation error fig 5 a the variation of this estimation error with ambient temperature provides the sensitivity of the calibration relationship to ambient temperature fig 5a shows how the error increases as the difference between the ambient temperature and the temperature t ref 18 c used when establishing the calibration relationship eq 1 increases when the ambient temperature is 5 c the introduced bias is as high as 2 cm this justifies the modification of eq 1 into eq 2 which accounts for temperature in order to account for the effect of temperature on the relationship between voltage and hydraulic head differential the calibration relationship eq 1 is modified to include the temperature variable eq 2 2 δ h ξ 0 ξ 1 u ξ 2 t coefficients ξ 0 ξ 1 and ξ 2 are estimated using data from both experiments the coefficient ξ 2 accounting for the influence of temperature in the relationship between δ h and u is estimated by fitting errors as a function of temperature fig 5a all three coefficients can then be estimated by relating eqs 1 and 2 noting that eq 1 is eq 2 for t t ref these treatments are executed in the form of r scripts r core team 2013 which provide calibration coefficients ξ i from data provided in experiments 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 coefficient values obtained during calibrations of five different pressure sensors are summarized in table 1 fig 5b shows errors in hydraulic head differential estimates as a function of temperature residual variability remains in the estimates due to the imperfection of the technology and measurements such as the hysteresis of the membrane or the temporal lag between air temperature variations and temperature of water in contact with the membrane when temperature is not taken into account in the calibration relationship i e when eq 1 is used for calibration errors associated with temperatures close to 5 c are on the order of 2 cm in comparison when taking into account the effect of temperature on the calibration relationship errors associated with temperatures close to 5 c are on the order of 2 mm taking into account the temperature correction can therefore reduce the estimation error on δ h by up to one order of magnitude 4 deployment of the lomos mini in the field this section presents the installation of the lomos mini in the field emphasizing how the experimental solution proposed is robust avoiding the contact between the electronic equipment and water and enabling the monitoring in compact geological settings a set of time series measured in the field is shown and is used to estimate transient and vertically distributed water and heat fluxes with the help of a numerical hydrothermal model 4 1 in situ implementation of the lomos mini lomos mini measurements rely on the installation of the pressure and temperature systems in close proximity fig 6 shows the final installation of the lomos mini system in the field this installation takes between 1 and 3 h depending on the resistance of the streambed sediments to the insertion of the hyporheic tube the purpose of the pressure system is to measure the hydraulic head differential between a point at depth in the hyporheic zone and the stream using the electronic circuit presented in section 3 this circuit is placed at the center of a waterproof box in hydraulic connection to the river and to the hyporheic zone figs 6a a c and 6b the box is designed to contain the equipment supporting the electronic circuit including a pack of six aa batteries with 1 5 v individual voltage powering the electronic circuit with a voltage greater than 7 v fig 6b d and the hobo device which serves both as trigger for taking measurements and as data logger fig 6b f several steps are followed to minimize chances of contact between water and electronic equipment inside the box first the electronic circuit implemented on an electronic board is flown into a silicone rubber fig 6b g silicone rubbers are easy to vulcanize and have a wide biological resistance they are therefore well suited to protect the electronic equipment second all components are placed in a hermetically sealed plastic box the box follows the ip68 standard resisting to continuous immersion beyond 1 m ip6 2005 a fluoroelastomer at the contact between the lid and the box ensures that the box is hermetically sealed 4 screws firmly seal the lid to the box the contact zone between the box and its lid is wrapped in electrical tape as an additional security to water intrusions finally balls of silica gel serve as a desiccant to absorb residual humidity that can appear from condensation experience has shown that these steps minimize the risk of water intrusion in the box following these steps ensures that electronic components remain dry throughout the in situ experiment during which the box can be continuously immersed in water for several weeks the pressure sensor located inside the pressure box is connected to two tubes one going to the river and one going into the hyporheic zone each tube is made of flexible and transparent plastic with inner diameter 16 mm and outer diameter 20 mm the stream tube is a few centimeters long and connects the pressure sensor to the pressure in the stream a fine grid placed at its extremity prevents the intrusion and clogging of elements inside the tube fig 6a b the hyporheic tube is positioned in the streambed its extremity at a depth equal to the depth of the deepest temperature sensor fig 6a c the bottom of the tube is perforated along 2 3 cm so that the hydraulic head in the tube equals the hydraulic head in the hyporheic zone at depth positioning the tube into the hyporheic zone is a delicate step especially so in compact geological environments such as colluvial environments it is achieved by pushing the tube with a manual drilling system as follows first an aluminum lost tip is fixed to the extremity of the tube the plastic tube is then inserted inside a more solid metal tube with inner diameter slightly larger than the outer diameter of the hyporheic tube a clamping ring fixed around the metal tube then allows the use of a hammer to push the hyporheic tube into the subsurface it is the use of a metal tip and hammer that allows the installation of such systems in compact geological environments once the desired depth is reached the hammer and metal tubes are removed and leaving the hyporheic tube in place the hyporheic tube is then fixed to the ribbed connection of the pressure box ensuring no pressure head loss or water intrusion at the connection fig 6b c after the installation the pressure membrane is at the interface between stream water and hyporheic zone water the system is designed for saturated hyporheic zones in connection with the stream brunner et al 2009 indeed the hydraulic head in the hyporheic zone needs to be greater than the elevation of the pressure sensor to maintain hydraulic connection between the pressure sensor and the water in the hyporheic zone the temperature system is implemented in the vicinity of the pressure system fig 6a d e the temperature probes are 3 wires 10 k ω ntc sensors compatible with the hobo data logger water soil temperature sensor tmc6 hd provided by onset the metal cap on the sensor has a cylindrical shape with height 25 mm and diameter 5 mm therefore the temperature measured at one depth is integrated over the 25 mm of the metal sensor these probes measure temperature above 0 c with 0 3 c accuracy four temperature probes are placed at regular intervals along a plastic sick on which notches of the size of the temperature caps are cut plastic is chosen because it is a thermal insulator and it is resistant to field conditions the insertion of the temperature stick in the hyporheic sediments is done by first drilling a hole using a metal tube ending with a tip the metal tube is then removed and replaced by the stick where the vertically distributed temperature probes are fixed each temperature sensor is connected to one hobo slot the hobo is then placed in a waterproof box with similar characteristics than the pressure box both the pressure and the temperature boxes need to be waterproof and to resist immersion in the stream over several weeks indeed the challenge in the field is to maintain the hydraulic connection of the circuit to the stream and hyporheic zone waters while keeping the electronic circuit dry in a waterproof environment moreover experience has shown that maintaining the temperature box under water minimizes the risk of seeing wild life damaging electrical cables linking temperature probes to the data logger 4 2 measured set of time series in the field this section presents a set of time series measured for one installation of the lomos mini system in the field water and heat exchanges estimated from this set of measurements are presented in section 4 3 the lomos mini system was tested at the avenelles basin a sedimentary catchment in the seine basin loumagne and tallec 2013 the avenelles basin is a well instrumented site where the monitoring network has been designed to quantify stream aquifer exchanges over multiple scales mouhri et al 2013 measurements presented in this section correspond to the installation of a lomos mini system in the middle part of the avenelles basin at a location where the streambed is composed of loess and underlaid by colluvium with blocks of gritstone to the authors knowledge this is one of the first experiments in this type of environment for the quantification of hyporheic exchanges fig 7 shows temperature and hydraulic head differential time series measured by a lomos mini hydraulic head estimates using both calibration relationships are presented one where temperature is taken into account in the calibration relationship eq 1 one where temperature is not taken into account eq 2 it is critical to account for the influence of temperature on hydraulic head differential estimates when investigating hydraulic head differential in the hyporheic zone where measurements need to be precise in the order of a few millimeters discarding the temperature effect when transducing voltage measurements to hydraulic head differential estimates can result in underestimating hydraulic head differential in some cases not taking into account the temperature effects can also lead to a misconception of the direction of exchanges for example when head differentials fluctuate around 0 m in fig 7 4 3 estimating exchanged fluxes from lomos mini measurements this section presents an example of flux estimates to illustrate the potential of the monitoring system when hydrological and thermal properties in the streambed are known when properties are unknown hydrological and thermal parameters can be estimated using inversion methods this will be the focus of later studies temperature and hydraulic head along the 1d vertical column can be simulated by a transient heat transport and water flow numerical model this study uses the numerical model ginette a fully coupled transient finite volume model solving for water and heat transport in porous media rivière et al 2014 boundary conditions applied to the numerical model are the hydraulic head differential time series as well as the top and bottom temperature time series the other temperature time series can be used to validate the choice of hydrological and thermal parameters in the numerical simulation simulated temperature and hydraulic head time series are sensitive to the initial temperature and pressure field assigned to the 1d column therefore a spin up period of 2 days is discarded from the analysis hypotheses associated with this approach are that water and heat fluxes between the stream and the aquifer are vertical that spatial variability of water and heat fluxes in the spacing between the pressure and the temperature probes is neglectable and that hydrological and thermal properties in the sediment column are known fig 8 shows vertical water and heat exchanges estimated from the set of measurements presented in fig 7 soil properties used in the numerical simulation are summarized in table 2 the corresponding root mean squared error between measured and simulated temperature time series is 0 05 c fluxes are extracted from the numerical model at the top cell they therefore represent the conditions right at the interface between the stream and the hyporheic zone in fig 8 colored time periods correspond to a positive thermal gradient in the column when temperature in the stream is higher than temperature at the bottom of the sediment column and when the stream is therefore expected to lose heat by thermal conduction these time periods are derived from the measured temperature time series presented in fig 7 the use of a transient model provides a detailed description of dynamics of the water and heat fluxes at the location and period associated with measurements water velocity was mostly positive corresponding to a gaining stream where water flows from the hyporheic zone into the stream fig 8 this is in line with the positive head differential along the 1d column observed in fig 7 where the hydraulic head is higher at the bottom of the hyporheic zone than at the top during most of the recording a gain of thermal energy in the stream by advection are expected during time periods when water velocity is positive fig 8 shows that the direction of advective heat fluxes is closely related to the magnitude of the water fluxes as expected conductive heat flux shows a higher temporal variability with a daily periodicity due to diurnal variations of stream temperature during the day when stream temperature is higher than hyporheic zone temperature the conductive heat flux is lower than average this corresponds to a situation where the heat propagates towards the hyporheic zone on the contrary during the night when stream temperature is lower than hyporheic zone temperature the conductive heat flux is higher than average another noticable point is the correspondance between the direction of the conductive flux and the sign of the thermal gradient in the hyporheic column as expected when the thermal gradient is positive i e when temperature is higher in the stream than at the bottom of the hyporheic zone the conductive heat flux is negative i e hyporheic zone sediments conduct heat downwards fig 9 further illustrates the potential of measurements taken by the lomos mini system by showing the spatial distribution of temperature and heat fluxes along the vertical column in the hyporheic zone fig 9a shows the temperature profiles along the 1d column and the well documented propagation and dampening of the diurnal temperature variations with depth advective fluxes fig 9b are homogeneous along the 1d column this is because they are proportional to the water velocity which is homogeneous along the 1d column conductive fluxes exhibit a higher spatial variability fig 9c frequent reversals in the direction of conductive fluxes at the top of the column are due to the propagation of stream diurnal temperature fluctuations in the porous media the depth of this reversal varies from day to day as the magnitude of daily temperature variations in the stream varies figs 8 and 9 illustrate the importance of the conductive term when quantifying heat exchange in the hyporheic zone however noting that even for low darcy velocity the advective term has the same order of magnitude than conductive heat flux coupled with a numerical model a lomos mini therefore enables high frequency estimation of advective and conductive heat fluxes along a vertical streambed profile as illustrated in fig 9b c d under stable hydraulics conditions most heat fluxes reversals are due to diurnal stream temperature fluctuations while the advective terms become predominant under transient hydrological conditions then driving energy flux reversals 5 conclusion this paper introduces the lomos mini an innovative experimental sensor monitoring water and heat exchanges in the hyporheic zone at a sub daily temporal resolution e g every 15 min the sensor operates under saturated conditions and monitors vertical exchanges at the local scale 0 1 1 m when compared to other available methods lomos mini measurements allow to relax the assumption of steady water flux and therefore enable the quantification of transient water exchanges accounting for dynamic hydrologic boundary conditions the lomos mini has been used intensely in the field and has proven to be resistant to a variety of climatic and hydrological conditions building upon the pressure sensor technology presented by greswell et al 2009 the lomos mini coupled pressure and temperature sensor pursues a similar purpose in that it is an easy to use inexpensive and robust equipment for automated data collection in the field it is therefore well suited for researchers and practitioners usually operating under time constraints and on a limited budget stream aquifer exchanges result from a variety of hydrological and geomorphological controls characterized by low and high temporal frequencies as well as spatial heterogeneity they therefore exhibit high variability over multiple temporal and spatial scales e g flipo et al 2014 the lomos mini offers a novel insight into the temporal complexity of local vertical exchanges by enabling the quantification of fluxes driven by dynamic hydrological boundary conditions which can have the same order of magnitude than those driven by the well studied stream geomorphologic features schmadel et al 2016 moreover the lomos mini is designed to be easy to deploy in the field and when installed at multiple locations lomos mini sensors can provide spatially distributed information on the exchange dynamics for these reasons the lomos mini is expected to contribute to future efforts supported by field data aiming at

aquifer interface but noted that the meters disturb the river flow field and alter measured exchanges particularly at low flow solder et al 2016 introduced a tube seepage meter allowing for estimates of vertical seepage rates and streambed hydraulic conductivity with minimal perturbation to sediment and water flow however it is based on an active change of water levels and therefore provides a snapshot estimate at the time when measurements are taken the tracking of natural tracers provides valuable information about the magnitude of stream aquifer exchanges xie et al 2016 in particular the usage of heat as a tracer of flow in the hyporheic zone has received considerable attention because it is relatively easy fast and inexpensive to measure anderson 2005 constantz 2008 a popular method consists of placing temperature sensors at different depths along a vertical profile in sediments below the stream the propagation of diurnal temperature variations with depth informs about the magnitude of water exchanges between the stream and the underlying hyporheic zone using either an analytical approximation to the heat equation with constant seepage and sinusoidal temperature boundary conditions e g hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 cuthbert et al 2010 or with the help of a numerical model solving for transient flow and heat transport along a vertical sediment column e g anibas et al 2009 cranswick et al 2014 recent analytical development by caissie and luce 2017 permit to estimate transient conductive and advective fluxes driven by diurnal and annual temperature variations from vertically distributed temperature time series but still relying on constant seepage velocity calibrated from a numerical model this paper presents a new sampling system called lomos mini local monitoring station mini which monitors vertical water and heat exchanges between a stream and its underlying aquifer at higher temporal frequency than other currently existing methods the lomos mini relies on the coupling of pressure and temperature measurements the main benefit of the lomos mini is the quantification of water and heat exchanges at a sub daily resolution e g every 15 min when used in combination with a vertically distributed hydrothermal numerical model in particular temporally varying response to particular hydrological events can be quantified rosenberry et al 2013 for example dudley southern and binley 2015 showed that the rapid rise of surface water levels after a rainfall event can lead to a temporary reversal of flow direction towards infiltration in the hyporheic zone monitoring methods available to date do not allow for the quantification of this reversal in water fluxes and associated heat fluxes at a sub daily resolution the main objective of this paper is to introduce the lomos mini designed to be easy to use inexpensive and reliable in the field the design of the pressure and temperature sensors and their implementation on the field are described and the use of a lomos mini is illustrated with a set of experimental measurements and corresponding flux estimates the deployment of several lomos mini will provide the ability to monitor water and heat fluxes between a stream and its underlying aquifer at high spatial and temporal resolution this paper is organized as follows the first part presents the sampling system the second part is dedicated to the calibration procedure particularly demonstrating the necessity of taking into account the effect of temperature when deriving hydraulic head gradients the last part describes the implementation of lomos mini in the field and illustrates its ability to monitor high frequency stream aquifer exchanges on a case study in the avenelles basin france mouhri et al 2013 where the streambed is composed of loess and underlaid by colluvium with blocks of gritstone a rarely sampled type of hyporheic zone 2 presentation of the lomos mini the lomos mini draws from lomos stations presented in mouhri et al 2013 for monitoring spatially distributed and temporally varying stream aquifer exchanges in both cases the quantification relies on a combination of hydraulic head differential and temperature measurements mouhri et al 2013 applied their methodology to a small sedimentary basin the avenelles basin france five lomos stations placed along the hydrological network monitored the stream aquifer exchange dynamics from hydraulic head and temperature measurements each lomos station consists of piezometers located in both banks of the stream and of a pressure sensor located in the stream and monitoring the stream stage all sensors also monitor temperature and constrain the boundaries of a two dimensional stream cross section heat is then used as a tracer of the flow to estimate continuous records of stream aquifer exchanges similar to the lomos the lomos mini couples hydraulic head gradient measurements with temperature measurements whereas the lomos constrains flow within a stream cross section lomos mini measurements are taken along a vertical column within the hyporheic zone at the local scale 0 1 1 m flipo et al 2014 this redesign implies to modify the monitoring system so that 1 it operates within the streambed instead of the stream banks and 2 it is able to measure hydraulic head differentials of the order of a few centimeters or less this is the role of the pressure differential sensor presented in section 3 the one dimensional 1d column along which measurements are taken is typically 40 80 cm deep although it can be easily adjusted depending on characterization needs fig 1 presents the monitoring system along a vertical cross section for the infiltrating case where hydraulic head is higher in the stream than at the bottom of the hyporheic zone and flow is directed downwards the lomos mini is designed to be installed in low order streams with a typical strahler number of 1 3 strahler 1952 and is thus adapted to monitor upstream river networks where discharge genesis usually occurs the streams need to be accessible by foot and it is recommended to make the installation when the water level in the stream is lower than 1 m to ensure that the implementation of the device in the streambed is possible the lomos mini is designed to operate under saturated conditions section 4 1 where the river and the hyporheic zone are connected brunner et al 2009 the lomos mini is a low cost system which can be constructed for about 500 including the two onset hobo data loggers as further detailed in section 4 1 the implementation of the lomos mini is robust and therefore suitable for a variety of geological environments with different compactness from soft porous media such as sandy streambeds to more compact porous media such as colluvial streambeds the first part of the lomos mini is the temperature system fig 1a temperature time series are measured in the stream and at several depths along a vertical profile in the hyporheic zone temperature sensors are typically installed along a stick at depths of 10 20 30 and 40 cm below the streambed although the depth and the spacing between probes is adjustable they monitor the propagation of temperature variations with depth with a typical sampling period of 15 min the in situ implementation of the temperature system is detailed in section 4 1 the second part is the monitoring of hydraulic head gradient between the surface and the hyporheic zone fig 1b a pressure differential sensor is installed in the direct vicinity of the temperature system and measures the differential in hydraulic head between the streambed and the bottom of the 1d column the pressure sensor samples every fifteen minutes synchronously with the temperature measurements the mechanical and electronic functioning of the pressure sensor is detailed in section 3 to the authors knowledge the lomos mini is the first system monitoring coupled water and heat exchanges at a high frequency e g 15 min and can therefore provide critical insight for better understanding hydrological geochemical and ecological processes in the hyporheic zone the potential offered by the lomos mini for quantifying stream aquifer exchanges at high frequency is further illustrated in section 4 3 3 the pressure sensor this section presents the pressure part of the lomos mini system which monitors the difference in hydraulic head between the top and the bottom of the vertical sediment column these measurements of typically a few centimeters or less are challenging to obtain with sufficient accuracy essaid et al 2008 the functioning of the pressure sensor is presented and the experimental steps for its calibration accounting for sensitivity to temperature are described 3 1 mechanical and electronic functioning of the pressure sensor the pressure sensor is built upon the technology presented in greswell et al 2009 modified by implementing an adjustable gain in the electronic circuit to better target ranges of hydraulic head differential observable between the stream and the hyporheic zone as detailed further in the section the main points of the electronic implementation are repeated here the hydraulic head differential monitoring relies on a pressure transducer converting the water pressure differential between the stream and the hyporheic zone into an electrical voltage which is measured by the data logger measuring pressure in the form of a differential between the stream and the hyporheic zone avoids the need for barometric pressure compensation the pressure transducer used in the lomos mini is the 26pca series pressure sensor designed by honeywell usa this sensor contains a piezoresistive membrane bending with an amplitude depending on the pressure differential applied on both sides of the membrane fig 2 placed between the tube going to the river and the one going to the hyporheic zone this membrane outputs an electrical voltage proportional to the difference in pressure between the top and the bottom of the sediment column the 26pca series sensor monitors pressure differentials with a magnitude of up to 1 psi 0 7 m water head in both directions and it resists to pressure differentials of up to 20 psi 14 m showing robustness to field conditions the sensor can record both negative and positive pressure differentials and is thus capable of monitoring hydraulic head differentials under both infiltration and exfiltration conditions the pressure sensor sensitivity is 8 35 mv psi 0 119 mv cm head when powered with 5 v a second part in the electronic circuit adjusts the voltage delivered by the piezoresistive membrane to the range made available by the data logger the data logger is an onset hobo and records voltages in the 0 2 5 v range an analog amplifier with adjustable gain is set such that the lomos mini monitors hydraulic head differential ranging between about 10 and 10 cm for most sites and most hydraulic conditions this range in hydraulic head differential is an overestimation of expected hydraulic head differentials between the top and the bottom of a 40 cm hyporheic zone column given the pressure sensor sensitivity the targeted hydraulic head differential range and the data logger recording range the gain is set to be on the order of 10 3 amplifying the signal delivered by the piezoresistive membrane from the order of millivolts to the order of volts notably the value chosen for the gain does not impact the final error made with the sensor finally a 1 25 v reference diode is placed in the electronic circuit to shift the final voltage range to 0 2 5 v as recorded by the onset hobo 3 2 calibration the pressure logger outputs an electrical voltage primarily function of the deformation of the membrane under the applied pressure differential besides the membrane deformation the electronic circuit is also very sensitive to temperature fluctuations the relationship between pressure differential temperature and voltage depends on the gain chosen for the amplifier but also on the temperature sensitivity of each individual component in the electronic circuit therefore each pressure system needs to be individually calibrated this section describes the experimental protocol for calibrating the pressure sensor and establishes the final relationship between hydraulic head differential voltage and temperature from presented calibration experiments 3 2 1 establishing the relationship between voltage and hydraulic head differential first the calibration of voltage measurements with respect to hydraulic head differential is performed this calibration is performed at ambient temperature during the calibration period temperature is close to constant and automatically monitored at a high frequency e g every 1 min a specific design is constructed for the calibration between hydraulic head differential and voltage fig 3 a two tubes the left reproducing the river stage h riv and the right reproducing the hyporheic zone hydraulic head h hz are placed vertically and are connected to the pressure sensor the water height in each tube is modified and the hydraulic head differential and the electrical voltage measured by the pressure sensor are reported for multiple configurations of water heights h riv and h hz the entire range of hydraulic head differential is covered until reaching the saturation of the data logger at 0 and 2 5 v fig 3b the measurements indicate a linear relationship between voltage u and hydraulic head differential δ h δ h h hz h riv until saturation of the data logger is reached a linear curve is then fitted to measurements not included in the data logger saturation zone the fitting relationship is presented in eq 1 where fitted coefficients α and β are estimated from measurements of the calibration experiment 1 δ h u t ref α β u 3 2 2 sensitivity to temperature as mentioned in greswell et al 2009 the electrical voltage measured at the output of the pressure sensor is sensitive to the ambient temperature at which measurements are taken this section presents the calibration method used to quantify the sensitivity of the pressure sensor to temperature conditions experiments used to establish the sensitivity of voltage measurements to temperature variations are conducted in a climatic chamber fig 4 a the climatic chamber is convenient because it enables the control of temperature in the environment where pressure measurements are taken the behavior of the pressure sensor can be tested in a wide range of temperature settings controlled via a programming interface a thermostatically controlled water bath with programmable temperature variations can equivalently be used when available three separate experiments are conducted for each sensor in each experiment a fixed hydraulic head differential is applied to the pressure sensor in the climatic chamber where temperature is programmed to vary linearly in ranges corresponding to temperature conditions that lomos mini can experience in the field the voltage and ambient temperature in the climatic chamber are recorded with a one minute periodicity these experiments show that for a fixed hydraulic head differential the measured difference in electrical potential varies with temperature in a linear fashion fig 4b the voltage signal is noisy this is due to the vibration of the climatic chamber caused by the motor control only the linear fit of voltage variations is considered when interpreting the signal 3 2 3 establishing the relationship between δ h u and t calibration experiments described in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 allow the quantification of measurement errors when the effect of temperature is not taken into account the error quantification is achieved by the mean of a calibration relationship between hydraulic head differential δ h output voltage u and temperature t first coefficients α and β from eq 1 are estimated based on data from experiment 3 2 1 then data from experiment 3 2 2 are used to calculate the hydraulic head differential δ h fit corresponding to the voltage measured in the climatic chamber when using eq 1 which does not account for the effect of temperature finally δ h fit is compared to the hydraulic head differential δ h meas applied during the experiment in the climatic chamber the difference between the fitted hydraulic head differential δ h fit and the hydraulic head differential applied in the climatic chamber δ h meas informs on the estimation error fig 5 a the variation of this estimation error with ambient temperature provides the sensitivity of the calibration relationship to ambient temperature fig 5a shows how the error increases as the difference between the ambient temperature and the temperature t ref 18 c used when establishing the calibration relationship eq 1 increases when the ambient temperature is 5 c the introduced bias is as high as 2 cm this justifies the modification of eq 1 into eq 2 which accounts for temperature in order to account for the effect of temperature on the relationship between voltage and hydraulic head differential the calibration relationship eq 1 is modified to include the temperature variable eq 2 2 δ h ξ 0 ξ 1 u ξ 2 t coefficients ξ 0 ξ 1 and ξ 2 are estimated using data from both experiments the coefficient ξ 2 accounting for the influence of temperature in the relationship between δ h and u is estimated by fitting errors as a function of temperature fig 5a all three coefficients can then be estimated by relating eqs 1 and 2 noting that eq 1 is eq 2 for t t ref these treatments are executed in the form of r scripts r core team 2013 which provide calibration coefficients ξ i from data provided in experiments 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 coefficient values obtained during calibrations of five different pressure sensors are summarized in table 1 fig 5b shows errors in hydraulic head differential estimates as a function of temperature residual variability remains in the estimates due to the imperfection of the technology and measurements such as the hysteresis of the membrane or the temporal lag between air temperature variations and temperature of water in contact with the membrane when temperature is not taken into account in the calibration relationship i e when eq 1 is used for calibration errors associated with temperatures close to 5 c are on the order of 2 cm in comparison when taking into account the effect of temperature on the calibration relationship errors associated with temperatures close to 5 c are on the order of 2 mm taking into account the temperature correction can therefore reduce the estimation error on δ h by up to one order of magnitude 4 deployment of the lomos mini in the field this section presents the installation of the lomos mini in the field emphasizing how the experimental solution proposed is robust avoiding the contact between the electronic equipment and water and enabling the monitoring in compact geological settings a set of time series measured in the field is shown and is used to estimate transient and vertically distributed water and heat fluxes with the help of a numerical hydrothermal model 4 1 in situ implementation of the lomos mini lomos mini measurements rely on the installation of the pressure and temperature systems in close proximity fig 6 shows the final installation of the lomos mini system in the field this installation takes between 1 and 3 h depending on the resistance of the streambed sediments to the insertion of the hyporheic tube the purpose of the pressure system is to measure the hydraulic head differential between a point at depth in the hyporheic zone and the stream using the electronic circuit presented in section 3 this circuit is placed at the center of a waterproof box in hydraulic connection to the river and to the hyporheic zone figs 6a a c and 6b the box is designed to contain the equipment supporting the electronic circuit including a pack of six aa batteries with 1 5 v individual voltage powering the electronic circuit with a voltage greater than 7 v fig 6b d and the hobo device which serves both as trigger for taking measurements and as data logger fig 6b f several steps are followed to minimize chances of contact between water and electronic equipment inside the box first the electronic circuit implemented on an electronic board is flown into a silicone rubber fig 6b g silicone rubbers are easy to vulcanize and have a wide biological resistance they are therefore well suited to protect the electronic equipment second all components are placed in a hermetically sealed plastic box the box follows the ip68 standard resisting to continuous immersion beyond 1 m ip6 2005 a fluoroelastomer at the contact between the lid and the box ensures that the box is hermetically sealed 4 screws firmly seal the lid to the box the contact zone between the box and its lid is wrapped in electrical tape as an additional security to water intrusions finally balls of silica gel serve as a desiccant to absorb residual humidity that can appear from condensation experience has shown that these steps minimize the risk of water intrusion in the box following these steps ensures that electronic components remain dry throughout the in situ experiment during which the box can be continuously immersed in water for several weeks the pressure sensor located inside the pressure box is connected to two tubes one going to the river and one going into the hyporheic zone each tube is made of flexible and transparent plastic with inner diameter 16 mm and outer diameter 20 mm the stream tube is a few centimeters long and connects the pressure sensor to the pressure in the stream a fine grid placed at its extremity prevents the intrusion and clogging of elements inside the tube fig 6a b the hyporheic tube is positioned in the streambed its extremity at a depth equal to the depth of the deepest temperature sensor fig 6a c the bottom of the tube is perforated along 2 3 cm so that the hydraulic head in the tube equals the hydraulic head in the hyporheic zone at depth positioning the tube into the hyporheic zone is a delicate step especially so in compact geological environments such as colluvial environments it is achieved by pushing the tube with a manual drilling system as follows first an aluminum lost tip is fixed to the extremity of the tube the plastic tube is then inserted inside a more solid metal tube with inner diameter slightly larger than the outer diameter of the hyporheic tube a clamping ring fixed around the metal tube then allows the use of a hammer to push the hyporheic tube into the subsurface it is the use of a metal tip and hammer that allows the installation of such systems in compact geological environments once the desired depth is reached the hammer and metal tubes are removed and leaving the hyporheic tube in place the hyporheic tube is then fixed to the ribbed connection of the pressure box ensuring no pressure head loss or water intrusion at the connection fig 6b c after the installation the pressure membrane is at the interface between stream water and hyporheic zone water the system is designed for saturated hyporheic zones in connection with the stream brunner et al 2009 indeed the hydraulic head in the hyporheic zone needs to be greater than the elevation of the pressure sensor to maintain hydraulic connection between the pressure sensor and the water in the hyporheic zone the temperature system is implemented in the vicinity of the pressure system fig 6a d e the temperature probes are 3 wires 10 k ω ntc sensors compatible with the hobo data logger water soil temperature sensor tmc6 hd provided by onset the metal cap on the sensor has a cylindrical shape with height 25 mm and diameter 5 mm therefore the temperature measured at one depth is integrated over the 25 mm of the metal sensor these probes measure temperature above 0 c with 0 3 c accuracy four temperature probes are placed at regular intervals along a plastic sick on which notches of the size of the temperature caps are cut plastic is chosen because it is a thermal insulator and it is resistant to field conditions the insertion of the temperature stick in the hyporheic sediments is done by first drilling a hole using a metal tube ending with a tip the metal tube is then removed and replaced by the stick where the vertically distributed temperature probes are fixed each temperature sensor is connected to one hobo slot the hobo is then placed in a waterproof box with similar characteristics than the pressure box both the pressure and the temperature boxes need to be waterproof and to resist immersion in the stream over several weeks indeed the challenge in the field is to maintain the hydraulic connection of the circuit to the stream and hyporheic zone waters while keeping the electronic circuit dry in a waterproof environment moreover experience has shown that maintaining the temperature box under water minimizes the risk of seeing wild life damaging electrical cables linking temperature probes to the data logger 4 2 measured set of time series in the field this section presents a set of time series measured for one installation of the lomos mini system in the field water and heat exchanges estimated from this set of measurements are presented in section 4 3 the lomos mini system was tested at the avenelles basin a sedimentary catchment in the seine basin loumagne and tallec 2013 the avenelles basin is a well instrumented site where the monitoring network has been designed to quantify stream aquifer exchanges over multiple scales mouhri et al 2013 measurements presented in this section correspond to the installation of a lomos mini system in the middle part of the avenelles basin at a location where the streambed is composed of loess and underlaid by colluvium with blocks of gritstone to the authors knowledge this is one of the first experiments in this type of environment for the quantification of hyporheic exchanges fig 7 shows temperature and hydraulic head differential time series measured by a lomos mini hydraulic head estimates using both calibration relationships are presented one where temperature is taken into account in the calibration relationship eq 1 one where temperature is not taken into account eq 2 it is critical to account for the influence of temperature on hydraulic head differential estimates when investigating hydraulic head differential in the hyporheic zone where measurements need to be precise in the order of a few millimeters discarding the temperature effect when transducing voltage measurements to hydraulic head differential estimates can result in underestimating hydraulic head differential in some cases not taking into account the temperature effects can also lead to a misconception of the direction of exchanges for example when head differentials fluctuate around 0 m in fig 7 4 3 estimating exchanged fluxes from lomos mini measurements this section presents an example of flux estimates to illustrate the potential of the monitoring system when hydrological and thermal properties in the streambed are known when properties are unknown hydrological and thermal parameters can be estimated using inversion methods this will be the focus of later studies temperature and hydraulic head along the 1d vertical column can be simulated by a transient heat transport and water flow numerical model this study uses the numerical model ginette a fully coupled transient finite volume model solving for water and heat transport in porous media rivière et al 2014 boundary conditions applied to the numerical model are the hydraulic head differential time series as well as the top and bottom temperature time series the other temperature time series can be used to validate the choice of hydrological and thermal parameters in the numerical simulation simulated temperature and hydraulic head time series are sensitive to the initial temperature and pressure field assigned to the 1d column therefore a spin up period of 2 days is discarded from the analysis hypotheses associated with this approach are that water and heat fluxes between the stream and the aquifer are vertical that spatial variability of water and heat fluxes in the spacing between the pressure and the temperature probes is neglectable and that hydrological and thermal properties in the sediment column are known fig 8 shows vertical water and heat exchanges estimated from the set of measurements presented in fig 7 soil properties used in the numerical simulation are summarized in table 2 the corresponding root mean squared error between measured and simulated temperature time series is 0 05 c fluxes are extracted from the numerical model at the top cell they therefore represent the conditions right at the interface between the stream and the hyporheic zone in fig 8 colored time periods correspond to a positive thermal gradient in the column when temperature in the stream is higher than temperature at the bottom of the sediment column and when the stream is therefore expected to lose heat by thermal conduction these time periods are derived from the measured temperature time series presented in fig 7 the use of a transient model provides a detailed description of dynamics of the water and heat fluxes at the location and period associated with measurements water velocity was mostly positive corresponding to a gaining stream where water flows from the hyporheic zone into the stream fig 8 this is in line with the positive head differential along the 1d column observed in fig 7 where the hydraulic head is higher at the bottom of the hyporheic zone than at the top during most of the recording a gain of thermal energy in the stream by advection are expected during time periods when water velocity is positive fig 8 shows that the direction of advective heat fluxes is closely related to the magnitude of the water fluxes as expected conductive heat flux shows a higher temporal variability with a daily periodicity due to diurnal variations of stream temperature during the day when stream temperature is higher than hyporheic zone temperature the conductive heat flux is lower than average this corresponds to a situation where the heat propagates towards the hyporheic zone on the contrary during the night when stream temperature is lower than hyporheic zone temperature the conductive heat flux is higher than average another noticable point is the correspondance between the direction of the conductive flux and the sign of the thermal gradient in the hyporheic column as expected when the thermal gradient is positive i e when temperature is higher in the stream than at the bottom of the hyporheic zone the conductive heat flux is negative i e hyporheic zone sediments conduct heat downwards fig 9 further illustrates the potential of measurements taken by the lomos mini system by showing the spatial distribution of temperature and heat fluxes along the vertical column in the hyporheic zone fig 9a shows the temperature profiles along the 1d column and the well documented propagation and dampening of the diurnal temperature variations with depth advective fluxes fig 9b are homogeneous along the 1d column this is because they are proportional to the water velocity which is homogeneous along the 1d column conductive fluxes exhibit a higher spatial variability fig 9c frequent reversals in the direction of conductive fluxes at the top of the column are due to the propagation of stream diurnal temperature fluctuations in the porous media the depth of this reversal varies from day to day as the magnitude of daily temperature variations in the stream varies figs 8 and 9 illustrate the importance of the conductive term when quantifying heat exchange in the hyporheic zone however noting that even for low darcy velocity the advective term has the same order of magnitude than conductive heat flux coupled with a numerical model a lomos mini therefore enables high frequency estimation of advective and conductive heat fluxes along a vertical streambed profile as illustrated in fig 9b c d under stable hydraulics conditions most heat fluxes reversals are due to diurnal stream temperature fluctuations while the advective terms become predominant under transient hydrological conditions then driving energy flux reversals 5 conclusion this paper introduces the lomos mini an innovative experimental sensor monitoring water and heat exchanges in the hyporheic zone at a sub daily temporal resolution e g every 15 min the sensor operates under saturated conditions and monitors vertical exchanges at the local scale 0 1 1 m when compared to other available methods lomos mini measurements allow to relax the assumption of steady water flux and therefore enable the quantification of transient water exchanges accounting for dynamic hydrologic boundary conditions the lomos mini has been used intensely in the field and has proven to be resistant to a variety of climatic and hydrological conditions building upon the pressure sensor technology presented by greswell et al 2009 the lomos mini coupled pressure and temperature sensor pursues a similar purpose in that it is an easy to use inexpensive and robust equipment for automated data collection in the field it is therefore well suited for researchers and practitioners usually operating under time constraints and on a limited budget stream aquifer exchanges result from a variety of hydrological and geomorphological controls characterized by low and high temporal frequencies as well as spatial heterogeneity they therefore exhibit high variability over multiple temporal and spatial scales e g flipo et al 2014 the lomos mini offers a novel insight into the temporal complexity of local vertical exchanges by enabling the quantification of fluxes driven by dynamic hydrological boundary conditions which can have the same order of magnitude than those driven by the well studied stream geomorphologic features schmadel et al 2016 moreover the lomos mini is designed to be easy to deploy in the field and when installed at multiple locations lomos mini sensors can provide spatially distributed information on the exchange dynamics for these reasons the lomos mini is expected to contribute to future efforts supported by field data aiming at

7322,the chloride mass balance method of estimating groundwater recharge is generally applied at a point scale but water resources management generally requires information at a regional scale to estimate groundwater recharge regionally previously used upscaling methods have ranged from simple averaging to empirical relationships and geostatistical interpolation this study combined the best components of these methods by using regression kriging in data sparse areas the recharge is upscaled using global regression equations with gridded rainfall and surface geology as covariates while in data dense areas the kriging of the regression equation residuals ensures that the upscaled recharge estimates respect the point estimates of recharge the uncertainty in the recharge estimates was quantified using 1000 stochastic replicates of the chloride deposition of rainfall the chloride exported in runoff the chloride concentration of the groundwater and the regression equations used to perform the upscaling this study focused on the coal bearing sydney gunnedah gloucester and surat basins of eastern new south wales australia historically groundwater recharge to the permian units of these basins has received little attention due to their low yields of poor quality water the increased potential extraction of regional groundwater due to coal development has demanded a greater understanding of the water balance we found that recharge is highest in the younger productive aquifers up to 20 of long term mean annual rainfall and lowest in the permian units 1 of long term mean annual rainfall the magnitude of the uncertainty is often close to the magnitude of the median recharge estimate the method developed here for upscaling the point estimates of recharge using the chloride mass balance provides robust estimates of recharge and its associated uncertainty the method is applicable to any regional study with variable density input data keywords sydney basin gunnedah basin gloucester basin spatial analysis upscaling 1 introduction groundwater recharge is very difficult to estimate as it cannot be directly measured bakker et al 2013 while there are numerous techniques to estimate recharge see scanlon et al 2002 and healy 2010 and the references therein the chloride mass balance method is the most widely used approach globally scanlon et al 2006 and in australia crosbie et al 2010 it is popular because it is robust over many climate zones and is cost effective requiring only analyses of chloride in groundwater and rainfall here we develop an improved approach for estimating regional i e 10 000km2 groundwater recharge by combining chloride analysis with an uncertainty assessment in a geostatistical framework that accounts for varying input data density the first uses of the chloride mass balance were at a point scale and the assumption was that the point estimates represented the area under investigation anderson 1945 hdwb 1957 subsequent work bresciani et al 2014 eriksson and khunakasem 1969 harrington et al 2002 showed that recharge estimates are not necessarily a point estimate but are an integration of an area upgradient of the sample location the exact upgradient area being determined by aquifer geometry depth of screens and distance to boundaries amongst other things thus truly representative recharge estimates require some form of upscaling this could be as simple as a straight average of point estimates of recharge over the entire region of interest ordens et al 2012 or dividing the area of interest into zones eriksson and khunakasem 1969 naranjo et al 2015 where there is sufficient spatial density of input data a spatially consistent upscaling of recharge estimates to a regular grid becomes possible this requires that the observations of chloride deposition in rainfall and groundwater chloride concentrations are characteristic of the spatial variability ait el mekki et al 2015 alcalá and custodio 2015 davies and crosbie 2018 hornero et al 2016 scanlon et al 2012 where there is insufficient density of input data to support a regular grid upscaling covariate regression analyses provides an alternative to overcome the data sparse shortfall crosbie et al 2015 although it is often noted that there is great uncertainty in recharge estimates the uncertainty is rarely quantified but there are several examples quantifying the uncertainty in recharge estimates from chloride mass balances in the literature the simplest method evaluated the range of the recharge rate from a high and low chloride deposition rate and presented the uncertainty as high and low recharge estimates ordens et al 2012 more formal approaches included a linear error propagation of the standard deviations of each of the input variables interpolated to the output recharge estimate grid which assumes normally distributed errors alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 monto carlo sampling of a pearson type iii distribution with a log normal distribution of chloride concentration allowed to relax the normality assumption and was more representative of the data distribution but it required extensive computing resources davies and crosbie 2018 an additional improvement to incorporate data sparse basins included the use of a regression equation to upscale recharge estimates and account for uncertainty stochastically at a point scale this included a probability distribution for the chloride deposition and a boot strapping of the recharge samples in the regression crosbie et al 2015 in this study we improve these approaches for groundwater recharge estimates by combining regression analysis with the spatial interpolation this is known from other disciplines as regression kriging hengl et al 2004 kriging with external drift wackernagel 2013 or partial thin plate splines mcvicar et al 2010 in this approach the mean of the interpolation becomes an externally defined often linear function of a spatially continuous covariate or covariates the spatial structure of the residuals of this regression represents the deviation from the externally defined grid at every interpolation location bayesian data fusion further generalises and improves this approach with relaxing distribution assumptions and improving precision estimates bogaert and fasbender 2007 peeters et al 2010 one of the challenges in spatial interpolation is the quantification of interpolation uncertainty especially if common assumptions on normality of data are not justified schelin and sjöstedt de luna 2010 bootstrapping while being more computationally expensive provides a much more robust estimation of the interpolation confidence bands than interpolation errors would den hertog et al 2006 in this study we apply these improvements to the estimation of regional groundwater recharge this paper aims to i use the chloride mass balance method for estimating recharge regionally with variable density input data and ii estimate the uncertainty in those recharge estimates spatially the variable density of data means that in some places there is sufficient data to reliably interpolate the recharge estimates directly to a regular grid in other places recharge estimates are too far apart to allow reliable interpolation in these data sparse areas recharge estimation relies on the relationships with covariates regression kriging overcomes the problem of variable data density as it relies on global regression relationships where there is low data density and then conforms to local estimates of recharge through interpolation in areas with high data density for assessing the uncertainty in the chloride mass balance recharge estimates this study applies the monte carlo sampling of the input variables and boot strapping of the point data to include the uncertainty in the regression relationships 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study is conducted in the coal bearing basins of eastern new south wales australia comprised of the permian gloucester sydney and gunnedah basins and part of the jurassic surat basin that overlies the gunnedah and sydney basins fig 1 in the past there has been little groundwater extraction from these basins for irrigation or urban use as the overlying alluvial systems generally have better quality water and higher yielding aquifers pena arancibia et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 however due to increasing coal resource development in these basins hodgkinson et al 2015 hodgkinson et al 2014 northey et al 2014 enhanced understanding of the water balance and hence estimates of groundwater recharge is needed the gloucester basin contains up to 2500m of faulted deformed and eroded permian sedimentary and volcanic rocks and covers 350km2 there are no productive aquifers within the gloucester basin mcvicar et al 2014 the sydney basin is part of the permian triassic sydney gunnedah bowen basin the sydney basin covers 64 000km2 of which 36 000km2 is onshore and contains up to 6000m of sediment coal measure sedimentation began in the early permian and continued to the late permian there was no coal deposited in the triassic but this period saw the deposition of the hawkesbury sandstone which is a regionally important aquifer herron et al 2016 mcvicar et al 2015 the gunnedah basin neighbours the sydney basin and covers 32 000km2 the gunnedah basin consists of up to 2000m of sediments and contains coal deposits from the early and late permian there are no regionally important productive aquifers as part of the gunnedah basin welsh et al 2014 the surat basin overlies the western part of the gunnedah basin and part of the northern sydney basin and is part of the great artesian basin which covers nearly one quarter of australia the great artesian basin contains nationally important regional aquifers and within the study area the most productive is the jurassic pilliga sandstone smerdon and ransley 2012 the surat basin contains 2500m of jurassic to middle cretaceous sediments parts of these basins are overlain by cenozoic volcanics which can locally form productive aquifers welsh et al 2014 the most productive aquifers within the study region are the alluvium associated with the major rivers e g namoi gwydir and hunter rivers to estimate groundwater recharge the surface geology has been generalised into 11 groups that are primarily based on depositional age fig 2 these groups are consistent with the groundwater management units used in allocating groundwater to users in the study region and are also used in the discretisation of the layers of numerical groundwater models these surface geology groups along with the 1930 2010 annual average rainfall jones et al 2009 are the covariates in the upscaling of the recharge estimates the study area has a variable rainfall from below 500mm yr in the west to above 2000mm yr in the highlands closer to the coast fig 4 land use is varied with extensive areas cleared of native vegetation for agriculture as well as the large urban areas of sydney newcastle and wollongong fig 1 there are also extensive areas of native vegetation covering the surface water catchments supplying the bulk of the drinking water to these major urban areas herron et al 2016 mcvicar et al 2015 the reporting of the results of this study uses previously defined regions primarily based on the surface water catchments including the sydney syd hunter hun gloucester glo gwydir gwy namoi nam and central west cnw regions fig 1 2 2 methods overview the method developed for this study includes three steps fig 3 estimate recharge using the chloride mass balance method at a point scale section 2 3 this includes estimating the chloride in rainfall section 2 3 1 runoff section 2 3 2 and groundwater section 2 3 3 regression kriging of the point estimates of recharge section 2 4 this encompasses upscaling recharge using regression equations section 2 4 1 kriging the residuals of the point scale recharge section 2 4 2 and aggregating the regression rasters and residual rasters to form the regression kriging upscaled recharge rasters section 2 4 3 evaluate the uncertainty in the spatial recharge estimates using 1000 replicates of the two processes above these three steps are described in detail in the following sub sections 2 3 point scale chloride mass balance the chloride mass balance is possible because chloride is excluded from evapotranspired water during evaporation and transpiration and so concentrates in the root zone this higher concentrated water then leaches downwards to the water table to become recharge at its simplest recharge is then calculated as 1 r p cl p cl gw where r is average annual recharge mm yr p is the average annual rainfall mm yr clp is the average chloride concentration of rainfall mg l and clgw is the chloride concentration of the groundwater mg l eq 1 assumes there is no lateral flow of chloride and if needed these additional fluxes of water and chloride can be incorporated as 2 r p cl p q on cl on q off cl off cl gw where qon is average annual runon mm yr clon is the average chloride concentration of runon mg l qoff is average annual runoff mm yr and cloff is the average chloride concentration of runoff mg l wood 1999 listed the important assumptions behind estimating recharge using the chloride mass balance method as i chloride in groundwater originates from rainfall on the aquifer and not from flow from underlying or overlying aquifers ii chloride is conservative in the system iii steady state conditions are assumed in that the fluxes of chloride and water have not changed over time and iv there is no recycling of chloride within the aquifer for the majority of the study area the chloride in groundwater is due to rainfall as there are no significant anthropogenic sources of chloride panno et al 2006 peeters et al 2007 the conceptual model of groundwater flow in these basins suggests that groundwater flows from the deeper sedimentary layers into the alluvium before being discharged into the rivers dawes et al 2017a dawes et al 2017b herr et al 2017 this means that any alluvial aquifers will violate the first assumption and so the chloride mass balance is not valid for these areas as such the analysis did not include any chloride in groundwater measurements from the alluvium in confined systems there is the possibility of groundwater flow from above or below so chloride in groundwater measurements were only included from outcrop areas chloride is conservative in the system if there are no sources or sinks within the aquifer it has long been hypothesised that the salts present in the sydney basin are of connate origin old 1942 however this has not been proven other basins in eastern australia deposited in marine environments were also thought to have salt as a remnant of formation water before detailed studies showed the salt was of meteoric origin and the high salinities observed were due to evapoconcentration herczeg et al 2001 hofmann and cartwright 2013 in this study we apply mcnally 2004 s reasoning that if the salt in the sydney basin was connate in origin it would be been flushed from the system long ago and therefore the source of salt is meteoric in areas where the recharge estimated by the chloride mass balance is representative of the previous native vegetation rather than the present land use the steady state assumption does not hold cartwright et al 2007 land clearing in the study area began over 200years ago giving a reasonable travel time of the groundwater since a land use change to prevent a bias of the chloride mass balance towards old water we only used bores located in outcrop areas that were less than 100m deep this minimised the possibility of sampling groundwater recharged under previous land use recycling of chloride occurs when groundwater is evaporated or transpired and then returned to the groundwater system recycling can occur in groundwater discharge areas bazuhair and wood 1996 flow through lakes howcroft et al 2017 and through irrigation with groundwater wood and sanford 1995 bores subject to the recycling of chloride have been avoided in this study by excluding any bores from irrigation areas generally alluvium and discharge areas 2 3 1 chloride in rainfall the chloride deposition rate is mass flux of chloride on a unit area d kg ha yr and is calculated as the product of p and clp and a unit conversion factor 3 d p cl p 100 the chloride deposition rate originated from a national dataset davies and crosbie 2014 davies and crosbie 2018 which mapped the chloride deposition both wet and dry from 300 points by fitting to a model relating the chloride deposition to the distance from the coast keywood et al 1997 the mean μ standard deviation σ and skewness g from 1000 replicate models are used to provide a pearson type iii distribution of chloride deposition at each point location in the study area fig 4 the deposition according to the pearson type iii distribution is given as pilgrim 1987 4 d μ k y σ where ky is a frequency factor calculated from g and a standard normal deviate z 5 k y 2 g z g 6 g 6 1 3 1 the standard normal deviate is generated stochastically to generate the distribution of chloride deposition rate for input into the recharge estimation at each point location 2 3 2 chloride in runoff the chloride in surface runoff can be measured at gauge locations in ephemeral rivers where there is no baseflow component manna et al 2016 many of the rivers in the study region flow year round and have substantial surface water groundwater interactions andersen and acworth 2009 ivkovic 2009 kellett et al 1989 which means the gauged runoff and chloride concentration will contain groundwater and will not be suitable for use in the chloride mass balance as an alternative modelling enables the estimation of chloride exported through surface runoff surface runoff as distinct from baseflow is generated from large rainfall events which generally have a lower chloride concentration than the smaller rainfall events that do not generate runoff fig s1 for rainfall analysed from sydney crosbie et al 2012 when rainfall exceeds 100mm month a weighted average chloride concentration of 11mg l is observed where when rainfall is below 100mm month the weighted average chloride concentration of 23mg l is measured this suggests that the proportion of rainfall exported from the area as surface runoff would carry comparatively less chloride than the equivalent proportion of chloride deposition flux modelling using awra vaze et al 2013 can estimate the runoff on a gridded surface and is not aggregated to the catchment scale as stream gauges are this can then be used to estimate the proportion of rainfall that becomes stream flow the runoff coefficient rc at each point within the study area fig 4 the baseflow component of stream flow in the study area is in the range of 20 50 of total streamflow mcvicar et al 2014 mcvicar et al 2015 welsh et al 2014 meaning that the surface runoff component ranges from 50 to 80 of streamflow as the surface runoff is generated from rainfall events with below average chloride concentration this study assumes that the chloride exported is in the range 33 66 of the proportion of rainfall that becomes streamflow this then gives the chloride exported e through runoff as 6 e 100 d α rc where α is a scaler with a value between 0 33 and 0 66 and the value of 100 is a unit conversion scaler as e is equivalent to qoff cloff and qon is assumed to be negligible the chloride mass balance equation for estimating recharge then becomes 7 r 100 d 1 α rc cl gw for this study α is sampled stochastically from a uniform distribution to provide the distribution for uncertainty estimation 2 3 3 chloride in groundwater information on groundwater in the study area is collected by the new south wales department of primary industries office of water they hold a database of bore construction details and analyses of water quality amongst other things now 2014 of the 33 892 bores in the database in the study area there are 3688 that have been analysed for the chloride concentration of groundwater at least once and of these 1279 were used in the present study bores located in the alluvium and groundwater discharge areas and those deeper than 100m were all excluded the spatial distribution of the selected bores is shown in fig 4 and the depth of these bores is shown in fig s2 the chloride in groundwater was extracted from the nsw office of water database for each location in the majority of locations 74 of 1279 bores there was only a single analysis of chloride concentration that precludes calculating the uncertainty there are 15 bores that had more than 10 analyses these had an average coefficient of variation of 0 21 this will be used for all bores as the basis for estimating the standard deviation as there is insufficient information to create a probability distribution for each individual bore although the variability in 15 bores is not a very strong statistical basis to estimate probability distributions for each bore the coefficient of variation of 0 21 is a robust measure as the coefficient of variation in the 158 bores with more than 3 samples also happens to be 0 21 the chloride concentration of groundwater is sampled from an assumed normal probability distribution for each replicate of the model 8 cl gw μ z σ where μ is the mean of all chloride in groundwater analyses at a bore mg l and σ is the standard deviation mg l 2 4 upscaling point estimates of recharge the upscaling of the point estimates of recharge using regression kriging hengl et al 2004 includes three steps i developing a relationship between rainfall and recharge for each surface geology group to predict recharge across the study area on a regular grid ii kriging the residuals between the point estimates of recharge and the regression equation estimates of recharge to provide a surface of residuals and iii adding the residual surface to the regression surface which provides a spatial estimate of recharge that is informed locally by point data and away from point data is dependent upon a global relationship between rainfall and recharge this process is repeated for 1000 stochastically generated replicates to quantify the uncertainty in the recharge estimates 2 4 1 regression equations previous studies have shown that recharge is better approximated by a log normal distribution rather than a normal distribution cook et al 1989 eriksson 1985 and this extends to its relationship with rainfall petheram et al 2002 recharge estimates are dependent upon rainfall soil type and vegetation crosbie et al 2010 kim and jackson 2012 scanlon et al 2006 and these have been used successfully used as variables to upscale modelled point estimates of recharge crosbie et al 2013 in other parts of the world potential evapotranspiration may be another useful predictor of recharge but that is not the case for the study area see fig s3 however as this study has subsetted the data by surface geology there are insufficient data to reliably differentiate recharge under different soil types and vegetation types within a surface geology group this leaves rainfall as the only covariate used to estimate recharge within a surface geology group 9 log r β 0 β 1 p where β 0 and β 1 are fitted through least squares regression we used bootstrapping to estimate uncertainty in the regression equations efron and tibshirani 1994 for each replicate 10 of the data used to fit each regression equation was randomly removed this will minimise the bias in the regression equation that can occur due to outliers in the dataset as these regression equations are used to extrapolate recharge beyond the observed range of long term 1930 2010 annual average rainfall experienced at the input bore network they can predict recharge that is infeasible i e greater than long term 1930 2010 annual average rainfall to prevent this in the upscaling we limited recharge to being less than half the long term 1930 2010 annual average rainfall the limit of half the rainfall was chosen as it is greater than the highest deterministic point estimate of recharge used in the upscaling 38 which leaves an allowance for the uncertainty in the deterministic estimate without extending into the infeasible range using the regression equation within each surface geology group we created a recharge surface on a 500m grid across the study area each replicate had the upscaled recharge rasters for each surface geology group combined into a single raster for storage in a raster stack 2 4 2 kriging residuals the difference in the recharge estimated through the regression equations and through the point scale chloride mass balance were calculated for each replicate these residuals were fitted to a spherical semi variogram using gstat pebesma 2004 in r r core team 2016 for each surface geology group and then kriged to a 500m grid for each replicate the different surface geology groups residual rasters were aggregated to a single residual raster respecting the surface geology and then stored in a raster stack 2 4 3 aggregating recharge rasters for each replicate the residual raster was added to the recharge raster upscaled using the regression equations to create a regression kriging recharge raster summary statistics were calculated from the 1000 replicates at the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles with the 50th percentile being assumed to be the most likely estimate of recharge and the difference between the 5th and 95th percentiles a measure of the uncertainty 2 5 alluvium as the alluvium has been excluded from the estimation of recharge using the chloride mass balance for this study an alternative method has been used for completeness in the maps the relationships developed by wohling et al 2012 based on field estimates of recharge from around australia use annual average rainfall clay content of the top 2m of soil and land use to predict annual average recharge here we use continental scale mapped clay content grundy et al 2015 and land use abares 2016 the uncertainty of recharge estimates to the alluvium have not been assessed the recharge to the alluvium is not the focus of this paper and isn t discussed further 2 6 assessment of the method to assess the performance of the regression kriging method the results were compared to more conventional upscaling of regression and kriging individually also compared is regression kriging without the differentiation in the regression equation based on the geology groups a deterministic upscaling was performed using 90 of the point recharge data with the remaining 10 used as a cross validation data set 3 results 3 1 point scale estimates of recharge as the study location encompasses the coastal zone to several hundred kilometres inland there is a large range in the mean chloride deposition rate across the 1279 input bores from 96kg ha yr to 4kg ha yr fig 4 at the location of these bores the long term 1930 2010 annual average rainfall varies greatly with a minimum of 528mm yr and a maximum of 2122mm yr consequently there is a wide variation in the runoff coefficient fig 4 in high rainfall areas the total runoff can be up to 50 of the rainfall whereas in the low rainfall areas it is practically zero as the surface runoff component has been assumed to export chloride at between 1 3 and 2 3 of the proportion of the total runoff exported the chloride exported can be between 0 and 33 of the chloride deposition a point scale example of the stochastic estimation of recharge using the chloride mass balance is demonstrated for bore gw029143 which is located in the sydney region latitude 34 22 s longitude 150 56 e in the middle triassic aquifers surface geology group the chloride deposition has a mean of 21kg ha yr a standard deviation of 2 5kg ha yr and a skewness of 0 27kg ha yr the runoff coefficient is 0 19 and it has a chloride in groundwater concentration of 40 8mg l a standard deterministic estimation of recharge would result in an estimate of 46 5mm yr if recharge is estimated stochastically with 10 000 random samples from the assumed distributions of chloride deposition chloride export in runoff and chloride concentration of groundwater the calculated recharge then becomes a probability distribution fig 5 the chloride deposition distribution is skewed to the left g 0 27 the chloride in groundwater distribution is assumed to be normally distributed and the resulting recharge distribution is heavily positively skewed approximating a log normal distribution fig 5 for this example the median recharge is slightly higher than the deterministic estimate at 46 7mm yr with the 5th and 95th percentiles being 31 7 and 73 5mm yr respectively the minimum and maximum of the 10 000 samples have a considerably greater range of 18 6 and 196mm yr 3 2 developing regression equations for each surface geology group the bores selected are used to develop a deterministic recharge estimate to show that the different stratigraphic units within a surface geology group form a consistent relationship fig 6 at the point scale there is scatter in these relationships yet our objective is to estimate a representative recharge rate regionally rather than at the point scale therefore it is the line of best fit that we are interested in from these relationships this regression line is statistically significant p 0 05 for all surface geology groups using an f test these relationships support the existing hydrogeological conceptual model of the study area the sand jurassic aquifers and middle triassic aquifers surface geology groups have the greatest recharge for a given annual average rainfall these three groups form important aquifers of good quality water that provide reasonable bore yields the other surface geology groups have lower recharge that is more representative of aquitards and do not contribute much recharge regionally although there are some locally important aquifers within these groups dawes et al 2017a b herr et al 2017 the boot strapping procedure accounts for the uncertainty in the point scale recharge estimates from the chloride deposition chloride exported in runoff and chloride concentration of groundwater in the regression equations a selection of these stochastically generated regression lines is shown in fig 7 similar to the point data the sand jurassic and middle triassic aquifers generally have the highest recharge for a given annual average rainfall the replicate regression lines are grouped tightly for the surface geology groups with bores spread over the greatest rainfall range the basement has the greatest spread in the regression lines particularly at high rainfall as this group had the least input bore data these stochastically generated regression equations are then used to upscale recharge to the entire study area on a regular 500m grid for each of the 1000 replicates 3 3 kriging regression residuals semivariograms are fitted to the residuals of each replicate of the recharge estimates to enable the residuals to be spatially interpolated through kriging example semivariograms for each surface geology group are shown in fig 8 from the deterministic recharge estimates shown in fig 6 the semivariograms are fitted to the recharge residuals from each surface geology group and the kriging is performed over the same surface geology groups to ensure that results are not interpolated over geological boundaries where there should not be any spatial correlation of the recharge residuals the sampling of the input chloride deposition distribution does incorporate spatial correlation across surface geology groups these semivariograms show that in each group there is a high nugget and a range that extends between 30 and 80km the high nugget indicates there is little spatial correlation in the residuals and has the effect that the interpolation is not trying to exactly match each point value of the recharge residuals but will only intervene when there is a local bias in the residuals the range of between 30 and 80km shows that the extent of the spatial correlation of recharge residuals and ensures that the residuals spatial surface is only using information that is local the example semivariograms shown for some of the geology groups show a poor fit e g volcanics and middle triassic aquifers in these cases there is a high nugget and a low sill the mean recharge residual surface of the 1000 replicates fig 9 shows that there are very few areas that have a recharge residual of more than half an order of magnitude positive or negative and that most of the area has a residual close to 0 in areas where there is no input bore data fig 4 the recharge residual is close to zero as the range in the variograms only extends to a maximum of 80km for surface geology groups that have a poor fit to the semivariograms there is little spatial correlation and therefore a mean residual that is also close to zero 3 4 aggregation of recharge surfaces regression kriging combines the upscaled recharge surface from the regression equations and the recharge residual surface from kriging the residuals fig 9 shows the mean of the 1000 replicates of the regression recharge the recharge residual and the mean of the final regression kriging recharge surface this shows that the mean of the regression recharge and the recharge from regression kriging is equal at the scale of the study area but is different locally the 1000 replicates of the upscaled recharge estimates from regression kriging are used to estimate the uncertainty in the recharge estimates across the study area this uncertainty is expressed as the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of recharge fig 10 the relative uncertainty in the recharge estimates shows that the areas without many data points particularly the highlands have the most uncertain estimates of recharge fig s4 as the extreme tails of the recharge distribution are not a priority the recharge statistics represented by the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles converge to a stable value quickly demonstrating that the 1000 replicates used here are sufficient fig s5 the estimated recharge for each surface geology group in each reporting region has been listed in table 1 and asa percentage of rainfall in table 2 this shows that the surface geology groups with the highest recharge are the sand volcanic jurassic aquifers and middle triassic aquifers 3 5 assessment of the method a comparison of the alternative upscaling methods shows that the spatial pattern of the kriging upscaling is less detailed than the regression or regression kriging because it does not have access to the surface geology or rainfall as co variates fig 11 the biggest difference in the regression kriging with and without the surface geology groups can be seen around the jurassic aquifers see fig 2 for location which corresponds to the intake beds for the great artesian basin when surface geology is not accounted for the regression kriging underestimates the recharge by almost an order of magnitude the 10 of point recharge estimates retained as validation show that the regression upscaling overestimates the low recharge estimates while the kriging and regression kriging are able to better match the data fig 12 the root mean squared rms error of the log transformed data for each method is approximately half an order of magnitude regression 0 52 kriging 0 46 regression kriging with geology 0 47 regression kriging without geology 0 46 and with the normalised percent error there is still little to separate the methods regression 17 kriging 21 regression kriging with geology 16 regression kriging without geology 21 in a purely statistical sense the regression kriging method is not a great leap forward over the conventional kriging method for the estimation of recharge spatially in this study but it does come with the substantial advantage of utilizing covariates for regional recharge estimation and thus responds to data beyond the spatially isolated bore recharge data set the best example arises from the underestimation of the point recharge dataset in high rainfall regions fig 4 the kriging upscaling had a maximum recharge of just over 100mm yr whereas the regression kriging has a maximum recharge closer to 1000mm yr the point recharge estimates are under represented in the high rainfall regions as bores are not needed for a water supply and so ordinary kriging would interpolate based on the point data from lower rainfall point estimates and under estimate the recharge in these high rainfall regions a comparison of the residual surfaces fitted for the regressions with and without the surface geology groups demonstrates the robustness of the method without the surface geology groups there is a greater residual from the input data fig s6b the regression kriging method can overcome this by making a greater intervention via the residual surface to create a similar recharge surface fig 11 both of the residual surfaces in fig s6 have a mean close to 0 but the surface without the geology has a standard deviation almost double that of the surface with surface geology 4 discussion 4 1 comparison to other recharge estimates in the region in the eastern nsw coal bearing geological basins detailed recharge studies have only been performed in small areas of the productive aquifers fig s7 these include the pilliga sandstone ransley and smerdon 2012 the hawkesbury sandstone cendón et al 2014 and the tomago sandbeds crosbie 2003 crosbie et al 2005 to date the permian units have not been considered asa water resource and have not had detailed investigations the recharge estimated in the current study compares well with the previous more detailed site specific studies table s2 the great artesian basin intake beds had the same average recharge estimated 1 1 of rainfall and the previous estimate in the hawkesbury sandstone of 9 cendón et al 2014 is close to that estimated here of 11 with a range of 8 14 between the 5th and 95th percentiles the chloride mass balance estimates of recharge at tomago of crosbie 2003 at the western end are comparable to those estimated here with 17 of rainfall compared to 14 9 20 the estimate of gross recharge at tomago of close to 50 of rainfall crosbie et al 2005 is not directly comparable to the net recharge estimates here see doble and crosbie 2017 for a discussion of gross versus net recharge there have been many numerical groundwater models developed for assessing coal resource developments in the permian units within the study region the recharge assumed for these models in the coastal catchments was reviewed by emm 2015 who summarised them asa percentage of rainfall for the permian sediments of the sydney and gloucester basin 1 of rainfall was found to be representative emm 2015 and for the triassic sediments of the sydney basin 6 of rainfall was found to be representative emm 2015 the permian recharge asa percentage of rainfall compares well to the recharge estimated here table 2 but the triassic recharge is quite different when aggregated the average recharge across all the triassic zones is 3 7 with a range between the 5th and 95th percentile of 2 9 4 7 but the present study has split the triassic into three groups this study found higher recharge for the middle triassic aquifers at 8 and lower recharge for the rest of the triassic units 2 4 2 qualitative uncertainty this section critically assesses the key assumptions of this study that could not be implemented in the quantitative uncertainty analysis yet have the potential to affect the predicted recharge here we use a qualitative uncertainty analysis to build confidence in the model predictions kloprogge et al 2011 peeters 2017 the key assumptions that could affect the estimated recharge are i that the source of chloride in the groundwater is from rainfall ii that the system is in steady state iii that the relationship between rainfall and log transformed recharge is linear and iv that kriging is an appropriate interpolator these are discussed in turn below 4 2 1 source of chloride in groundwater old 1942 hypothesised that the salts present in the sydney basin are of connate origin which if correct would render the chloride mass balance method invalid in other basins in eastern australia with sediment deposits of marine origins the groundwater composition may look like seawater but actually evolved from the evapoconcentration of rainwater this was shown through the chloride bromide ratios cl br and the stable isotopes of water herczeg et al 2001 hofmann and cartwright 2013 taylor 2016 showed that salt in the wianamatta group sediments in the sydney basin originated from the evapoconcentration of rainfall and was not connate in origin that study used the stable isotopes of both hydrogen and oxygen to show that the water evaporated which gave the groundwater a seawater like chemical composition rainwater near the coast has a chemical composition resembling diluted seawater jasonsmith et al 2011 showed in their study that upward flow of groundwater from the wittingham coal measures in the sydney basin into the alluvium was the source of saline discharge to a small catchment in the upper hunter river they based this on the cl br ratios however this was an order of magnitude less than would be expected of brines from the dissolution of halite cartwright et al 2004 however given that their groundwater sample labelled as indicative of halite dissolution is quite fresh tds 224mg l and the bromide concentration is listed as 0 0mg l the analytical precision of the cl br ratio is questionable it has been shown by other researchers that the chloride inputs can be corrected for estimating recharge on the basis of the cl br ratio alcalá and custodio 2008 horner et al 2017 if the primary source of chloride in the groundwater is either due to connate water or halite dissolution then the relationships between rainfall and recharge in fig 6 would be random scatter for each surface geology group the relationship is statistically significant p 0 05 the permian coal surface geology group which contains the wittingham coal measures has the weakest relationship between rainfall and recharge p 0 024 which could be an indicator that the source of chloride in this group is not entirely meteoric if the source of chloride is not entirely meteoric then recharge will be underestimated agricultural practice especially application of fertilizer is another potential source of chloride allison and hughes 1978 for instance correct the chloride input due to potassium chloride fertiliser at two of the sixteen study sites in the vicinity of mt gambier in australia the land use map of australia department of agriculture and water resources 2016 shows that the majority of land outside the alluvial systems in the study area is used for dryland cropping or grazing modified pastures the compilation of gross margin handbooks describing typical farming practice presented in navarro et al 2016 indicates that fertilisers with a high chloride concentration such as potassium chloride are not recommended or necessary for these kinds of farming at the regional scale of this study agricultural sources of chloride are therefore considered very small this can however mean that locally recharge rates are underestimated if chloride rich fertilisers are applied other anthropogenic sources of chloride such as road de icing or leaking sewer systems are not relevant in this part of australia 4 2 2 steady state conditions the fourth assumption listed in section 2 2 that the water and chloride fluxes are in steady state is very difficult to meet in an area that has undergone recent i e decades to centuries for semi arid areas less for temperate areas land use change much research has been performed assessing the impacts of land use change on recharge but this has usually been in areas with long term annual average rainfall below 700mm yr kennett smith et al 1994 petheram et al 2002 scanlon et al 2005 the most extreme examples are from the semi arid mallee area where it is common for recharge to increase by two orders of magnitude following native vegetation clearing for agriculture allison et al 1985 kennett smith et al 1994 but this is starting from recharge as low as 0 1mm yr the other extreme has been observed at tomago eastern most point of the study area on the coast where crosbie et al 2005 found that recharge was not significantly different under three vegetation types forest heath and grass with the recharge estimated to be 47 of the rainfall independent of the vegetation type the study area will likely fall between these two extremes ideally future work could use age based tracers to determine the age of the water at the time of chloride analysis the age of the water increases with depth in a water column as the water at the water table was recharged recently and the water at the bottom of the column recharged a long time ago böhlke 2002 solomon et al 1993 modern water 50years has been found at depths greater than 100m within the study area albeit in a high rainfall area 1200mm yr cendón et al 2014 this study has used relatively shallow bores median is 34m drilled depth see fig s2 in outcrop areas in an attempt at sampling water that has been recharged since clearing of the native vegetation over the past 200years as a very simple proxy for age the drilled depth of the bore has been used to look for a relationship with the recharge estimates there is no relationship between the depth of the bore and the recharge that can be seen fig s8 this is an indication that it is not possible from this dataset to identify the transient effects of landuse change on recharge the point recharge estimates corresponding to pre clearing conditions will bias the results towards low recharge estimates however at this stage it is not possible to quantify the magnitude of this bias this bias in the recharge estimates is however most likely to occur in low recharge areas where recharge is less than 1mm yr it will take a long time to displace the water that was recharged under native vegetation i e centuries whereas areas with recharge greater than 10mm yr will come to equilibrium comparatively quicker i e decades not having the system in steady state following land clearing can only result in an underestimate of the recharge 4 2 3 linearity of regression equations fig 6 shows considerable scatter in the relationship between rainfall and chloride mass balance estimated recharge they do however systematically show lower recharge associated with low rainfall and vice versa the linear regression between rainfall and recharge aims to capture the general trend of this relationship where local deviations are accounted for through the kriging of the residuals some alternatives to the linear regression that can be considered are i using the mean of the dataset if there is limited explanation of the regression variance ii local means if subgroups are present or iii a more complex functional form e g a quadratic or higher order polynomial regression that more closely captures the variation in the data when applying the first option i e i above the method reverts to simple kriging and the rainfall covariate is ignored a simple kriging approach is able to reproduce point estimates with an accuracy comparable to the regression kriging but it lacks agreement with the conceptual understanding of recharge processes the latter can lead to unrealistic values in data poor areas the second option i e ii above using local means for instance one for low rainfall and one for high rainfall would alleviate that issue this however introduces a non linearity in the interpolation that can result in boundary effects and more importantly necessitates the arbitrary distinction between high and low rainfall the third option i e iii above a more complex fitting equation or in extremis a spline fitting algorithm can help in avoiding the arbitrary choices more complex functions however are much more prone to overfitting and instability away from the controlling observations this has two consequences a it will be more difficult to establish a stationary spatial relationship between residuals for the kriging algorithm and b the algorithm is more likely to produce extrapolation artefacts the linear regression equations in combination with the bootstrapping procedure provide a trade off between introducing an objective repeatable functional relationship between recharge and rainfall in the interpolation and minimising the propensity of interpolation artefacts in data poor areas 4 2 4 regression kriging with bootstrapping one of the main assumptions in ordinary kriging is that the random spatial process that is simulated is stationary and can be captured with a single covariance function regression kriging relaxes that first assumption as it allows the mean of interpolation to vary locally asa function of an external covariate removing the externally defined trend from the data increases the probability that the residuals are homoscedastic i e that their variance is constant and independent of scale or location the uncertainty of the interpolated surfaces however still relies on propagation of normally distributed errors through the kriging equation which results in a mean and standard deviation for each grid cell the use of a bootstrapping procedure in our study on the other hand avoids this normality assumption and results in a more robust estimation of the interpolated recharge 5 conclusion this study aimed to regionally estimate groundwater recharge across the 146 000km2 of eastern new south wales coal bearing basins that are facing increased development pressures the variable spatial density of input groundwater bores for estimating recharge using the chloride mass balance method provided challenges in the upscaling of the point estimates of recharge to regional estimates that are necessary for regional water resource management the upscaling was completed using regression kriging which combined the best aspects of the global upscaling of regression and the local methods of interpolation via kriging this study found that recharge is highest in the productive aquifers such as the coastal dunes over 100mm yr hawkesbury sandstone up to 100mm yr and the pilliga sandstone up to 10mm yr and lowest in the permian units 1 of rainfall the regional recharge estimated here is consistent with small scale studies in the productive aquifers and is the first detailed recharge study in the permian units the recharge estimation incorporated the uncertainty in the chloride deposition of rainfall the chloride exported in runoff the chloride concentration of the groundwater and the regression equations used in upscaling the uncertainty in the recharge estimates was quantified using stochastic inputs and 1000 replicates the magnitude of the uncertainty when expressed as the difference between the 5th and 95th percentiles of the recharge estimates is often close to the magnitude of the median recharge estimate a qualitative analysis of the unquantified uncertainty in the recharge estimates suggests that a low bias is more likely than a high bias in recharge estimates presented here this is particularly the case for the areas with the lowest recharge the method developed here for upscaling the point estimates of recharge using the chloride mass balance provides robust estimates of recharge and its associated uncertainty provided that the assumptions underlying the chloride mass balance method can be met the method is applicable to any region i e 10 000km2 with a variable density of input data as long as surface geology and rainfall grids are spatially continuously available for the region acknowledgements this research is part of the bioregional

7322,the chloride mass balance method of estimating groundwater recharge is generally applied at a point scale but water resources management generally requires information at a regional scale to estimate groundwater recharge regionally previously used upscaling methods have ranged from simple averaging to empirical relationships and geostatistical interpolation this study combined the best components of these methods by using regression kriging in data sparse areas the recharge is upscaled using global regression equations with gridded rainfall and surface geology as covariates while in data dense areas the kriging of the regression equation residuals ensures that the upscaled recharge estimates respect the point estimates of recharge the uncertainty in the recharge estimates was quantified using 1000 stochastic replicates of the chloride deposition of rainfall the chloride exported in runoff the chloride concentration of the groundwater and the regression equations used to perform the upscaling this study focused on the coal bearing sydney gunnedah gloucester and surat basins of eastern new south wales australia historically groundwater recharge to the permian units of these basins has received little attention due to their low yields of poor quality water the increased potential extraction of regional groundwater due to coal development has demanded a greater understanding of the water balance we found that recharge is highest in the younger productive aquifers up to 20 of long term mean annual rainfall and lowest in the permian units 1 of long term mean annual rainfall the magnitude of the uncertainty is often close to the magnitude of the median recharge estimate the method developed here for upscaling the point estimates of recharge using the chloride mass balance provides robust estimates of recharge and its associated uncertainty the method is applicable to any regional study with variable density input data keywords sydney basin gunnedah basin gloucester basin spatial analysis upscaling 1 introduction groundwater recharge is very difficult to estimate as it cannot be directly measured bakker et al 2013 while there are numerous techniques to estimate recharge see scanlon et al 2002 and healy 2010 and the references therein the chloride mass balance method is the most widely used approach globally scanlon et al 2006 and in australia crosbie et al 2010 it is popular because it is robust over many climate zones and is cost effective requiring only analyses of chloride in groundwater and rainfall here we develop an improved approach for estimating regional i e 10 000km2 groundwater recharge by combining chloride analysis with an uncertainty assessment in a geostatistical framework that accounts for varying input data density the first uses of the chloride mass balance were at a point scale and the assumption was that the point estimates represented the area under investigation anderson 1945 hdwb 1957 subsequent work bresciani et al 2014 eriksson and khunakasem 1969 harrington et al 2002 showed that recharge estimates are not necessarily a point estimate but are an integration of an area upgradient of the sample location the exact upgradient area being determined by aquifer geometry depth of screens and distance to boundaries amongst other things thus truly representative recharge estimates require some form of upscaling this could be as simple as a straight average of point estimates of recharge over the entire region of interest ordens et al 2012 or dividing the area of interest into zones eriksson and khunakasem 1969 naranjo et al 2015 where there is sufficient spatial density of input data a spatially consistent upscaling of recharge estimates to a regular grid becomes possible this requires that the observations of chloride deposition in rainfall and groundwater chloride concentrations are characteristic of the spatial variability ait el mekki et al 2015 alcalá and custodio 2015 davies and crosbie 2018 hornero et al 2016 scanlon et al 2012 where there is insufficient density of input data to support a regular grid upscaling covariate regression analyses provides an alternative to overcome the data sparse shortfall crosbie et al 2015 although it is often noted that there is great uncertainty in recharge estimates the uncertainty is rarely quantified but there are several examples quantifying the uncertainty in recharge estimates from chloride mass balances in the literature the simplest method evaluated the range of the recharge rate from a high and low chloride deposition rate and presented the uncertainty as high and low recharge estimates ordens et al 2012 more formal approaches included a linear error propagation of the standard deviations of each of the input variables interpolated to the output recharge estimate grid which assumes normally distributed errors alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 monto carlo sampling of a pearson type iii distribution with a log normal distribution of chloride concentration allowed to relax the normality assumption and was more representative of the data distribution but it required extensive computing resources davies and crosbie 2018 an additional improvement to incorporate data sparse basins included the use of a regression equation to upscale recharge estimates and account for uncertainty stochastically at a point scale this included a probability distribution for the chloride deposition and a boot strapping of the recharge samples in the regression crosbie et al 2015 in this study we improve these approaches for groundwater recharge estimates by combining regression analysis with the spatial interpolation this is known from other disciplines as regression kriging hengl et al 2004 kriging with external drift wackernagel 2013 or partial thin plate splines mcvicar et al 2010 in this approach the mean of the interpolation becomes an externally defined often linear function of a spatially continuous covariate or covariates the spatial structure of the residuals of this regression represents the deviation from the externally defined grid at every interpolation location bayesian data fusion further generalises and improves this approach with relaxing distribution assumptions and improving precision estimates bogaert and fasbender 2007 peeters et al 2010 one of the challenges in spatial interpolation is the quantification of interpolation uncertainty especially if common assumptions on normality of data are not justified schelin and sjöstedt de luna 2010 bootstrapping while being more computationally expensive provides a much more robust estimation of the interpolation confidence bands than interpolation errors would den hertog et al 2006 in this study we apply these improvements to the estimation of regional groundwater recharge this paper aims to i use the chloride mass balance method for estimating recharge regionally with variable density input data and ii estimate the uncertainty in those recharge estimates spatially the variable density of data means that in some places there is sufficient data to reliably interpolate the recharge estimates directly to a regular grid in other places recharge estimates are too far apart to allow reliable interpolation in these data sparse areas recharge estimation relies on the relationships with covariates regression kriging overcomes the problem of variable data density as it relies on global regression relationships where there is low data density and then conforms to local estimates of recharge through interpolation in areas with high data density for assessing the uncertainty in the chloride mass balance recharge estimates this study applies the monte carlo sampling of the input variables and boot strapping of the point data to include the uncertainty in the regression relationships 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study is conducted in the coal bearing basins of eastern new south wales australia comprised of the permian gloucester sydney and gunnedah basins and part of the jurassic surat basin that overlies the gunnedah and sydney basins fig 1 in the past there has been little groundwater extraction from these basins for irrigation or urban use as the overlying alluvial systems generally have better quality water and higher yielding aquifers pena arancibia et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 however due to increasing coal resource development in these basins hodgkinson et al 2015 hodgkinson et al 2014 northey et al 2014 enhanced understanding of the water balance and hence estimates of groundwater recharge is needed the gloucester basin contains up to 2500m of faulted deformed and eroded permian sedimentary and volcanic rocks and covers 350km2 there are no productive aquifers within the gloucester basin mcvicar et al 2014 the sydney basin is part of the permian triassic sydney gunnedah bowen basin the sydney basin covers 64 000km2 of which 36 000km2 is onshore and contains up to 6000m of sediment coal measure sedimentation began in the early permian and continued to the late permian there was no coal deposited in the triassic but this period saw the deposition of the hawkesbury sandstone which is a regionally important aquifer herron et al 2016 mcvicar et al 2015 the gunnedah basin neighbours the sydney basin and covers 32 000km2 the gunnedah basin consists of up to 2000m of sediments and contains coal deposits from the early and late permian there are no regionally important productive aquifers as part of the gunnedah basin welsh et al 2014 the surat basin overlies the western part of the gunnedah basin and part of the northern sydney basin and is part of the great artesian basin which covers nearly one quarter of australia the great artesian basin contains nationally important regional aquifers and within the study area the most productive is the jurassic pilliga sandstone smerdon and ransley 2012 the surat basin contains 2500m of jurassic to middle cretaceous sediments parts of these basins are overlain by cenozoic volcanics which can locally form productive aquifers welsh et al 2014 the most productive aquifers within the study region are the alluvium associated with the major rivers e g namoi gwydir and hunter rivers to estimate groundwater recharge the surface geology has been generalised into 11 groups that are primarily based on depositional age fig 2 these groups are consistent with the groundwater management units used in allocating groundwater to users in the study region and are also used in the discretisation of the layers of numerical groundwater models these surface geology groups along with the 1930 2010 annual average rainfall jones et al 2009 are the covariates in the upscaling of the recharge estimates the study area has a variable rainfall from below 500mm yr in the west to above 2000mm yr in the highlands closer to the coast fig 4 land use is varied with extensive areas cleared of native vegetation for agriculture as well as the large urban areas of sydney newcastle and wollongong fig 1 there are also extensive areas of native vegetation covering the surface water catchments supplying the bulk of the drinking water to these major urban areas herron et al 2016 mcvicar et al 2015 the reporting of the results of this study uses previously defined regions primarily based on the surface water catchments including the sydney syd hunter hun gloucester glo gwydir gwy namoi nam and central west cnw regions fig 1 2 2 methods overview the method developed for this study includes three steps fig 3 estimate recharge using the chloride mass balance method at a point scale section 2 3 this includes estimating the chloride in rainfall section 2 3 1 runoff section 2 3 2 and groundwater section 2 3 3 regression kriging of the point estimates of recharge section 2 4 this encompasses upscaling recharge using regression equations section 2 4 1 kriging the residuals of the point scale recharge section 2 4 2 and aggregating the regression rasters and residual rasters to form the regression kriging upscaled recharge rasters section 2 4 3 evaluate the uncertainty in the spatial recharge estimates using 1000 replicates of the two processes above these three steps are described in detail in the following sub sections 2 3 point scale chloride mass balance the chloride mass balance is possible because chloride is excluded from evapotranspired water during evaporation and transpiration and so concentrates in the root zone this higher concentrated water then leaches downwards to the water table to become recharge at its simplest recharge is then calculated as 1 r p cl p cl gw where r is average annual recharge mm yr p is the average annual rainfall mm yr clp is the average chloride concentration of rainfall mg l and clgw is the chloride concentration of the groundwater mg l eq 1 assumes there is no lateral flow of chloride and if needed these additional fluxes of water and chloride can be incorporated as 2 r p cl p q on cl on q off cl off cl gw where qon is average annual runon mm yr clon is the average chloride concentration of runon mg l qoff is average annual runoff mm yr and cloff is the average chloride concentration of runoff mg l wood 1999 listed the important assumptions behind estimating recharge using the chloride mass balance method as i chloride in groundwater originates from rainfall on the aquifer and not from flow from underlying or overlying aquifers ii chloride is conservative in the system iii steady state conditions are assumed in that the fluxes of chloride and water have not changed over time and iv there is no recycling of chloride within the aquifer for the majority of the study area the chloride in groundwater is due to rainfall as there are no significant anthropogenic sources of chloride panno et al 2006 peeters et al 2007 the conceptual model of groundwater flow in these basins suggests that groundwater flows from the deeper sedimentary layers into the alluvium before being discharged into the rivers dawes et al 2017a dawes et al 2017b herr et al 2017 this means that any alluvial aquifers will violate the first assumption and so the chloride mass balance is not valid for these areas as such the analysis did not include any chloride in groundwater measurements from the alluvium in confined systems there is the possibility of groundwater flow from above or below so chloride in groundwater measurements were only included from outcrop areas chloride is conservative in the system if there are no sources or sinks within the aquifer it has long been hypothesised that the salts present in the sydney basin are of connate origin old 1942 however this has not been proven other basins in eastern australia deposited in marine environments were also thought to have salt as a remnant of formation water before detailed studies showed the salt was of meteoric origin and the high salinities observed were due to evapoconcentration herczeg et al 2001 hofmann and cartwright 2013 in this study we apply mcnally 2004 s reasoning that if the salt in the sydney basin was connate in origin it would be been flushed from the system long ago and therefore the source of salt is meteoric in areas where the recharge estimated by the chloride mass balance is representative of the previous native vegetation rather than the present land use the steady state assumption does not hold cartwright et al 2007 land clearing in the study area began over 200years ago giving a reasonable travel time of the groundwater since a land use change to prevent a bias of the chloride mass balance towards old water we only used bores located in outcrop areas that were less than 100m deep this minimised the possibility of sampling groundwater recharged under previous land use recycling of chloride occurs when groundwater is evaporated or transpired and then returned to the groundwater system recycling can occur in groundwater discharge areas bazuhair and wood 1996 flow through lakes howcroft et al 2017 and through irrigation with groundwater wood and sanford 1995 bores subject to the recycling of chloride have been avoided in this study by excluding any bores from irrigation areas generally alluvium and discharge areas 2 3 1 chloride in rainfall the chloride deposition rate is mass flux of chloride on a unit area d kg ha yr and is calculated as the product of p and clp and a unit conversion factor 3 d p cl p 100 the chloride deposition rate originated from a national dataset davies and crosbie 2014 davies and crosbie 2018 which mapped the chloride deposition both wet and dry from 300 points by fitting to a model relating the chloride deposition to the distance from the coast keywood et al 1997 the mean μ standard deviation σ and skewness g from 1000 replicate models are used to provide a pearson type iii distribution of chloride deposition at each point location in the study area fig 4 the deposition according to the pearson type iii distribution is given as pilgrim 1987 4 d μ k y σ where ky is a frequency factor calculated from g and a standard normal deviate z 5 k y 2 g z g 6 g 6 1 3 1 the standard normal deviate is generated stochastically to generate the distribution of chloride deposition rate for input into the recharge estimation at each point location 2 3 2 chloride in runoff the chloride in surface runoff can be measured at gauge locations in ephemeral rivers where there is no baseflow component manna et al 2016 many of the rivers in the study region flow year round and have substantial surface water groundwater interactions andersen and acworth 2009 ivkovic 2009 kellett et al 1989 which means the gauged runoff and chloride concentration will contain groundwater and will not be suitable for use in the chloride mass balance as an alternative modelling enables the estimation of chloride exported through surface runoff surface runoff as distinct from baseflow is generated from large rainfall events which generally have a lower chloride concentration than the smaller rainfall events that do not generate runoff fig s1 for rainfall analysed from sydney crosbie et al 2012 when rainfall exceeds 100mm month a weighted average chloride concentration of 11mg l is observed where when rainfall is below 100mm month the weighted average chloride concentration of 23mg l is measured this suggests that the proportion of rainfall exported from the area as surface runoff would carry comparatively less chloride than the equivalent proportion of chloride deposition flux modelling using awra vaze et al 2013 can estimate the runoff on a gridded surface and is not aggregated to the catchment scale as stream gauges are this can then be used to estimate the proportion of rainfall that becomes stream flow the runoff coefficient rc at each point within the study area fig 4 the baseflow component of stream flow in the study area is in the range of 20 50 of total streamflow mcvicar et al 2014 mcvicar et al 2015 welsh et al 2014 meaning that the surface runoff component ranges from 50 to 80 of streamflow as the surface runoff is generated from rainfall events with below average chloride concentration this study assumes that the chloride exported is in the range 33 66 of the proportion of rainfall that becomes streamflow this then gives the chloride exported e through runoff as 6 e 100 d α rc where α is a scaler with a value between 0 33 and 0 66 and the value of 100 is a unit conversion scaler as e is equivalent to qoff cloff and qon is assumed to be negligible the chloride mass balance equation for estimating recharge then becomes 7 r 100 d 1 α rc cl gw for this study α is sampled stochastically from a uniform distribution to provide the distribution for uncertainty estimation 2 3 3 chloride in groundwater information on groundwater in the study area is collected by the new south wales department of primary industries office of water they hold a database of bore construction details and analyses of water quality amongst other things now 2014 of the 33 892 bores in the database in the study area there are 3688 that have been analysed for the chloride concentration of groundwater at least once and of these 1279 were used in the present study bores located in the alluvium and groundwater discharge areas and those deeper than 100m were all excluded the spatial distribution of the selected bores is shown in fig 4 and the depth of these bores is shown in fig s2 the chloride in groundwater was extracted from the nsw office of water database for each location in the majority of locations 74 of 1279 bores there was only a single analysis of chloride concentration that precludes calculating the uncertainty there are 15 bores that had more than 10 analyses these had an average coefficient of variation of 0 21 this will be used for all bores as the basis for estimating the standard deviation as there is insufficient information to create a probability distribution for each individual bore although the variability in 15 bores is not a very strong statistical basis to estimate probability distributions for each bore the coefficient of variation of 0 21 is a robust measure as the coefficient of variation in the 158 bores with more than 3 samples also happens to be 0 21 the chloride concentration of groundwater is sampled from an assumed normal probability distribution for each replicate of the model 8 cl gw μ z σ where μ is the mean of all chloride in groundwater analyses at a bore mg l and σ is the standard deviation mg l 2 4 upscaling point estimates of recharge the upscaling of the point estimates of recharge using regression kriging hengl et al 2004 includes three steps i developing a relationship between rainfall and recharge for each surface geology group to predict recharge across the study area on a regular grid ii kriging the residuals between the point estimates of recharge and the regression equation estimates of recharge to provide a surface of residuals and iii adding the residual surface to the regression surface which provides a spatial estimate of recharge that is informed locally by point data and away from point data is dependent upon a global relationship between rainfall and recharge this process is repeated for 1000 stochastically generated replicates to quantify the uncertainty in the recharge estimates 2 4 1 regression equations previous studies have shown that recharge is better approximated by a log normal distribution rather than a normal distribution cook et al 1989 eriksson 1985 and this extends to its relationship with rainfall petheram et al 2002 recharge estimates are dependent upon rainfall soil type and vegetation crosbie et al 2010 kim and jackson 2012 scanlon et al 2006 and these have been used successfully used as variables to upscale modelled point estimates of recharge crosbie et al 2013 in other parts of the world potential evapotranspiration may be another useful predictor of recharge but that is not the case for the study area see fig s3 however as this study has subsetted the data by surface geology there are insufficient data to reliably differentiate recharge under different soil types and vegetation types within a surface geology group this leaves rainfall as the only covariate used to estimate recharge within a surface geology group 9 log r β 0 β 1 p where β 0 and β 1 are fitted through least squares regression we used bootstrapping to estimate uncertainty in the regression equations efron and tibshirani 1994 for each replicate 10 of the data used to fit each regression equation was randomly removed this will minimise the bias in the regression equation that can occur due to outliers in the dataset as these regression equations are used to extrapolate recharge beyond the observed range of long term 1930 2010 annual average rainfall experienced at the input bore network they can predict recharge that is infeasible i e greater than long term 1930 2010 annual average rainfall to prevent this in the upscaling we limited recharge to being less than half the long term 1930 2010 annual average rainfall the limit of half the rainfall was chosen as it is greater than the highest deterministic point estimate of recharge used in the upscaling 38 which leaves an allowance for the uncertainty in the deterministic estimate without extending into the infeasible range using the regression equation within each surface geology group we created a recharge surface on a 500m grid across the study area each replicate had the upscaled recharge rasters for each surface geology group combined into a single raster for storage in a raster stack 2 4 2 kriging residuals the difference in the recharge estimated through the regression equations and through the point scale chloride mass balance were calculated for each replicate these residuals were fitted to a spherical semi variogram using gstat pebesma 2004 in r r core team 2016 for each surface geology group and then kriged to a 500m grid for each replicate the different surface geology groups residual rasters were aggregated to a single residual raster respecting the surface geology and then stored in a raster stack 2 4 3 aggregating recharge rasters for each replicate the residual raster was added to the recharge raster upscaled using the regression equations to create a regression kriging recharge raster summary statistics were calculated from the 1000 replicates at the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles with the 50th percentile being assumed to be the most likely estimate of recharge and the difference between the 5th and 95th percentiles a measure of the uncertainty 2 5 alluvium as the alluvium has been excluded from the estimation of recharge using the chloride mass balance for this study an alternative method has been used for completeness in the maps the relationships developed by wohling et al 2012 based on field estimates of recharge from around australia use annual average rainfall clay content of the top 2m of soil and land use to predict annual average recharge here we use continental scale mapped clay content grundy et al 2015 and land use abares 2016 the uncertainty of recharge estimates to the alluvium have not been assessed the recharge to the alluvium is not the focus of this paper and isn t discussed further 2 6 assessment of the method to assess the performance of the regression kriging method the results were compared to more conventional upscaling of regression and kriging individually also compared is regression kriging without the differentiation in the regression equation based on the geology groups a deterministic upscaling was performed using 90 of the point recharge data with the remaining 10 used as a cross validation data set 3 results 3 1 point scale estimates of recharge as the study location encompasses the coastal zone to several hundred kilometres inland there is a large range in the mean chloride deposition rate across the 1279 input bores from 96kg ha yr to 4kg ha yr fig 4 at the location of these bores the long term 1930 2010 annual average rainfall varies greatly with a minimum of 528mm yr and a maximum of 2122mm yr consequently there is a wide variation in the runoff coefficient fig 4 in high rainfall areas the total runoff can be up to 50 of the rainfall whereas in the low rainfall areas it is practically zero as the surface runoff component has been assumed to export chloride at between 1 3 and 2 3 of the proportion of the total runoff exported the chloride exported can be between 0 and 33 of the chloride deposition a point scale example of the stochastic estimation of recharge using the chloride mass balance is demonstrated for bore gw029143 which is located in the sydney region latitude 34 22 s longitude 150 56 e in the middle triassic aquifers surface geology group the chloride deposition has a mean of 21kg ha yr a standard deviation of 2 5kg ha yr and a skewness of 0 27kg ha yr the runoff coefficient is 0 19 and it has a chloride in groundwater concentration of 40 8mg l a standard deterministic estimation of recharge would result in an estimate of 46 5mm yr if recharge is estimated stochastically with 10 000 random samples from the assumed distributions of chloride deposition chloride export in runoff and chloride concentration of groundwater the calculated recharge then becomes a probability distribution fig 5 the chloride deposition distribution is skewed to the left g 0 27 the chloride in groundwater distribution is assumed to be normally distributed and the resulting recharge distribution is heavily positively skewed approximating a log normal distribution fig 5 for this example the median recharge is slightly higher than the deterministic estimate at 46 7mm yr with the 5th and 95th percentiles being 31 7 and 73 5mm yr respectively the minimum and maximum of the 10 000 samples have a considerably greater range of 18 6 and 196mm yr 3 2 developing regression equations for each surface geology group the bores selected are used to develop a deterministic recharge estimate to show that the different stratigraphic units within a surface geology group form a consistent relationship fig 6 at the point scale there is scatter in these relationships yet our objective is to estimate a representative recharge rate regionally rather than at the point scale therefore it is the line of best fit that we are interested in from these relationships this regression line is statistically significant p 0 05 for all surface geology groups using an f test these relationships support the existing hydrogeological conceptual model of the study area the sand jurassic aquifers and middle triassic aquifers surface geology groups have the greatest recharge for a given annual average rainfall these three groups form important aquifers of good quality water that provide reasonable bore yields the other surface geology groups have lower recharge that is more representative of aquitards and do not contribute much recharge regionally although there are some locally important aquifers within these groups dawes et al 2017a b herr et al 2017 the boot strapping procedure accounts for the uncertainty in the point scale recharge estimates from the chloride deposition chloride exported in runoff and chloride concentration of groundwater in the regression equations a selection of these stochastically generated regression lines is shown in fig 7 similar to the point data the sand jurassic and middle triassic aquifers generally have the highest recharge for a given annual average rainfall the replicate regression lines are grouped tightly for the surface geology groups with bores spread over the greatest rainfall range the basement has the greatest spread in the regression lines particularly at high rainfall as this group had the least input bore data these stochastically generated regression equations are then used to upscale recharge to the entire study area on a regular 500m grid for each of the 1000 replicates 3 3 kriging regression residuals semivariograms are fitted to the residuals of each replicate of the recharge estimates to enable the residuals to be spatially interpolated through kriging example semivariograms for each surface geology group are shown in fig 8 from the deterministic recharge estimates shown in fig 6 the semivariograms are fitted to the recharge residuals from each surface geology group and the kriging is performed over the same surface geology groups to ensure that results are not interpolated over geological boundaries where there should not be any spatial correlation of the recharge residuals the sampling of the input chloride deposition distribution does incorporate spatial correlation across surface geology groups these semivariograms show that in each group there is a high nugget and a range that extends between 30 and 80km the high nugget indicates there is little spatial correlation in the residuals and has the effect that the interpolation is not trying to exactly match each point value of the recharge residuals but will only intervene when there is a local bias in the residuals the range of between 30 and 80km shows that the extent of the spatial correlation of recharge residuals and ensures that the residuals spatial surface is only using information that is local the example semivariograms shown for some of the geology groups show a poor fit e g volcanics and middle triassic aquifers in these cases there is a high nugget and a low sill the mean recharge residual surface of the 1000 replicates fig 9 shows that there are very few areas that have a recharge residual of more than half an order of magnitude positive or negative and that most of the area has a residual close to 0 in areas where there is no input bore data fig 4 the recharge residual is close to zero as the range in the variograms only extends to a maximum of 80km for surface geology groups that have a poor fit to the semivariograms there is little spatial correlation and therefore a mean residual that is also close to zero 3 4 aggregation of recharge surfaces regression kriging combines the upscaled recharge surface from the regression equations and the recharge residual surface from kriging the residuals fig 9 shows the mean of the 1000 replicates of the regression recharge the recharge residual and the mean of the final regression kriging recharge surface this shows that the mean of the regression recharge and the recharge from regression kriging is equal at the scale of the study area but is different locally the 1000 replicates of the upscaled recharge estimates from regression kriging are used to estimate the uncertainty in the recharge estimates across the study area this uncertainty is expressed as the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of recharge fig 10 the relative uncertainty in the recharge estimates shows that the areas without many data points particularly the highlands have the most uncertain estimates of recharge fig s4 as the extreme tails of the recharge distribution are not a priority the recharge statistics represented by the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles converge to a stable value quickly demonstrating that the 1000 replicates used here are sufficient fig s5 the estimated recharge for each surface geology group in each reporting region has been listed in table 1 and asa percentage of rainfall in table 2 this shows that the surface geology groups with the highest recharge are the sand volcanic jurassic aquifers and middle triassic aquifers 3 5 assessment of the method a comparison of the alternative upscaling methods shows that the spatial pattern of the kriging upscaling is less detailed than the regression or regression kriging because it does not have access to the surface geology or rainfall as co variates fig 11 the biggest difference in the regression kriging with and without the surface geology groups can be seen around the jurassic aquifers see fig 2 for location which corresponds to the intake beds for the great artesian basin when surface geology is not accounted for the regression kriging underestimates the recharge by almost an order of magnitude the 10 of point recharge estimates retained as validation show that the regression upscaling overestimates the low recharge estimates while the kriging and regression kriging are able to better match the data fig 12 the root mean squared rms error of the log transformed data for each method is approximately half an order of magnitude regression 0 52 kriging 0 46 regression kriging with geology 0 47 regression kriging without geology 0 46 and with the normalised percent error there is still little to separate the methods regression 17 kriging 21 regression kriging with geology 16 regression kriging without geology 21 in a purely statistical sense the regression kriging method is not a great leap forward over the conventional kriging method for the estimation of recharge spatially in this study but it does come with the substantial advantage of utilizing covariates for regional recharge estimation and thus responds to data beyond the spatially isolated bore recharge data set the best example arises from the underestimation of the point recharge dataset in high rainfall regions fig 4 the kriging upscaling had a maximum recharge of just over 100mm yr whereas the regression kriging has a maximum recharge closer to 1000mm yr the point recharge estimates are under represented in the high rainfall regions as bores are not needed for a water supply and so ordinary kriging would interpolate based on the point data from lower rainfall point estimates and under estimate the recharge in these high rainfall regions a comparison of the residual surfaces fitted for the regressions with and without the surface geology groups demonstrates the robustness of the method without the surface geology groups there is a greater residual from the input data fig s6b the regression kriging method can overcome this by making a greater intervention via the residual surface to create a similar recharge surface fig 11 both of the residual surfaces in fig s6 have a mean close to 0 but the surface without the geology has a standard deviation almost double that of the surface with surface geology 4 discussion 4 1 comparison to other recharge estimates in the region in the eastern nsw coal bearing geological basins detailed recharge studies have only been performed in small areas of the productive aquifers fig s7 these include the pilliga sandstone ransley and smerdon 2012 the hawkesbury sandstone cendón et al 2014 and the tomago sandbeds crosbie 2003 crosbie et al 2005 to date the permian units have not been considered asa water resource and have not had detailed investigations the recharge estimated in the current study compares well with the previous more detailed site specific studies table s2 the great artesian basin intake beds had the same average recharge estimated 1 1 of rainfall and the previous estimate in the hawkesbury sandstone of 9 cendón et al 2014 is close to that estimated here of 11 with a range of 8 14 between the 5th and 95th percentiles the chloride mass balance estimates of recharge at tomago of crosbie 2003 at the western end are comparable to those estimated here with 17 of rainfall compared to 14 9 20 the estimate of gross recharge at tomago of close to 50 of rainfall crosbie et al 2005 is not directly comparable to the net recharge estimates here see doble and crosbie 2017 for a discussion of gross versus net recharge there have been many numerical groundwater models developed for assessing coal resource developments in the permian units within the study region the recharge assumed for these models in the coastal catchments was reviewed by emm 2015 who summarised them asa percentage of rainfall for the permian sediments of the sydney and gloucester basin 1 of rainfall was found to be representative emm 2015 and for the triassic sediments of the sydney basin 6 of rainfall was found to be representative emm 2015 the permian recharge asa percentage of rainfall compares well to the recharge estimated here table 2 but the triassic recharge is quite different when aggregated the average recharge across all the triassic zones is 3 7 with a range between the 5th and 95th percentile of 2 9 4 7 but the present study has split the triassic into three groups this study found higher recharge for the middle triassic aquifers at 8 and lower recharge for the rest of the triassic units 2 4 2 qualitative uncertainty this section critically assesses the key assumptions of this study that could not be implemented in the quantitative uncertainty analysis yet have the potential to affect the predicted recharge here we use a qualitative uncertainty analysis to build confidence in the model predictions kloprogge et al 2011 peeters 2017 the key assumptions that could affect the estimated recharge are i that the source of chloride in the groundwater is from rainfall ii that the system is in steady state iii that the relationship between rainfall and log transformed recharge is linear and iv that kriging is an appropriate interpolator these are discussed in turn below 4 2 1 source of chloride in groundwater old 1942 hypothesised that the salts present in the sydney basin are of connate origin which if correct would render the chloride mass balance method invalid in other basins in eastern australia with sediment deposits of marine origins the groundwater composition may look like seawater but actually evolved from the evapoconcentration of rainwater this was shown through the chloride bromide ratios cl br and the stable isotopes of water herczeg et al 2001 hofmann and cartwright 2013 taylor 2016 showed that salt in the wianamatta group sediments in the sydney basin originated from the evapoconcentration of rainfall and was not connate in origin that study used the stable isotopes of both hydrogen and oxygen to show that the water evaporated which gave the groundwater a seawater like chemical composition rainwater near the coast has a chemical composition resembling diluted seawater jasonsmith et al 2011 showed in their study that upward flow of groundwater from the wittingham coal measures in the sydney basin into the alluvium was the source of saline discharge to a small catchment in the upper hunter river they based this on the cl br ratios however this was an order of magnitude less than would be expected of brines from the dissolution of halite cartwright et al 2004 however given that their groundwater sample labelled as indicative of halite dissolution is quite fresh tds 224mg l and the bromide concentration is listed as 0 0mg l the analytical precision of the cl br ratio is questionable it has been shown by other researchers that the chloride inputs can be corrected for estimating recharge on the basis of the cl br ratio alcalá and custodio 2008 horner et al 2017 if the primary source of chloride in the groundwater is either due to connate water or halite dissolution then the relationships between rainfall and recharge in fig 6 would be random scatter for each surface geology group the relationship is statistically significant p 0 05 the permian coal surface geology group which contains the wittingham coal measures has the weakest relationship between rainfall and recharge p 0 024 which could be an indicator that the source of chloride in this group is not entirely meteoric if the source of chloride is not entirely meteoric then recharge will be underestimated agricultural practice especially application of fertilizer is another potential source of chloride allison and hughes 1978 for instance correct the chloride input due to potassium chloride fertiliser at two of the sixteen study sites in the vicinity of mt gambier in australia the land use map of australia department of agriculture and water resources 2016 shows that the majority of land outside the alluvial systems in the study area is used for dryland cropping or grazing modified pastures the compilation of gross margin handbooks describing typical farming practice presented in navarro et al 2016 indicates that fertilisers with a high chloride concentration such as potassium chloride are not recommended or necessary for these kinds of farming at the regional scale of this study agricultural sources of chloride are therefore considered very small this can however mean that locally recharge rates are underestimated if chloride rich fertilisers are applied other anthropogenic sources of chloride such as road de icing or leaking sewer systems are not relevant in this part of australia 4 2 2 steady state conditions the fourth assumption listed in section 2 2 that the water and chloride fluxes are in steady state is very difficult to meet in an area that has undergone recent i e decades to centuries for semi arid areas less for temperate areas land use change much research has been performed assessing the impacts of land use change on recharge but this has usually been in areas with long term annual average rainfall below 700mm yr kennett smith et al 1994 petheram et al 2002 scanlon et al 2005 the most extreme examples are from the semi arid mallee area where it is common for recharge to increase by two orders of magnitude following native vegetation clearing for agriculture allison et al 1985 kennett smith et al 1994 but this is starting from recharge as low as 0 1mm yr the other extreme has been observed at tomago eastern most point of the study area on the coast where crosbie et al 2005 found that recharge was not significantly different under three vegetation types forest heath and grass with the recharge estimated to be 47 of the rainfall independent of the vegetation type the study area will likely fall between these two extremes ideally future work could use age based tracers to determine the age of the water at the time of chloride analysis the age of the water increases with depth in a water column as the water at the water table was recharged recently and the water at the bottom of the column recharged a long time ago böhlke 2002 solomon et al 1993 modern water 50years has been found at depths greater than 100m within the study area albeit in a high rainfall area 1200mm yr cendón et al 2014 this study has used relatively shallow bores median is 34m drilled depth see fig s2 in outcrop areas in an attempt at sampling water that has been recharged since clearing of the native vegetation over the past 200years as a very simple proxy for age the drilled depth of the bore has been used to look for a relationship with the recharge estimates there is no relationship between the depth of the bore and the recharge that can be seen fig s8 this is an indication that it is not possible from this dataset to identify the transient effects of landuse change on recharge the point recharge estimates corresponding to pre clearing conditions will bias the results towards low recharge estimates however at this stage it is not possible to quantify the magnitude of this bias this bias in the recharge estimates is however most likely to occur in low recharge areas where recharge is less than 1mm yr it will take a long time to displace the water that was recharged under native vegetation i e centuries whereas areas with recharge greater than 10mm yr will come to equilibrium comparatively quicker i e decades not having the system in steady state following land clearing can only result in an underestimate of the recharge 4 2 3 linearity of regression equations fig 6 shows considerable scatter in the relationship between rainfall and chloride mass balance estimated recharge they do however systematically show lower recharge associated with low rainfall and vice versa the linear regression between rainfall and recharge aims to capture the general trend of this relationship where local deviations are accounted for through the kriging of the residuals some alternatives to the linear regression that can be considered are i using the mean of the dataset if there is limited explanation of the regression variance ii local means if subgroups are present or iii a more complex functional form e g a quadratic or higher order polynomial regression that more closely captures the variation in the data when applying the first option i e i above the method reverts to simple kriging and the rainfall covariate is ignored a simple kriging approach is able to reproduce point estimates with an accuracy comparable to the regression kriging but it lacks agreement with the conceptual understanding of recharge processes the latter can lead to unrealistic values in data poor areas the second option i e ii above using local means for instance one for low rainfall and one for high rainfall would alleviate that issue this however introduces a non linearity in the interpolation that can result in boundary effects and more importantly necessitates the arbitrary distinction between high and low rainfall the third option i e iii above a more complex fitting equation or in extremis a spline fitting algorithm can help in avoiding the arbitrary choices more complex functions however are much more prone to overfitting and instability away from the controlling observations this has two consequences a it will be more difficult to establish a stationary spatial relationship between residuals for the kriging algorithm and b the algorithm is more likely to produce extrapolation artefacts the linear regression equations in combination with the bootstrapping procedure provide a trade off between introducing an objective repeatable functional relationship between recharge and rainfall in the interpolation and minimising the propensity of interpolation artefacts in data poor areas 4 2 4 regression kriging with bootstrapping one of the main assumptions in ordinary kriging is that the random spatial process that is simulated is stationary and can be captured with a single covariance function regression kriging relaxes that first assumption as it allows the mean of interpolation to vary locally asa function of an external covariate removing the externally defined trend from the data increases the probability that the residuals are homoscedastic i e that their variance is constant and independent of scale or location the uncertainty of the interpolated surfaces however still relies on propagation of normally distributed errors through the kriging equation which results in a mean and standard deviation for each grid cell the use of a bootstrapping procedure in our study on the other hand avoids this normality assumption and results in a more robust estimation of the interpolated recharge 5 conclusion this study aimed to regionally estimate groundwater recharge across the 146 000km2 of eastern new south wales coal bearing basins that are facing increased development pressures the variable spatial density of input groundwater bores for estimating recharge using the chloride mass balance method provided challenges in the upscaling of the point estimates of recharge to regional estimates that are necessary for regional water resource management the upscaling was completed using regression kriging which combined the best aspects of the global upscaling of regression and the local methods of interpolation via kriging this study found that recharge is highest in the productive aquifers such as the coastal dunes over 100mm yr hawkesbury sandstone up to 100mm yr and the pilliga sandstone up to 10mm yr and lowest in the permian units 1 of rainfall the regional recharge estimated here is consistent with small scale studies in the productive aquifers and is the first detailed recharge study in the permian units the recharge estimation incorporated the uncertainty in the chloride deposition of rainfall the chloride exported in runoff the chloride concentration of the groundwater and the regression equations used in upscaling the uncertainty in the recharge estimates was quantified using stochastic inputs and 1000 replicates the magnitude of the uncertainty when expressed as the difference between the 5th and 95th percentiles of the recharge estimates is often close to the magnitude of the median recharge estimate a qualitative analysis of the unquantified uncertainty in the recharge estimates suggests that a low bias is more likely than a high bias in recharge estimates presented here this is particularly the case for the areas with the lowest recharge the method developed here for upscaling the point estimates of recharge using the chloride mass balance provides robust estimates of recharge and its associated uncertainty provided that the assumptions underlying the chloride mass balance method can be met the method is applicable to any region i e 10 000km2 with a variable density of input data as long as surface geology and rainfall grids are spatially continuously available for the region acknowledgements this research is part of the bioregional

7323,coupled water and energy balance models have become increasingly popular for estimating groundwater recharge because of the integration of energy and water balances and sometimes carbon balance the additional balances are thought to constrain the water balance and as a result should help reduce the uncertainty of groundwater recharge however these models usually have a large number of parameters the uncertainty of these parameters may result in a large uncertainty in groundwater recharge estimates this study aims to assess the potential uncertainty of groundwater recharge estimated from a widely used water and energy model it is largely based on annual pasture vegetation in the lower part of the campaspe catchment in southeast australia a monte carlo analysis method was employed to examine potential uncertainties introduced by different types of errors the results show that for a mean rainfall of 398mm y and using a particular set of pedotransfer functions for deriving soil hydraulic parameters the estimated recharge ranged from 7 to 144mm y due to the uncertainty in vegetation parameters this upper bound of the recharge range increased to 236mm y when using different sets of pedotransfer functions through several synthetic test cases this study shows that soil moisture time series may not offer much help for reducing recharge uncertainty whereas evapotranspiration time series are able to reduce recharge uncertainty by more than 50 the reduction in recharge uncertainty steadily improves as the uncertainty in observations reduces keywords groundwater recharge soil water balance water and energy balance model uncertainty analysis 1 introduction groundwater recharge plays a significant role in water resources management in particular in arid and semi arid regions scanlon et al 2006 often groundwater recharge is used to determine the allocation of groundwater extraction based on the principle that the extraction should not exceed the recharge although the relationship between allocation and recharge has been criticised e g bredehoeft 1997 2002 gorelick and zheng 2015 zhou 2009 the practice is still common throughout the world e g chung et al 2016 devlin and sophocleous 2005 many methods have been developed to estimate groundwater recharge with the soil water balance method probably the most widely used and perhaps the most straightforward allison et al 1994 healy and cook 2002 scanlon et al 2002 a large number of soil water balance models have been developed and these can be broadly classified into bucket models and physically based models the bucket models treat the soil as a reservoir that is filled up by precipitation and emptied by evapotranspiration zhang et al 2002 recharge occurs when the reservoir overflows numerous variants of bucket models exist depending on the conceptualisation of the system and methods for estimating evapotranspiration alley 1984 dripps and bradbury 2007 finch 1998 jie et al 2011 kendy et al 2003 ruiz et al 2010 rushton and ward 1979 westenbroek et al 2010 zhang and hiscock 2010 these models are computationally efficient and so have been used over large areas xu 1997 xu and singh 1998 in comparison physically based soil water balance models have to solve richards equation to obtain the spatial distribution of soil moisture content chen et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 kurtzman and scanlon 2011 turkeltaub et al 2015 the computational burden and the difficulty to achieve numerical convergence restrict physically based models to be mostly used for assessing local scale hydrological process and quantifying relevant fluxes water and energy balance models are essentially water balance models capable of simulating the water and energy balances simultaneously e g akkermans et al 2012 petropoulos et al 2009 sellers et al 1986 williams et al 1996 zhang and dawes 1998 because of their additional capacity to simulate the energy balance these models are considered superior to water balance only models for computing evapotranspiration overgaard et al 2006 potential groundwater recharge which is the rate of soil water drainage below a given depth is a water budget component that is produced from all water and energy balance models the use of water and energy balance models to estimate potential groundwater recharge in australia started from the need to address the response of potential recharge to land use changes zhang et al 1999 and climate change crosbie et al 2010 mccallum et al 2010 the water atmosphere vegetation energy and solutes model waves was the model used zhang and dawes 1998 since then the waves model has been applied in many areas to assess groundwater recharge crosbie et al 2012 2013 models are usually calibrated to different observations including streamflow soil moisture evapotranspiration and modis leaf area index chen et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 zhang et al 1999 conceptually models which are more complex and include a larger number of physical processes should be more accurate than overly simple models that neglect critical processes although this may depend on the uncertainty associated with calibration data and model parameters this is because simple models have large structural errors and estimating parameter values based on soft knowledge is often better than neglecting processes entirely water and energy balance models may help to better constrain the water balance with the energy and carbon balances in comparison to pure water balance models as these additional balances constrain evapotranspiration et for example et is influenced by net radiation air temperature vapour pressure deficit aerodynamic resistance and canopy resistance canopy resistance is a function of relative availability of water and light carbon assimilation rate leaf area index although the accuracy of water balance models for estimating groundwater recharge has been questioned in a number of studies e g alley 1984 gee and hillel 1988 there are still very few examples of where formal uncertainty analysis has accompanied estimates of recharge obtained with such models even for simple models with few parameter values giambelluca et al 1996 lanini and caballero 2016 it is clear that models that are calibrated to field data should also have less uncertainty than uncalibrated models although calibration data can be difficult to obtain and or site specific nevertheless it is not uncommon to predict recharge using models without any formal calibration e g dash et al 2016 crosbie et al 2010 2013 rushton et al 2006 taylor and howard 1996 the objectives of this study were to examine the uncertainty of groundwater recharge estimated from a water and energy balance model that has been widely used around the world and also to provide suggestions for reducing uncertainty when using this type of model the intention was not to exhaust all the possible scenarios but rather to address this issue through a synthetic example largely based on a field site in southeast australia we built a model in a similar manner to that described in crosbie et al 2010 to represent typical land use c3 annual pasture or dryland pasture in this study in a semi arid area a monte carlo approach was adopted to examine potential uncertainty using latin hypercube sampling we then explored whether field observations such as soil moisture and evapotranspiration could be employed to reduce recharge uncertainty 2 field site description this study is loosely based on the lower part of the campaspe catchment in southeast australia fig 1 we chose the annual pasture in this area as our vegetation the intention of this study was not to produce recharge estimates across the entire region rather we aimed to illustrate potential recharge uncertainty estimated from a water and energy balance model using a demonstrative example the northern part of the catchment includes the floodplains of the campaspe and murray rivers as so is very flat the top soil over this region largely falls in the category of sodosols according to the australian soil classification system isbell 1996 two aquifers occur in this area an unconfined sand clay interbedded aquifer and a semi confined sandy aquifer the water table in the unconfined aquifer is generally 10 15m below ground whereas the piezometric surface in the confined aquifer is lower than the water table therefore there is a general trend of downward flow from the unconfined aquifer to the confined aquifer the long term average precipitation is about 400mm y whereas the long term average potential evapotranspiration et is 1600mm y 2006 2016 rainfall occurs episodically throughout the year with monthly rainfall about 1 3 higher in the months from may to october around 40mm than in other months however extreme rainfall events can occur at any time in comparison potential et has a clear seasonal trend it peaks at around 12mm d in the summer months december to february and is around 1mm d in the winter months june to august the majority of the catchment has been cultivated for farming dryland crops dryland pasture and irrigated crops account for 6 69 and 8 of the total catchment area respectively this study has focused on dryland pasture c3 annual pasture which belongs to the plant functional type of grass as this is the dominant vegetation type in the catchment 3 methods 3 1 numerical modelling the water atmosphere vegetation energy and solutes waves model zhang and dawes 1998 was chosen to examine recharge uncertainty estimated from the water and energy balance modelling waves simulates water solute energy and carbon balances simultaneously in the soil vegetation atmosphere continuum rainfall is first intercepted by plant leaves and then evaporated back to the atmosphere for any time step waves first performs the calculation of the carbon balance in order to derive the canopy carbon assimilation rate the carbon assimilation rate is then distributed to leaves stems and roots based on factors such as water availability respiration rates and leaf mortality rates then waves carries out the calculation of the energy balance in order to obtain the et rate through the penman monteith equation this et rate is distributed to different depths of the root zone by considering a number of factors such as root carbon mass soil water matric potential osmotic potential root salt sensitivity factor and permanent wilting point next waves iteratively solves the richards equation to achieve numerical convergence excess water above ground due to limited infiltration and saturation capacity becomes overland flow this excess water above ground is removed from the model by default excess water draining through the soil continuum will become groundwater recharge a detailed description of the methodology used by waves and its numerical implementation is thoroughly documented by zhang and dawes 1998 3 2 data collection and analysis three types of data were collected for running the waves model these include climate variables on a daily time step soil attribute data for deriving soil hydraulic parameters and vegetation parameters historical daily climate data was extracted from the gridded climate surfaces provided by the queensland department of natural resources and water jeffrey et al 2001 the dataset contains all the common variables measured at a weather station including rainfall temperature solar radiation pan evaporation vapour pressure and humidity for 127years the variable vapour pressure deficit was derived from temperature and measured vapour pressure in accordance with grayso et al 1998 soil hydraulic parameters were derived from soil attribute raster datasets accessed from the terrestrial ecosystem research network tern http www tern org au the tern provides a range of australia wide soil attributes e g clay content silt content sand content at 6 depth intervals 0 0 05m 0 05 0 15m 0 15 0 3m 0 3 0 6m 0 6 1 0m and 1 0 2 0m the top 0 3m and the depth range of 0 3 2 0m were treated as topsoil and subsoil respectively we considered both topsoil and subsoil in order to account for the fact that topsoil is usually more permeable than subsoil because of its richness in organic matters this treatment rendered the subsurface structure of the waves model consistent with previous studies e g crosbie et al 2010 2012 then we averaged the clay content of both the topsoil and subsoil to create a clay content map on the map grid cells with clay content lower than the median value are classified as soil group 1 the remaining grid cells are classified as soil group 2 this resulted in a soil group map as shown in fig 1 we used clay content to determine soil groups as increases in clay content lead to decreases in permeability and increases in water holding capacity and hence increases in deep drainage kennett smith et al 1994 wohling et al 2012 the second soil group was chosen to examine the uncertainty of recharge the soil attribute values were used to calculate the soil moisture characteristic curves at discrete points through pedotransfer functions ideally a specific pedotransfer function should be derived from field measurements for the study area however this was not possible due to the size of the catchment and paucity of data minasny et al 1999 derived a pedotransfer function for australia but this function was not useful in this study because it requires soil particle size data which was not available for the field site moreover most studies only have pedotransfer functions for either soil moisture characteristic curves or saturated hydraulic conductivity instead of both ultimately four sets of pedotransfer functions that are capable of deriving both soil moisture characteristic curves and saturated hydraulic conductivity parameters from the same soil data were selected from the literature i e dane and puckett 1992 saxton et al 1986 wösten et al 1999 schaap et al 2001 as waves uses the broadbridge white soil retention model broadbridge and white 1998 we derived retention curve parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity from the four sets of pedotransfer functions table 1 for both topsoil and subsoil it is clear that all the parameters except c are very different from one group to another indicating the difference between the pedotransfer functions all the pedotransfer functions yielded c fixed at 10 because this parameter relates to the slope of the moisture characteristic at satiation in this study we chose c3 annual pasture as the vegetation because it is the dominant vegetation type in the catchment waves requires 26 parameters for a type of vegetation dawes et al 1998 conducted a comprehensive literature review of vegetation parameters and compiled a table of all parameters with upper and lower bounds for several different vegetation types these uncertainties reflect the accuracy of estimation without field measurement when using a biophysically based model at the regional scale it is not possible to measure field scale parameters in this study the uncertainty ranges of most vegetation parameters were taken from the table in dawes et al 1998 only a few parameter ranges were modified after a brief literature review to better reflect c3 annual pasture in a semi arid environment in southeast australia these modified parameters are indicated in table 2 3 3 model setup and recharge assessment waves requires discretisation of the unsaturated zone in order to solve the richards equation in this study the model was set up to be 4m in depth with the top of the model representing the land surface at the depth of 4m both soil evaporation and plant transpiration should become negligible given the maximum rooting depth of 1 5m table 2 and the average water table depth of 10 15m hence deep drainage can be assumed to equal actual groundwater recharge the bottom of the model was specified with a free drainage boundary condition the model was discretised into 58 elements with the elemental size increasing from 0 001m near the top to 0 05m at a depth of 0 4m from 0 4m to 4m a constant elemental size of 0 1m was used the top 0 3m was assumed to be the topsoil whereas the remaining soil layer comprised the subsoil the initial matric potential was assumed to be uniform at 100m and the initial root carbon mass was assumed to be 0 002kg m2 at all nodes the initial leaf carbon was set at 0 05kg m2 and the stem carbon was 0 5km m2 because we do not know the exact initial conditions it takes some time for the model to spin up to the equilibrium state we assessed the time for leaf area index to reach its long term trend in several selected model realisations our assessment suggests that the spin up time is only several years in those selected model realisations given the stochastic nature of this study it is impossible to examine the spin up time for all model realisations as the period for simulation was 127years starting from 1889 first year data is available we chose the last 50years to calculate the long term average groundwater recharge and left the first 77years for the model to spin up such a long time should allow any model realisation to reach its equilibrium state the input vegetation parameters were sampled from the parameter ranges listed in table 2 using the monte carlo approach the latin hypercube sampling technique was used to perform stratified sampling of all parameters which ensured the reasonable distribution of samples over a sampling space in comparison to simple monte carlo sampling this stratified sampling approach requires less realisations to describe a probability distribution given the large number of uncertain parameters 40 000 realisations were generated to yield 40 000 recharge estimates i e 10 000 realisations for each group of soil hydraulic parameters in theory the number of realisations should be dependent on the particular case to ensure ergodic statistics in this study we chose 40 000 realisations based on the computational power we could access and this number is more likely to capture many important parameter sets than a smaller number the soil hydraulic parameters were chosen from the four groups derived from four different sets of pedotransfer functions table 1 after sampling all parameters and variables were fed into the waves model to simulate daily drainage the long term mean groundwater recharge was estimated by taking the average of daily drainage over the past 50years i e 1966 2016 3 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis is useful for determining influential model parameters often an exhaustive assessment requires a number of sensitivity analysis methods to distinguish different groups of parameters i e parameters with negligible effects linear effects nonlinear and or interaction effects in this study the purpose of the sensitivity analysis was to improve qualitative understanding of those parameters rather than an exhaustive assessment hence we only carried out one sensitivity analysis the morris method was chosen to perform the sensitivity analysis morris 1991 saltelli et al 2008 this method normalises the parameter space to the multidimensional hypercube i e each dimension represents one parameter each dimension is divided into the same number of intervals which equals the number of scenarios for each scenario the morris method randomly decides the trajectory in the parameter space one measure μ mean of the elementary effects of a parameter i e the ratios of recharge change to parameter change is calculated for every parameter in this study we analysed the sensitivity of the vegetation parameters and soil hydraulic parameters the ranges of the vegetation parameters are the same as those in table 2 unlike the vegetation parameters the soil hydraulic parameters are not independent these parameters appear in groups as shown in table 2 as the sensitivity analysis requires parameter ranges we chose the subsoil in table 1 asan example and determined the ranges of the soil hydraulic parameters from the highest and lowest values hence the ranges for ks θs θr and λc are 0 00634 0 189m d 0 327 0 428 0 128 0 306 and 0 0428 0 296m respectively the parameter c is treated constant as it was estimated to be 10 from all the pedotransfer functions moreover our initial testing suggests recharge is also insensitive to c although we did not examine soil hydraulic parameters from different soil layers and soil groups the sensitivity analysis is still indicative of the importance of these soil hydraulic parameters in the model 3 5 model calibration we examined uncertainty in recharge using both uncalibrated and calibrated models fig 2 calibrated models use et and or soil moisture for calibration as these parameters have been most often used for model calibration in the literature chen et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 kendy et al 2003 soil moisture content can be easily measured by installing moisture sensors at depth of interest evapotranspiration can be inferred from meteorological data or from satellite imagery hence in this study we also attempt to evaluate whether soil moisture content and evapotranspiration time series can reduce recharge uncertainty in order to produce generalised results the soil moisture and et data were obtained from one realisation with parameters randomly sampled fig 2 in this study we only extracted the last 10years of the time series produced from the specific realisation as our experience indicates that it is rare to have more than 10years of field data the synthetic time series was then treated as observations for model calibration to account for observational uncertainty arising from human errors equipment errors or analysis errors we added 10 error to the synthetic time series shown as upper and lower bounds in fig 3 this is towards the lower level of et measurement errors reported in the literature glenn et al 2011 congruent information for soil moisture does not exist although in our judgement 10 represents a reasonable estimate of uncertainty involved in field sampling and analysis for soil moisture e g different sensor types local scale soil heterogeneity and operational errors to allow for consistent framework and quantitative comparison we therefore applied the same percent error to soil moisture we therefore consider a model fitting error to occur only when the simulated value differs from the original value by more than 10 fig 3 goodness of fit can be examined using statistical variables these include 1 root mean squared error rmse a measure of the average differences between modelled results and observed results smaller rmse indicates better prediction of the model 2 mean relative error mre a measure of the bias of the modelled results compared to observed ones mre 0 is a sign of model over prediction and mre 0 signals model under prediction 3 coefficient of determination r2 a measure of the agreement between observed and modelled results high r2 indicates strong goodness of fit whereas low r2 suggests weak model fitting to measured results the formulae are 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 2 mre 1 n i 1 n p i o i o i 3 r 2 i 1 n p i p o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where p i and o i are predicted and observed values respectively and p and o are average values of the predicted and observed time series respectively note that nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse is another metric that measures model sensitivity to outliers because the similarity between nse and rmse nse was not included here criteria must be used to determine acceptable models in this study we first computed the mean and standard deviation of synthetic time series we then used half of the standard deviation as the cut off for rmse and 0 5 for r2 in accordance with moriasi et al 2007 the criteria provided by moriasi et al 2007 were based on a thorough review of catchment modelling studies in addition we used half of the coefficient of variation the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean for mre in order to link it to observations i e baseline data in this study a model is deemed as acceptable only if all the three fit statistics meet their criteria at the same time although there is general guidance in the literature the choice of cut off criteria is still subjective 4 results 4 1 a demonstrative example fig 4 shows the partitioning of the water input i e rainfall into several different water budget components over a period of 10years the long term average rainfall was 398mm y most rain was less than 40mm d and fell between june and august heavy rain as much as 60mm d or more occurred in some years the average interception rate was 118mm y about 30 of the rainfall with the average leaf area index of 0 801 this interception rate is reasonable as the study area is semi arid and most rainfall is below 20mm d clark 1940 showed that wheat functionally same as annual pasture can intercept more than 33 of rainfall when rainfall is less than 1 48inches d i e 38mm d any water that was not intercepted by leaves would reach the ground and undergo further partitioning heavy rainfall tended to cause overland flow especially when the rainfall exceeded about 20mm d the average overland flow rate was 36mm y once the water entered the soil it migrated through the soil pores to increase the soil moisture storage where a large part of the water was transpired back to the atmosphere by the plant through the stomata or drained through the root zone to recharge the underlying groundwater the mean et rate was about 183mm y accounting for 45 of the rainfall note that this et value only comprised soil evaporation and plant transpiration the total et is 301mm y as it also includes canopy evaporation i e rainfall interception the deep drainage through the root zone is the source of groundwater recharge the long term average drainage 61mm y accounted for 15 of the rainfall the drainage also exhibits a strong annual variation in addition to seasonal variation for example between the 3rd and 4th years the recharge was relatively low and steady at approximately 0 1mm d whereas the recharge spiked to 1 7mm d in the 9th year the highest annual recharge occurred in the 6th year 162mm y whereas the lowest was in the 4th year 17mm y 4 2 sensitivity analysis the morris sensitivity analysis suggests that maximum carbon assimilation rate amax saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and saturated water content θs and residual water content θr play more important roles than other parameters because of the higher mean values of the elementary effects fig 5 amax is important as it affects the actual carbon assimilation rate which impacts on stomatal conductance the other three important parameters ks θs and θr determine the capability of soil to transmit or retain soil water it is not surprising that these parameters are important the next set of important parameters include rainfall interception coefficient kr light extinction coefficient k saturation light intensity lsat leaf respiration rate lrate leaf mortality rate mrate and above ground partitioning factor β kr determines how much rainfall will be intercepted by leaves and hence impacts on the availability of water reaching the ground similarly k affects the distribution of solar radiation and longwave radiation at different layers which are the energy sources for evapotranspiration the other four parameters lsat lrate mrate and β play important roles in plant growth 4 3 recharge uncertainty as with the demonstrative example we generated 10 000 realisations by randomly sampling all the vegetation parameters all the 10 000 realisations share the same climate inputs and use the same set of soil hydraulic parameters as those in the demonstrative example 30 000 realisations were run later for the other three sets of soil hydraulic parameters 10 000 realisations produced 10 000 values of long term mean groundwater recharge note that the recharge produced from these realisations is direct output from waves without model calibration as shown in fig 6 pedo1 the possible recharge range is between 7 and 144mm y with the mean recharge at 66mm y fig 6 also shows the differences in the recharge distributions and statistics between the four sets of pedotransfer functions pedo2 and pedo3 resulted in quite similar recharge ranges 7 80mm y whereas the last set of pedotransfer functions produced a much wider range 10 240mm y the t test suggests that the difference in mean recharge is statistically significant between any two groups the much wider recharge range in the fourth set of pedotransfer functions is attributed to the larger saturated hydraulic conductivity and the larger residual water content using the rosetta program schaap et al 2001 because of the fourth set of pedotransfer functions the overall recharge range increased from 7 144mm y to 7 236mm y the upper bound of the recharge range has increased by 92mm y the 236mm y for recharge was for an extreme parameter combination e g high ks small difference between θs and θr low amax such a high recharge value is unlikely to be realistic for a semi arid environment and the probability for it to occur is very low the large range of recharge estimates in fig 6 indicates that this method is unlikely to produce highly constrained recharge that can be confidently used by water resources managers note that we present several recharge statistics in fig 6b and several following figures but our analysis throughout this study is focused on the complete recharge range i e the range between minimum and maximum values rather than 5 95 percentiles or 25 75 percentiles 4 4 model calibration to test our hypothesis that additional datasets may help to reduce recharge uncertainty we chose a single realisation as a base case to generate a moisture content time series at the 0 6m depth and et time series both moisture content and et time series are used to calibrate the waves models in order to produce constrained recharge estimates note that the choice of 0 6m for the moisture content is subjective any other depths could also be used to perform this analysis as the depth of 0 3m is defined as the interface between topsoil and subsoil this 0 6m depth is located in the subsoil the two time series for the last 10years were extracted and modified by adding lower and upper error bounds 10 of the actual values as outlined in the methods section the synthetic curves in fig 7 show the error bounds of the moisture content and the et time series for the last 10years it should also be noted that the synthetic et time series in the following analysis only includes soil evaporation and plant transpiration actual et measurements should also include rainfall interception by canopies given a theoretical study the use of et time series without including rainfall interception is not expected to have a significant impact on the conclusions fig 7 also shows the modelled moisture content and et from three different model realisations using different parameter values these three model realisations produce different groundwater recharge but they all provide a reasonable fit to the data produced from the base case as can be seen the overall fitting for both moisture content and et was quite reasonable take model 1 for example rmse mre and r2 for soil moisture are 0 0 0 0 and 1 0 respectively considering the error bounds fig 7a and rmse mre and r2 for et are 0 207mm d 0 247 and 0 856 respectively the quantitative measures indicate the fitting is better for moisture content than for et consistent with the qualitative inspection this process of data fitting was carried out 40 000 times each fit statistic can be used to determine the plausible range of the recharge by examining the relationship between the statistic and the recharge fig 8 for rmse and mre the data points were separated into 3 4 clusters and spread in a similar fashion to the relevant recharge distribution in fig 6 the spreading was likely caused by relatively stable moisture content i e moisture content stabilises at the residual moisture content for more than half of the time as shown in fig 7 this is because our synthetic dataset was generated by using one of the four groups of the soil hydraulic parameters the other three groups of the soil hydraulic parameters seem to produce different soil moisture results regardless of vegetation parameters as the mean and the standard deviation of the synthetic data are 0 248 and 0 015 respectively we used half of the standard deviation 0 007 half of the coefficient of variation 0 03 and 0 5as the cut off values for rmse mre and r2 respectively as explained in the methods section a model is acceptable only if the three fit statistics meet their cut off criteria at the same time hence the final recharge range is 7 144mm y θ fig 9 with 9999 acceptable models θ of test case 1 table 3 nearly half of the range without data fitting however as shown on the right panel of fig 8 the acceptable models are from the same cluster these acceptable models used the same group of soil hydraulic parameters as the base case that produced the synthetic time series and only one of the 10 000 realisations that used these soil parameters was deemed to be unacceptable if only realisations using the same soil parameters are used then calibration to soil moisture does not provide any constraint on groundwater recharge this is attributed to the narrow variation in soil moisture content relative to the measurement error fig 7 the et time series was used to constrain the recharge range in the same manner as the soil moisture time series as the mean and the standard deviation of the synthetic data are 0 546 and 0 503mm d respectively we used half of the standard deviation 0 252 half of the coefficient of variation 0 46 and 0 5as cut off values for rmse mre and r2 respectively as explained in the methods section the monte carlo simulations produced a range of values for fit statistics and we examined the relationships between these and recharge fig 10 the plausible range of recharge resulting from the combination of the fit statistics is between 33 and 113mm y et fig 9 and the number of acceptable models is 2107 et of test case 1 table 3 the et produced a narrower range of recharge than the soil moisture in this specific test case when both the soil moisture and et were used together to calibrate the model the recharge range was not significantly reduced from that produced from calibration to et alone θ et fig 9 however the number of acceptable models reduced to 1543 θ et of test case 1 table 3 clearly in this synthetic scenario the recharge range was narrowed from 7 236mm y to 33 113mm y through data fitting as shown in fig 7 both the cases producing 33 and 113mm y recharge can fit the synthetic time series equally well in order to investigate whether the ability of data fitting to reduce recharge uncertainty is dependent on the base case chosen the data fitting process was repeated twice using different base cases the first base case produced a recharge range of 34 119mm y fig 11 a whereas the second base case yielded a recharge range of 26 145mm y fig 11b as with test case 1 both the test cases here also show the decrease in the number of acceptable models as we used different datasets for model calibration test cases 2 and 3 table 3 although it is clear that model calibration will usually be able to reduce the uncertainty of recharge the degree of uncertainty reduction is expected to be correlated with the potential error of a dataset used for calibration to investigate this we repeated the calibration to et but with varying the error associated with the data thus if the error on the et dataset is increased from 10 to 30 the range in estimated recharge increases from 33 113 to 22 236mm y fig 12 the recharge range narrows steadily as the error decreases and for a 5 error in et the recharge range becomes 37 111mm y 5 discussion water and energy balance models are useful to address climate change impacts on ecohydrology for the purpose of estimating recharge such models may have large uncertainty as demonstrated in this study using the waves model the challenge in using the waves model to estimate recharge lies in the reliable determination of parameters there were 26 parameters and 4 soil hydraulic parameters required by the waves model the uncertainties of these parameters resulted in the large uncertainty range of the long term average groundwater recharge through several hypothetical cases however we demonstrated that the groundwater recharge uncertainty could be narrowed down by fitting commonly measured variables such as et but not soil moisture content whether the recharge rates estimated from the calibrated models are sufficiently accurate will depend on the uncertainty of the calibration data and the purpose of the investigation 5 1 soil hydraulic properties pedotransfer functions are often used to translate soil texture information to soil hydraulic parameters in unsaturated zone modelling hohenbrink and lischeid 2014 wang et al 2015 a large number of pedotransfer functions are available vereecken et al 2010 with the rosetta program being the most widely used schaap et al 2001 however most pedotransfer functions were developed to yield retention curve parameters only and some of them require soil particle distribution that we do not possess in the end four sets of pedotransfer functions were employed to infer both retention curve parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity dane and puckett 1992 saxton et al 1986 wösten et al 1999 and schaap et al 2001 we discovered that different pedotransfer functions resulted in differences in soil hydraulic properties table 1 different groups of soil hydraulic properties resulted in the different ranges of recharge estimates fig 6 the combination of these different groups of soil hydraulic properties led to the large uncertainty range of recharge this conclusion is in accord with results from previous investigations that have concluded that different pedotransfer functions can result in up to an order of magnitude difference in recharge estimates faust et al 2006 the large uncertainty in recharge was more likely caused by the combination of large ks and small difference between θs and θr for both the topsoil and subsoil see pedo4 in table 1 this is because the small difference between θs and θr allows the soil to reach saturation with only a small amount of water and the large ks permits fast transmission of water in the soil for a semi arid environment with limited precipitation reaching saturation faster will allow water to infiltrate through the root zone faster and hence will result in more deep drainage this important information was not reflected by the sensitivity analysis as the two parameters were treated as independent parameters this suggests that even if we cannot determine θs and θr precisely efforts should be devoted to reduce the uncertainty of the difference between these two parameters in comparison the sensitivity analysis showed ks is indeed important this parameter can be determined through several techniques such as pumping tests and slug tests however it often ranges over several orders of magnitude to reduce the uncertainty of soil hydraulic properties it is best to develop pedotransfer functions for the study region wösten et al 2001 concluded that pedotransfer functions are better used for making predictions for the area where the soils were sampled to derive the functions at the scale of this study it may seem feasible to develop our own pedotransfer functions however at regional scales e g crosbie et al 2010 or when a project is time and budget limited the development of pedotransfer functions does not seem practical hence many studies tend to seek established pedotransfer functions to save time and budget cornelis et al 2001 sobieraj et al 2001 to select the most appropriate pedotransfer functions field observations such as soil moisture may also be helpful because different pedotransfer functions may correlate to different soil moisture variations in our study we attempted to directly reduce recharge uncertainty by fitting modelled to synthetic moisture content time series the modelling showed only those models that use the same group of soil hydraulic parameters as that generated the synthetic time series were acceptable while in reality observed moisture content may not inform us the exact pedotransfer function it should be able to indicate which one is most probable 5 2 vegetation parameters in this study we adopted the vegetation parameter ranges from the waves manual with slight adjustment many parameters for specific plants can be measured in the field or in the lab as we attempted to cover the category of c3 annual pasture instead of a specific plant at the regional scale our approach was deemed appropriate and the parameter ranges were reasonable this is a common practice in many water and energy balance models classifying the terrestrial biosphere into limited number of plant functional types grace and williams 2004 however the uncertainty range of groundwater recharge is likely to be large due to the uncertainty in different parameters to reduce the uncertainty of recharge the first approach is to reduce the uncertainties of several important vegetation parameters a sensitivity analysis can be undertaken to identify these parameters e g amax kr and k in fig 5 and dedicate relevant efforts to improve measurements similar to soil hydraulic properties this is only feasible at point scales i e for individual plant species at large scales plant functional types e g annual perennial evergreen and deciduous are usually used each plant functional type includes many different plant species estimating parameters for a plant functional type would require a large number of measurements for all the different species more importantly there is no guarantee of lowering parameter uncertainty given the large number of plant species hence the scope of reducing parameter uncertainty directly is very limited the second approach is to directly reduce uncertainty of recharge by comparing to available observations as shown in fig 9 and fig 11 et narrowed the recharge down whereas in our example soil moisture did not et is helpful because water and energy balance models essentially compute groundwater recharge as the residual of a water balance where et is further constrained by solving a simultaneous energy balance with the availability of climate data and large scale satellite measurements of energy balance proxies reducing recharge uncertainty with independent et estimates is a reasonable approach soil moisture was not helpful in our study because the assumed 10 error of moisture content is large relative to the temporal variation however soil moisture may be of more use in other soil types where temporal variations in water content may be more pronounced 5 3 comparison to other water balance models most soil water balance models treat potential et as an input along with rainfall de vries and simmers 2002 pointed out that recharge is usually smaller than the uncertainty range of et and so the estimated recharge is very uncertain in comparison water and energy balance models such as waves used in this study directly computes et in accordance with atmospheric and canopy conditions the et measurements are used to constrain water and energy balance models fig 10 this direct calculation of et is beneficial to situations where et measurements are limited of course our analysis also indicates that the uncertainty of datasets used for model calibration impacts on the uncertainty of recharge fig 12 shows that the reduction of et uncertainty can greatly reduce the uncertainty of recharge a large number of water and energy balance models have been developed depending on the purposes the complexity of these water and energy balance models and relevant equations used may differ nevertheless all water and energy balance models simulate point scale processes i e transfer of heat and water occurs in the vertical direction hence control points are usually needed to estimate recharge at point scales which are up scaled to the relevant region using simple upscaling methods healy 2012 crosbie et al 2013 although the use of water and energy balance models to estimate groundwater recharge is conceptually similar to simple soil water balance models these water and energy balance models require a large number of parameters as discussed above and as a consequence increase the number of uncertainty sources whether this complexity is necessary for estimating groundwater recharge requires further assessment moreover many water and energy balance models treat the unsaturated zone as several buckets at different depths rather than solving richards equation to obtain vertical distribution of moisture content as waves this treatment makes it hard to use soil moisture measured at specific depths to constrain models hence the choice of a model needs to be based on the objective of a project and availability of datasets as pointed out by alley 1984 gee and hillel 1988 and sorensen et al 2014 models that treat soil layers as several reservoirs are likely to produce differing recharge estimates because of different approaches used for water budget partitioning sorensen et al 2014 demonstrated that soil moisture data alone are unable to constrain groundwater recharge in four commonly used water balance models consistent with our study 6 conclusions water and energy balance models have become increasingly popular for estimating groundwater recharge this is because these models attempt to simulate several balances water energy and carbon at the same time and the additional balances are thought to constrain the water balance however the inclusion of the additional balances also introduce additional parameters that carry different degrees of uncertainty and likely complicate the estimation of recharge this study is aimed to examine the uncertainty of groundwater recharge estimated from a typical water and energy balance model the results showed that uncalibrated models have large uncertainty in recharge however for model calibration soil moisture time series may not offer much help for constraining models and reducing recharge uncertainty whereas et time series are able to reduce recharge uncertainty by more than 50 the ability of a data time series to constrain models is dependent on its uncertainty relative to the magnitude of its temporal variation acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the murray darling basin authority for the financial support for this project this

7323,coupled water and energy balance models have become increasingly popular for estimating groundwater recharge because of the integration of energy and water balances and sometimes carbon balance the additional balances are thought to constrain the water balance and as a result should help reduce the uncertainty of groundwater recharge however these models usually have a large number of parameters the uncertainty of these parameters may result in a large uncertainty in groundwater recharge estimates this study aims to assess the potential uncertainty of groundwater recharge estimated from a widely used water and energy model it is largely based on annual pasture vegetation in the lower part of the campaspe catchment in southeast australia a monte carlo analysis method was employed to examine potential uncertainties introduced by different types of errors the results show that for a mean rainfall of 398mm y and using a particular set of pedotransfer functions for deriving soil hydraulic parameters the estimated recharge ranged from 7 to 144mm y due to the uncertainty in vegetation parameters this upper bound of the recharge range increased to 236mm y when using different sets of pedotransfer functions through several synthetic test cases this study shows that soil moisture time series may not offer much help for reducing recharge uncertainty whereas evapotranspiration time series are able to reduce recharge uncertainty by more than 50 the reduction in recharge uncertainty steadily improves as the uncertainty in observations reduces keywords groundwater recharge soil water balance water and energy balance model uncertainty analysis 1 introduction groundwater recharge plays a significant role in water resources management in particular in arid and semi arid regions scanlon et al 2006 often groundwater recharge is used to determine the allocation of groundwater extraction based on the principle that the extraction should not exceed the recharge although the relationship between allocation and recharge has been criticised e g bredehoeft 1997 2002 gorelick and zheng 2015 zhou 2009 the practice is still common throughout the world e g chung et al 2016 devlin and sophocleous 2005 many methods have been developed to estimate groundwater recharge with the soil water balance method probably the most widely used and perhaps the most straightforward allison et al 1994 healy and cook 2002 scanlon et al 2002 a large number of soil water balance models have been developed and these can be broadly classified into bucket models and physically based models the bucket models treat the soil as a reservoir that is filled up by precipitation and emptied by evapotranspiration zhang et al 2002 recharge occurs when the reservoir overflows numerous variants of bucket models exist depending on the conceptualisation of the system and methods for estimating evapotranspiration alley 1984 dripps and bradbury 2007 finch 1998 jie et al 2011 kendy et al 2003 ruiz et al 2010 rushton and ward 1979 westenbroek et al 2010 zhang and hiscock 2010 these models are computationally efficient and so have been used over large areas xu 1997 xu and singh 1998 in comparison physically based soil water balance models have to solve richards equation to obtain the spatial distribution of soil moisture content chen et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 kurtzman and scanlon 2011 turkeltaub et al 2015 the computational burden and the difficulty to achieve numerical convergence restrict physically based models to be mostly used for assessing local scale hydrological process and quantifying relevant fluxes water and energy balance models are essentially water balance models capable of simulating the water and energy balances simultaneously e g akkermans et al 2012 petropoulos et al 2009 sellers et al 1986 williams et al 1996 zhang and dawes 1998 because of their additional capacity to simulate the energy balance these models are considered superior to water balance only models for computing evapotranspiration overgaard et al 2006 potential groundwater recharge which is the rate of soil water drainage below a given depth is a water budget component that is produced from all water and energy balance models the use of water and energy balance models to estimate potential groundwater recharge in australia started from the need to address the response of potential recharge to land use changes zhang et al 1999 and climate change crosbie et al 2010 mccallum et al 2010 the water atmosphere vegetation energy and solutes model waves was the model used zhang and dawes 1998 since then the waves model has been applied in many areas to assess groundwater recharge crosbie et al 2012 2013 models are usually calibrated to different observations including streamflow soil moisture evapotranspiration and modis leaf area index chen et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 zhang et al 1999 conceptually models which are more complex and include a larger number of physical processes should be more accurate than overly simple models that neglect critical processes although this may depend on the uncertainty associated with calibration data and model parameters this is because simple models have large structural errors and estimating parameter values based on soft knowledge is often better than neglecting processes entirely water and energy balance models may help to better constrain the water balance with the energy and carbon balances in comparison to pure water balance models as these additional balances constrain evapotranspiration et for example et is influenced by net radiation air temperature vapour pressure deficit aerodynamic resistance and canopy resistance canopy resistance is a function of relative availability of water and light carbon assimilation rate leaf area index although the accuracy of water balance models for estimating groundwater recharge has been questioned in a number of studies e g alley 1984 gee and hillel 1988 there are still very few examples of where formal uncertainty analysis has accompanied estimates of recharge obtained with such models even for simple models with few parameter values giambelluca et al 1996 lanini and caballero 2016 it is clear that models that are calibrated to field data should also have less uncertainty than uncalibrated models although calibration data can be difficult to obtain and or site specific nevertheless it is not uncommon to predict recharge using models without any formal calibration e g dash et al 2016 crosbie et al 2010 2013 rushton et al 2006 taylor and howard 1996 the objectives of this study were to examine the uncertainty of groundwater recharge estimated from a water and energy balance model that has been widely used around the world and also to provide suggestions for reducing uncertainty when using this type of model the intention was not to exhaust all the possible scenarios but rather to address this issue through a synthetic example largely based on a field site in southeast australia we built a model in a similar manner to that described in crosbie et al 2010 to represent typical land use c3 annual pasture or dryland pasture in this study in a semi arid area a monte carlo approach was adopted to examine potential uncertainty using latin hypercube sampling we then explored whether field observations such as soil moisture and evapotranspiration could be employed to reduce recharge uncertainty 2 field site description this study is loosely based on the lower part of the campaspe catchment in southeast australia fig 1 we chose the annual pasture in this area as our vegetation the intention of this study was not to produce recharge estimates across the entire region rather we aimed to illustrate potential recharge uncertainty estimated from a water and energy balance model using a demonstrative example the northern part of the catchment includes the floodplains of the campaspe and murray rivers as so is very flat the top soil over this region largely falls in the category of sodosols according to the australian soil classification system isbell 1996 two aquifers occur in this area an unconfined sand clay interbedded aquifer and a semi confined sandy aquifer the water table in the unconfined aquifer is generally 10 15m below ground whereas the piezometric surface in the confined aquifer is lower than the water table therefore there is a general trend of downward flow from the unconfined aquifer to the confined aquifer the long term average precipitation is about 400mm y whereas the long term average potential evapotranspiration et is 1600mm y 2006 2016 rainfall occurs episodically throughout the year with monthly rainfall about 1 3 higher in the months from may to october around 40mm than in other months however extreme rainfall events can occur at any time in comparison potential et has a clear seasonal trend it peaks at around 12mm d in the summer months december to february and is around 1mm d in the winter months june to august the majority of the catchment has been cultivated for farming dryland crops dryland pasture and irrigated crops account for 6 69 and 8 of the total catchment area respectively this study has focused on dryland pasture c3 annual pasture which belongs to the plant functional type of grass as this is the dominant vegetation type in the catchment 3

back to the atmosphere for any time step waves first performs the calculation of the carbon balance in order to derive the canopy carbon assimilation rate the carbon assimilation rate is then distributed to leaves stems and roots based on factors such as water availability respiration rates and leaf mortality rates then waves carries out the calculation of the energy balance in order to obtain the et rate through the penman monteith equation this et rate is distributed to different depths of the root zone by considering a number of factors such as root carbon mass soil water matric potential osmotic potential root salt sensitivity factor and permanent wilting point next waves iteratively solves the richards equation to achieve numerical convergence excess water above ground due to limited infiltration and saturation capacity becomes overland flow this excess water above ground is removed from the model by default excess water draining through the soil continuum will become groundwater recharge a detailed description of the methodology used by waves and its numerical implementation is thoroughly documented by zhang and dawes 1998 3 2 data collection and analysis three types of data were collected for running the waves model these include climate variables on a daily time step soil attribute data for deriving soil hydraulic parameters and vegetation parameters historical daily climate data was extracted from the gridded climate surfaces provided by the queensland department of natural resources and water jeffrey et al 2001 the dataset contains all the common variables measured at a weather station including rainfall temperature solar radiation pan evaporation vapour pressure and humidity for 127years the variable vapour pressure deficit was derived from temperature and measured vapour pressure in accordance with grayso et al 1998 soil hydraulic parameters were derived from soil attribute raster datasets accessed from the terrestrial ecosystem research network tern http www tern org au the tern provides a range of australia wide soil attributes e g clay content silt content sand content at 6 depth intervals 0 0 05m 0 05 0 15m 0 15 0 3m 0 3 0 6m 0 6 1 0m and 1 0 2 0m the top 0 3m and the depth range of 0 3 2 0m were treated as topsoil and subsoil respectively we considered both topsoil and subsoil in order to account for the fact that topsoil is usually more permeable than subsoil because of its richness in organic matters this treatment rendered the subsurface structure of the waves model consistent with previous studies e g crosbie et al 2010 2012 then we averaged the clay content of both the topsoil and subsoil to create a clay content map on the map grid cells with clay content lower than the median value are classified as soil group 1 the remaining grid cells are classified as soil group 2 this resulted in a soil group map as shown in fig 1 we used clay content to determine soil groups as increases in clay content lead to decreases in permeability and increases in water holding capacity and hence increases in deep drainage kennett smith et al 1994 wohling et al 2012 the second soil group was chosen to examine the uncertainty of recharge the soil attribute values were used to calculate the soil moisture characteristic curves at discrete points through pedotransfer functions ideally a specific pedotransfer function should be derived from field measurements for the study area however this was not possible due to the size of the catchment and paucity of data minasny et al 1999 derived a pedotransfer function for australia but this function was not useful in this study because it requires soil particle size data which was not available for the field site moreover most studies only have pedotransfer functions for either soil moisture characteristic curves or saturated hydraulic conductivity instead of both ultimately four sets of pedotransfer functions that are capable of deriving both soil moisture characteristic curves and saturated hydraulic conductivity parameters from the same soil data were selected from the literature i e dane and puckett 1992 saxton et al 1986 wösten et al 1999 schaap et al 2001 as waves uses the broadbridge white soil retention model broadbridge and white 1998 we derived retention curve parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity from the four sets of pedotransfer functions table 1 for both topsoil and subsoil it is clear that all the parameters except c are very different from one group to another indicating the difference between the pedotransfer functions all the pedotransfer functions yielded c fixed at 10 because this parameter relates to the slope of the moisture characteristic at satiation in this study we chose c3 annual pasture as the vegetation because it is the dominant vegetation type in the catchment waves requires 26 parameters for a type of vegetation dawes et al 1998 conducted a comprehensive literature review of vegetation parameters and compiled a table of all parameters with upper and lower bounds for several different vegetation types these uncertainties reflect the accuracy of estimation without field measurement when using a biophysically based model at the regional scale it is not possible to measure field scale parameters in this study the uncertainty ranges of most vegetation parameters were taken from the table in dawes et al 1998 only a few parameter ranges were modified after a brief literature review to better reflect c3 annual pasture in a semi arid environment in southeast australia these modified parameters are indicated in table 2 3 3 model setup and recharge assessment waves requires discretisation of the unsaturated zone in order to solve the richards equation in this study the model was set up to be 4m in depth with the top of the model representing the land surface at the depth of 4m both soil evaporation and plant transpiration should become negligible given the maximum rooting depth of 1 5m table 2 and the average water table depth of 10 15m hence deep drainage can be assumed to equal actual groundwater recharge the bottom of the model was specified with a free drainage boundary condition the model was discretised into 58 elements with the elemental size increasing from 0 001m near the top to 0 05m at a depth of 0 4m from 0 4m to 4m a constant elemental size of 0 1m was used the top 0 3m was assumed to be the topsoil whereas the remaining soil layer comprised the subsoil the initial matric potential was assumed to be uniform at 100m and the initial root carbon mass was assumed to be 0 002kg m2 at all nodes the initial leaf carbon was set at 0 05kg m2 and the stem carbon was 0 5km m2 because we do not know the exact initial conditions it takes some time for the model to spin up to the equilibrium state we assessed the time for leaf area index to reach its long term trend in several selected model realisations our assessment suggests that the spin up time is only several years in those selected model realisations given the stochastic nature of this study it is impossible to examine the spin up time for all model realisations as the period for simulation was 127years starting from 1889 first year data is available we chose the last 50years to calculate the long term average groundwater recharge and left the first 77years for the model to spin up such a long time should allow any model realisation to reach its equilibrium state the input vegetation parameters were sampled from the parameter ranges listed in table 2 using the monte carlo approach the latin hypercube sampling technique was used to perform stratified sampling of all parameters which ensured the reasonable distribution of samples over a sampling space in comparison to simple monte carlo sampling this stratified sampling approach requires less realisations to describe a probability distribution given the large number of uncertain parameters 40 000 realisations were generated to yield 40 000 recharge estimates i e 10 000 realisations for each group of soil hydraulic parameters in theory the number of realisations should be dependent on the particular case to ensure ergodic statistics in this study we chose 40 000 realisations based on the computational power we could access and this number is more likely to capture many important parameter sets than a smaller number the soil hydraulic parameters were chosen from the four groups derived from four different sets of pedotransfer functions table 1 after sampling all parameters and variables were fed into the waves model to simulate daily drainage the long term mean groundwater recharge was estimated by taking the average of daily drainage over the past 50years i e 1966 2016 3 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis is useful for determining influential model parameters often an exhaustive assessment requires a number of sensitivity analysis methods to distinguish different groups of parameters i e parameters with negligible effects linear effects nonlinear and or interaction effects in this study the purpose of the sensitivity analysis was to improve qualitative understanding of those parameters rather than an exhaustive assessment hence we only carried out one sensitivity analysis the morris method was chosen to perform the sensitivity analysis morris 1991 saltelli et al 2008 this method normalises the parameter space to the multidimensional hypercube i e each dimension represents one parameter each dimension is divided into the same number of intervals which equals the number of scenarios for each scenario the morris method randomly decides the trajectory in the parameter space one measure μ mean of the elementary effects of a parameter i e the ratios of recharge change to parameter change is calculated for every parameter in this study we analysed the sensitivity of the vegetation parameters and soil hydraulic parameters the ranges of the vegetation parameters are the same as those in table 2 unlike the vegetation parameters the soil hydraulic parameters are not independent these parameters appear in groups as shown in table 2 as the sensitivity analysis requires parameter ranges we chose the subsoil in table 1 asan example and determined the ranges of the soil hydraulic parameters from the highest and lowest values hence the ranges for ks θs θr and λc are 0 00634 0 189m d 0 327 0 428 0 128 0 306 and 0 0428 0 296m respectively the parameter c is treated constant as it was estimated to be 10 from all the pedotransfer functions moreover our initial testing suggests recharge is also insensitive to c although we did not examine soil hydraulic parameters from different soil layers and soil groups the sensitivity analysis is still indicative of the importance of these soil hydraulic parameters in the model 3 5 model calibration we examined uncertainty in recharge using both uncalibrated and calibrated models fig 2 calibrated models use et and or soil moisture for calibration as these parameters have been most often used for model calibration in the literature chen et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 kendy et al 2003 soil moisture content can be easily measured by installing moisture sensors at depth of interest evapotranspiration can be inferred from meteorological data or from satellite imagery hence in this study we also attempt to evaluate whether soil moisture content and evapotranspiration time series can reduce recharge uncertainty in order to produce generalised results the soil moisture and et data were obtained from one realisation with parameters randomly sampled fig 2 in this study we only extracted the last 10years of the time series produced from the specific realisation as our experience indicates that it is rare to have more than 10years of field data the synthetic time series was then treated as observations for model calibration to account for observational uncertainty arising from human errors equipment errors or analysis errors we added 10 error to the synthetic time series shown as upper and lower bounds in fig 3 this is towards the lower level of et measurement errors reported in the literature glenn et al 2011 congruent information for soil moisture does not exist although in our judgement 10 represents a reasonable estimate of uncertainty involved in field sampling and analysis for soil moisture e g different sensor types local scale soil heterogeneity and operational errors to allow for consistent framework and quantitative comparison we therefore applied the same percent error to soil moisture we therefore consider a model fitting error to occur only when the simulated value differs from the original value by more than 10 fig 3 goodness of fit can be examined using statistical variables these include 1 root mean squared error rmse a measure of the average differences between modelled results and observed results smaller rmse indicates better prediction of the model 2 mean relative error mre a measure of the bias of the modelled results compared to observed ones mre 0 is a sign of model over prediction and mre 0 signals model under prediction 3 coefficient of determination r2 a measure of the agreement between observed and modelled results high r2 indicates strong goodness of fit whereas low r2 suggests weak model fitting to measured results the formulae are 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 2 mre 1 n i 1 n p i o i o i 3 r 2 i 1 n p i p o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where p i and o i are predicted and observed values respectively and p and o are average values of the predicted and observed time series respectively note that nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse is another metric that measures model sensitivity to outliers because the similarity between nse and rmse nse was not included here criteria must be used to determine acceptable models in this study we first computed the mean and standard deviation of synthetic time series we then used half of the standard deviation as the cut off for rmse and 0 5 for r2 in accordance with moriasi et al 2007 the criteria provided by moriasi et al 2007 were based on a thorough review of catchment modelling studies in addition we used half of the coefficient of variation the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean for mre in order to link it to observations i e baseline data in this study a model is deemed as acceptable only if all the three fit statistics meet their criteria at the same time although there is general guidance in the literature the choice of cut off criteria is still subjective 4 results 4 1 a demonstrative example fig 4 shows the partitioning of the water input i e rainfall into several different water budget components over a period of 10years the long term average rainfall was 398mm y most rain was less than 40mm d and fell between june and august heavy rain as much as 60mm d or more occurred in some years the average interception rate was 118mm y about 30 of the rainfall with the average leaf area index of 0 801 this interception rate is reasonable as the study area is semi arid and most rainfall is below 20mm d clark 1940 showed that wheat functionally same as annual pasture can intercept more than 33 of rainfall when rainfall is less than 1 48inches d i e 38mm d any water that was not intercepted by leaves would reach the ground and undergo further partitioning heavy rainfall tended to cause overland flow especially when the rainfall exceeded about 20mm d the average overland flow rate was 36mm y once the water entered the soil it migrated through the soil pores to increase the soil moisture storage where a large part of the water was transpired back to the atmosphere by the plant through the stomata or drained through the root zone to recharge the underlying groundwater the mean et rate was about 183mm y accounting for 45 of the rainfall note that this et value only comprised soil evaporation and plant transpiration the total et is 301mm y as it also includes canopy evaporation i e rainfall interception the deep drainage through the root zone is the source of groundwater recharge the long term average drainage 61mm y accounted for 15 of the rainfall the drainage also exhibits a strong annual variation in addition to seasonal variation for example between the 3rd and 4th years the recharge was relatively low and steady at approximately 0 1mm d whereas the recharge spiked to 1 7mm d in the 9th year the highest annual recharge occurred in the 6th year 162mm y whereas the lowest was in the 4th year 17mm y 4 2 sensitivity analysis the morris sensitivity analysis suggests that maximum carbon assimilation rate amax saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and saturated water content θs and residual water content θr play more important roles than other parameters because of the higher mean values of the elementary effects fig 5 amax is important as it affects the actual carbon assimilation rate which impacts on stomatal conductance the other three important parameters ks θs and θr determine the capability of soil to transmit or retain soil water it is not surprising that these parameters are important the next set of important parameters include rainfall interception coefficient kr light extinction coefficient k saturation light intensity lsat leaf respiration rate lrate leaf mortality rate mrate and above ground partitioning factor β kr determines how much rainfall will be intercepted by leaves and hence impacts on the availability of water reaching the ground similarly k affects the distribution of solar radiation and longwave radiation at different layers which are the energy sources for evapotranspiration the other four parameters lsat lrate mrate and β play important roles in plant growth 4 3 recharge uncertainty as with the demonstrative example we generated 10 000 realisations by randomly sampling all the vegetation parameters all the 10 000 realisations share the same climate inputs and use the same set of soil hydraulic parameters as those in the demonstrative example 30 000 realisations were run later for the other three sets of soil hydraulic parameters 10 000 realisations produced 10 000 values of long term mean groundwater recharge note that the recharge produced from these realisations is direct output from waves without model calibration as shown in fig 6 pedo1 the possible recharge range is between 7 and 144mm y with the mean recharge at 66mm y fig 6 also shows the differences in the recharge distributions and statistics between the four sets of pedotransfer functions pedo2 and pedo3 resulted in quite similar recharge ranges 7 80mm y whereas the last set of pedotransfer functions produced a much wider range 10 240mm y the t test suggests that the difference in mean recharge is statistically significant between any two groups the much wider recharge range in the fourth set of pedotransfer functions is attributed to the larger saturated hydraulic conductivity and the larger residual water content using the rosetta program schaap et al 2001 because of the fourth set of pedotransfer functions the overall recharge range increased from 7 144mm y to 7 236mm y the upper bound of the recharge range has increased by 92mm y the 236mm y for recharge was for an extreme parameter combination e g high ks small difference between θs and θr low amax such a high recharge value is unlikely to be realistic for a semi arid environment and the probability for it to occur is very low the large range of recharge estimates in fig 6 indicates that this method is unlikely to produce highly constrained recharge that can be confidently used by water resources managers note that we present several recharge statistics in fig 6b and several following figures but our analysis throughout this study is focused on the complete recharge range i e the range between minimum and maximum values rather than 5 95 percentiles or 25 75 percentiles 4 4 model calibration to test our hypothesis that additional datasets may help to reduce recharge uncertainty we chose a single realisation as a base case to generate a moisture content time series at the 0 6m depth and et time series both moisture content and et time series are used to calibrate the waves models in order to produce constrained recharge estimates note that the choice of 0 6m for the moisture content is subjective any other depths could also be used to perform this analysis as the depth of 0 3m is defined as the interface between topsoil and subsoil this 0 6m depth is located in the subsoil the two time series for the last 10years were extracted and modified by adding lower and upper error bounds 10 of the actual values as outlined in the methods section the synthetic curves in fig 7 show the error bounds of the moisture content and the et time series for the last 10years it should also be noted that the synthetic et time series in the following analysis only includes soil evaporation and plant transpiration actual et measurements should also include rainfall interception by canopies given a theoretical study the use of et time series without including rainfall interception is not expected to have a significant impact on the conclusions fig 7 also shows the modelled moisture content and et from three different model realisations using different parameter values these three model realisations produce different groundwater recharge but they all provide a reasonable fit to the data produced from the base case as can be seen the overall fitting for both moisture content and et was quite reasonable take model 1 for example rmse mre and r2 for soil moisture are 0 0 0 0 and 1 0 respectively considering the error bounds fig 7a and rmse mre and r2 for et are 0 207mm d 0 247 and 0 856 respectively the quantitative measures indicate the fitting is better for moisture content than for et consistent with the qualitative inspection this process of data fitting was carried out 40 000 times each fit statistic can be used to determine the plausible range of the recharge by examining the relationship between the statistic and the recharge fig 8 for rmse and mre the data points were separated into 3 4 clusters and spread in a similar fashion to the relevant recharge distribution in fig 6 the spreading was likely caused by relatively stable moisture content i e moisture content stabilises at the residual moisture content for more than half of the time as shown in fig 7 this is because our synthetic dataset was generated by using one of the four groups of the soil hydraulic parameters the other three groups of the soil hydraulic parameters seem to produce different soil moisture results regardless of vegetation parameters as the mean and the standard deviation of the synthetic data are 0 248 and 0 015 respectively we used half of the standard deviation 0 007 half of the coefficient of variation 0 03 and 0 5as the cut off values for rmse mre and r2 respectively as explained in the methods section a model is acceptable only if the three fit statistics meet their cut off criteria at the same time hence the final recharge range is 7 144mm y θ fig 9 with 9999 acceptable models θ of test case 1 table 3 nearly half of the range without data fitting however as shown on the right panel of fig 8 the acceptable models are from the same cluster these acceptable models used the same group of soil hydraulic parameters as the base case that produced the synthetic time series and only one of the 10 000 realisations that used these soil parameters was deemed to be unacceptable if only realisations using the same soil parameters are used then calibration to soil moisture does not provide any constraint on groundwater recharge this is attributed to the narrow variation in soil moisture content relative to the measurement error fig 7 the et time series was used to constrain the recharge range in the same manner as the soil moisture time series as the mean and the standard deviation of the synthetic data are 0 546 and 0 503mm d respectively we used half of the standard deviation 0 252 half of the coefficient of variation 0 46 and 0 5as cut off values for rmse mre and r2 respectively as explained in the methods section the monte carlo simulations produced a range of values for fit statistics and we examined the relationships between these and recharge fig 10 the plausible range of recharge resulting from the combination of the fit statistics is between 33 and 113mm y et fig 9 and the number of acceptable models is 2107 et of test case 1 table 3 the et produced a narrower range of recharge than the soil moisture in this specific test case when both the soil moisture and et were used together to calibrate the model the recharge range was not significantly reduced from that produced from calibration to et alone θ et fig 9 however the number of acceptable models reduced to 1543 θ et of test case 1 table 3 clearly in this synthetic scenario the recharge range was narrowed from 7 236mm y to 33 113mm y through data fitting as shown in fig 7 both the cases producing 33 and 113mm y recharge can fit the synthetic time series equally well in order to investigate whether the ability of data fitting to reduce recharge uncertainty is dependent on the base case chosen the data fitting process was repeated twice using different base cases the first base case produced a recharge range of 34 119mm y fig 11 a whereas the second base case yielded a recharge range of 26 145mm y fig 11b as with test case 1 both the test cases here also show the decrease in the number of acceptable models as we used different datasets for model calibration test cases 2 and 3 table 3 although it is clear that model calibration will usually be able to reduce the uncertainty of recharge the degree of uncertainty reduction is expected to be correlated with the potential error of a dataset used for calibration to investigate this we repeated the calibration to et but with varying the error associated with the data thus if the error on the et dataset is increased from 10 to 30 the range in estimated recharge increases from 33 113 to 22 236mm y fig 12 the recharge range narrows steadily as the error decreases and for a 5 error in et the recharge range becomes 37 111mm y 5 discussion water and energy balance models are useful to address climate change impacts on ecohydrology for the purpose of estimating recharge such models may have large uncertainty as demonstrated in this study using the waves model the challenge in using the waves model to estimate recharge lies in the reliable determination of parameters there were 26 parameters and 4 soil hydraulic parameters required by the waves model the uncertainties of these parameters resulted in the large uncertainty range of the long term average groundwater recharge through several hypothetical cases however we demonstrated that the groundwater recharge uncertainty could be narrowed down by fitting commonly measured variables such as et but not soil moisture content whether the recharge rates estimated from the calibrated models are sufficiently accurate will depend on the uncertainty of the calibration data and the purpose of the investigation 5 1 soil hydraulic properties pedotransfer functions are often used to translate soil texture information to soil hydraulic parameters in unsaturated zone modelling hohenbrink and lischeid 2014 wang et al 2015 a large number of pedotransfer functions are available vereecken et al 2010 with the rosetta program being the most widely used schaap et al 2001 however most pedotransfer functions were developed to yield retention curve parameters only and some of them require soil particle distribution that we do not possess in the end four sets of pedotransfer functions were employed to infer both retention curve parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity dane and puckett 1992 saxton et al 1986 wösten et al 1999 and schaap et al 2001 we discovered that different pedotransfer functions resulted in differences in soil hydraulic properties table 1 different groups of soil hydraulic properties resulted in the different ranges of recharge estimates fig 6 the combination of these different groups of soil hydraulic properties led to the large uncertainty range of recharge this conclusion is in accord with results from previous investigations that have concluded that different pedotransfer functions can result in up to an order of magnitude difference in recharge estimates faust et al 2006 the large uncertainty in recharge was more likely caused by the combination of large ks and small difference between θs and θr for both the topsoil and subsoil see pedo4 in table 1 this is because the small difference between θs and θr allows the soil to reach saturation with only a small amount of water and the large ks permits fast transmission of water in the soil for a semi arid environment with limited precipitation reaching saturation faster will allow water to infiltrate through the root zone faster and hence will result in more deep drainage this important information was not reflected by the sensitivity analysis as the two parameters were treated as independent parameters this suggests that even if we cannot determine θs and θr precisely efforts should be devoted to reduce the uncertainty of the difference between these two parameters in comparison the sensitivity analysis showed ks is indeed important this parameter can be determined through several techniques such as pumping tests and slug tests however it often ranges over several orders of magnitude to reduce the uncertainty of soil hydraulic properties it is best to develop pedotransfer functions for the study region wösten et al 2001 concluded that pedotransfer functions are better used for making predictions for the area where the soils were sampled to derive the functions at the scale of this study it may seem feasible to develop our own pedotransfer functions however at regional scales e g crosbie et al 2010 or when a project is time and budget limited the development of pedotransfer functions does not seem practical hence many studies tend to seek established pedotransfer functions to save time and budget cornelis et al 2001 sobieraj et al 2001 to select the most appropriate pedotransfer functions field observations such as soil moisture may also be helpful because different pedotransfer functions may correlate to different soil moisture variations in our study we attempted to directly reduce recharge uncertainty by fitting modelled to synthetic moisture content time series the modelling showed only those models that use the same group of soil hydraulic parameters as that generated the synthetic time series were acceptable while in reality observed moisture content may not inform us the exact pedotransfer function it should be able to indicate which one is most probable 5 2 vegetation parameters in this study we adopted the vegetation parameter ranges from the waves manual with slight adjustment many parameters for specific plants can be measured in the field or in the lab as we attempted to cover the category of c3 annual pasture instead of a specific plant at the regional scale our approach was deemed appropriate and the parameter ranges were reasonable this is a common practice in many water and energy balance models classifying the terrestrial biosphere into limited number of plant functional types grace and williams 2004 however the uncertainty range of groundwater recharge is likely to be large due to the uncertainty in different parameters to reduce the uncertainty of recharge the first approach is to reduce the uncertainties of several important vegetation parameters a sensitivity analysis can be undertaken to identify these parameters e g amax kr and k in fig 5 and dedicate relevant efforts to improve measurements similar to soil hydraulic properties this is only feasible at point scales i e for individual plant species at large scales plant functional types e g annual perennial evergreen and deciduous are usually used each plant functional type includes many different plant species estimating parameters for a plant functional type would require a large number of measurements for all the different species more importantly there is no guarantee of lowering parameter uncertainty given the large number of plant species hence the scope of reducing parameter uncertainty directly is very limited the second approach is to directly reduce uncertainty of recharge by comparing to available observations as shown in fig 9 and fig 11 et narrowed the recharge down whereas in our example soil moisture did not et is helpful because water and energy balance models essentially compute groundwater recharge as the residual of a water balance where et is further constrained by solving a simultaneous energy balance with the availability of climate data and large scale satellite measurements of energy balance proxies reducing recharge uncertainty with independent et estimates is a reasonable approach soil moisture was not helpful in our study because the assumed 10 error of moisture content is large relative to the temporal variation however soil moisture may be of more use in other soil types where temporal variations in water content may be more pronounced 5 3 comparison to other water balance models most soil water balance models treat potential et as an input along with rainfall de vries and simmers 2002 pointed out that recharge is usually smaller than the uncertainty range of et and so the estimated recharge is very uncertain in comparison water and energy balance models such as waves used in this study directly computes et in accordance with atmospheric and canopy conditions the et measurements are used to constrain water and energy balance models fig 10 this direct calculation of et is beneficial to situations where et measurements are limited of course our analysis also indicates that the uncertainty of datasets used for model calibration impacts on the uncertainty of recharge fig 12 shows that the reduction of et uncertainty can greatly reduce the uncertainty of recharge a large number of water and energy balance models have been developed depending on the purposes the complexity of these water and energy balance models and relevant equations used may differ nevertheless all water and energy balance models simulate point scale processes i e transfer of heat and water occurs in the vertical direction hence control points are usually needed to estimate recharge at point scales which are up scaled to the relevant region using simple upscaling methods healy 2012 crosbie et al 2013 although the use of water and energy balance models to estimate groundwater recharge is conceptually similar to simple soil water balance models these water and energy balance models require a large number of parameters as discussed above and as a consequence increase the number of uncertainty sources whether this complexity is necessary for estimating groundwater recharge requires further assessment moreover many water and energy balance models treat the unsaturated zone as several buckets at different depths rather than solving richards equation to obtain vertical distribution of moisture content as waves this treatment makes it hard to use soil moisture measured at specific depths to constrain models hence the choice of a model needs to be based on the objective of a project and availability of datasets as pointed out by alley 1984 gee and hillel 1988 and sorensen et al 2014 models that treat soil layers as several reservoirs are likely to produce differing recharge estimates because of different approaches used for water budget partitioning sorensen et al 2014 demonstrated that soil moisture data alone are unable to constrain groundwater recharge in four commonly used water balance models consistent with our study 6 conclusions water and energy balance models have become increasingly popular for estimating groundwater recharge this is because these models attempt to simulate several balances water energy and carbon at the same time and the additional balances are thought to constrain the water balance however the inclusion of the additional balances also introduce additional parameters that carry different degrees of uncertainty and likely complicate the estimation of recharge this study is aimed to examine the uncertainty of groundwater recharge estimated from a typical water and energy balance model the results showed that uncalibrated models have large uncertainty in recharge however for model calibration soil moisture time series may not offer much help for constraining models and reducing recharge uncertainty whereas et time series are able to reduce recharge uncertainty by more than 50 the ability of a data time series to constrain models is dependent on its uncertainty relative to the magnitude of its temporal variation acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the murray darling basin authority for the financial support for this project this

7324,increasing demand on groundwater resources motivates understanding of the controls on recharge dynamics so model predictions under current and future climate may improve here we address questions about the nonlinear behavior of flux variability in the vadose zone that may explain previously reported teleconnections between global scale climate variability and fluctuations in groundwater levels we use hundreds of hydrus 1d simulations in a sensitivity analysis approach to evaluate the damping depth of transient recharge over a range of periodic boundary conditions and vadose zone geometries and hydraulic parameters that are representative of aquifer systems of the conterminous united states u s although the models were parameterized based on u s aquifers findings from this study are applicable elsewhere that have mean recharge rates between 3 65 and 730mmyr 1 we find that mean infiltration flux period of time varying infiltration and hydraulic conductivity are statistically significant predictors of damping depth the resulting framework explains why some periodic infiltration fluxes associated with climate variability dampen with depth in the vadose zone resulting in steady state recharge while other periodic surface fluxes do not dampen with depth resulting in transient recharge we find that transient recharge in response to the climate variability patterns could be detected at the depths of water levels in most u s aquifers our findings indicate that the damping behavior of transient infiltration fluxes is linear across soil layers for a range of texture combinations the implications are that relatively simple homogeneous models of the vadose zone may provide reasonable estimates of the damping depth of climate varying transient recharge in some complex layered vadose zone profiles keywords recharge climate variability vadose zone damping linear superposition 1 introduction a growing number of studies report that groundwater levels can

levels also respond to groundwater pumping trends and variability largely on seasonal timescales gurdak 2017 this so called climate induced pumping has been detected on timescales ranging from less than one year russo and lall 2017 to scales consistent with the el niño southern oscillation enso gurdak et al 2007 these physical mechanisms have largely been inferred from statistical and spectral analysis of hydroclimatic time series e g gurdak et al 2007 hanson et al 2006 2004 holman et al 2011 kuss and gurdak 2014 russo and lall 2017 however teleconnections that have not been evaluated by mechanistic models may be limited for understanding and predicting groundwater responses to future climate increasing demands on groundwater resources from the water energy food nexus taniguchi et al 2017 and climate variability and change green et al 2011 taylor et al 2012 continues to raise the importance of understanding and accurately predicting current and future recharge meixner et al 2016 these predictions can be improved through a better understanding of the properties of the vadose zone that control a time varying recharge response to climate variability hunt et al 2008 such controls are poorly understood because of the nonlinear relations among unsaturated flow pressure water content and hydraulic diffusivity in the vadose zone dickinson et al 2014 these challenges are further compounded by a general lack of long term field observations of such variables from the vadose zone that are necessary to detect time varying recharge in response to climate variability on interannual to multidecadal timescales gurdak et al 2007 although recent studies have begun monitoring the vadose zone under different climate regimes and land use e g baram et al 2012 carrera hernandez et al 2011 strobach et al 2014 turkeltaub et al 2014 as noted by dickinson et al 2014 the nonlinear complexity of controls on transient recharge has often limited the direct representation of recharge in groundwater models and resource assessments which in many cases have assumed a long term steady state recharge flux under some conditions assigning a slowly varying or constant recharge flux in a groundwater model is justified because periodic or episodic variations in surface infiltration fluxes smooth out or dampens with depth prior to recharge dickinson et al 2014 however recent physically based modeling studies dickinson et al 2014 velasco et al 2015 and the previously mentioned studies that use time series and spectral analysis have identified some conditions where climate variability results in transient recharge fluxes that are not dampened within the vadose zone an improved ability to model recharge is relevant for improving prediction of groundwater response to future climate and the associated global to local scale management decisions and policy regarding sustainable groundwater famiglietti 2014 this is particularly needed for aquifers in semi arid and arid climates that often are in overdraft conditions have relatively thick vadose zones and are generally predicted to have less recharge and or more episodic recharge events under future climate change green et al 2011 taylor et al 2012 treidel et al 2012 to address this need requires a review of the state of understanding of coupled climate variability and vadose zone dynamics 1 1 climate variability the expected trends in many hydrologic processes including recharge rates and mechanisms due to human induced climate change particularly over the first half of the 21st century can only be fully appreciated when combined with understanding of the overprinted global scale climate variability the majority of climate change impact studies on recharge have largely focused on human induced climate change often using the approach of coupling downscaled climate data from global circulation models gcms that drive hydrologic models to estimate recharge rates and mechanisms under future climate change commonly by the middle to end of the 21st century green et al 2011 meixner et al 2016 taylor et al 2012 treidel et al 2012 the current generation of gcms project that mean climate across many regions of the globe will move to a state continuously beyond historical variability by the mid 21st century mora et al 2013 which will likely alter the frequency magnitude and other spatiotemporal characteristics of climate variability patterns stoner et al 2009 however the comparatively short term planning horizon often years to decades for most groundwater resource management decisions means that transient recharge in response to climate variability on interannual to multidecadal timescales has immediate and tangible implications for groundwater sustainability gurdak et al 2009 climate variability occurs on all temporal scales that extend beyond weather events and is defined as the difference between current climate conditions and the mean state over a larger temporal scale ghil 2002 climate variability is often characterized using indices that combine sea surface temperatures sea level pressures geo potential heights and wind speed among other atmosphere ocean variables ghil 2002 the indices that represent the six leading atmospheric ocean circulation systems that affect north american interannual to multidecadal climate variability include the atlantic teleconnection patterns the arctic oscillation ao north atlantic oscillation nao and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and the pacific teleconnection patterns enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo and pacific north american oscillation pna the most widely accepted quasi periodic cycles for these systems range from 1 70years including 6 12months ao 3 6years nao 50 70years amo 2 7years enso 15 30years pdo to 1 4years pna

skillfully recent analysis demonstrate some robust projections for how they may evolve through the 21st century such as changing in amplitude time scale and increasing the meteorological extremes with which they are associated chen et al 2017 zhang and delworth 2016 the atlantic and pacific teleconnections influence the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation air temperature drought snowpack and

tremblay et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2011 such variability in surface hydroclimatology is expected to influence time varying infiltration downward water flux in the vadose zone and ultimately recharge rates and mechanism gurdak et al 2007 hanson et al 2004 kuss and gurdak 2014 however the teleconnections patterns that exist in surface hydrologic processes are not necessarily the same as those preserved in the subsurface processes that affect groundwater levels velasco et al 2015 much of the subsurface hydrologic response is also a function of the hydraulic properties of the vadose zone dickinson et al 2014 1 2 vadose zone hydraulic properties and climate varying recharge recent research has begun to consider the properties of the vadose zone that may influence whether groundwater levels may respond to climate variability to investigate the role of the vadose zone these studies have focused on the relations between soil and water properties and periodic flow in the vadose zone that could be driven by climate variability bakker and nieber 2009 dickinson et al 2004 2014 pool and dickinson 2007 these relations become important when climatic forcings at the land surface can be damped in the vadose zone prior to reaching the water table velasco et al 2015 bakker and nieber 2009 derived an analytical solution to the richards equation for vertical one dimensional transient flow that was used to predict the movement of cyclical sinusoidally varying fluxes at the land surface where the infiltration can be assumed to be a function of precipitation and evaporation bakker and nieber 2009 found that flux variations damp with depth in the vadose zone such that beyond a certain depth referred as the damping depth d the flux could be approximated as steady bakker and nieber 2009 expanding on the work of bakker and nieber 2009 dickinson et al 2014 developed a screening tool for evaluating how variability of a cyclical infiltration pattern at the land surface was damped with depth in the vadose zone if the flow variability damped to within 5 of the original amplitude they stated that the assigned recharge in numerical groundwater flow models can be assumed to be steady however if 5 of the infiltration variability remained at the depth of the water table recharge is assumed to be transient dickinson et al 2014 assessed the sensitivity of the damping to vertical water fluxes typical of arid and semiarid regions where the periods of infiltration variability ranged from 1 to 365days in homogenous sand and clay the damping and damping depth was evaluated through comparisons with results from numerical simulations from the software hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 dickinson et al 2014 found that the analytical solution by bakker and nieber 2009 was most accurate for soil water conditions where the hydraulic diffusivity is relatively constant the hydraulic diffusivity is likely to be steady in fine soils when both the water content and flux variability are relatively small they found that the diffusivity can be highly variable in coarse soils such as sand when the amplitude of the flux variability and water content were relatively large dickinson et al 2014 found that the damping depth from the analytical solution bakker and nieber 2009 could be excessively large up to five times the damping depth from the numerical solution when the diffusivity was highly variable this overestimation of the numerical damping depth which is also an underestimation of the damping may result in mischaracterization of the damping properties of the vadose zone in their examples dickinson et al 2014 noted that regions of coarse soils in aquifers where recharge was likely to be steady could have been misidentified as having transient recharge their analysis was limited to homogeneous sand and clay soils and damping in layered soils with contrasting soil water properties was not assessed 1 3 objectives this paper addresses the knowledge gap of how physical processes of water flow in the vadose zone contribute to observed teleconnections between climate and groundwater levels by controlling transient recharge fluxes and mechanisms in response to climate variability here we systematically build on the findings of dickinson et al 2014 by using a sensitivity analysis approach to evaluate the damping of cyclical surface forcings in the vadose zone from hundreds of numerical hydrus 1d simulations over a range of periodic boundary conditions and vadose zone geometries and hydraulic parameters that are generally representative of aquifer systems of the conterminous united states u s we assess the damping properties of the vadose zone using a numerical approach that allows for a more accurate time varying hydraulic diffusivity than the approach by dickinson et al 2014 we use the results of this approach to address the following research questions how does soil texture in the vadose zone influence damping in homogeneous one layer and heterogeneous two layer systems what are the effects of layer thickness on damping depth d does the damping in two layers occur independently or does the presence of one layer impact the damping in the other layer if the damping is independent is linear superposition described in section 2 1 4 of the damping in separate layers a reasonable approximation which characteristics of the infiltration and soil water parameters have the most statistically significant influence on d by addressing these questions surrounding d we provide a framework that can be used to i interpret the physical processes underlying the teleconnections between climate variability patterns and fluctuations in groundwater levels and ii predict steady state versus transient recharge over a wide range of time varying infiltration fluxes periods and hydraulic properties of soil and vadose zone that is representative of u s aquifers 2 methods 2 1 numerical modeling numerical hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 simulations were used to evaluate the hydraulic properties and characteristics of the periodic net infiltration flux qz affecting the d and transient recharge in homogeneous one layer and heterogeneous two layer textural profiles of the vadose zone hydrus 1d is a computer program that solves the richards equation for saturated and unsaturated water flow in general two sets of hydrus 1d simulations were run one for homogeneous one layer profiles and one for heterogeneous two layer profiles this section describes the model conditions and parameters that were used in both sets of hydrus 1d simulations table 1 while the details about the homogeneous and heterogeneous simulations are described in the subsequent sections the boundary conditions to the hydrus 1d simulations were a periodic vertical net infiltration flux qz 0 l t 1 below the root zone at depth z 0 and free drainage and the gradient of total head is equal to 1 the flux qz 0 is a composite of a steady downward mean flux qs l t 1 and a sinusoidal transient component with mean amplitude qp l t 1 value and period p t fig 1 a the combined qs and qp components represents the net infiltration below the root zone that results from the infiltration of precipitation runoff and the uptake of water by evapotranspiration the components of qz can represent varying infiltration in diffuse recharge settings basin floors stream channels or areas of applied irrigation water where the steady component qs represents a long term mean flux and the periodic component qp represents the sum of episodic events and climate variations from the steady component for a real system where distributed recharge is characterized the sum of qs at all locations would equal the total discharge for our analysis the amplitude qp never exceeds the steady component of the flux qs bakker and nieber 2009 dickinson et al 2014 this results in a flux that is always positive in the downward direction the qs values were selected to represent long term 1971 2000 mean net recharge rates from a range of climate and land cover regions of the conterminous u s and were calculated as the difference between mean annual precipitation and mean annual evapotranspiration as reported by sanford and selnick 2013 table 2 this residual contains both recharge and runoff and may overestimate recharge in some areas table 3 summarizes the qs values used in the hydrus 1d simulations to represent different climate and land cover regions although the models were parameterized based on u s aquifers and climate findings from this study are applicable elsewhere that have mean recharge rates between 3 65 and 730mmyr 1 table 3 the amplitude of the sinusoidal flux component qp were set equal to 99 of each qs thus the flux is always downward and greater than zero table 3 a range of periods p were used in the hydrus 1d simulations to represent qz 0 variability on monthly 30day seasonal 90 and 180day and annual 365day timescales table 1 the 30day periods are used to represent synoptic scale meteorological systems while the 90 and 180day periods represent mediterranean monsoonal or other climates that have distinct wet and dry seasons in addition longer periods of 730 2 556 and 3 652days 2 7 and 10years table 1 were used in the simulations to represent qz 0 variability that is consistent with global scale climate patterns including pna 1 4years nao 3 6years and enso 2 7year cycles the hydrus 1d models were spun up for at least 20 periods to achieve oscillatory steady state conditions prior to evaluating the transient responses the hydrus 1d soil texture and hydraulic properties were parameterized using the 12 u s department of agriculture usda soil textural classes and the gardner 1958 and gardner kozeny mathias and butler 2006 bakker and nieber 2009 soil hydraulic models except for the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks values that were obtained from the rosetta soil catalog schaap et al 2001 table 4 the gardner α and gardner kozeny ɳ0 and µ parameter values table 4 were estimated by linear regression as detailed in dickinson et al 2014 and wraith and or 1998 2 1 1 homogeneous one layer profiles a total of 588 hydrus 1d simulations of homogeneous one layer profiles were run for all combinations of the 12 usda soil textures table 4 seven mean fluxes qs table 3 and seven periods p table 1 the model domain includes 1001 nodes with a vertical node spacing that is equal and sums to the specified bottom boundary of the model which included 10 20 and 100m table 1 the larger profile bottom boundary depths of 20 and 100m were used in simulations where the d exceeded the 10m profile depth the results of the homogeneous profile simulations were used as a guide to constrain the range of model conditions and parameters tested during the subsequent hydrus 1d simulations of heterogeneous two layer profiles 2 1 2 heterogeneous two layer profiles a total of 54 hydrus 1d simulations of heterogeneous two layer profiles were run for all layer combinations of three representative usda soil textures clay silt and loam table 1 one mean flux qs 1 00mmd 1 table 1 three periods p 30 90 and 365days table 1 and three relative thicknesses thin intermediate and thick of the upper layer in the two layered profile similar to the homogeneous simulations the model domain for the two layered profile included 1001 nodes with equal vertical node spacing over depths from 10m and 50m table 1 here we evaluate two layers to keep the problem tractable to better understand the behavior between layers the larger profile depth bottom boundary of 50m was used in simulations where the d exceeded the 10m profile depth here we establish the relative thickness thin intermediate and thick of the upper layer using quarter fractions of the d that resulted from the hydrus 1d simulations of the homogeneous one layer profiles fig 1b using this approach a relatively thin upper layer is 0 25d intermediate thick upper layer is 0 5d and relatively thick upper layer is 0 75d fig 1b this creates a set of three possible upper layer thicknesses for each of the two layered model domains table 1 once the thickness of the upper layer is established the remaining lower portion of the model domain is set as the lower layer therefore the thickness of the lower layer is a function of the upper layer thickness 2 1 3 vertically stacked homogeneous profiles the simulated damping depth from vertically stacked homogeneous profiles of flux variability fig 2 which is used to approximate the flux variability in two layers in a single simulation and help test for linearity and superposition see section 2 1 4 is calculated as follows first flow in the upper layer was simulated by hydrus 1d with a single homogeneous soil layer to represent the damping in an upper soil layer fig 2c next the qp from the bottom of the upper layer defines the input qp for the simulation of flow in a single homogeneous lower layer to represent a lower layer fig 2c and d the simulation of the homogeneous upper layer is similar to the description from section 2 1 in that the mean amplitude of the sinusoidal flux component qp at z 0 was set equal to 99 of the qs fig 2c however the separate simulation of the homogeneous lower layer fig 2d uses as input at z 0 the qp from the bottom of the homogeneous upper layer rather than being set equal to 99 of the qs finally the damping depth of the vertically stacked homogeneous profiles d shp fig 2c and d is calculated as 1 d shp z ul d ll where zul l is the relative thickness thin 0 25d intermediate 0 5d or thick 0 75d used in the simulation of the homogeneous upper layer and dll l is the damping depth simulated in the lower layer 2 1 4 testing for linearity and superposition we explore the approximation of linear superposition with respect to the damping depth d and the interactions between layered soil textures in the vadose zone if the assumption of linear superposition holds true we expect that adding the d from simulations of two separate homogeneous soil profiles should approximate the simulated d in a layered system of the same two soil textures the implications of linear superposition would enable using d behavior in homogeneous soil profiles to estimate d behavior and hence steady state and transient recharge in more complex layered soil profiles that are representative of natural vadose zones to test the linear superposition approximation we first simulate damping depths in heterogeneous two layer soil profiles d 2lp when the upper layer has different relative thicknesses thin intermediate and thick fig 2b that is we simulate flow in two layers in a single hydrus 1d model then we compare the d 2lp to the simulated damping depths from vertically stacked homogeneous profiles d shp fig 2c and d we consider the linear superposition approximation to be reasonably accurate if 2 d shp 10 d 2 lp where the damping depth from vertically stacked homogeneous profiles d shp is within 10 of the simulated damping depths in the heterogeneous two layer profiles d 2lp fig 2 illustrates an example where the d shp is 13 7 greater than the d 2lp and linear superposition may not be valid however the cases where eq 2 are true indicate that d is largely influenced by the hydraulic properties of the upper layer with relatively smaller influence by the hydraulic interactions between the layers or properties of the lower layer an important implication of the linear superposition assumption is that simple homogeneous models may provide reasonable estimates of d in more complex layered systems 2 2 significance testing we used the false discovery rate fdr technique benjamini and hochberg 1995 during the statistical significance testing to quantify the relative sensitivity of d to k qs and p the fdr p value adjustment efficiently controls for the rate of false positives among a large number of tests benjamini and hochberg 1995 the fdr p values p i fdr are computed as 3 p i fdr minimum p i 1 fdr m i p i where the independently calculated p values have an fdr adjusted p value that falls below α if the parameter is statistically significant at the 0 05 level benjamini and hochberg 1995 we used the fdr logworth transformation benjamini and hochberg 1995 to provide an appropriate scale for visualization where 4 log 10 fdr p value 1 3 log 10 0 05 1 3 a fdr logworth value 1 3 indicates significance at the 0 05 level we use the fdr logworth approach to reject the null hypothesis that the k qs and p do not influence d we also present the r2 values from the linear least squares model to evaluate the proportion of variation in d that is accounted for by the k qs and p 3 results and discussion the results and discussion are organized in two parts to address the research questions first we present results from the simulations of the homogenous one layer profiles and discuss how d is influenced by the hydraulic properties of the vadose zone and characteristics of the net infiltration flux qz second we present results from the simulations of the heterogeneous two layer profiles and vertically stacked homogeneous profiles and discuss how d is influenced by layer thickness layer interactions and the conditions where the assumption of linear superposition is valid 3 1 damping depth in homogenous one layer profiles d results from the simulations of homogeneous one layer profiles indicate that d is positively related to qs and p to illustrate this relation we show the simulated d for three representative soil textures clay silt and loam and ranges of qs 0 01 1 0mmd 1 and p 30 730days fig 3 the d associated with arid qs 0 01mmd 1 remains within the upper 2m even with p that is consistent with enso variability 730days fig 3 however the larger qs associated with semi arid 0 1mmd 1 and humid 1 0mmd 1 climates results in d that span from 1m under monthly and seasonal p 30 90days to 100m for p that is consistent with enso variability fig 3 the simulated d is similar in the clay silt and loam profiles even as qs and p increase fig 3 results from all simulations of homogeneous one layer profiles indicate that d spans more than four orders of magnitude from 0 1 to 1000m fig 4 the d exceeds 1000m in simulations using qs 0 05mmd 1 and p 2557d but those results are not shown here because the thickness of the vadose zone is generally 1000m in aquifers fan et al 2007 fig 4 illustrates three important positive relations the d generally increases as a function of increasing coarseness of soil texture and increasing qs and p which are findings that are generally consistent with dickinson et al 2014 the reader is referred to corona 2016 for tables of values used in fig 4 as the qs and p increase the sensitivity of d to the differences in hydraulic properties of the soil texture also increases particularly for the relatively coarser soil textures the implications of these results is that vadose zone sediment with greater sand content is likely to preserve transient recharge fluxes associated with climate variability especially those at greater qs and p at relatively greater depths to water than vadose zone sediments with more silt clay and loam which is a finding consistent with dickinson et al 2014 the effect of sediment texture on d is further explored in the results from the simulations of the heterogeneous two layer profiles and vertically stacked homogeneous profiles while vertical heterogeneities in soil texture are ubiquitous in real world vadose zones the findings about homogeneous soil textures shown in fig 4 begin to illustrate some important possible implications for the detection of spatial and temporal patterns of transient recharge in response to climate variability across u s aquifers the depth to water or vadose zone thickness is generally less than 100m in most aquifers of the u s fan et al 2007 aquifers in the humid qs 0 50 2 0mmd 1 eastern u s tend to have relatively smaller depths to water often less than 10 20m while aquifers in the semiarid and arid qs 0 01 0 10mmd 1 western u s tend to have relatively greater depths to water often 50 100m or more fan et al 2007 using those approximate depths to water and qs ranges fig 4 illustrates that transient recharge in response to qs variability on seasonal 90days to decadal 3652days timescales are more likely to reach the water table in aquifers of the humid eastern u s while only transient recharge with longer periods 731 3652days are likely to reach the water table in aquifers of the semiarid and arid u s the patterns of d in fig 4 also indicates that transient recharge with relatively shorter periods seasonal could be detected at the depth to water in aquifers of the semiarid and arid u s if focused or preferential recharge mechanisms i e ephemeral streams topographic depressions or irrigation return flow create local qs rates of 0 50 2 0mmd 1 the simulated d under the range of conditions representative of the continental u s fig 4 shows that transient recharge in response to ao nao enso and possibly pdo could be detected at the depth of the water table in most aquifers especially in those of the humid eastern u s the results of the significance testing support these interpretation of simulated d in homogeneous one layer profiles and indicate that qs p and ksat are all statistically significant α 0 05 variables that influence d table 5 in all soil textures except sand d is the most sensitive to qs followed by p and finally ksat based on the fdr logworth values table 5 in sand the qs and p have equal influence on d but these results are less reliable because of numerical convergence issues in the highly nonlinear numerical simulations of flow in sand based on these significance tests the variables associated with natural climate variable such as qs and p are relatively more important as compared to variables associated with the vadose zone such as ksat in determining the depth of transient recharge in aquifers an implication is that prioritizing the characterization of average infiltration fluxes qs and climate variability periodicity p over site specific soil types for example during groundwater model development may yield more accurate estimates of transient versus steady recharge these interpretations have limitations because the r2 values range from 0 55 to 0 66 table 5 indicating that these three variables could only explain about half to two thirds of the variability in d the unexplained variability in d is likely attributed to hydraulic diffusivity d which varies with depth and time in the vadose zone and makes such hydraulic properties difficult to evaluate with statistical significance tests 3 2 damping depth in heterogeneous two layer profiles d 2lp the simulated damping depths from homogeneous one layer profiles d are compared to damping depths from heterogeneous two layer profiles d 2lp to evaluate the effects of layering and layer thickness for three representative soil textures clay silt and loam fig 5 the percent change from d to d 2lp ranges from 35 to 40 and represent only comparisons between simulations where the texture from the top of the two layer profile is the same as the texture from the one layer profile fig 5 the negative values indicate that d 2lp d in the corresponding one layer profile and the positive values indicate that the d 2lp d in the corresponding one layer profile fig 5 the majority of the values are between 25 for all three upper layer thicknesses and there is no observable trend in the variance of the percent change in d as a function of upper layer thickness for most soil textures and p fig 5 a few exceptions occur for the monthly p 30days where percent change in d is as much as 30 greater for the relatively thin upper layer compared to the relatively thick upper fig 5 however the results indicate that d 2lp is generally not sensitive to the upper layer thickness for the range of qs monthly to annual p and for most soil textures the implications are that when the soil textures in a layered profile include clay silt and loam homogeneous simulations that use the soil texture representative of land surface may provide reasonable approximations 25 of the depth of transient recharge as compared to more complex heterogeneous simulations that parameterize layering of texture in the vadose zone 3 3 damping depth in vertically stacked homogeneous profiles d shp the simulated damping depths from heterogeneous two layer profiles d 2lp are compared to damping depths from the vertically stacked homogeneous profiles d shp fig 6 and used to evaluate the effects of layer interactions and the conditions where the assumption of linear superposition appear most valid the percent change from d 2lp to d shp ranges from 10 to 22 where the negative values indicate that d 2lp d shp and the positive values indicate that d 2lp d shp fig 6 the majority of the values are between 10 for all three upper layer thicknesses and these errors are relatively small compared to the variations of d within any given period band shown in fig 4 additionally there is no apparent relationship in the variance of the percent change in d as a function of upper layer thickness fig 6 this indicates that d shp and the assumption of linear superposition are generally not sensitive to the upper layer thickness for the simulated range of qs monthly to annual p and for the representative soil textures of clay silt and loam the profiles of silt over clay and silt over loam resulted in positive value outliers 11 22 and indicate that d shp overestimates d 2lp fig 6 interestingly the positive outliers occur only for the monthly 30day and seasonal 90day periods fig 6a and b and not for the annual 365day period fig 6c the validity of the linear superposition assumption apparently increases as the period increases and is justification for not showing the error analysis for longer periods as in fig 4 the results presented in fig 6 generally indicate that d shp is relatively insensitive to the hydraulic interactions between layers and that the assumption of linear superposition may be reasonable for many combinations of soil textures especially when the soil textures in a layered profile are relatively similar in terms of hydraulic properties and include clay silt and loam the important implications of these findings is that if clay silt and loam layers are present in the vadose zone relatively simple homogeneous models may provide reasonably accurate estimates of the depth of transient recharge in response to climate variability a more detailed follow up paper will examine the phenomena controlling signal propagation across the layer boundaries 4 summary and conclusions we use simple numerical modeling experiments to demonstrate that cyclical infiltration in the vadose zone from variable climate could result in variable recharge and potentially impact the availability of groundwater resources we evaluated hundreds of numerical hydrus 1d simulations over a range of periodic boundary conditions and vadose zone geometries and hydraulic parameters that are generally representative of aquifer systems of the conterminous u s and likely found throughout the world the periods of the variations match those of known climate cycles and the fluxes are representative of arid to humid climates we focused on simulated damping depth in the vadose zone which is defined where the ratio of the flux variation at any depth to the infiltration flux variation from the sinusoidal perturbation at land surface is equal to 5 understanding the physical processes that control damping depth is central to understanding and predicting climate variability teleconnections with groundwater level variability because the vertical position of the damping depth in the vadose zone determines the presence of steady state or transient recharge at the water table results of the simulated damping depths provide important insight into the appropriate conditions and limitations of using the assumption of steady state recharge fluxes for aquifers across the u s and how oscillations associated with global scale climate variability result in transient recharge at local scales the findings presented here provide a framework that generally explains why some periodic infiltration fluxes associated with climate variability are unexpectedly absent in groundwater level fluctuations and dampen with depth in the vadose zone resulting in steady state recharge fluxes while other periodic surface fluxes do not dampen with depth resulting in transient recharge we find that damping depth spans several orders of magnitude depending on the mean flux and period of the time varying infiltration that may be associated with global scale climate patterns as well as the soil texture and hydraulic properties of the local vadose zone damping depth generally increases as mean flux and period of the time varying infiltration increase and the vadose zone contains relatively more coarser soil textures given the general differences in climate and depths to water a wider range of time varying recharge fluxes from monthly to decadal scale variability are likely to be present at the water table in aquifers of the humid eastern u s while a more narrow range of time varying recharge fluxes from interannual to decadal timescales are more likely to be present at the water table in aquifers of the semiarid and arid western u s damping of transient recharge fluxes are more likely in the semiarid and arid aquifers of the u s that have relatively greater depths to water however local conditions or land use change that create focused or preferential recharge mechanisms could enable the shorter period time varying recharge fluxes monthly to annual to reach the water table in the semiarid and arid aquifers of the western u s an important finding here is that given the general range of conditions representative of the continental u s transient recharge fluxes in response to the climate variability patterns of ao nao enso and possibly pdo could be detected at the depth of the water table in most aquifers an important implication of our findings is that prioritizing the characterization of average recharge fluxes qs and climate variability periodicity p over site specific soil types for example during groundwater model development may yield more accurate estimates of transient versus steady recharge application of these findings from simulations of homogeneous soil textures to real world groundwater resource management objectives has limitations because we find that heterogeneities and layering can have a substantial impact on damping depth under some conditions however when the soil textures in a layered profile are relatively similar especially if they include clay silt and loam homogeneous simulations that use the soil texture at land surface may be reasonable approximations of the depth of transient recharge fluxes as compared to more complex heterogeneous simulations that parameterize layering of texture in the vadose zone these findings generally support continued work aimed at collecting soil cores and measuring soil hydraulic properties or inferring them from pedotransfer functions or geophysical methods another important finding is that the assumption of linear superposition is reasonable under a considerable range of conditions that we tested the model results indicate that the damping depth is not sensitive to layer thickness or hydraulic interactions between many combinations of soil textures especially when the soil textures in a layered profile are relatively similar and include clay silt and loam and thus support the assumption of linear superposition under those conditions we conclude that the apparent linear behavior in the damping of climate varying recharge fluxes over a considerable range of clay silt and loam textures is further support that simple homogeneous models of soil textures at land surface can reasonably estimate transient recharge fluxes in more complex layered vadose zone profiles a follow up paper will test and validate this framework using results from spectral analyses of hydrologic time series and field observations from the vadose zone where available acknowledgments this research

7324,increasing demand on groundwater resources motivates understanding of the controls on recharge dynamics so model predictions under current and future climate may improve here we address questions about the nonlinear behavior of flux variability in the vadose zone that may explain previously reported teleconnections between global scale climate variability and fluctuations in groundwater levels we use hundreds of hydrus 1d simulations in a sensitivity analysis approach to evaluate the damping depth of transient recharge over a range of periodic boundary conditions and vadose zone geometries and hydraulic parameters that are representative of aquifer systems of the conterminous united states u s although the models were parameterized based on u s aquifers findings from this study are applicable elsewhere that have mean recharge rates between 3 65 and 730mmyr 1 we find that mean infiltration flux period of time varying infiltration and hydraulic conductivity are statistically significant predictors of damping depth the resulting framework explains why some periodic infiltration fluxes associated with climate variability dampen with depth in the vadose zone resulting in steady state recharge while other periodic surface fluxes do not dampen with depth resulting in transient recharge we find that transient recharge in response to the climate variability patterns could be detected at the depths of water levels in most u s aquifers our findings indicate that the damping behavior of transient infiltration fluxes is linear across soil layers for a range of texture combinations the implications are that relatively simple homogeneous models of the vadose zone may provide reasonable estimates of the damping depth of climate varying transient recharge in some complex layered vadose zone profiles keywords recharge climate variability vadose zone damping linear superposition 1 introduction a growing number of studies report that groundwater levels can fluctuate in response to low frequency and persistent global scale climate patterns that have quasi periodic oscillations on interannual to multidecadal timescales e g fleming and quilty 2006 holman et al 2009 perez valdivia et al 2012 tremblay et al 2011 venencio and garcía 2011 which affect infiltration and recharge complicating the interpretation of these teleconnections is that groundwater levels also respond to groundwater pumping trends and variability largely on seasonal timescales gurdak 2017 this so called climate induced pumping has been detected on timescales ranging from less than one year russo and lall 2017 to scales consistent with the el niño southern oscillation enso gurdak et al 2007 these physical mechanisms have largely been inferred from statistical and spectral analysis of hydroclimatic time series e g gurdak et al 2007 hanson et al 2006 2004 holman et al 2011 kuss and gurdak 2014 russo and lall 2017 however teleconnections that have not been evaluated by mechanistic models may be limited for understanding and predicting groundwater responses to future climate increasing demands on groundwater resources from the water energy food nexus taniguchi et al 2017 and climate variability and change green et al 2011 taylor et al 2012 continues to raise the importance of understanding and accurately predicting current and future recharge meixner et al 2016 these predictions can be improved through a better understanding of the properties of the vadose zone that control a time varying recharge response to climate variability hunt et al 2008 such controls are poorly understood because of the nonlinear relations among unsaturated flow pressure water content and hydraulic diffusivity in the vadose zone dickinson et al 2014 these challenges are further compounded by a general lack of long term field observations of such variables from the vadose zone that are necessary to detect time varying recharge in response to climate variability on interannual to multidecadal timescales gurdak et al 2007 although recent studies have begun monitoring the vadose zone under different climate regimes and land use e g baram et al 2012 carrera hernandez et al 2011 strobach et al 2014 turkeltaub et al 2014 as noted by dickinson et al 2014 the nonlinear complexity of controls on transient recharge has often limited the direct representation of recharge in groundwater models and resource assessments which in many cases have assumed a long term steady state recharge flux under some conditions assigning a slowly varying or constant recharge flux in a groundwater model is justified because periodic or episodic variations in surface infiltration fluxes smooth out or dampens with depth prior to recharge dickinson et al 2014 however recent physically based modeling studies dickinson et al 2014 velasco et al 2015 and the previously mentioned studies that use time series and spectral analysis have identified some conditions where climate variability results in transient recharge fluxes that are not dampened within the vadose zone an improved ability to model recharge is relevant for improving prediction of groundwater response to future climate and the associated global to local scale management decisions and policy regarding sustainable groundwater famiglietti 2014 this is particularly needed for aquifers in semi arid and arid climates that often are in overdraft conditions have relatively thick vadose zones and are generally predicted to have less recharge and or more episodic recharge events under future climate change green et al 2011 taylor et al 2012 treidel et al 2012 to address this need requires a review of the state of understanding of coupled climate variability and vadose zone dynamics 1 1 climate variability the expected trends in many hydrologic processes including recharge rates and mechanisms due to human induced climate change particularly over the first half of the 21st century can only be fully appreciated when combined with understanding of the overprinted global scale climate variability the majority of climate change impact studies on recharge have largely focused on human induced climate change often using the approach of coupling downscaled climate data from global circulation models gcms that drive hydrologic models to estimate recharge rates and mechanisms under future climate change commonly by the middle to end of the 21st century green et al 2011 meixner et al 2016 taylor et al 2012 treidel et al 2012 the current generation of gcms project that mean climate across many regions of the globe will move to a state continuously beyond historical variability by the mid 21st century mora et al 2013 which will likely alter the frequency magnitude and other spatiotemporal characteristics of climate variability patterns stoner et al 2009 however the comparatively short term planning horizon often years to decades for most groundwater resource management decisions means that transient recharge in response to climate variability on interannual to multidecadal timescales has immediate and tangible implications for groundwater sustainability gurdak et al 2009 climate variability occurs on all temporal scales that extend beyond weather events and is defined as the difference between current climate conditions and the mean state over a larger temporal scale ghil 2002 climate variability is often characterized using indices that combine sea surface temperatures sea level pressures geo potential heights and wind speed among other atmosphere ocean variables ghil 2002 the indices that represent the six leading atmospheric ocean circulation systems that affect north american interannual to multidecadal climate variability include the atlantic teleconnection patterns the arctic oscillation ao north atlantic oscillation nao and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and the pacific teleconnection patterns enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo and pacific north american oscillation pna the most widely accepted quasi periodic cycles for these systems range from 1 70years including 6 12months ao 3 6years nao 50 70years amo 2 7years enso 15 30years pdo to 1 4years pna

skillfully recent analysis demonstrate some robust projections for how they may evolve through the 21st century such as changing in amplitude time scale and increasing the meteorological extremes with which they are associated chen et al 2017 zhang and delworth 2016 the atlantic and pacific teleconnections influence the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation air temperature drought snowpack and melt evapotranspiration stream discharge and other land surface hydrologic processes across the continental u s north america and other regions bayari and yildiz 2012 beebee and manga 2004 brabets and walvoord 2009 cayan et al 1999 enfield et al 2001 kondrashov et al 2005 maheu et al 2003 mantua et al 1997 mazouz et al 2012 mccabe et al 2004 ropelewski and halpert 1986 sabziparvar et al 2011 tremblay et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2011 such variability in surface hydroclimatology is expected to influence time varying infiltration downward water flux in the vadose zone and ultimately recharge rates and mechanism gurdak et al 2007 hanson et al 2004 kuss and gurdak 2014 however the teleconnections patterns that exist in surface hydrologic processes are not necessarily the same as those preserved in the subsurface processes that affect groundwater levels velasco et al 2015 much of the subsurface hydrologic response is also a function of the hydraulic properties of the vadose zone dickinson et al 2014 1 2 vadose zone hydraulic properties and climate varying recharge recent research has begun to consider the properties of the vadose zone that may influence whether groundwater levels may respond to climate variability to investigate the role of the vadose zone these studies have focused on the relations between soil and water properties and periodic flow in the vadose zone that could be driven by climate variability bakker and nieber 2009 dickinson et al 2004 2014 pool and dickinson 2007 these relations become important when climatic forcings at the land surface can be damped in the vadose zone prior to reaching the water table velasco et al 2015 bakker and nieber 2009 derived an analytical solution to the richards equation for vertical one dimensional transient flow that was used to predict the movement of cyclical sinusoidally varying fluxes at the land surface where the infiltration can be assumed to be a function of precipitation and evaporation bakker and nieber 2009 found that flux variations damp with depth in the vadose zone such that beyond a certain depth referred as the damping depth d the flux could be approximated as steady bakker and nieber 2009 expanding on the work of bakker and nieber 2009 dickinson et al 2014 developed a screening tool for evaluating how variability of a cyclical infiltration pattern at the land surface was damped with depth in the vadose zone if the flow variability damped to within 5 of the original amplitude they stated that the assigned recharge in numerical groundwater flow models can be assumed to be steady however if 5 of the infiltration variability remained at the depth of the water table recharge is assumed to be transient dickinson et al 2014 assessed the sensitivity of the damping to vertical water fluxes typical of arid and semiarid regions where the periods of infiltration variability ranged from 1 to 365days in homogenous sand and clay the damping and damping depth was evaluated through comparisons with results from numerical simulations from the software hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 dickinson et al 2014 found that the analytical solution by bakker and nieber 2009 was most accurate for soil water conditions where the hydraulic diffusivity is relatively constant the hydraulic diffusivity is likely to be steady in fine soils when both the water content and flux variability are relatively small they found that the diffusivity can be highly variable in coarse soils such as sand when the amplitude of the flux variability and water content were relatively large dickinson et al 2014 found that the damping depth from the analytical solution bakker and nieber 2009 could be excessively large up to five times the damping depth from the numerical solution when the diffusivity was highly variable this overestimation of the numerical damping depth which is also an underestimation of the damping may result in mischaracterization of the damping properties of the vadose zone in their examples dickinson et al 2014 noted that regions of coarse soils in aquifers where recharge was likely to be steady could have been misidentified as having transient recharge their analysis was limited to homogeneous sand and clay soils and damping in layered soils with contrasting soil water properties was not assessed 1 3 objectives this paper addresses the knowledge gap of how physical processes of water flow in the vadose zone contribute to observed teleconnections between climate and groundwater levels by controlling transient recharge fluxes and mechanisms in response to climate variability here we systematically build on the findings of dickinson et al 2014 by using a sensitivity analysis approach to evaluate the damping of cyclical surface forcings in the vadose zone from hundreds of numerical hydrus 1d simulations over a range of periodic boundary conditions and vadose zone geometries and hydraulic parameters that are generally representative of aquifer systems of the conterminous united states u s we assess the damping properties of the vadose zone using a numerical approach that allows for a more accurate time varying hydraulic diffusivity than the approach by dickinson et al 2014 we use the results of this approach to address the following research questions how does soil texture in the vadose zone influence damping in homogeneous one layer and heterogeneous two layer systems what are the effects of layer thickness on damping depth d does the damping in two layers occur independently or does the presence of one layer impact the damping in the other layer if the damping is independent is linear superposition described in section 2 1 4 of the damping in separate layers a reasonable approximation which characteristics of the infiltration and soil water parameters have the most statistically significant influence on d by addressing these questions surrounding d we provide a framework that can be used to i interpret the physical processes underlying the teleconnections between climate variability patterns and fluctuations in groundwater levels and ii predict steady state versus transient recharge over a wide range of time varying infiltration fluxes periods and hydraulic properties of soil and vadose zone that is representative of u s aquifers 2 methods 2 1 numerical modeling numerical hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 simulations were used to evaluate the hydraulic properties and characteristics of the periodic net infiltration flux qz affecting the d and transient recharge in homogeneous one layer and heterogeneous two layer textural profiles of the vadose zone hydrus 1d is a computer program that solves the richards equation for saturated and unsaturated water flow in general two sets of hydrus 1d simulations were run one for homogeneous one layer profiles and one for heterogeneous two layer profiles this section describes the model conditions and parameters that were used in both sets of hydrus 1d simulations table 1 while the details about the homogeneous and heterogeneous simulations are described in the subsequent sections the boundary conditions to the hydrus 1d simulations were a periodic vertical net infiltration flux qz 0 l t 1 below the root zone at depth z 0 and free drainage and the gradient of total head is equal to 1 the flux qz 0 is a composite of a steady downward mean flux qs l t 1 and a sinusoidal transient component with mean amplitude qp l t 1 value and period p t fig 1 a the combined qs and qp components represents the net infiltration below the root zone that results from the infiltration of precipitation runoff and the uptake of water by evapotranspiration the components of qz can represent varying infiltration in diffuse recharge settings basin floors stream channels or areas of applied irrigation water where the steady component qs represents a long term mean flux and the periodic component qp represents the sum of episodic events and climate variations from the steady component for a real system where distributed recharge is characterized the sum of qs at all locations would equal the total discharge for our analysis the amplitude qp never exceeds the steady component of the flux qs bakker and nieber 2009 dickinson et al 2014 this results in a flux that is always positive in the downward direction the qs values were selected to represent long term 1971 2000 mean net recharge rates from a range of climate and land cover regions of the conterminous u s and were calculated as the difference between mean annual precipitation and mean annual evapotranspiration as reported by sanford and selnick 2013 table 2 this residual contains both recharge and runoff and may overestimate recharge in some areas table 3 summarizes the qs values used in the hydrus 1d simulations to represent different climate and land cover regions although the models were parameterized based on u s aquifers and climate findings from this study are applicable elsewhere that have mean recharge rates between 3 65 and 730mmyr 1 table 3 the amplitude of the sinusoidal flux component qp were set equal to 99 of each qs thus the flux is always downward and greater than zero table 3 a range of periods p were used in the hydrus 1d simulations to represent qz 0 variability on monthly 30day seasonal 90 and 180day and annual 365day timescales table 1 the 30day periods are used to represent synoptic scale meteorological systems while the 90 and 180day periods represent mediterranean monsoonal or other climates that have distinct wet and dry seasons in addition longer periods of 730 2 556 and 3 652days 2 7 and 10years table 1 were used in the simulations to represent qz 0 variability that is consistent with global scale climate patterns including pna 1 4years nao 3 6years and enso 2 7year cycles the hydrus 1d models were spun up for at least 20 periods to achieve oscillatory steady state conditions prior to evaluating the transient responses the hydrus 1d soil texture and hydraulic properties were parameterized using the 12 u s department of agriculture usda soil textural classes and the gardner 1958 and gardner kozeny mathias and butler 2006 bakker and nieber 2009 soil hydraulic models except for the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks values that were obtained from the rosetta soil catalog schaap et al 2001 table 4 the gardner α and gardner kozeny ɳ0 and µ parameter values table 4 were estimated by linear regression as detailed in dickinson et al 2014 and wraith and or 1998 2 1 1 homogeneous one layer profiles a total of 588 hydrus 1d simulations of homogeneous one layer profiles were run for all combinations of the 12 usda soil textures table 4 seven mean fluxes qs table 3 and seven periods p table 1 the model domain includes 1001 nodes with a vertical node spacing that is equal and sums to the specified bottom boundary of the model which included 10 20 and 100m table 1 the larger profile bottom boundary depths of 20 and 100m were used in simulations where the d exceeded the 10m profile depth the results of the homogeneous profile simulations were used as a guide to constrain the range of model conditions and parameters tested during the subsequent hydrus 1d simulations of heterogeneous two layer profiles 2 1 2 heterogeneous two layer profiles a total of 54 hydrus 1d simulations of heterogeneous two layer profiles were run for all layer combinations of three representative usda soil textures clay silt and loam table 1 one mean flux qs 1 00mmd 1 table 1 three periods p 30 90 and 365days table 1 and three relative thicknesses thin intermediate and thick of the upper layer in the two layered profile similar to the homogeneous simulations the model domain for the two layered profile included 1001 nodes with equal vertical node spacing over depths from 10m and 50m table 1 here we evaluate two layers to keep the problem tractable to better understand the behavior between layers the larger profile depth bottom boundary of 50m was used in simulations where the d exceeded the 10m profile depth here we establish the relative thickness thin intermediate and thick of the upper layer using quarter fractions of the d that resulted from the hydrus 1d simulations of the homogeneous one layer profiles fig 1b using this approach a relatively thin upper layer is 0 25d intermediate thick upper layer is 0 5d and relatively thick upper layer is 0 75d fig 1b this creates a set of three possible upper layer thicknesses for each of the two layered model domains table 1 once the thickness of the upper layer is established the remaining lower portion of the model domain is set as the lower layer therefore the thickness of the lower layer is a function of the upper layer thickness 2 1 3 vertically stacked homogeneous profiles the simulated damping depth from vertically stacked homogeneous profiles of flux variability fig 2 which is used to approximate the flux variability in two layers in a single simulation and help test for linearity and superposition see section 2 1 4 is calculated as follows first flow in the upper layer was simulated by hydrus 1d with a single homogeneous soil layer to represent the damping in an upper soil layer fig 2c next the qp from the bottom of the upper layer defines the input qp for the simulation of flow in a single homogeneous lower layer to represent a lower layer fig 2c and d the simulation of the homogeneous upper layer is similar to the description from section 2 1 in that the mean amplitude of the sinusoidal flux component qp at z 0 was set equal to 99 of the qs fig 2c however the separate simulation of the homogeneous lower layer fig 2d uses as input at z 0 the qp from the bottom of the homogeneous upper layer rather than being set equal to 99 of the qs finally the damping depth of the vertically stacked homogeneous profiles d shp fig 2c and d is calculated as 1 d shp z ul d ll where zul l is the relative thickness thin 0 25d intermediate 0 5d or thick 0 75d used in the simulation of the homogeneous upper layer and dll l is the damping depth simulated in the lower layer 2 1 4 testing for linearity and superposition we explore the approximation of linear superposition with respect to the damping depth d and the interactions between layered soil textures in the vadose zone if the assumption of linear superposition holds true we expect that adding the d from simulations of two separate homogeneous soil profiles should approximate the simulated d in a layered system of the same two soil textures the implications of linear superposition would enable using d behavior in homogeneous soil profiles to estimate d behavior and hence steady state and transient recharge in more complex layered soil profiles that are representative of natural vadose zones to test the linear superposition approximation we first simulate damping depths in heterogeneous two layer soil profiles d 2lp when the upper layer has different relative thicknesses thin intermediate and thick fig 2b that is we simulate flow in two layers in a single hydrus 1d model then we compare the d 2lp to the simulated damping depths from vertically stacked homogeneous profiles d shp fig 2c and d we consider the linear superposition approximation to be reasonably accurate if 2 d shp 10 d 2 lp where the damping depth from vertically stacked homogeneous profiles d shp is within 10 of the simulated damping depths in the heterogeneous two layer profiles d 2lp fig 2 illustrates an example where the d shp is 13 7 greater than the d 2lp and linear superposition may not be valid however the cases where eq 2 are true indicate that d is largely influenced by the hydraulic properties of the upper layer with relatively smaller influence by the hydraulic interactions between the layers or properties of the lower layer an important implication of the linear superposition assumption is that simple homogeneous models may provide reasonable estimates of d in more complex layered systems 2 2 significance testing we used the false discovery rate fdr technique benjamini and hochberg 1995 during the statistical significance testing to quantify the relative sensitivity of d to k qs and p the fdr p value adjustment efficiently controls for the rate of false positives among a large number of tests benjamini and hochberg 1995 the fdr p values p i fdr are computed as 3 p i fdr minimum p i 1 fdr m i p i where the independently calculated p values have an fdr adjusted p value that falls below α if the parameter is statistically significant at the 0 05 level benjamini and hochberg 1995 we used the fdr logworth transformation benjamini and hochberg 1995 to provide an appropriate scale for visualization where 4 log 10 fdr p value 1 3 log 10 0 05 1 3 a fdr logworth value 1 3 indicates significance at the 0 05 level we use the fdr logworth approach to reject the null hypothesis that the k qs and p do not influence d we also present the r2 values from the linear least squares model to evaluate the proportion of variation in d that is accounted for by the k qs and p 3 results and discussion the results and discussion are organized in two parts to address the research questions first we present results from the simulations of the homogenous one layer profiles and discuss how d is influenced by the hydraulic properties of the vadose zone and characteristics of the net infiltration flux qz second we present results from the simulations of the heterogeneous two layer profiles and vertically stacked homogeneous profiles and discuss how d is influenced by layer thickness layer interactions and the conditions where the assumption of linear superposition is valid 3 1 damping depth in homogenous one layer profiles d results from the simulations of homogeneous one layer profiles indicate that d is positively related to qs and p to illustrate this relation we show the simulated d for three representative soil textures clay silt and loam and ranges of qs 0 01 1 0mmd 1 and p 30 730days fig 3 the d associated with arid qs 0 01mmd 1 remains within the upper 2m even with p that is consistent with enso variability 730days fig 3 however the larger qs associated with semi arid 0 1mmd 1 and humid 1 0mmd 1 climates results in d that span from 1m under monthly and seasonal p 30 90days to 100m for p that is consistent with enso variability fig 3 the simulated d is similar in the clay silt and loam profiles even as qs and p increase fig 3 results from all simulations of homogeneous one layer profiles indicate that d spans more than four orders of magnitude from 0 1 to 1000m fig 4 the d exceeds 1000m in simulations using qs 0 05mmd 1 and p 2557d but those results are not shown here because the thickness of the vadose zone is generally 1000m in aquifers fan et al 2007 fig 4 illustrates three important positive relations the d generally increases as a function of increasing coarseness of soil texture and increasing qs and p which are findings that are generally consistent with dickinson et al 2014 the reader is referred to corona 2016 for tables of values used in fig 4 as the qs and p increase the sensitivity of d to the differences in hydraulic properties of the soil texture also increases particularly for the relatively coarser soil textures the implications of these results is that vadose zone sediment with greater sand content is likely to preserve transient recharge fluxes associated with climate variability especially those at greater qs and p at relatively greater depths to water than vadose zone sediments with more silt clay and loam which is a finding consistent with dickinson et al 2014 the effect of sediment texture on d is further explored in the results from the simulations of the heterogeneous two layer profiles and vertically stacked homogeneous profiles while vertical heterogeneities in soil texture are ubiquitous in real world vadose zones the findings about homogeneous soil textures shown in fig 4 begin to illustrate some important possible implications for the detection of spatial and temporal patterns of transient recharge in response to climate variability across u s aquifers the depth to water or vadose zone thickness is generally less than 100m in most aquifers of the u s fan et al 2007 aquifers in the humid qs 0 50 2 0mmd 1 eastern u s tend to have relatively smaller depths to water often less than 10 20m while aquifers in the semiarid and arid qs 0 01 0 10mmd 1 western u s tend to have relatively greater depths to water often 50 100m or more fan et al 2007 using those approximate depths to water and qs ranges fig 4 illustrates that transient recharge in response to qs variability on seasonal 90days to decadal 3652days timescales are more likely to reach the water table in aquifers of the humid eastern u s while only transient recharge with longer periods 731 3652days are likely to reach the water table in aquifers of the semiarid and arid u s the patterns of d in fig 4 also indicates that transient recharge with relatively shorter periods seasonal could be detected at the depth to water in aquifers of the semiarid and arid u s if focused or preferential recharge mechanisms i e ephemeral streams topographic depressions or irrigation return flow create local qs rates of 0 50 2 0mmd 1 the simulated d under the range of conditions representative of the continental u s fig 4 shows that transient recharge in response to ao nao enso and possibly pdo could be detected at the depth of the water table in most aquifers especially in those of the humid eastern u s the results of the significance testing support these interpretation of simulated d in homogeneous one layer profiles and indicate that qs p and ksat are all statistically significant α 0 05 variables that influence d table 5 in all soil textures except sand d is the most sensitive to qs followed by p and finally ksat based on the fdr logworth values table 5 in sand the qs and p have equal influence on d but these results are less reliable because of numerical convergence issues in the highly nonlinear numerical simulations of flow in sand based on these significance tests the variables associated with natural climate variable such as qs and p are relatively more important as compared to variables associated with the vadose zone such as ksat in determining the depth of transient recharge in aquifers an implication is that prioritizing the characterization of average infiltration fluxes qs and climate variability periodicity p over site specific soil types for example during groundwater model development may yield more accurate estimates of transient versus steady recharge these interpretations have limitations because the r2 values range from 0 55 to 0 66 table 5 indicating that these three variables could only explain about half to two thirds of the variability in d the unexplained variability in d is likely attributed to hydraulic diffusivity d which varies with depth and time in the vadose zone and makes such hydraulic properties difficult to evaluate with statistical significance tests 3 2 damping depth in heterogeneous two layer profiles d 2lp the simulated damping depths from homogeneous one layer profiles d are compared to damping depths from heterogeneous two layer profiles d 2lp to evaluate the effects of layering and layer thickness for three representative soil textures clay silt and loam fig 5 the percent change from d to d 2lp ranges from 35 to 40 and represent only comparisons between simulations where the texture from the top of the two layer profile is the same as the texture from the one layer profile fig 5 the negative values indicate that d 2lp d in the corresponding one layer profile and the positive values indicate that the d 2lp d in the corresponding one layer profile fig 5 the majority of the values are between 25 for all three upper layer thicknesses and there is no observable trend in the variance of the percent change in d as a function of upper layer thickness for most soil textures and p fig 5 a few exceptions occur for the monthly p 30days where percent change in d is as much as 30 greater for the relatively thin upper layer compared to the relatively thick upper fig 5 however the results indicate that d 2lp is generally not sensitive to the upper layer thickness for the range of qs monthly to annual p and for most soil textures the implications are that when the soil textures in a layered profile include clay silt and loam homogeneous simulations that use the soil texture representative of land surface may provide reasonable approximations 25 of the depth of transient recharge as compared to more complex heterogeneous simulations that parameterize layering of texture in the vadose zone 3 3 damping depth in vertically stacked homogeneous profiles d shp the simulated damping depths from heterogeneous two layer profiles d 2lp are compared to damping depths from the vertically stacked homogeneous profiles d shp fig 6 and used to evaluate the effects of layer interactions and the conditions where the assumption of linear superposition appear most valid the percent change from d 2lp to d shp ranges from 10 to 22 where the negative values indicate that d 2lp d shp and the positive values indicate that d 2lp d shp fig 6 the majority of the values are between 10 for all three upper layer thicknesses and these errors are relatively small compared to the variations of d within any given period band shown in fig 4 additionally there is no apparent relationship in the variance of the percent change in d as a function of upper layer thickness fig 6 this indicates that d shp and the assumption of linear superposition are generally not sensitive to the upper layer thickness for the simulated range of qs monthly to annual p and for the representative soil textures of clay silt and loam the profiles of silt over clay and silt over loam resulted in positive value outliers 11 22 and indicate that d shp overestimates d 2lp fig 6 interestingly the positive outliers occur only for the monthly 30day and seasonal 90day periods fig 6a and b and not for the annual 365day period fig 6c the validity of the linear superposition assumption apparently increases as the period increases and is justification for not showing the error analysis for longer periods as in fig 4 the results presented in fig 6 generally indicate that d shp is relatively insensitive to the hydraulic interactions between layers and that the assumption of linear superposition may be reasonable for many combinations of soil textures especially when the soil textures in a layered profile are relatively similar in terms of hydraulic properties and include clay silt and loam the important implications of these findings is that if clay silt and loam layers are present in the vadose zone relatively simple homogeneous models may provide reasonably accurate estimates of the depth of transient recharge in response to climate variability a more detailed follow up paper will examine the phenomena controlling signal propagation across the layer boundaries 4 summary and conclusions we use simple numerical modeling experiments to demonstrate that cyclical infiltration in the vadose zone from variable climate could result in variable recharge and potentially impact the availability of groundwater resources we evaluated hundreds of numerical hydrus 1d simulations over a range of periodic boundary conditions and vadose zone geometries and hydraulic parameters that are generally representative of aquifer systems of the conterminous u s and likely found throughout the world the periods of the variations match those of known climate cycles and the fluxes are representative of arid to humid climates we focused on simulated damping depth in the vadose zone which is defined where the ratio of the flux variation at any depth to the infiltration flux variation from the sinusoidal perturbation at land surface is equal to 5 understanding the physical processes that control damping depth is central to understanding and predicting climate variability teleconnections with groundwater level variability because the vertical position of the damping depth in the vadose zone determines the presence of steady state or transient recharge at the water table results of the simulated damping depths provide important insight into the appropriate conditions and limitations of using the assumption of steady state recharge fluxes for aquifers across the u s and how oscillations associated with global scale climate variability result in transient recharge at local scales the findings presented here provide a framework that generally explains why some periodic infiltration fluxes associated with climate variability are unexpectedly absent in groundwater level fluctuations and dampen with depth in the vadose zone resulting in steady state recharge fluxes while other periodic surface fluxes do not dampen with depth resulting in transient recharge we find that damping depth spans several orders of magnitude depending on the mean flux and period of the time varying infiltration that may be associated with global scale climate patterns as well as the soil texture and hydraulic properties of the local vadose zone damping depth generally increases as mean flux and period of the time varying infiltration increase and the vadose zone contains relatively more coarser soil textures given the general differences in climate and depths to water a wider range of time varying recharge fluxes from monthly to decadal scale variability are likely to be present at the water table in aquifers of the humid eastern u s while a more narrow range of time varying recharge fluxes from interannual to decadal timescales are more likely to be present at the water table in aquifers of the semiarid and arid western u s damping of transient recharge fluxes are more likely in the semiarid and arid aquifers of the u s that have relatively greater depths to water however local conditions or land use change that create focused or preferential recharge mechanisms could enable the shorter period time varying recharge fluxes monthly to annual to reach the water table in the semiarid and arid aquifers of the western u s an important finding here is that given the general range of conditions representative of the continental u s transient recharge fluxes in response to the climate variability patterns of ao nao enso and possibly pdo could be detected at the depth of the water table in most aquifers an important implication of our findings is that prioritizing the characterization of average recharge fluxes qs and climate variability periodicity p over site specific soil types for example during groundwater model development may yield more accurate estimates of transient versus steady recharge application of these findings from simulations of homogeneous soil textures to real world groundwater resource management objectives has limitations because we find that heterogeneities and layering can have a substantial impact on damping depth under some conditions however when the soil textures in a layered profile are relatively similar especially if they include clay silt and loam homogeneous simulations that use the soil texture at land surface may be reasonable approximations of the depth of transient recharge fluxes as compared to more complex heterogeneous simulations that parameterize layering of texture in the vadose zone these findings generally support continued work aimed at collecting soil cores and measuring soil hydraulic properties or inferring them from pedotransfer functions or geophysical methods another important finding is that the assumption of linear superposition is reasonable under a considerable range of conditions that we tested the model results indicate that the damping depth is not sensitive to layer thickness or hydraulic interactions between many combinations of soil textures especially when the soil textures in a layered profile are relatively similar and include clay silt and loam and thus support the assumption of linear superposition under those conditions we conclude that the apparent linear behavior in the damping of climate varying recharge fluxes over a considerable range of clay silt and loam textures is further support that simple homogeneous models of soil textures at land surface can reasonably estimate transient recharge fluxes in more complex layered vadose zone profiles a follow up paper will test and validate this framework using results from spectral analyses of hydrologic time series and field observations from the vadose zone where available acknowledgments this research
