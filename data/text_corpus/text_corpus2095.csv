10475,climate change has drastic impacts on water resources and agricultural productivity especially in arid and semi arid environments the present study simulated and explored the economic impacts of climate change on the water and agriculture sectors of the zayandehroud river basin in iran for the years 2040 and 2070in three major phases in phase i two general circulation models gcm hadcm2 and cgcm3t63 an artificial neural network ann rainfall runoff model and crop water production functions were applied to evaluate the biophysical impacts of climate change on water resources and various crop yields in phase ii the aforementioned models were integrated into the hydro economic spatial equilibrium model of zayandehroud basin he semz and the effects of the modeled runoff and socio economics changes on the economic welfare of the water sector its distributional consequences and on temporal spatial water prices and allocation were simulated in phase iii the simulated optimal allocated water to the agriculture sector was introduced into a positive mathematical programming pmp model of the agriculture sector to simulate follow on changes in crop acreage cropping patterns and farmers gross benefit in this modeling framework the role of two no cost adaptation strategies in agriculture i e modifications in crop irrigation and cropping pattern were also investigated the results showed that by mid century precipitation will be reduced and temperature increased in the zayandehroud river basin the direct result of these changes will be a reduction in the basin discharge by 4 3 in 2040 and 8 1 in 2070 compared to the base period the simulated economic value of water showed upward trends under climate change and socio economic scenarios reflecting an increase in water scarcity in response to changes in the scarcity value of water users respond by changing their patterns of water use and allocation the withdrawal by each sector decreases in response to reduced runoff although agriculture will be more responsive the results of the pmp model showed that by choosing optimal cropping pattern and an optimum deficient irrigation strategy for each crop there will be good opportunities for farmers to adapt to increasing water scarcity and higher temperatures induced by climate change jel classification c61 q54 q25 keywords climate change cropping pattern economic impacts hydro economic model river basin 1 introduction today climate change is one of the most important problems facing communities because of its long term effects on current and future generations yazdanpanah and zobydi 2017 climate change is an inevitable phenomenon of natural and human origins to which reduction and adaptation are needed to reduce the severity of its impacts and damages koundinya et al 2018 climate change is the biggest 21st century environmental challenge that has broad impacts on various economic sectors human communities natural resources and biodiversity water resources and agriculture are the sectors most dependent on climate as it directly determines the temporal and spatial availability of resources and their productivity bantin et al 2017 in addition these sectors are strongly linked to other economic sectors and claim a large portion of the economy especially in developing countries climate change will have a significant influence on the sustainability of water supply both quantitatively and qualitatively human health and the food supply in future decades bhave et al 2018 in addition agriculture is a climate sensitive sector that must adapt to climate change to maintain its economic vitality and meet the increasing caloric demands of a growing population mu et al 2017 the direct physical effects of climate change on water resources and agriculture have indirect implications on social economic and environmental systems thereby changing the management and allocation of land and water resources numerous studies worldwide have examined the complex relations between climate change and water resources as well as agriculture various studies have explored how climate change might affect global water scarcity in the future using population projections and simulated changes in climate from global climate models gcms with water resources models simon and arnell 2016 understanding the effects of climate change on water resource systems has been extensively attempted in the last few decades fant et al 2015 brown and wilby 2012 haasnoot and middelkoop 2012 a review of these studies gives evidence that this issue needs to be studied in more detail considering various climatic and socio economic conditions it has been argued that even with aggressive strategies to stabilize the concentration of atmosphere carbon dioxide between 400 and 500 ppm the occurrence of climate change in the future is inevitable on the general scale quiggin et al 2010 it has been predicted that the vulnerability of developing countries would be greater than that of developed countries also the water and agricultural commodities supplies in addition to changes in their relative prices in response to climate change would lead to structural changes of resources allocation among different sectors to changes in the comparative advantages in favor of one region at the expense of another and to alteration of the economic and commercial structures of countries iran is located in a dry and semi dry region of the world and such countries are especially vulnerable to the predicted impacts of climate change on water resources xia et al 2016 trends in historical meteorological data as well as future climate change projections indicate that temperatures will increase and spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation will change in the future as they have in recent decades fant et al 2015 analysis of data from five meteorological stations with at least 100 years of records revealed a significant increase in the average annual temperature ipcc projections on climate change a1 scenario also indicate that the average annual temperature will increase by 2 c until 2040 and by 3 5 4 c by the year 2100 they also predict a decrease of 10 20 in the average level of precipitation moreover it is anticipated that cereal production will decrease by 30 in the next 30 years ipcc 2007 these issues present a serious challenge to dry and low precipitation regions of iran many studies have evaluated climate change and its consequences in iran however they have tried to detect either long term trends in climatic and hydrological variables abdi dehkordi et al 2017 modarres and silva 2007 hejam et al 2008 or the physical effects of climate change on runoff and crop yields abrishamchi et al 2007 ashofteh and massah bovani 2007 khorshiddust and ghavidel rahimi 2008 the outcomes of such studies offer only a potential estimate of climate change impacts and have limited managerial implications climate change not only affects the biophysical variables but also influences the type and amount of water consumption in various activities the shadow price of water and agriculture cropping patterns rojas downing et al 2017 emphasis on the potential effects of climate change only and disregarding adaptive adjustments in market and farmer behaviors causes the overestimation of vulnerability for instance runoff reduction deepens competition between different uses and consumers and in turn increases the price of water resulting in water reallocation among users by moving from less value to high value consumption therefore a part of the predicted impact on water resources in biophysical modeling is modified by price changes at the market level farmers also react to water deficits by changing cultivation patterns and crop irrigation schemes williams and carrico 2017 nevertheless climate change is only one aspect of future challenges to water resources management changing socio economic conditions are more important in outlining the situation of water resources at both national and regional scales menzel et al 2019 socioeconomic scenarios are also key factors that determine the degree of vulnerability to climate change rodríguez et al 2015 the impact analysis of climate change using hybrid models which integrate the complex relationships between economic hydrological and agronomic elements as well as adaptation strategies with socioeconomic trends gives a more realistic evaluation of water resources and the vulnerability of the agricultural sector the current survey showed that there is a huge research gap in this area in iran the aim of this research therefore was to investigate the economic impacts of climate change on the water resources and agricultural sector of the zayandehroud river basin by developing a hydro economic model of the spatial equilibrium of water basin and an agricultural positive mathematical programming model 2 area under study the zayandehroud river basin about 26 000 km2 is located in the central iranian plateau and stretches about 350 km from west to east the koohrang mountains are the major water source for the zayandehroud the area s climate varies from hyper arid to very wet annual precipitation varies from about 1400 mm in the koohrang mountains to 50 mm in the southeast the precipitation regime is mediterranean and the maximum precipitation falls from january to march despite the completion of many water resources development and water transfer projects koohrang and cheshmelangan tunnels the basin usually faces a water shortage and intensive competition because of rapid demand growth the gavkhooni swamp is an international wetland ecosystem located in this basin and covers over 430 000 ha the minimum critical and optimal levels of environmental water requirement are 2 2 m3 s 69 4 mcm per year and 4 5 m3 s 142 mcm per year respectively however total annual inflow river natural flow drains outputs to this swamp averages a mere 33 mcm which is far lower than the desirable amount and even lower than the critical water requirement level moreover it is predicted that climate change will reduce river inflow by about 10 by the year 2040 massah bavani and morid 2005 if water consumption grows with the current trend the basin will not be able to reliably supply water by 2020 and with a 10 reduction in water resources the area will be under water stress thus it is important to evaluate how climate change affects water resources water uses and the welfare of water consumers especially the agriculture sector 3 methods and models the integrated modeling required by this research had four elements that are closely linked climate modeling a hydrological model of rainfall runoff a hydro economic model of the water basin and a positive mathematical programming pmp model of the agriculture sector fig 1 shows the schematized interactions between models identifying the basic processes used in this research and the information flows between them it is necessary to mention here while one can simply use the pmp model to calibrate observed baseline water use and cropping patterns and simulate the impact of climate change and socio economic changes and farmer s reaction with regards to different adaptation strategies but in this paper to avoidance of model complexity subject to the presence of irrigation deficiency equations in the model and simultaneously determining of optimal crops irrigation and crop pattern and the possibility of specifying a more detailed model in agricultural sector we prefer to use two positive mathematical programming separately one for water allocation in water user sectors level and another for optimal allocation of land and predetermined agricultural water resources between different crops 3 1 climate change modeling general circulation models gcms provide physically based predictions of how climate might change as a result of increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other trace gases in this study the response of the zayandehroud basin to climate change was evaluated using hadcm3 and cgcm3t63 archived by the ipcc data distribution center for b1 and a1b scenarios a major part of the zayandehroud water is provided through inter basin water transfer by koohrang and cheshmelangan tunnels which are located west of the zayandehroud dam therefore climate change was simulated in two spatial sites the basin upstream from the dam and the zayandehroud river basin downstream from the dam conditional probability density kernel estimator and k nearest neighbor knn approaches with the ability to extrapolate data from an artificial data series were used to downscale the monthly precipitation in the dam s basin and for simulate daily temperature and precipitation in the zayandehroud river basin respectively the weather generators are not able to record long term changes in climate parameters deviation from climatic normal in the output of large scale prediction models and based on predetermined scenarios to exert these changes in the observed series the strategic re sampling technique was used considering the efficiency of the knn generator in simulating a long term climate normal and its significant conformity with historical normals exerting changes in the observed series by strategic re sampling can be transferred into the simulated climate data series by running the knn generator resulting in the generation of an artificial series put on climate change in fig 2 steps of applied nonparametric downscaling approach were depicted 3 2 rainfall runoff modeling a conceptual model of neural networks was used to simulate the runoff response to climate change in the zayandehroud river basin neural networks have found great applications in the simulation of complex hydrological relationships uvo et al 2000 hsu et al 2002 mazvimavi et al 2005 parida et al 2006 a neural network is a set of neurons that connect in various layers with a special architecture the number of layers and neurons of a network and their placement form the architecture of a network mathematical functions known as neuron transfer functions are used to transfer the input to the output for each neuron fig 3 demonstrates the sample architecture of a three layer neural network with a fully connected and feed forward structure the first layer is the input layer which in this sample has four neurons number of independent variables plus one constant input neuron showing the bias in the network equations the number of the neurons in the middle layer controls the network flexibility in the precision of prediction there is no direct method for estimating the number of the neurons in this layer the number of neurons in the output layer is equal to the number of predicted vector variables here river runoff was simulated for the entire basin and for the dam s basin the independent variables in simulation of the runoff at the basin scale were the maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation while for the dam s basin only the precipitation variable was selected algorithm of zayendehroud hydrological simulation by neural network model is as fallowed 1 gathering enough sets of inputs explanatory variables and outputs independent variable for preparation of the model 2 selection of appropriate number of observational pairs as training set and the residuals as a testing set neural network model trains by training set model calibration 3 entering inputs of testing set into the designed model and record the calculated outputs model validation 4 comparing the estimated outputs obtained from the former step with real observational outputs and calculation of model error for different ratios of training and testing sets 5 comparing model errors obtained in step 4 and determining of appropriate number for training and testing sets based on least model error 6 repeating this algorithm with change in network architecture up to achieving a network with least modeling error compared to other networks the validity and reliability of ann model performance in simulation of river run off checked by the two criteria of r2 and nash sutcliffe in the trend and validation periods 3 3 socio economic scenarios in climate change studies it is important to explore how society and the economy will change in the future here three socio economic scenarios and three scenarios of unconstrained water demand in the zayandehroud water basin in the future in the absence of climate change table1 scenario 1 optimistic is more in line with iran s short and midterm national socio economic development programs in contrast scenario 2 pessimistic represents the continuation of past trends in future periods scenario 3 is a mixture of current trends and national development programs in both the short and midterm it is expected that the structure of basin water demands will change in the future in response to more competition between sectors irrespective of changes in water resource availability due to climate change the increased water demand of non agriculture sectors will result in decreased water resources available to the agriculture sector based on iran s institutional arrangements for water resource management under conditions of water deficiency and drought demands of the domestic and industrial sectors take priority over the agriculture sector and even the environment 3 4 hydro economic spatial equilibrium model of zayandehroud river basin he semz in this study a hydro economic spatial equilibrium model was developed to integrate the effects of climate change scenarios on spatial temporal and inter sectoral water allocation as well as welfare distribution of the zayandehroud water resources he semz is a basin scale endogenous price mathematical model formulated under the partial equilibrium framework of the water sector following samuelson 1952 takayama and judge 1964 vaux and howitt 1984 ward et al 2001 and hurd et al 1999a 1999b 2004 samuelson 1952 reported that maximizing the economic surplus corresponds to clear competitive market equilibrium therefore the water sector model in which multiple water consumers j 1 2 3 j are in the market can be specified by maximizing the net benefits of water in the entire basin as in eqs 1 and 2 griffin 2005 1 max z j 1 j b j w j c j w j j α j 1 2 β j w j w j c j w j 2 subject to j 1 j w j w λ where bj wj and cj wj are the total benefits and costs of water resources consumption for the jth consumer respectively wj is the amount of water withdrawal and αj and βj are parameters of water demand functions of the jth consumer the constraint in this problem states that the sum of the amounts of water diverted by all consumers should be equal to the total inventory of water resources solving the first order conditions for maximization of the problem gives 3 m b j m c j λ for all j 1 2 j 4 mn b j λ for all j 1 2 j the efficient amount of water consumption by each consumer is where the marginal benefits mb resulting from water consumption is equal to the marginal cost of water supply mc plus the social or scarcity value of the natural resource λ at the equilibrium point the marginal net benefits mnbj are equal for all consumers as much as λ which is a value attributed to the scarcity of the natural resource as the scarcity of water resources intensifies for example in response to climate change the value of λ also increases and vice versa by introducing the spatial and temporal dimensions of water allocation and integrating basin wide hydrological constraints into this theoretical economic model the objective function of the he semz was reiterated in the form of maximizing total economic net benefits of consumptive e g agriculture domestic and industry and non consumptive e g recreational benefits of water storage in zayandehroud dam water uses in this process a set of hydrological constraints eq 6 to eq 9 including the river flow balance the balance of reservoir water storage ground water supply surface reservoir evaporation and supplying environmental water rights constraints of the gavkhooni swamp were super imposed the main properties of the zayandehroud river basin including tributaries water flows entrance simple nodes and nodes for supply storage and consumption are shown in fig 4 the definitions of the variables parameters and indices of the he semz are summarized in table 2 objective function maximizing total net economic benefits of water basin

one key aspect of this model is the role of economic value of water as a driving force for the management of the water resources system this value is often shown with mathematical functions relating the economic value of water to the amount of water consumption when water supply declines in response to decreased river inflow for example in response to climate change the value of the resource scarcity increases signaling consumers in various regions to allocate water to higher value uses vaux and howitt 1984 hurd et al 2004 key assumptions of the model and parameters estimation methods are as follows linear demand function following hurd et al 2004 hurd coonrod 2007 and vaux et al 2003 and for simplicity we assumed linear demand function for all consumptive users agriculture industry and domestic sectors linearization of non linear functions or physical process equations is often employed to allow the use of linear programming which guarantees a global optimum if nonlinear equations are used model size is often further reduced for computational reasons harou et al 2009 agricultural water demand estimation water is an input for agricultural production therefore the economic value of water could be estimated by isolating the marginal contribution of water in the value of total production medellín azuara et al 2010 there are two general methods kindler and russell 1984 young 2005 scheierling et al 2006 inductive and deductive for achieving this purpose here the deductive method pmp optimization model howitt 2005 was used to estimate the economic value and water demand in the agricultural sector as the value of agricultural water is affected by various factors and constraints e g cropping pattern irrigation scheduling and technology it can fluctuate greatly across different sites and seasons here these functions were estimated for each demand site and each season spring summer and fall industrial water demand estimation for calibrating linear demand function for industry sector we need to know demand elasticity price and amount of water consumption the elasticity of water demand for this sector was estimated by the marginal productivity method wang and lall 2002 nahman and de lange 2013 and water production elasticity due to the lack of time series or cross section data for individual sites and industry groups a translog production function for the entire basin was estimated using 2 digit international standard industrial coding isic level data from the iranian statistical center isc 2010 calibration of domestic water demand davidson et al 2009 proposed that the value given by households to the domestic water can be calculated by estimating the elasticity ε price p and amount q of water in a given year the slope of the demand function b and the intercept term α were calculated by a point elasticity formula george et al 2011 household water demand elasticity has been estimated in various studies in iran sharzei and kolahi 2014 adibpour and shirashyani 2014 the results indicate that the structure of the household water demand is not highly influenced by climatic and geographical conditions across various regions here an average water demand elasticity of 0 22 indicating relatively high inelasticity was applied considering the aforementioned studies integrating socioeconomic scenarios in the model in order to analyze the effects of future climate change on water economy a baseline scenario in the future must be created by transferring the model from the current basic year to a future baseline scenario however the response of water economy to climate change is also affected by socioeconomic conditions to consider any possible future changes in socioeconomic conditions the water demand functions were rotated toward the right considering the socioeconomic trends given in table 1 basin s water supply resources resources for the zayandehroud water supply include mainly inter basin water transfer koohrang 1 and 2 and cheshmeh langan tunnels groundwater and basin inflows the seasonal average water supply for each of these resources within a 5 year period 2006 2010 was calculated and considered as the baseline scenario water availability water transfer projects from zayandehroud basin to outside several water transfer projects for the provision of potable water to cities located outside the basin yazd 50 mcm kashan 50 mcm ardestan 1 8 mcm naein 2 26 mcm and jughuyeh irrigation canal were exploited outflow water from the basin was all integrated into one node of out of basin use and it was assumed that the dewatering point of this node is the dam environmental water requirement of ghavkhoni swamp and recreational benefit of dam water storage the ghavkhooni swamp is an endpoint natural ecosystem of the zayandehroud river s flow the quantity and quality of the entering water are largely dependent on the extent of water released from the dam and the water withdrawal for consumptive uses along the 350 km upstream the minimum critical required level for continuation of the swamp s vital activities 2 2 m3 s or 69 4 mcm per year was considered as the environmental water rights constrain in all scenarios the recreational benefits of water storage in the zayandehrud dam reservoir are estimated seasonally as a function of the volume of water storage in the reservoir based on the number of people visiting the dam site and the amount of their willingness to pay travel cost method the general form of these seasonal recreational benefit functions is t b s φ s 0 5 β s 2 no constant term where tb is the total recreation benefit of each season s is the amount of water storage in the dam reservoir in that season and φ and β are parameters that were estimated by the maximum entropy approach base on seasonal visit rate people willingness to pay and the amount of water storage in the reservoir in the base period cost of water supply estimation of non linear water cost functions was performed using the three stages calibration approach of howitt 1995 in the first we solved the normative hydro economy model with terms of average costs of production transfer storage and distribution of water for each water user sector in the model objective function and calibration alongside with other hydrological constraints given the amount of dual values shadow price of calibration constrain in the second stage the slope coefficients matrix of costs functions was estimated by the maximum entropy method finally in the last stage sector s non linear cost functions substituted with the average cost terms in the hydro economic model objective function and ran the model again average costs of water supply for each sector were calculated as a weighted average of surface and groundwater cost of water production transfer storage and distribution by solving the calibrated model under different scenarios the optimal values of the decision variables including spatial and temporal water economic prices and allocation levels to various consumers the amount of seasonal water storage in the reservoir and total net economic benefits of consumptive and non consumptive water uses across the entire basin were obtained the difference between the values of these variables across different scenarios and their corresponding baseline figures suggests the net effects of climate change and socioeconomic scenarios 3 5 the effect of climate change on the basin s agricultural sector and the role of climate change strategies the agricultural sector is the largest water consumer about 90 of water across the zayandehroud water basin and hence gives a considerable portion of the socioeconomic profits of water however it is more vulnerable to climate change than other sectors because its production processes are highly exposed to the climate it also enjoys a somewhat lower priority in institutional arrangements regarding water allocation because of the lower value of water in other words this sector is the main victim of a water supply deficit e g caused by climate change or increase in water demand e g caused by socioeconomic trends in the he sems although the role of water economic value and the reallocation of water resources among various sites and sectors implicitly exist for achieving the maximum net benefits the adaptive strategies that can be taken by farmers at farm level in response to a water shortage are neglected on the other hand what is considered as the agricultural welfare loss in the he semz is the loss of profits from water reduction while the profit of the farmers flows not only out of the water but is a combination of the profits resulting from the application of all production inputs and crop yields therefore the economic impacts of climate change on farmers can be far greater than that estimated in the he semz thus attempts were made herein to estimate the effects of climate change on the agricultural sector in the basin using a two stage process and considering two no cost adaptive strategies i e cropping pattern change and selecting optimal irrigation deficiency the production of agricultural crops is not only directly influenced by rainfall temperature and evapo transpiration during the growth period it is also highly affected by the availability of water resources for agriculture climate change will alter the amounts and patterns of precipitation evaporation runoff water resources availability and soil water storage therefore the impact of climate change on agriculture includes both direct effects increased evaporation decreased effective precipitation and declined biomass and indirect effects decreased water resources changes in crop water requirement are a direct result of temperature changes and diminished precipitation signifies the further dependence of agricultural products on irrigation in situations of lowered availability of water resources for the agricultural sector under such conditions changes in irrigated crops are largely dependent upon the farmer s irrigation schedule if a water deficit for crops caused by climate change is fully compensated for through irrigation the reduction in yield might be trivial however the outcome of supplying more water per unit of area under conditions in which runoff has also declined is definitely a reduction in a farmer s total acreage under cultivation another decision of a farmer facing these changes might be to pursue profit maximization and implement some degree of crop irrigation deficiency preventing a substantial decrease in cultivation acreage by scarifying a part of the crop yield study results evidence that when the scarcity of water resources is intensified farmers usually aim to maximize profits rather than yield in allocating land and water resources to different productions agriculture modeling involves a two stage process the first stage is to simulate changes in crop yield using fao empirical crop production functions assuming that the decision of farmers regarding supplying irrigation water will not change in relation to the current conditions the second stage involves using an economic optimization tool what s best to determine the profit maximizing combination of land use and seasonal irrigation deficiency rate for each crop in the basin level given resource and environmental constraints simultaneously in order to assess the aggregate farmer s economic damages caused by climate change empirical crop production function is the best practical approach for evaluating the reaction of plants to water shortage under climate change scenarios raes et al 2009 the fao irrigation and drainage paper introduced an important yet simple reference for determining the reaction of agricultural crops yield to water this method provides a standard for crop water production functions as eq 10 that has been used extensively heidecke and heckelei 2010 10 y a y m 1 k y k y e t a e t m this equation is based on a single relation that relates the relative reduction in crop yields to their relative decline in water consumption evapotranspiration using the specific coefficient of ky for each crop ya is the observed simulated yield ym is the potential yield assuming that water is not limited ky is the coefficient of the crop yield reaction to water and eta and etm are the actual and potential evapo transpiration of the crop growth period respectively the yield potential of different crops in the basin is calculated based on the fao agricultural ecological zoning approach and then adjusted based on expert opinions and historical observations in this study the reference and potential evapo transpiration and the effective rainfall for the base and future periods were simulated in cropwat for three spatial regions upstream middle and downstream of the zayandehroud basin not all the information required for the calculation of this parameter in future periods is generated by gcms models thus simulations were carried out through a regression relationship between the average temperature and etm of the historical period with 25 years of observations assuming maximization of the aggregated gross margin of zayandehroud basin agricultural activities the standard pmp model was modified in a way that the values of etafs were determined endogenously with the levels of crops acreages xf 11 m a x i m i z e z f 1 f p f y f x f f 1 f ϕ f x f 0 5 γ f f x f x f subject to 12 f 1 f x f l a n d λ l a n d 13 y

variable of the area allocated to the fth crops pf is the price of each product unit yf shows the yield of fth product and ϕ f and γ f f are the constant and slop of production cost function respectively l a n d is the total availability of irrigated land eq 13 balances the predicted crop yields based on the interactive effect of net consumed water across crop growth stages and potential yields in which yf and y f m are the actual and potential yield of the fth crops respectively kyfs is the yield reaction coefficient of the fth crop to the water in the sth season and etafs and etmfs

crop in the sth season etagfs was calculated in terms of crop seasonal net water requirements etajs and irrigation efficiency ef irr the sum of water consumption in the sth season by various crops and seasonal total water resources surface plus groundwater availability wats were limited by eq 16 a low bound for irrigation deficiency eq 16 imposes upon the model in such a way that the percentage of crop irrigation deficiency in every season does not exceed 50 of its potential evapo transpiration this model is solved by solving nonlinear optimization problems in which the decision variables are the level of cultivation land allocated to various crops xf and seasonal crop irrigation rates etafs in order to maximize the aggregate farmer s gross margin in overall agricultural activities in the zayandehroud river basin 4 results and discussion 4 1 climate change projections the results of climate change projections made using cgcm3t63 and hadcm3 models for the dam basin and the whole zayandehroud river basin are presented in table 3 chehelgard hydrometric station located at the entry of water transfer tunnels koohrang 1 and 2 was selected as the representative station for the dam basin and an average of all basin climatology stations were used as representative of the whole zayandehroud river basin because of the lack of daily temperature data to introduce into the weather generator model the broken line method was used to obtain a 30 year stochastic series of daily maximum and minimum temperatures with the width of moving window 7 100 year daily maximum and minimum temperatures as well as precipitation series were stimulated to exert long term changes to climate parameters in the output of the weather generator the strategic re sampling technique was implemented on the observational series based on the specific output of large scale models the condition for success in simulating climate change is the proper functioning of the meteorological generator so that it can produce series with the desired statistical length and optimal quality that have statistical similarities with the observed series fig 5 shown appropriate consistencies between simulated and observational monthly series of zayendehroud minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation the general results indicated that throughout the future periods the amount of annual precipitation in the zayandehroud river basin will diminish while the temperature will increase changes in the average annual precipitation of the basin in the a1b scenario were projected to be 23 1 and 16 3 for 2040 and 2070 respectively in addition to decreased total annual precipitation the seasonal pattern of rainfall is also expected to change in both periods the amount of autumn and winter precipitation will declined whereas the opposite is projected for spring and summer projection results also imply a general tendency of the temperature parameter to increase the minimum temperature will increase by 1 3 c and 1 4 c by 2040 and 2070 respectively the corresponding values of these numbers for the maximum temperature will be 0 7 c and 1 c respectively overall there is an agreement between the direction of changes in precipitation reduction and temperature increase for the two periods however projected temperature changes are greater for 2070 than for 2040 while changes in precipitation for the time period 2040 2069 will be more moderate compared to the period ending in 2040 this means that more dramatic changes in agricultural water demand and crop yields can be expected in 2070 compared to 2040 the extent of precipitation changes in the dam basin the main source of transferred water to the basin is projected to be far less than the average precipitation change in the whole zayandehroud river basin as observed the reduction in precipitation in this part of the basin was projected to be only 3 1 and 6 4 for the periods of 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 respectively 4 2 impact of climate change on river run off neural network model of zayendehroud rainfall runoff validated by calculated r2 and nash sutcliffe criteria in trend and validation periods as shown in table 4 by introducing the changes in precipitation in the dam basin into the the river runoff was simulated at the dam entry point table 5 the results revealed that the inflow into zayandehroud dam would generally be reduced in all months of the year in both periods of 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 compared with the baseline however the variation in inflow is estimated to be greater during autumn and winter than during spring and summer the greatest reduction in river runoff in both periods is predicted to occur in february 7 9 and 19 4 for 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 respectively the average amount of reduction in the annual inflow for periods 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 is estimated to be 3 4 and 8 1 respectively comparing the reduction in annual precipitation at the dam basin with the percentage change of runoff suggests a greater sensitivity in the hydrological parameters than in rainfall due to climate change conner et al 2009 confirmed the existence of a nonlinear relationship between the amount of discharge and annual precipitation and concluded that in dry basins the percentage of runoff changes in relation to changes in precipitation is most often greater than one regardless of the projected reduction in the surface water supply in response to climate change it is also expected that the water requirements to meet the demands of both domestic and industry sectors will increase from 608 5 mcm at baseline to 892 4 46 7 growth 788 mcm 44 growth and 683 mcm 12 2 growth by 2040 in optimistic pessimistic and mixed scenarios respectively the corresponding values of these non agriculture water demands for 2070 are 1510 6 1225 8 and 894 5 mcm respectively see table 1 comparing the increase in water demand with the decrease in water supply in the future indicates the further significance of socioeconomic scenarios compared to climate change scenarios in the management of the basin s water resources 4 3 impact of climate and socio economic changes on water price and allocation the he semz model consisting of 137 variables 89 equations and one nonlinear objective function was programmed in gams brooke et al 1988 and solved by conopt solver under three general solutions baseline current climate and socioeconomic conditions baseline scenarios in the future current climate with future socioeconomic conditions hereafter referred to baseline 2040s and baseline 2070s and climate change scenarios future climate and socioeconomic conditions hereafter referred to as a1b 2040s and a1b 2070s in this model the shadow value of water plays a key role in the efficient water allocation across various users implying that the value of water is not constant and changes as the amount of available water changes table 6 demonstrates the sensitivity of water price for different users to socio economic and climate change scenarios the first row of this table indicates the basin average annual runoff and the economic implicit prices of water across different users for the baseline period in future baseline scenarios the river inflow do not change compared to the baseline period the only change is an increase in water demand of domestic and industrial sectors resulting in the rightward rotation of their water demand functions this intensifies the water shortage for agricultural activities and thus increases the shadow price of water in this sector the average economic price of agricultural water during the baseline is 1303 rials m3 it is predicted that under the most likely socio economic changes mixed scenario with an average increase of 12 2 by 2040 and 47 0 by 2070 in non agricultural water demand the value of agricultural water will increase to 1334 4 and 1404 1 rials m3 in the baseline 2040s and baseline 2070s respectively in the a1b 2040 and a1b 2070 scenarios the percentage of increase in the agricultural water price is also projected to be higher 8 7 and 12 5 respectively under these climate change scenarios the water price also grows in the industry and domestic sectors however the percentage change is far less than that of the agricultural sector due to lower water demand elasticity changes in agricultural water price are not the same across various water demand sites such as that at the upstream basin where water has a lower economic value while enjoying higher demand elasticity and has greater sensitivity to reduced runoff in comparison with the middle and downstream basins the variation in implicit price of water results in the altered temporal and spatial allocation of water resources to different uses across the basin and in turn changes the net economic surpluses of the water system table 7 lists these changes in the baseline 2040s and baseline 2070s total industrial and domestic water demand is fully met part of this growth is compensated by reducing the level of water allocated to the agricultural sector another part is offset by increasing the release of water from the dam and further withdrawal of groundwater in zones with no limitation on water withdrawal therefore under these scenarios the amount of the water withdrawn by the agricultural sector in the entire basin will decrease by about 1 7 79 3 mcm and 5 9 298 2 mcm respectively the major portion of the reduction in water allocated to the agricultural sector is also related to the zones z5 and z6 located in the basin s downstream with higher demand elasticity and lower economic value for water the total amount of water withdrawn from the basin under these scenarios will grow by 1 95 and 1 5 respectively the welfare implication of these changes is decreased economic surplus of the agricultural sector 1 02 and 2 1 in baseline 2040 and baseline 2070 respectively and in return increased economic surplus in the domestic 33 5 and 63 7 and industry 21 and 51 5 sectors and transition of the society as a whole to a higher welfare status compared with the baseline period the reasons for this are the reallocation of water to higher value uses and further withdrawal from the water resources of the basin 4 4 the impact of climate change on the agricultural sector 4 4 1 crop water demand and crop yield to avoid aggregation error crop water demand and crop yield were simulated in three spatial regions upstream middle and downstream of the basin and then the weighted average of their changes in relation with the base period was calculated fig 6 demonstrates the increased water demand of the main crops cultivated in the basin under climate change conditions based on the current area under cultivation the greatest variations in water needs in both periods were projected for alfalfa wheat and barley such that the extent of these increase ranged from 30 to 34 for alfalfa 16 25 for wheat and 17 29 for barley considering a 10 increase in water demand as the drought stress borderline it can be concluded that these crops would suffer the stress of increased water demand in future periods and thus the adoption of adaptive measures is inevitable in contrast the vulnerability of summer and spring cultivations has been less estimated than winter crops in terms of the increase in water demand overall these changes cause the total net agricultural water demand of the basin major crops to increase from 1164 mcm per year in the base period to 1350 2 mcm and 1379 8 mcm in the 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 periods respectively based on the current areas under cultivation overall the zayandehroud basin will face the stress of increased water demand in the future periods the intensity of this elevation ranges from 16 weighted mean in 2010 2039s period to 18 5 within the 2040 2069 period increased water demand means the same level of agricultural water shortage in the future periods regardless of any reduction in water allocation amount to this sector in response to socio economic changes and or decline in river runoff due to climate if increased climatic humidity deficiency is not offset by further supplies of irrigation water by the farmers then crop yields will decline the results shown in table 6 indicate that climate change will most probably result in a dramatic decrease in the yields of the major winter crops of the basin wheat barley onion alfalfa and potato and a moderate decline in the yields of summer crops rice cotton sunflower and beetroot the largest yield decrease in both periods was estimated for onion 22 1 and 24 4 while the slightest one was estimated for sunflower 0 9 to 0 5 note that the changes reported in table 8 were estimated while neglecting the fertilizer effect of co2 under certain conditions of water and nutrient levels available to a plant as the co2 concentration increases water consumption efficiency and hence the ratio of biomass to consumed water increase in crop photosynthesis processes in this case part of the yield reduction might be compensated through this effect however the impacts of co2 on crop yields under climate change are an uncertain and challenging issue 4 4 2 impact of climate change and adaptation on farm income and land use the impact of climate change on a farmer s income is the aggregate outcome of physical changes e g crop yields and availability of water resources and human behavioral changes physical changes are the direct result of variations in climatic parameters as was indicated for the zayandehroud river basin climate change and changes in socio economic scenarios lead to decreased availability of water resources for agricultural activities the output of the he semz increased water demand and diminished agricultural crop yields the behavioral changes are the result of farmers rational and optimal decision making when facing physical changes when the restriction of and demand for water resources grow the farmer s decision will be directed towards cultivating plants with a higher value of water and less water demand similarly in response to these changes farmers might prevent a substantial decrease in the area under cultivation through some degree of deficit irrigation therefore physical changes are not transferred with the same ratio to economic changes at the farm level in this research physical changes were transferred to a pmp economic model simulating farmers decision making when confronting changes in water resource availability crop water demand and actual crop yield therefore the effect of climate change on total acreage of crop production cropping pattern and total gross margin of agricultural productions was estimated under three adaptation strategies including scenario 1 sc1 no use of any adaptive measures scenario 2 sc2 farmers respond to climate and socio economic changes by changing their cropping pattern scenario 3 sc3 farmers respond to climate and socio economic changes by changing their cropping patterns and deciding on optimal water irrigation in the first strategy it is assumed that farmers make absolutely no effort to adapt in order to fight the changes in water resources availability crop water demand and crop yield in the real world this assumption does not seem to be realistic because the scarcity of water resources and the resulting increase in water opportunity cost changes the choice of farmers with respect to the type of cultivated crops and acreage levels allocated to each sc2 in the third strategy cs3 a more realistic situation it is assumed that when facing water shortages farmers will not only alter their choice of cropping pattern but also change their decision about the amount of irrigation water supply irrigation deficiency for different crops decrease increase yields or increase decrease the area under cultivation of various crops table 5 indicates the agricultural land use and farmers income changes in response to socioeconomic and climate changes based on the results of the he semz model the amount of water allocated to the agricultural sector will be reduced by 136 and 452 million cubic meters within the 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 periods respectively the results table 9 showed that in the worst case if farmers do not apply any adaptation strategy in response to climate change the total gross revenue of the agricultural sector in the basin will decline 18 1 in the period of 2010 2039 and 32 in the period of 2040 2069 in this situation it is anticipated that the total irrigated crop acreage will diminish about 4 4 and 14 6 relative to the base case farmers losses due to climate change under sc2 when farmers respond to these changes by changing their decisions related to crop acreage and cropping pattern are estimated to be less than those of sc1 in which farmers do not use any adaptation as shown in table 9 the percentage of reduction in total agricultural gross revenue in this case is 12 2 and 18 2 respectively which are significantly less than the values of 18 1 and 32 in sc1 as shown in table 8 the share of major crops in the basin including wheat potato rice and cotton in the cropping pattern will diminish under these conditions compared with the basic state in contrast the area under cultivation of barley alfalfa and beans will grow results also showed that when simultaneously applying two no cost adaptation strategies selection of optimal cropping pattern and optimal crop irrigation deficiency sc3 the area under cultivation not only not reduced but at the reduced level of water resources it can also be enhanced from 229 000 ha at the base year to 245 500 7 2 and 237 000 ha within the 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 periods respectively in this way farmers total economic losses from climate change can be reduced to 2 8 and 9 9 in the periods of 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 respectively this is significantly lower than the corresponding figures in the sc1 and sc2 scenarios 5 conclusion by the middle of this century the factor of climate change coupled with changes in socio economic factors will result in additional stress on water resources and the agricultural sector of the basin for example with the criterion of reducing 10 of water resources as a limit to the water resource crisis in the zayandehroud basin the results showed that up to the 1450 horizons the amount of water allocated to the agricultural sector will be reduced by 9 which will increase the need for irrigation from 17 to 19 stress on water resources and the agricultural sector will be higher in future periods due to the increasing demand for water for drinking and in the industry sector as compared to reduced water supplies due to climate change this illustrates the role of socio economic alternatives in the status of resources and water use in the watershed in the coming decades and the necessity to integrate these alternatives with the pathway for climate change in future studies moreover the important role of demand management policy in the domestic and industry sectors of the future in order to reduce water consumption efficiently and thus reduce the stress on the water resources and agricultural sector of the basin is evidenced applying demand management policies for example efficient and economical water pricing while reducing water consumption reducing the stress on water resources and the agricultural sector in the basin and improving the financial situations of water supply companies can be adaptive approaches to climate change as the results of the current research show to manage the water resources of the basin it is possible to cope with the consequences of climate change by applying cost free adaptation strategies at the macro level where efforts should be made to ensure the flexibility of the water allocation system and the conditions for moving towards a water market allocation system and at the sector level with emphasis on agriculture where a regional strategy document should be developed for selecting an optimal cropping pattern and an deficit irrigation strategy for each crop in addition to cost effective solutions there are other implementation strategies such as transferring between water basins changing cultivars through research and development increasing irrigation efficiency and building dams and more water infrastructures and etc naturally the implementation of any of these solutions will impose costs on the community thus they should be implemented within the framework of the cost benefit analysis for example transferring water between the basins although improving the status of the water resources and bringing economic benefits for the destination basin but regardless of its capital costs its implementation may have negative economic environmental and possibly social effects for the transferring basin declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10475,climate change has drastic impacts on water resources and agricultural productivity especially in arid and semi arid environments the present study simulated and explored the economic impacts of climate change on the water and agriculture sectors of the zayandehroud river basin in iran for the years 2040 and 2070in three major phases in phase i two general circulation models gcm hadcm2 and cgcm3t63 an artificial neural network ann rainfall runoff model and crop water production functions were applied to evaluate the biophysical impacts of climate change on water resources and various crop yields in phase ii the aforementioned models were integrated into the hydro economic spatial equilibrium model of zayandehroud basin he semz and the effects of the modeled runoff and socio economics changes on the economic welfare of the water sector its distributional consequences and on temporal spatial water prices and allocation were simulated in phase iii the simulated optimal allocated water to the agriculture sector was introduced into a positive mathematical programming pmp model of the agriculture sector to simulate follow on changes in crop acreage cropping patterns and farmers gross benefit in this modeling framework the role of two no cost adaptation strategies in agriculture i e modifications in crop irrigation and cropping pattern were also investigated the results showed that by mid century precipitation will be reduced and temperature increased in the zayandehroud river basin the direct result of these changes will be a reduction in the basin discharge by 4 3 in 2040 and 8 1 in 2070 compared to the base period the simulated economic value of water showed upward trends under climate change and socio economic scenarios reflecting an increase in water scarcity in response to changes in the scarcity value of water users respond by changing their patterns of water use and allocation the withdrawal by each sector decreases in response to reduced runoff although agriculture will be more responsive the results of the pmp model showed that by choosing optimal cropping pattern and an optimum deficient irrigation strategy for each crop there will be good opportunities for farmers to adapt to increasing water scarcity and higher temperatures induced by climate change jel classification c61 q54 q25 keywords climate change cropping pattern economic impacts hydro economic model river basin 1 introduction today climate change is one of the most important problems facing communities because of its long term effects on current and future generations yazdanpanah and zobydi 2017 climate change is an inevitable phenomenon of natural and human origins to which reduction and adaptation are needed to reduce the severity of its impacts and damages koundinya et al 2018 climate change is the biggest 21st century environmental challenge that has broad impacts on various economic sectors human communities natural resources and biodiversity water resources and agriculture are the sectors most dependent on climate as it directly determines the temporal and spatial availability of resources and their productivity bantin et al 2017 in addition these sectors are strongly linked to other economic sectors and claim a large portion of the economy especially in developing countries climate change will have a significant influence on the sustainability of water supply both quantitatively and qualitatively human health and the food supply in future decades bhave et al 2018 in addition agriculture is a climate sensitive sector that must adapt to climate change to maintain its economic vitality and meet the increasing caloric demands of a growing population mu et al 2017 the direct physical effects of climate change on water resources and agriculture have indirect implications on social economic and environmental systems thereby changing the management and allocation of land and water resources numerous studies worldwide have examined the complex relations between climate change and water resources as well as agriculture various studies have explored how climate change might affect global water scarcity in the future using population projections and simulated changes in climate from global climate models gcms with water resources models simon and arnell 2016 understanding the effects of climate change on water resource systems has been extensively attempted in the last few decades fant et al 2015 brown and wilby 2012 haasnoot and middelkoop 2012 a review of these studies gives evidence that this issue needs to be studied in more detail considering various climatic and socio economic conditions it has been argued that even with aggressive strategies to stabilize the concentration of atmosphere carbon dioxide between 400 and 500 ppm the occurrence of climate change in the future is inevitable on the general scale quiggin et al 2010 it has been predicted that the vulnerability of developing countries would be greater than that of developed countries also the water and agricultural commodities supplies in addition to changes in their relative prices in response to climate change would lead to structural changes of resources allocation among different sectors to changes in the comparative advantages in favor of one region at the expense of another and to alteration of the economic and commercial structures of countries iran is located in a dry and semi dry region of the world and such countries are especially vulnerable to the predicted impacts of climate change on water resources xia et al 2016 trends in historical meteorological data as well as future climate change projections indicate that temperatures will increase and spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation will change in the future as they have in recent decades fant et al 2015 analysis of data from five meteorological stations with at least 100 years of records revealed a significant increase in the average annual temperature ipcc projections on climate change a1 scenario also indicate that the average annual temperature will increase by 2 c until 2040 and by 3 5 4 c by the year 2100 they also predict a decrease of 10 20 in the average level of precipitation moreover it is anticipated that cereal production will decrease by 30 in the next 30 years ipcc 2007 these issues present a serious challenge to dry and low precipitation regions of iran many studies have evaluated climate change and its consequences in iran however they have tried to detect either long term trends in climatic and hydrological variables abdi dehkordi et al 2017 modarres and silva 2007 hejam et al 2008 or the physical effects of climate change on runoff and crop yields abrishamchi et al 2007 ashofteh and massah bovani 2007 khorshiddust and ghavidel rahimi 2008 the outcomes of such studies offer only a potential estimate of climate change impacts and have limited managerial implications climate change not only affects the biophysical variables but also influences the type and amount of water consumption in various activities the shadow price of water and agriculture cropping patterns rojas downing et al 2017 emphasis on the potential effects of climate change only and disregarding adaptive adjustments in market and farmer behaviors causes the overestimation of vulnerability for instance runoff reduction deepens competition between different uses and consumers and in turn increases the price of water resulting in water reallocation among users by moving from less value to high value consumption therefore a part of the predicted impact on water resources in biophysical modeling is modified by price changes at the market level farmers also react to water deficits by changing cultivation patterns and crop irrigation schemes williams and carrico 2017 nevertheless climate change is only one aspect of future challenges to water resources management changing socio economic conditions are more important in outlining the situation of water resources at both national and regional scales menzel et al 2019 socioeconomic scenarios are also key factors that determine the degree of vulnerability to climate change rodríguez et al 2015 the impact analysis of climate change using hybrid models which integrate the complex relationships between economic hydrological and agronomic elements as well as adaptation strategies with socioeconomic trends gives a more realistic evaluation of water resources and the vulnerability of the agricultural sector the current survey showed that there is a huge research gap in this area in iran the aim of this research therefore was to investigate the economic impacts of climate change on the water resources and agricultural sector of the zayandehroud river basin by developing a hydro economic model of the spatial equilibrium of water basin and an agricultural positive mathematical programming model 2 area under study the zayandehroud river basin about 26 000 km2 is located in the central iranian plateau and stretches about 350 km from west to east the koohrang mountains are the major water source for the zayandehroud the area s climate varies from hyper arid to very wet annual precipitation varies from about 1400 mm in the koohrang mountains to 50 mm in the southeast the precipitation regime is mediterranean and the maximum precipitation falls from january to march despite the completion of many water resources development and water transfer projects koohrang and cheshmelangan tunnels the basin usually faces a water shortage and intensive competition because of rapid demand growth the gavkhooni swamp is an international wetland ecosystem located in this basin and covers over 430 000 ha the minimum critical and optimal levels of environmental water requirement are 2 2 m3 s 69 4 mcm per year and 4 5 m3 s 142 mcm per year respectively however total annual inflow river natural flow drains outputs to this swamp averages a mere 33 mcm which is far lower than the desirable amount and even lower than the critical water requirement level moreover it is predicted that climate change will reduce river inflow by about 10 by the year 2040 massah bavani and morid 2005 if water consumption grows with the current trend the basin will not be able to reliably supply water by 2020 and with a 10 reduction in water resources the area will be under water stress thus it is important to evaluate how climate change affects water resources water uses and the welfare of water consumers especially the agriculture sector 3 methods and models the integrated modeling required by this research had four elements that are closely linked climate modeling a hydrological model of rainfall runoff a hydro economic model of the water basin and a positive mathematical programming pmp model of the agriculture sector fig 1 shows the schematized interactions between models identifying the basic processes used in this research and the information flows between them it is necessary to mention here while one can simply use the pmp model to calibrate observed baseline water use and cropping patterns and simulate the impact of climate change and socio economic changes and farmer s reaction with regards to different adaptation strategies but in this paper to avoidance of model complexity subject to the presence of irrigation deficiency equations in the model and simultaneously determining of optimal crops irrigation and crop pattern and the possibility of specifying a more detailed model in agricultural sector we prefer to use two positive mathematical programming separately one for water allocation in water user sectors level and another for optimal allocation of land and predetermined agricultural water resources between different crops 3 1 climate change modeling general circulation models gcms provide physically based predictions of how climate might change as a result of increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other trace gases in this study the response of the zayandehroud basin to climate change was evaluated using hadcm3 and cgcm3t63 archived by the ipcc data distribution center for b1 and a1b scenarios a major part of the zayandehroud water is provided through inter basin water transfer by koohrang and cheshmelangan tunnels which are located west of the zayandehroud dam therefore climate change was simulated in two spatial sites the basin upstream from the dam and the zayandehroud river basin downstream from the dam conditional probability density kernel estimator and k nearest neighbor knn approaches with the ability to extrapolate data from an artificial data series were used to downscale the monthly precipitation in the dam s basin and for simulate daily temperature and precipitation in the zayandehroud river basin respectively the weather generators are not able to record long term changes in climate parameters deviation from climatic normal in the output of large scale prediction models and based on predetermined scenarios to exert these changes in the observed series the strategic re sampling technique was used considering the efficiency of the knn generator in simulating a long term climate normal and its significant conformity with historical normals exerting changes in the observed series by strategic re sampling can be transferred into the simulated climate data series by running the knn generator resulting in the generation of an artificial series put on climate change in fig 2 steps of applied nonparametric downscaling approach were depicted 3 2 rainfall runoff modeling a conceptual model of neural networks was used to simulate the runoff response to climate change in the zayandehroud river basin neural networks have found great applications in the simulation of complex hydrological relationships uvo et al 2000 hsu et al 2002 mazvimavi et al 2005 parida et al 2006 a neural network is a set of neurons that connect in various layers with a special architecture the number of layers and neurons of a network and their placement form the architecture of a network mathematical functions known as neuron transfer functions are used to transfer the input to the output for each neuron fig 3 demonstrates the sample architecture of a three layer neural network with a fully connected and feed forward structure the first layer is the input layer which in this sample has four neurons number of independent variables plus one constant input neuron showing the bias in the network equations the number of the neurons in the middle layer controls the network flexibility in the precision of prediction there is no direct method for estimating the number of the neurons in this layer the number of neurons in the output layer is equal to the number of predicted vector variables here river runoff was simulated for the entire basin and for the dam s basin the independent variables in simulation of the runoff at the basin scale were the maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation while for the dam s basin only the precipitation variable was selected algorithm of zayendehroud hydrological simulation by neural network model is as fallowed 1 gathering enough sets of inputs explanatory variables and outputs independent variable for preparation of the model 2 selection of appropriate number of observational pairs as training set and the residuals as a testing set neural network model trains by training set model calibration 3 entering inputs of testing set into the designed model and record the calculated outputs model validation 4 comparing the estimated outputs obtained from the former step with real observational outputs and calculation of model error for different ratios of training and testing sets 5 comparing model errors obtained in step 4 and determining of appropriate number for training and testing sets based on least model error 6 repeating this algorithm with change in network architecture up to achieving a network with least modeling error compared to other networks the validity and reliability of ann model performance in simulation of river run off checked by the two criteria of r2 and nash sutcliffe in the trend and validation periods 3 3 socio economic scenarios in climate change studies it is important to explore how society and the economy will change in the future here three socio economic scenarios and three scenarios of unconstrained water demand in the zayandehroud water basin in the future in the absence of climate change table1 scenario 1 optimistic is more in line with iran s short and midterm national socio economic development programs in contrast scenario 2 pessimistic represents the continuation of past trends in future periods scenario 3 is a mixture of current trends and national development programs in both the short and midterm it is expected that the structure of basin water demands will change in the future in response to more competition between sectors irrespective of changes in water resource availability due to climate change the increased water demand of non agriculture sectors will result in decreased water resources available to the agriculture sector based on iran s institutional arrangements for water resource management under conditions of water deficiency and drought demands of the domestic and industrial sectors take priority over the agriculture sector and even the environment 3 4 hydro economic spatial equilibrium model of zayandehroud river basin he semz in this study a hydro economic spatial equilibrium model was developed to integrate the effects of climate change scenarios on spatial temporal and inter sectoral water allocation as well as welfare distribution of the zayandehroud water resources he semz is a basin scale endogenous price mathematical model formulated under the partial equilibrium framework of the water sector following samuelson 1952 takayama and judge 1964 vaux and howitt 1984 ward et al 2001 and hurd et al 1999a 1999b 2004 samuelson 1952 reported that maximizing the economic surplus corresponds to clear competitive market equilibrium therefore the water sector model in which multiple water consumers j 1 2 3 j are in the market can be specified by maximizing the net benefits of water in the entire basin as in eqs 1 and 2 griffin 2005 1 max z j 1 j b j w j c j w j j α j 1 2 β j w j w j c j w j 2 subject to j 1 j w j w λ where bj wj and cj wj are the total benefits and costs of water resources consumption for the jth consumer respectively wj is the amount of water withdrawal and αj and βj are parameters of water demand functions of the jth consumer the constraint in this problem states that the sum of the amounts of water diverted by all consumers should be equal to the total inventory of water resources solving the first order conditions for maximization of the problem gives 3 m b j m c j λ for all j 1 2 j 4 mn b j λ for all j 1 2 j the efficient amount of water consumption by each consumer is where the marginal benefits mb resulting from water consumption is equal to the marginal cost of water supply mc plus the social or scarcity value of the natural resource λ at the equilibrium point the marginal net benefits mnbj are equal for all consumers as much as λ which is a value attributed to the scarcity of the natural resource as the scarcity of water resources intensifies for example in response to climate change the value of λ also increases and vice versa by introducing the spatial and temporal dimensions of water allocation and integrating basin wide hydrological constraints into this theoretical economic model the objective function of the he semz was reiterated in the form of maximizing total economic net benefits of consumptive e g agriculture domestic and industry and non consumptive e g recreational benefits of water storage in zayandehroud dam water uses in this process a set of hydrological constraints eq 6 to eq 9 including the river flow balance the balance of reservoir water storage ground water supply surface reservoir evaporation and supplying environmental water rights constraints of the gavkhooni swamp were super imposed the main properties of the zayandehroud river basin including tributaries water flows entrance simple nodes and nodes for supply storage and consumption are shown in fig 4 the definitions of the variables parameters and indices of the he semz are summarized in table 2 objective function maximizing total net economic benefits of water basin

one key aspect of this model is the role of economic value of water as a driving force for the management of the water resources system this value is often shown with mathematical functions relating the economic value of water to the amount of water consumption when water supply declines in response to decreased river inflow for example in response to climate change the value of the resource scarcity increases signaling consumers in various regions to allocate water to higher value uses vaux and howitt 1984 hurd et al 2004 key assumptions of the model and parameters estimation methods are as follows linear demand function following hurd et al 2004 hurd coonrod 2007 and vaux et al 2003 and for simplicity we assumed linear demand function for all consumptive users agriculture industry and domestic sectors linearization of non linear functions or physical process equations is often employed to allow the use of linear programming which guarantees a global optimum if nonlinear equations are used model size is often further reduced for computational reasons harou et al 2009 agricultural water demand estimation water is an input for agricultural production therefore the economic value of water could be estimated by isolating the marginal contribution of water in the value of total production medellín azuara et al 2010 there are two general methods kindler and russell 1984 young 2005 scheierling et al 2006 inductive and deductive for achieving this purpose here the deductive method pmp optimization model howitt 2005 was used to estimate the economic value and water demand in the agricultural sector as the value of agricultural water is affected by various factors and constraints e g cropping pattern irrigation scheduling and technology it can fluctuate greatly across different sites and seasons here these functions were estimated for each demand site and each season spring summer and fall industrial water demand estimation for calibrating linear demand function for industry sector we need to know demand elasticity price and amount of water consumption the elasticity of water demand for this sector was estimated by the marginal productivity method wang and lall 2002 nahman and de lange 2013 and water production elasticity due to the lack of time series or cross section data for individual sites and industry groups a translog production function for the entire basin was estimated using 2 digit international standard industrial coding isic level data from the iranian statistical center isc 2010 calibration of domestic water demand davidson et al 2009 proposed that the value given by households to the domestic water can be calculated by estimating the elasticity ε price p and amount q of water in a given year the slope of the demand function b and the intercept term α were calculated by a point elasticity formula george et al 2011 household water demand elasticity has been estimated in various studies in iran sharzei and kolahi 2014 adibpour and shirashyani 2014 the results indicate that the structure of the household water demand is not highly influenced by climatic and geographical conditions across various regions here an average water demand elasticity of 0 22 indicating relatively high inelasticity was applied considering the aforementioned studies integrating socioeconomic scenarios in the model in order to analyze the effects of future climate change on water economy a baseline scenario in the future must be created by transferring the model from the current basic year to a future baseline scenario however the response of water economy to climate change is also affected by socioeconomic conditions to consider any possible future changes in socioeconomic conditions the water demand functions were rotated toward the right considering the socioeconomic trends given in table 1 basin s water supply resources resources for the zayandehroud water supply include mainly inter basin water transfer koohrang 1 and 2 and cheshmeh langan tunnels groundwater and basin inflows the seasonal average water supply for each of these resources within a 5 year period 2006 2010 was calculated and considered as the baseline scenario water availability water transfer projects from zayandehroud basin to outside several water transfer projects for the provision of potable water to cities located outside the basin yazd 50 mcm kashan 50 mcm ardestan 1 8 mcm naein 2 26 mcm and jughuyeh irrigation canal were exploited outflow water from the basin was all integrated into one node of out of basin use and it was assumed that the dewatering point of this node is the dam environmental water requirement of ghavkhoni swamp and recreational benefit of dam water storage the ghavkhooni swamp is an endpoint natural ecosystem of the zayandehroud river s flow the quantity and quality of the entering water are largely dependent on the extent of water released from the dam and the water withdrawal for consumptive uses along the 350 km upstream the minimum critical required level for continuation of the swamp s vital activities 2 2 m3 s or 69 4 mcm per year was considered as the environmental water rights constrain in all scenarios the recreational benefits of water storage in the zayandehrud dam reservoir are estimated seasonally as a function of the volume of water storage in the reservoir based on the number of people visiting the dam site and the amount of their willingness to pay travel cost method the general form of these seasonal recreational benefit functions is t b s φ s 0 5 β s 2 no constant term where tb is the total recreation benefit of each season s is the amount of water storage in the dam reservoir in that season and φ and β are parameters that were estimated by the maximum entropy approach base on seasonal visit rate people willingness to pay and the amount of water storage in the reservoir in the base period cost of water supply estimation of non linear water cost functions was performed using the three stages calibration approach of howitt 1995 in the first we solved the normative hydro economy model with terms of average costs of production transfer storage and distribution of water for each water user sector in the model objective function and calibration alongside with other hydrological constraints given the amount of dual values shadow price of calibration constrain in the second stage the slope coefficients matrix of costs functions was estimated by the maximum entropy method finally in the last stage sector s non linear cost functions substituted with the average cost terms in the hydro economic model objective function and ran the model again average costs of water supply for each sector were calculated as a weighted average of surface and groundwater cost of water production transfer storage and distribution by solving the calibrated model under different scenarios the optimal values of the decision variables including spatial and temporal water economic prices and allocation levels to various consumers the amount of seasonal water storage in the reservoir and total net economic benefits of consumptive and non consumptive water uses across the entire basin were obtained the difference between the values of these variables across different scenarios and their corresponding baseline figures suggests the net effects of climate change and socioeconomic scenarios 3 5 the effect of climate change on the basin s agricultural sector and the role of climate change strategies the agricultural sector is the largest water consumer about 90 of water across the zayandehroud water basin and hence gives a considerable portion of the socioeconomic profits of water however it is more vulnerable to climate change than other sectors because its production processes are highly exposed to the climate it also enjoys a somewhat lower priority in institutional arrangements regarding water allocation because of the lower value of water in other words this sector is the main victim of a water supply deficit e g caused by climate change or increase in water demand e g caused by socioeconomic trends in the he sems although the role of water economic value and the reallocation of water resources among various sites and sectors implicitly exist for achieving the maximum net benefits the adaptive strategies that can be taken by farmers at farm level in response to a water shortage are neglected on the other hand what is considered as the agricultural welfare loss in the he semz is the loss of profits from water reduction while the profit of the farmers flows not only out of the water but is a combination of the profits resulting from the application of all production inputs and crop yields therefore the economic impacts of climate change on farmers can be far greater than that estimated in the he semz thus attempts were made herein to estimate the effects of climate change on the agricultural sector in the basin using a two stage process and considering two no cost adaptive strategies i e cropping pattern change and selecting optimal irrigation deficiency the production of agricultural crops is not only directly influenced by rainfall temperature and evapo transpiration during the growth period it is also highly affected by the availability of water resources for agriculture climate change will alter the amounts and patterns of precipitation evaporation runoff water resources availability and soil water storage therefore the impact of climate change on agriculture includes both direct effects increased evaporation decreased effective precipitation and declined biomass and indirect effects decreased water resources changes in crop water requirement are a direct result of temperature changes and diminished precipitation signifies the further dependence of agricultural products on irrigation in situations of lowered availability of water resources for the agricultural sector under such conditions changes in irrigated crops are largely dependent upon the farmer s irrigation schedule if a water deficit for crops caused by climate change is fully compensated for through irrigation the reduction in yield might be trivial however the outcome of supplying more water per unit of area under conditions in which runoff has also declined is definitely a reduction in a farmer s total acreage under cultivation another decision of a farmer facing these changes might be to pursue profit maximization and implement some degree of crop irrigation deficiency preventing a substantial decrease in cultivation acreage by scarifying a part of the crop yield study results evidence that when the scarcity of water resources is intensified farmers usually aim to maximize profits rather than yield in allocating land and water resources to different productions agriculture modeling involves a two stage process the first stage is to simulate changes in crop yield using fao empirical crop production functions assuming that the decision of farmers regarding supplying irrigation water will not change in relation to the current conditions the second stage involves using an economic optimization tool what s best to determine the profit maximizing combination of land use and seasonal irrigation deficiency rate for each crop in the basin level given resource and environmental constraints simultaneously in order to assess the aggregate farmer s economic damages caused by climate change empirical crop production function is the best practical approach for evaluating the reaction of plants to water shortage under climate change scenarios raes et al 2009 the fao irrigation and drainage paper introduced an important yet simple reference for determining the reaction of agricultural crops yield to water this method provides a standard for crop water production functions as eq 10 that has been used extensively heidecke and heckelei 2010 10 y a y m 1 k y k y e t a e t m this equation is based on a single relation that relates the relative reduction in crop yields to their relative decline in water consumption evapotranspiration using the specific coefficient of ky for each crop ya is the observed simulated yield ym is the potential yield assuming that water is not limited ky is the coefficient of the crop yield reaction to water and eta and etm are the actual and potential evapo transpiration of the crop growth period respectively the yield potential of different crops in the basin is calculated based on the fao agricultural ecological zoning approach and then adjusted based on expert opinions and historical observations in this study the reference and potential evapo transpiration and the effective rainfall for the base and future periods were simulated in cropwat for three spatial regions upstream middle and downstream of the zayandehroud basin not all the information required for the calculation of this parameter in future periods is generated by gcms models thus simulations were carried out through a regression relationship between the average temperature and etm of the historical period with 25 years of observations assuming maximization of the aggregated gross margin of zayandehroud basin agricultural activities the standard pmp model was modified in a way that the values of etafs were determined endogenously with the levels of crops acreages xf 11 m a x i m i z e z f 1 f p f y f x f f 1 f ϕ f x f 0 5 γ f f x f x f subject to 12 f 1 f x f l a n d λ l a n d 13 y

respectively l a n d is the total availability of irrigated land eq 13 balances the predicted crop yields based on the interactive effect of net consumed water across crop growth stages and potential

seasonal total water resources surface plus groundwater availability wats were limited by eq 16 a low bound for irrigation deficiency eq 16 imposes upon the model in such a way that the percentage of crop irrigation deficiency in every season does not exceed 50 of its potential evapo transpiration this model is solved by solving nonlinear optimization problems in which the decision variables are the level of cultivation land allocated to various crops xf and seasonal crop irrigation rates etafs in order to maximize the aggregate farmer s gross margin in overall agricultural activities in the zayandehroud river basin 4 results and discussion 4 1 climate change projections the results of climate change projections made using cgcm3t63 and hadcm3 models for the dam basin and the whole zayandehroud river basin are presented in table 3 chehelgard hydrometric station located at the entry of water transfer tunnels koohrang 1 and 2 was selected as the representative station for the dam basin and an average of all basin climatology stations were used as representative of the whole zayandehroud river basin because of the lack of daily temperature data to introduce into the weather generator model the broken line method was used to obtain a 30 year stochastic series of daily maximum and minimum temperatures with the width of moving window 7 100 year daily maximum and minimum temperatures as well as precipitation series were stimulated to exert long term changes to climate parameters in the output of the weather generator the strategic re sampling technique was implemented on the observational series based on the specific output of large scale models the condition for success in simulating climate change is the proper functioning of the meteorological generator so that it can produce series with the desired statistical length and optimal quality that have statistical similarities with the observed series fig 5 shown appropriate consistencies between simulated and observational monthly series of zayendehroud minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation the general results indicated that throughout the future periods the amount of annual precipitation in the zayandehroud river basin will diminish while the temperature will increase changes in the average annual precipitation of the basin in the a1b scenario were projected to be 23 1 and 16 3 for 2040 and 2070 respectively in addition to decreased total annual precipitation the seasonal pattern of rainfall is also expected to change in both periods the amount of autumn and winter precipitation will declined whereas the opposite is projected for spring and summer projection results also imply a general tendency of the temperature parameter to increase the minimum temperature will increase by 1 3 c and 1 4 c by 2040 and 2070 respectively the corresponding values of these numbers for the maximum temperature will be 0 7 c and 1 c respectively overall there is an agreement between the direction of changes in precipitation reduction and temperature increase for the two periods however projected temperature changes are greater for 2070 than for 2040 while changes in precipitation for the time period 2040 2069 will be more moderate compared to the period ending in 2040 this means that more dramatic changes in agricultural water demand and crop yields can be expected in 2070 compared to 2040 the extent of precipitation changes in the dam basin the main source of transferred water to the basin is projected to be far less than the average precipitation change in the whole zayandehroud river basin as observed the reduction in precipitation in this part of the basin was projected to be only 3 1 and 6 4 for the periods of 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 respectively 4 2 impact of climate change on river run off neural network model of zayendehroud rainfall runoff validated by calculated r2 and nash sutcliffe criteria in trend and validation periods as shown in table 4 by introducing the changes in precipitation in the dam basin into the the river runoff was simulated at the dam entry point table 5 the results revealed that the inflow into zayandehroud dam would generally be reduced in all months of the year in both periods of 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 compared with the baseline however the variation in inflow is estimated to be greater during autumn and winter than during spring and summer the greatest reduction in river runoff in both periods is predicted to occur in february 7 9 and 19 4 for 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 respectively the average amount of reduction in the annual inflow for periods 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 is estimated to be 3 4 and 8 1 respectively comparing the reduction in annual precipitation at the dam basin with the percentage change of runoff suggests a greater sensitivity in the hydrological parameters than in rainfall due to climate change conner et al 2009 confirmed the existence of a nonlinear relationship between the amount of discharge and annual precipitation and concluded that in dry basins the percentage of runoff changes in relation to changes in precipitation is most often greater than one regardless of the projected reduction in the surface water supply in response to climate change it is also expected that the water requirements to meet the demands of both domestic and industry sectors will increase from 608 5 mcm at baseline to 892 4 46 7 growth 788 mcm 44 growth and 683 mcm 12 2 growth by 2040 in optimistic pessimistic and mixed scenarios respectively the corresponding values of these non agriculture water demands for 2070 are 1510 6 1225 8 and 894 5 mcm respectively see table 1 comparing the increase in water demand with the decrease in water supply in the future indicates the further significance of socioeconomic scenarios compared to climate change scenarios in the management of the basin s water resources 4 3 impact of climate and socio economic changes on water price and allocation the he semz model consisting of 137 variables 89 equations and one nonlinear objective function was programmed in gams brooke et al 1988 and solved by conopt solver under three general solutions baseline current climate and socioeconomic conditions baseline scenarios in the future current climate with future socioeconomic conditions hereafter referred to baseline 2040s and baseline 2070s and climate change scenarios future climate and socioeconomic conditions hereafter referred to as a1b 2040s and a1b 2070s in this model the shadow value of water plays a key role in the efficient water allocation across various users implying that the value of water is not constant and changes as the amount of available water changes table 6 demonstrates the sensitivity of water price for different users to socio economic and climate change scenarios the first row of this table indicates the basin average annual runoff and the economic implicit prices of water across different users for the baseline period in future baseline scenarios the river inflow do not change compared to the baseline period the only change is an increase in water demand of domestic and industrial sectors resulting in the rightward rotation of their water demand functions this intensifies the water shortage for agricultural activities and thus increases the shadow price of water in this sector the average economic price of agricultural water during the baseline is 1303 rials m3 it is predicted that under the most likely socio economic changes mixed scenario with an average increase of 12 2 by 2040 and 47 0 by 2070 in non agricultural water demand the value of agricultural water will increase to 1334 4 and 1404 1 rials m3 in the baseline 2040s and baseline 2070s respectively in the a1b 2040 and a1b 2070 scenarios the percentage of increase in the agricultural water price is also projected to be higher 8 7 and 12 5 respectively under these climate change scenarios the water price also grows in the industry and domestic sectors however the percentage change is far less than that of the agricultural sector due to lower water demand elasticity changes in agricultural water price are not the same across various water demand sites such as that at the upstream basin where water has a lower economic value while enjoying higher demand elasticity and has greater sensitivity to reduced runoff in comparison with the middle and downstream basins the variation in implicit price of water results in the altered temporal and spatial allocation of water resources to different uses across the basin and in turn changes the net economic surpluses of the water system table 7 lists these changes in the baseline 2040s and baseline 2070s total industrial and domestic water demand is fully met part of this growth is compensated by reducing the level of water allocated to the agricultural sector another part is offset by increasing the release of water from the dam and further withdrawal of groundwater in zones with no limitation on water withdrawal therefore under these scenarios the amount of the water withdrawn by the agricultural sector in the entire basin will decrease by about 1 7 79 3 mcm and 5 9 298 2 mcm respectively the major portion of the reduction in water allocated to the agricultural sector is also related to the zones z5 and z6 located in the basin s downstream with higher demand elasticity and lower economic value for water the total amount of water withdrawn from the basin under these scenarios will grow by 1 95 and 1 5 respectively the welfare implication of these changes is decreased economic surplus of the agricultural sector 1 02 and 2 1 in baseline 2040 and baseline 2070 respectively and in return increased economic surplus in the domestic 33 5 and 63 7 and industry 21 and 51 5 sectors and transition of the society as a whole to a higher welfare status compared with the baseline period the reasons for this are the reallocation of water to higher value uses and further withdrawal from the water resources of the basin 4 4 the impact of climate change on the agricultural sector 4 4 1 crop water demand and crop yield to avoid aggregation error crop water demand and crop yield were simulated in three spatial regions upstream middle and downstream of the basin and then the weighted average of their changes in relation with the base period was calculated fig 6 demonstrates the increased water demand of the main crops cultivated in the basin under climate change conditions based on the current area under cultivation the greatest variations in water needs in both periods were projected for alfalfa wheat and barley such that the extent of these increase ranged from 30 to 34 for alfalfa 16 25 for wheat and 17 29 for barley considering a 10 increase in water demand as the drought stress borderline it can be concluded that these crops would suffer the stress of increased water demand in future periods and thus the adoption of adaptive measures is inevitable in contrast the vulnerability of summer and spring cultivations has been less estimated than winter crops in terms of the increase in water demand overall these changes cause the total net agricultural water demand of the basin major crops to increase from 1164 mcm per year in the base period to 1350 2 mcm and 1379 8 mcm in the 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 periods respectively based on the current areas under cultivation overall the zayandehroud basin will face the stress of increased water demand in the future periods the intensity of this elevation ranges from 16 weighted mean in 2010 2039s period to 18 5 within the 2040 2069 period increased water demand means the same level of agricultural water shortage in the future periods regardless of any reduction in water allocation amount to this sector in response to socio economic changes and or decline in river runoff due to climate if increased climatic humidity deficiency is not offset by further supplies of irrigation water by the farmers then crop yields will decline the results shown in table 6 indicate that climate change will most probably result in a dramatic decrease in the yields of the major winter crops of the basin wheat barley onion alfalfa and potato and a moderate decline in the yields of summer crops rice cotton sunflower and beetroot the largest yield decrease in both periods was estimated for onion 22 1 and 24 4 while the slightest one was estimated for sunflower 0 9 to 0 5 note that the changes reported in table 8 were estimated while neglecting the fertilizer effect of co2 under certain conditions of water and nutrient levels available to a plant as the co2 concentration increases water consumption efficiency and hence the ratio of biomass to consumed water increase in crop photosynthesis processes in this case part of the yield reduction might be compensated through this effect however the impacts of co2 on crop yields under climate change are an uncertain and challenging issue 4 4 2 impact of climate change and adaptation on farm income and land use the impact of climate change on a farmer s income is the aggregate outcome of physical changes e g crop yields and availability of water resources and human behavioral changes physical changes are the direct result of variations in climatic parameters as was indicated for the zayandehroud river basin climate change and changes in socio economic scenarios lead to decreased availability of water resources for agricultural activities the output of the he semz increased water demand and diminished agricultural crop yields the behavioral changes are the result of farmers rational and optimal decision making when facing physical changes when the restriction of and demand for water resources grow the farmer s decision will be directed towards cultivating plants with a higher value of water and less water demand similarly in response to these changes farmers might prevent a substantial decrease in the area under cultivation through some degree of deficit irrigation therefore physical changes are not transferred with the same ratio to economic changes at the farm level in this research physical changes were transferred to a pmp economic model simulating farmers decision making when confronting changes in water resource availability crop water demand and actual crop yield therefore the effect of climate change on total acreage of crop production cropping pattern and total gross margin of agricultural productions was estimated under three adaptation strategies including scenario 1 sc1 no use of any adaptive measures scenario 2 sc2 farmers respond to climate and socio economic changes by changing their cropping pattern scenario 3 sc3 farmers respond to climate and socio economic changes by changing their cropping patterns and deciding on optimal water irrigation in the first strategy it is assumed that farmers make absolutely no effort to adapt in order to fight the changes in water resources availability crop water demand and crop yield in the real world this assumption does not seem to be realistic because the scarcity of water resources and the resulting increase in water opportunity cost changes the choice of farmers with respect to the type of cultivated crops and acreage levels allocated to each sc2 in the third strategy cs3 a more realistic situation it is assumed that when facing water shortages farmers will not only alter their choice of cropping pattern but also change their decision about the amount of irrigation water supply irrigation deficiency for different crops decrease increase yields or increase decrease the area under cultivation of various crops table 5 indicates the agricultural land use and farmers income changes in response to socioeconomic and climate changes based on the results of the he semz model the amount of water allocated to the agricultural sector will be reduced by 136 and 452 million cubic meters within the 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 periods respectively the results table 9 showed that in the worst case if farmers do not apply any adaptation strategy in response to climate change the total gross revenue of the agricultural sector in the basin will decline 18 1 in the period of 2010 2039 and 32 in the period of 2040 2069 in this situation it is anticipated that the total irrigated crop acreage will diminish about 4 4 and 14 6 relative to the base case farmers losses due to climate change under sc2 when farmers respond to these changes by changing their decisions related to crop acreage and cropping pattern are estimated to be less than those of sc1 in which farmers do not use any adaptation as shown in table 9 the percentage of reduction in total agricultural gross revenue in this case is 12 2 and 18 2 respectively which are significantly less than the values of 18 1 and 32 in sc1 as shown in table 8 the share of major crops in the basin including wheat potato rice and cotton in the cropping pattern will diminish under these conditions compared with the basic state in contrast the area under cultivation of barley alfalfa and beans will grow results also showed that when simultaneously applying two no cost adaptation strategies selection of optimal cropping pattern and optimal crop irrigation deficiency sc3 the area under cultivation not only not reduced but at the reduced level of water resources it can also be enhanced from 229 000 ha at the base year to 245 500 7 2 and 237 000 ha within the 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 periods respectively in this way farmers total economic losses from climate change can be reduced to 2 8 and 9 9 in the periods of 2010 2039 and 2040 2069 respectively this is significantly lower than the corresponding figures in the sc1 and sc2 scenarios 5 conclusion by the middle of this century the factor of climate change coupled with changes in socio economic factors will result in additional stress on water resources and the agricultural sector of the basin for example with the criterion of reducing 10 of water resources as a limit to the water resource crisis in the zayandehroud basin the results showed that up to the 1450 horizons the amount of water allocated to the agricultural sector will be reduced by 9 which will increase the need for irrigation from 17 to 19 stress on water resources and the agricultural sector will be higher in future periods due to the increasing demand for water for drinking and in the industry sector as compared to reduced water supplies due to climate change this illustrates the role of socio economic alternatives in the status of resources and water use in the watershed in the coming decades and the necessity to integrate these alternatives with the pathway for climate change in future studies moreover the important role of demand management policy in the domestic and industry sectors of the future in order to reduce water consumption efficiently and thus reduce the stress on the water resources and agricultural sector of the basin is evidenced applying demand management policies for example efficient and economical water pricing while reducing water consumption reducing the stress on water resources and the agricultural sector in the basin and improving the financial situations of water supply companies can be adaptive approaches to climate change as the results of the current research show to manage the water resources of the basin it is possible to cope with the consequences of climate change by applying cost free adaptation strategies at the macro level where efforts should be made to ensure the flexibility of the water allocation system and the conditions for moving towards a water market allocation system and at the sector level with emphasis on agriculture where a regional strategy document should be developed for selecting an optimal cropping pattern and an deficit irrigation strategy for each crop in addition to cost effective solutions there are other implementation strategies such as transferring between water basins changing cultivars through research and development increasing irrigation efficiency and building dams and more water infrastructures and etc naturally the implementation of any of these solutions will impose costs on the community thus they should be implemented within the framework of the cost benefit analysis for example transferring water between the basins although improving the status of the water resources and bringing economic benefits for the destination basin but regardless of its capital costs its implementation may have negative economic environmental and possibly social effects for the transferring basin declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10476,water saving by agricultural virtual water trade vwt is regarded as a new way to address water shortage and many studies have considered it at local and global scales however the existing calculation methods do not consider how agricultural products should be produced in export and import areas without crop trade we believe that three facts related to irrigation should be considered in water saving in agricultural vwt evaluation 1 arable land is highly restricted 2 irrigation increases crop yield significantly and 3 green water does not require cost the role of irrigation which is important for both the export and import region is very important for determining how to cultivate crops without virtual water trade in the case of grain vwt between heilongjiang and guangdong china the national blue water saving in 2010 with this consideration was 2562 1 mm³ water loss whereas the figure was 975 mm³ under the existing calculation framework therefore there is a possibility that vwt can be used in agricultural development and water management decision making while considering the role of irrigation keywords virtual water water saving blue green water irrigation 1 introduction the systematic risks of water resource and arable land shortages facing our planet threaten the global food supply and social stability in addition to improving the efficiency of water resource utilization cao et al 2020 the importation of water intensive agricultural products in the form of virtual water is regarded as an effective measure to cope with regional water scarcity allan 1998 virtual water is used to describe the amount of water consumed in the production of products or services and it refers to the water consumed in the production process of products akoto danso et al 2019 bazrafshan et al 2019 virtual water trade vwt is the flow of water resources with product trade vwt makes water resources global resources a virtual water strategy which refers to a measure by which water resource intensive products are imported to replace local production in areas of water shortage conserves local water resources and relieves the pressure on water resources is a specific strategy to allocate water resources from a global perspective fu et al 2018 vwt is considered an important strategy for coping with the global water shortage and it is based mainly on two concepts 1 economic globalization promotes the convenience of trading water intensive agricultural products between regions and 2 virtual water flow can save water resources at regional and global scales therefore water saving by agricultural vwt is the premise of a virtual water strategy and has attracted the attention of scholars in the field of water and environmental management han et al 2018 bazrafshan et al 2020 for instance liu et al 2018 provided a critical review of current research into water savings generated from food trade at the global and regional levels however it is difficult to use virtual water evaluation results in regional agricultural water management decision making boelens and vos 2012 because the method of quantifying water savings in agricultural vwt still requires further study 2 existing water saving estimation framework water saving of crop vwt related indicators includes regional water loss rwl in a virtual water export area regional water saving rws in a virtual water inflow area and global water saving gws taking the simplest case one to one virtual flow between regions as an example the calculation of these parameters in the existing framework is described briefly as follows 1 v w t t p r o d v w c e x p 2 r w l e x p v w t 3 r w s i m p t p r o d v w c i m p 4 g w s t p r o d v w c i m p v w c e x p in the aforementioned formulae t p r o d is the trade volume of agricultural product tons v w c e x p and v w c i m p are the virtual water contents of agricultural product in the export and import regions respectively m3 ton r w l e x p is the rwl of the export region m3 which is the amount of water conservation assuming no trade in agricultural products and r w s i m p is the rws of the import region m3 which is amount of increase of water investment if the t p r o d were produced by the region gws should be defined as the national water saving nws if the water saving in agricultural virtual water trade within a country is evaluated if gws 0 virtual flow saves water resources for the whole world country and the virtual flow pattern is worth encouraging form the perspective of improving global national water use efficiency otherwise virtual water flow wastes water resources and the water use efficiency in the virtual water export region should be improved taking the vwt in 2010 between china s largest grain exporter heilongjiang and grain importer guangdong as an example the water saving effect was calculated and is shown in fig 1 vwch and vwcg are the virtual water contents for producing grain in heilongjiang and guangdong respectively t is the trade volume of grain from heilongjiang to guangdong estimated by sun et al 2016 nws is the national water savings due to grain trade from heilongjiang to guangdong and rwl and rws are the regional water loss saving of heilongjiang and guangdong respectively the data of virtual water content of grain in the total cropland are derived from cao et al 2015 based on this water saving assessment framework the vwt of grain between heilongjiang and guangdong in 2010 was estimated to be 5465 6 mm³ including 1797 6 mm³ of blue and 3668 0 mm³ of green water this is the volume rwl of heilongjiang fig 1 the blue and green virtual water contents of grain in guangdong were 420 and 857 m³ ton respectively as a result the rws of this province was 6441 4 mm³ including 1814 7 mm³ of blue and 3668 0 mm³ of green water resources if there was virtual water flow for china the virtual water content of 4 28 mton of grain would be reduced from 1505 to 1227 m³ ton and the nws would be 975 8 mm³ because both the grain blue and green vwcs of heilongjiang were lower than those of guangdong the virtual water flow saved both blue and green water resources in china without considering the endowment of water resources a virtual water strategy should be implemented between heilongjiang and guangdong by the chinese government to increase the grain transferred from heilongjiang with its higher water use efficiency to guangdong with its lower water use efficiency almost all of the existing assessments of virtual water trade and its water saving effect have been conducted in this way lamastra et al 2017 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2019a 3 facts pertaining to the role of irrigation presently water savings are evaluated by comparing the assumed no virtual water trade status with the actual situation specifically agricultural product and virtual water import regions expand the scale of crop production according to the existing sowing pattern including irrigated and rainfed crop areas for agricultural product and virtual water export regions irrigated and rainfed crop areas are reduced based on the existing planting structure in other words the blue green water composition and water use efficiency of the observed crops in both the export and import regions are not changed however these strategies for achieving the goal of water saving in virtual water trade assessment are not consistent with the actual situation of regional crop sowing irrigation development and agricultural water management sauer et al 2010 the following three facts related to irrigation which plays a vital role in regional crop production and agricultural water management have been ignored arable land is highly restricted with the overwhelming trend of urbanization and the booming population arable land suitable for growing crops has been greatly threatened wu et al 2018 the global cropland area has remained at about 20 mha through the last decade fao 2019 however in many areas a lack of arable land is the main reason for crop product and virtual water importation restriction of land resources mandates that the crop planting area cannot be expanded at will irrigation increases crop yield significantly water stress is a common problem in crop cultivation especially in arid areas effective precipitation lower than the crop demand inhibits the normal physiological growth of a crop and leads to a reduction of yield irrigation solves this problem wang et al 2019b in developing countries the yield of irrigated paddy rice is about twice that of rain fed rice cai and rosegrant 2003 the grain yield of rainfed cropland in china is approximately 2 91 tons ha but the yield for land equipped with irrigation is 6 74 tons ha cao et al 2015 expanding the irrigated area under limited arable land is an effective way to mitigate food shortages green water does not require cost green water is the water resource derived from precipitation that is stored in soil and subsequently returned to the atmosphere aldaya et al 2010 through crop transpiration there is no need to construct farmland water conservancy facilities or purchase water conveyance equipment in a green water utilization process different from the case of irrigation water withdrawal it requires low investment of labor in facilities and water resource management mostly using green water helps optimize the allocation of social resources a rational agricultural and water management department addresses the priority issues pertaining to decision making on crop production increase decrease based on the aforementioned facts related to the role of irrigation water saving in agricultural virtual water trade is not determined by water use efficiency crop vwc rather it is determined by the regional crop water footprint total blue and green water consumptions for crop production m³ the scale of agricultural production and the level of irrigation development in other words if crop and virtual water trade does not occur the effect may be considered to reduce the use of irrigation water in the export region and increase it in the import region 4 water saving estimation considering the role of irrigation considering the role of irrigation the situation of water saving effect evaluation in agricultural virtual water trade may be different from that shown in fig 1 with consideration of the role of irrigation it becomes a case of virtual water flow water saving effect evaluation the calculation of vwt is the same as in formula 1 however its impacts on the water resource utilization of the export region import region and whole country may be different in the case of no agricultural product trade the export region is inclined to reduce irrigation water and hence reduce crop output in the case of water shortage dalin et al 2015 gao et al 2020 and the export region is inclined to increase crop output by expanding the irrigation area in the case of limitation of arable land therefore the calculation process of water saving in the case of heilongjiang and guangdong should be reexamined the irrigation area needed to produce the amount of grain trade t in heilongjiang is 1 09 mha t yh i yh r which is lower than the total irrigated grain cropland ah i of 3 75 mha fig 2 therefore if it did not need to provide grain to guangdong heilongjiang should reduce crop output by reducing the use of irrigation water resources in this way it could make full use of the free green water resources and also transfer the saved blue water resources to industrial commercial and residential uses thus improving social welfare if this were the case the green and blue water losses in heilongjiang would be 0 and 6142 7 mm³ respectively fig 2 yh i yh r

grain in irrigated rainfed cropland in heilongjiang and guangdong respectively other acronyms are explained in fig 1 if food could not be imported from outside of guangdong priority should be given to expansion of the irrigation area and then to the area of arable land an increase of grain of about 2 95 mton ag r yg i yg r could be attained if all of the rainfed cropland in guangdong 0 86 mha were equipped with irrigation however this result still does not meet the grain demand and an extra 0 21 mha t 2 95 yg i of irrigation area is required hence the amounts of irrigation blue and green water to be added are 3580 6 0 86 0 21 wfg b ag i and 1181 3 0 21 wfg g i ag i mm³ fig 2 the rws of guangdong is 7461 9 mm³ fig 2 the benefit from the grain and virtual water import from heilongjiang to guangdong includes 75 2 blue and 24 8 green water different from the nws calculated by the existing framework fig 1 the grain virtual water trade between the two provinces lost 1380 8 mm³ of water resources for the country even though it saved 1181 3 mm³ of green water the waste of adjustable and precious blue water in china reached 2562 1 mm³ fig 2 in the virtual water trade grain virtual water trade between heilongjiang and guangdong is unworthily encouraged taking into account the role of irrigation because it cannot contribute to efficient utilization of water resources in china this example represents the general situation of a global agricultural virtual water trade pattern in which flows occur from areas with high water use efficiency to areas with low water use efficiency liu et al 2019 5 concluding remarks it is impossible to consider how the virtual water export area can maintain its position using the existing calculation framework in other words how water saving of virtual water trade can be realized is rarely discussed because there are obvious problems that are difficult to solve we believe that this cannot be practically combined with regional agricultural production water management which relegates research of virtual water to remain theoretical at present it is difficult to propose feasible suggestions for regional agricultural layout irrigation development and water resource management however the result may have more profound and realistic policy implications if the role of irrigation is considered in virtual water assessments it is suggested that an evaluation framework and empirical research of virtual water trade and its impacts among regions that consider agricultural water use characteristics and the role of irrigation should be implemented this is expected to promote the virtual water research strategy in response to the global food and water crises declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they

10476,water saving by agricultural virtual water trade vwt is regarded as a new way to address water shortage and many studies have considered it at local and global scales however the existing calculation methods do not consider how agricultural products should be produced in export and import areas without crop trade we believe that three facts related to irrigation should be considered in water saving in agricultural vwt evaluation 1 arable land is highly restricted 2 irrigation increases crop yield significantly and 3 green water does not require cost the role of irrigation which is important for both the export and import region is very important for determining how to cultivate crops without virtual water trade in the case of grain vwt between heilongjiang and guangdong china the national blue water saving in 2010 with this consideration was 2562 1 mm³ water loss whereas the figure was 975 mm³ under the existing calculation framework therefore there is a possibility that vwt can be used in agricultural development and water management decision making while considering the role of irrigation keywords virtual water water saving blue green water irrigation 1 introduction the systematic risks of water resource and arable land shortages facing our planet threaten the global food supply and social stability in addition to improving the efficiency of water resource utilization cao et al 2020 the importation of water intensive agricultural products in the form of virtual water is regarded as an effective measure to cope with regional water scarcity allan 1998 virtual water is used to describe the amount of water consumed in the production of products or services and it refers to the water consumed in the production process of products akoto danso et al 2019 bazrafshan et al 2019 virtual water trade vwt is the flow of water resources with product trade vwt makes water resources global resources a virtual water strategy which refers to a measure by which water resource intensive products are imported to replace local production in areas of water shortage conserves local water resources and relieves the pressure on water resources is a specific strategy to allocate water resources from a global perspective fu et al 2018 vwt is considered an important strategy for coping with the global water shortage and it is based mainly on two concepts 1 economic globalization promotes the convenience of trading water intensive agricultural products between regions and 2 virtual water flow can save water resources at regional and global scales therefore water saving by agricultural vwt is the premise of a virtual water strategy and has attracted the attention of scholars in the field of water and environmental management han et al 2018 bazrafshan et al 2020 for instance liu et al 2018 provided a critical review of current research into water savings generated from food trade at the global and regional levels however it is difficult to use virtual water evaluation results in regional agricultural water management decision making boelens and vos 2012 because the method of quantifying water savings in agricultural vwt still requires further study 2 existing water saving estimation framework water saving of crop vwt related indicators includes regional water loss rwl in a virtual water export area regional water saving rws in a virtual water inflow area and global water saving gws taking the simplest case one to one virtual flow between regions as an example the calculation of these parameters in the existing framework is described briefly as follows 1 v w t t p r o d v w c e x p 2 r w l e x p v w t 3 r w s i m p t p r o d v w c i m p 4 g w s t p r o d v w c i m p v w c e x p in the aforementioned formulae t p r o d is the trade volume of agricultural product tons v w c e x p and v w c i m p are the virtual water contents of agricultural product in the export and import regions respectively m3 ton r w l e x p is the rwl of the export region m3 which is the amount of water conservation assuming no trade in agricultural products and r w s i m p is the rws of the import region m3 which is amount of increase of water investment if the t p r o d were produced by the region gws should be defined as the national water saving nws if the water saving in agricultural virtual water trade within a country is evaluated if gws 0 virtual flow saves water resources for the whole world country and the virtual flow pattern is worth encouraging form the perspective of improving global national water use efficiency otherwise virtual water flow wastes water resources and the water use efficiency in the virtual water export region should be improved taking the vwt in 2010 between china s largest grain exporter heilongjiang and grain importer guangdong as an example the water saving effect was calculated and is shown in fig 1 vwch and vwcg are the virtual water contents for producing grain in heilongjiang and guangdong respectively t is the trade volume of grain from heilongjiang to guangdong estimated by sun et al 2016 nws is the national water savings due to grain trade from heilongjiang to guangdong and rwl and rws are the regional water loss saving of heilongjiang and guangdong respectively the data of virtual water content of grain in the total cropland are derived from cao et al 2015 based on this water saving assessment framework the vwt of grain between heilongjiang and guangdong in 2010 was estimated to be 5465 6 mm³ including 1797 6 mm³ of blue and 3668 0 mm³ of green water this is the volume rwl of heilongjiang fig 1 the blue and green virtual water contents of grain in guangdong were 420 and 857 m³ ton respectively as a result the rws of this province was 6441 4 mm³ including 1814 7 mm³ of blue and 3668 0 mm³ of green water resources if there was virtual water flow for china the virtual water content of 4 28 mton of grain would be reduced from 1505 to 1227 m³ ton and the nws would be 975 8 mm³ because both the grain blue and green vwcs of heilongjiang were lower than those of guangdong the virtual water flow saved both blue and green water resources in

10477,taiwan intends to select an economic crop to be planted in a minority region to improve the farmers income and soil and water conversation this paper therefore applied a combination of three well established techniques including analytical hierarchy process ahp and fuzzy topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution to optimize the selection process of an economic crop based on a literature review and in depth interviews with government officials farming experts and farmers several selection criteria are developed including soil and water conservation the continuity of food and cultural heritage in minority regions and the value adding activities that may increase the household income and the employment in the entire agricultural produce to sell value chain as a result plum is selected as the optimal candidate by the fuzzy model for the social assistance program of agricultural development the experts also suggested that government might empower and energize the administrative organization maintain soil and water conservation on hillsides and consolidate available resources to maximize the effectiveness of assistance moreover the economic value in the plum produce to sell value chain can be enhanced through considering culture brand distribution channel and consumer experience keywords soil and water conservation crop industry of minority area the continuity of minority culture the value chain of agricultural goods analytical hierarchy process ahp fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis 1 introduction agriculture is often considered as a primary economic activity and a vital industry in minority regions as most minority regions are located alongside hills soil and water conservation becomes an essential consideration for developing agriculture in these areas there were evidences suggesting that agricultural employment and revenue are important part of the total employment and total household income for farmer families therefore government in taiwan tends to foster an economic crop with a social assistance program in minority regions to improve the household income and the employment rate there the minority regions include renai and xinyi township which are located on central mountains range in taiwan in these regions the main residents are taiwanese and aborigines constituting nearly 79 67 and 57 00 of the population according to the government for residents in these areas agriculture is their primary source of income increasing agricultural employment and sales would contribute to their total employment and family income significantly therefore an effective program launched by the government would help scaling up the aborigine living in the renai and xinyi township it would also foster a suitable economic crop produce the associated products and promote the market with improving industrial integration the total employment and household income the 2014 census of the united states department of agriculture usda showed that there were 151 942 minority operated farms united states department of agriculture 2014 accordingly barrett et al 2001 found that livelihood improving strategies in rural africa should consider the asset activity and income diversification empirical studies have emphasized that three critical issues need to be addressed in minority regions the unstable price of agricultural goods low household income for farmers and the contradiction between soil and water conservation and agricultural development aizaki 2015 mottaleb et al 2013 this study therefore aims to promote the decision making process by finding a scientific methodology to translate the selection criteria into a quantitative model to improve the effectiveness of decision making and optimize the public resource allocation the model has been tested by the economic crop selection in a minority region in taiwan where the government aims to assist in agricultural development according to a literature review and interviews with farming experts the drivers of the unstable price of agricultural goods and low household income for farmers are associated with several trends such as higher market competition higher price risk aging farmers as well as production imbalances for example united states department of agriculture 2014 reported that 130 680 minority operated farms in the united states still had a profit less than 10 000 u s dollars an increasing number of minority agricultural legal disputes are originated in minority agricultural areas which overlap with soil and water conservation areas to help the government providing social assistance for agricultural development two issues need to be addressed the selection of economic crop and an effective promotion plan including soil and water conservation united states department of agriculture 2014 found that minority operated farms grew various kinds of crops such as oilseed grains vegetables and melons fruits tree nuts tobacco cotton sugarcane and hay knowler and bradshaw 2007 concluded that the government s efforts to promote conservation agriculture should be different from the particular conditions of individual locales due to budget resource and environmental constraints the government needs to select a single economic crop out of various crop candidates the optimal crop should have been grown by the farms in minority regions and have a best fit for the inherent characteristics of agriculture in the next step the government needs to come up with a promotion plan a proper selection of economic crop with a good fostered plan is vital to convincing the farmers to grow the selected crop in minority regions in addition there were some papers finding that in making crop planting strategies farmers generally neglected soil and water conservation so the criteria of soil and water conservation were critical when government designs and implements appropriate policies and programs bekele and drake 2003 calatrava et al 2011 found the effectiveness of agricultural soil conservation would be affected by the policies of land use rural development and water and the education levels of farmers longworth and williamson 1993 found that government was encouraged to provide incentives to encourage the adoption of sustainable management practices e g soil and water conservation among the minority nationality communities in china most studies discussing the economic and management issues of water and soil conservation employed various econometric models to analyze the factors affecting farmers decision in adopting the water and soil conservation strategies for example mathieu et al 2019 used a probit model to analyze the factors that determine the adoption of water and soil conservation techniques among bam cotton producers and the results showed that early warning group membership smartphone ownership and cotton income are decisive factors however technical assistance and an access to the pesticide were negative factors wang et al 2019 used a bivariate probit model to identify factors affecting the adoption of the two soil conservation practices which are diversified crop rotation dcr and integrated cropping and livestock system icls kpadonou et al 2017 used both multivariate and ordered probit models to analyze farmers adoption decisions for eleven on farm water and soil conservation practices in western african drylands and the results showed that labor knowledge and capital intensive farmers were more likely to make adoption decisions the decision making process to choose the optimal economic crop can be complicated and uncertain first the multiple criteria decision making mcdm fuzzy methodology is considered in this study an increasing number of papers have considered the mcdm fuzzy model as an essential part of decision theory it refers to a decision making analysis method that chooses ranks and evaluates with multiple criteria taking into account that uncertainty and fuzziness are ubiquitous in the decision making process for example wadhwa et al 2009 set an mcdm fuzzy model of the reverse logistics system yang and hsieh 2009 discussed the selection problem of the six sigma project by the approach of the mcdm fuzzy model al najjar and alsyouf 2003 selected the most efficient maintenance approach using an mcdm fuzzy model according to a literature review and interviews with farming experts the relevant selection criteria include how the economic crop was related to the minority culture and heritage soil and water conservation and the cost and benefit analysis for the possible produce to sell option in the crop value chain zheng et al 2012 showed there was a close relationship between the cultural traditions and minority ethnicities in agriculture in yunnan province in china zilberman et al 2019 found that the innovation induced food supply chain design is significant for the value of food janssen and swinnen 2019 discussed the ways how value chains affect technology transfer and adoption in food chains of developing countries the multiple criteria mentioned above would potentially increase the risk of a wrong selection considering the risk of selecting an incorrect economic crop in minority regions this study further included the concept of analytical hierarchy process ahp for selecting the optimal economic crop fuzzy topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method for reducing risks and they are rarely used in previous literature to optimize the selection process based on a literature review and interviews with experts topsis has the advantages of being straightforward more comprehensible more computational efficient and had a better performance than the other mathematical models zhu et al 2013 tsaur 2011 shih et al 2007 additionally the market structure of agricultural products tends to be a completely competitive market and it is more difficult to highlight the characteristics of similar products as a result the planting process is easily affected by external factors therefore there is a high degree of uncertainty and ambiguity in the choice of crops to plant therefore combining the method of ahp and fuzzy topsis method in the present study may be beneficial to the selection of agricultural crops accordingly webber and labaste 2009 used the revealed comparative advantage rca index and domestic resource cost drc coefficient to evaluate value chain interventions of the crop industry this approach may provide an alternative to optimize the decision making process agriculture is usually the main economic activity of minorities as most minority areas are located alongside hillsides soil and water conservation is considered as an essential factor that need more attention the timely intervention of the government to increase the sales of agricultural products may therefore significantly increase the income of these minorities thus this paper extended on a multiple criteria decision making mcdm approach by introducing a fuzzy model to integrate the ahp and fuzzy topsis method to optimize a selection process for the predefined aim the model employed in taiwan aims to select an economic crop that would receive public assistance of agricultural development in a minority region this paper is organized as follows the aim and background information of this study are introduced in the first section the proposed method with a literature review is summarized in section 2 section 3 elaborates on the mcdm approach with an application of this approach in the case study about how the fussy model selects the economic crop in combination with ahp and fuzzy topsis in section 4 suggestions and practical implications from experts were provided the conclusion is presented in section 5 2 literature review and the proposed method in this paper a combined approach of ahp and fuzzy topsis methods was applied to solve the mcdm problem in selecting an optimal crop out of a set of economic crop candidates in minority regions the method and an integrating process flow diagram are shown in fig 1 qureshi et al 2017 chen et al 2014 zhang 2012 liao and kao 2010 önü and soner 2008 hwang and yoon 1981 zadeh 1965 first of all to build an initial list of economic crops in minority regions multiple sources with reached and considered including an investigation of existed economic crops in minority regions consulting with farming experts and examining historical research on similar topics based on the price of agricultural goods gergely 2005 also performed an initial list of mozambique s major agricultural economic crops for a targeted agricultural program which is implemented with loan funds from the world bank secondly the farming experts with professional knowledge about the minority regions shortlisted the recommended candidates of economic crops from the initial list built in step one in support of this idea the world bank 2006 applied a similar expert review to decide which specific crops in mozambique were the optimal candidates for intervention mozambique was selected to receive the international development association ida loan funds from the world bank for a targeted agricultural program their initial crop list was vetted by the office of commercial agricultural sector promotion within gpsca gabinete de promoção do sector commercial agrário a department of the mozambique ministry of agriculture third the criteria of selection c c 1 c 2 c c 1 c 2 c 5 was created based on a literature review and interviews with farming experts the results showed that economic crops should link with minority cultural heritage while at the same time be able to provide expected income therefore five criteria c c 1 c 2 c n are determined that is the linkage with agriculture heritage and culture the linkage with food heritage and culture the benefits of production processing and marketing of agricultural products the potential of industrial integration and the conservation of soil and water these criteria can further be divided into three types namely minority culture criteria c m expected benefit criteria c e and soil and water conservation criteria c s w therefore the selection criteria can be expressed as c c 1 c 2 c 5 c m c e c s w c m c e c m c s w and c e c s w liao 2013 to provide justification for the two criteria related to minority culture and heritage c m c 1 c 2 it is noted that a significant amount of crops were already growing in the minority region most of them are similar to the crops grown in other areas the linkage with minority culture and heritage might create an added value to the chosen agricultural goods producing in the minority region as stated in the japan act on the sixth industry promotion and the local consumption of local products 2010 a 2010b local agricultural industries should effectively make use of regional resources in this paper these regional resources can be considered as minority customs skills heritage and totem moreover the minority culture has gradually been assimilated by majority groups the government has been taken actions to sustain minority cultures by adopting minority related laws sautman 1999 li and bryan 2007 additionally rerkasem et al 2009 found that indigenous knowledge and skills played an important role in forest management on the land use in the mountainous region the other two criteria are set to evaluate the expected benefits from the value adding activities in growing the chosen crop c e c 3 c 4 the expected tangible and intangible benefits of the value chain have been commonly used as the selection criteria in previous research for example webber and labaste 2010 mentioned that value adding activities were conducted at each stage of the entire value chain in the agricultural industries these value adding activities not only fulfill the consumer needs but also generate required incomes for business this paper divided the value adding activities into three stages namely production breeding production processing and logistics marketing brand and channel and integration heterogeneous integration and horizontal integration other considerations were discussed in previous literature about agricultural value chains mckenna 2017 english et al 2006 reardon and flores 2006 humphrey 2005 westlake 2005 van roekel et al 2002 emphasized on five topics of relevance to agricultural industry value chains trust and cooperation governance market power innovation and knowledge focus intervention points j e austin associates inc 2006 claimed that mozambican cashew domestic value chain included farmers traders processors and exporters the last criterion focuses on the advantages of the conservation of soil and water in growing the chosen crop c s w c 5 soil and water conservation would help increase the output of crops whereas the cultivation of crops fertilizers and pesticides are harmful to soil and water conservation especially in the minority agriculture regions alongside hills for example kouelo et al 2016 found the adoption of soil and water conservation practices by farmers was very low bowley 2015 found that wind and water which were unimpeded by forest cover would devastate crops and the soil and water conservation practices promoted by government as well as the management of farmland would improve crop production the fourth step is therefore using ahp to identify the relative weights of each criterion based on experts subjective judgments after that as the final step the fuzzy topsis method is applied to obtain the closeness coefficient of each agricultural industry candidate of the minority region concerning each criterion in support of this method chen et al 2017 applied mqcac and fuzzy topsis to improve versions in multi criteria decision analysis to develop the unleaded gasoline quality adopting the fuzzy topsis approach is able to convert decision makers experience into meaningful results by applying linguistic values to assess each criterion and alternative candidates in the end the optimal economic crop for minority region could be determined 3 case study fostering economic crops in minority regions this paper conducted a case study on fostering economic crops in minority regions the renai and xinyi township of taiwan the decision making group dmg five experts consists of a government officer d 1 two farming experts d 2 d 3 and two farmers d 4 d 5 who are invited to provide their opinions and feedback in the decision making process the present included only five experts and stakeholders about fostering economic crops in minority regions participating in the group inviting five experts instead of more irrelevant interviewees could make the decision making process more cost effective comprehensive and representative the initial list ended up with more than fifty crops in the renai and xinyi township of taiwan based on literature reviews after the being reviewed by the experts six crops were shortlisted by the dmg that is tea v 1 vegetable v 2 lindera v 3 glutinous rice v 4 mushroom v 5 and plum v 6 in this study crops were considered not only by their native forms but also by their linkages with agriculture heritage and value chain moreover there were various vegetables that seem to be incompatible with other crops whereas farmers in minority regions could consider these six crops independently to select the optimal economic crop to grow in the regions five criteria are applied as 1 c 1 the linkage between agriculture heritage and culture and the chosen crop 2 c 2 the linkage between food heritage and culture and the chosen crop 3 c 3 the benefits of production processing and marketing stages in the value chain of the chosen crop 4 c 4 the potential of industrial integration in the value chain of the chosen crop 5 c 5 the advantages of soil and water conservation brought by growing the chosen crop the hierarchical structure of group decision making is shown in fig 2 five experts use the linguistic variables to weight the importance of criteria and the matrix of fuzzy triangular numbers in addition fuzzy preference is also used for the linguistic variables very low low fairly low fairly high high very high which are 0 0 0 20 0 0 20 0 40 0 20 0 40 0 60 0 40 0 60 0 80 0 60 0 80 1 00 0 80 1 00 1 00 the linguistic variables of fuzzy ratings of the alternative preferences are presented in fig 3 in fig 3 a triangular fuzzy number can be defined as a triplet α β γ the utility function u δ x of the fuzzy rating δ is defined as follows liao 2011 chen et al 2006 u δ x x α β α x α β γ x γ β x β γ 0 o t h e r w i s e where α β γ the fuzzy weight matrix of the criteria determined by the five experts is shown in table 1 the five experts use the linguistic variables to assess the fuzzy preference rating of each candidate regarding each criterion and the ratings are presented in table 2 the reasons to present rating of each group in table 2 are as follows 1 only three crops such as a lender glutinous rice and plum were linked to minority culture in agriculture 2 none of the crops has shown breeding activities in the value chain 3 all crops can generate income at the production processing and logistics stages in the value chain 4 tea glutinous rice and plum can generate the additional value of the brand and marketing stages in the value chain 5 tea and plum can create additional value at the heterogeneous integration stage in the value chain 6 tea and plum can help the conservation of soil and water the weights of each criterion are listed in table 1 the fuzzy preference evaluations of policy subjects by experts are shown in table 2 both tables are used to construct the fuzzy weighted decision matrix in table 3 in addition the linguistic variables for the importance of fuzzy weights of each criterion are similar to that presented in fig 3 the shortest distance from the fuzzy positive ideal solution fpis d v i v i 1 2 6 and the farthest distance from the fuzzy negative ideal solution fnis d v i v i 1 2 6 are determined by using the method of zhang et al 2011 the distance of each candidate from fpis and fnis is calculated respectively with respect to each criterion as shown in tables 4 the data of table 4 are from v max i v i j j j min i v ij j j and v min i v i j j j max i v ij j j the fuzzy positive ideal and fuzzy negative ideal is determined as v 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 04 0 04 0 04 1 1 1 and v 0 16 0 16 0 16 0 16 0 16 0 16 0 12 0 12 0 12 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 08 0 08 0 08 using d i j 1 n d v i j v j and d i j 1 n d v i j v j the distance of fuzzy positive ideal and fuzzy negative ideal of each candidate can be calculated with each criterion respectively as shown in table 4 in the next step the closeness coefficient c c i d i d i d i i 1 2 6 for each candidate is calculated as c c 1 0 296 c c 2 0 311 c c 3 0 410 c c 4 0 410 c c 5 0 367 and c c 6 0 475 the alternatives are ranked in descending order by c c i as follows v 6 v 4 v 3 v 5 v 2 v 1 therefore based on quantitative criterion measures plum has been selected as the optimal economic crop to grow in the minority region by using the fuzzy method advices from experts about the promotion plan of the economic crop in the minority region based on the proposed fuzzy method plum is selected in the social assistance program of agriculture to improve farmers household income and the employment rate in minority regions from previous studies and suggestions from farming experts it is better to have a similar program focusing on the promotion of minority culture in collaboration with growing the selected crop thereafter it is possible to upgrade and deepen the value chains of agricultural products from the selected crop in the region in line with this idea j e austin associates inc 2006 argued that the way to upgrade and deepen the value chains of crop industries was to create value by improving efficiency considerately enhancing product quality and adding innovative operations to the value chain hu et al 2019 found that farmers were adopting technologies and products and this process often required collaborative inter segments with other actors in the value chain in terms of the promotion plan interviews were conducted with government officers farmers peasant association and researchers and the advices were summarized as follows 1 it is important to empower and energize the administrative organization as well as consolidating available resources in minority regions that can maximize the effectiveness of assisting the selected crop the present parties involved in the produce to sell value chain of the targeted crop i e plum are only farms taking charge in its stage of production and peasant association focusing on processing branding marketing logistics and heterogeneous integration rejuvenation in these minority regions through the public private partnerships is suggested the recommended activities include empowering and energizing the administrative organization who lead the social assistance program of agricultural development to consolidate the available resources for the selected crop to upskill taiwanese aborigines in the stage of production and to enlarge the value adding activities in the entire plum produce to sell value chain such as heterogeneous industrial integration forre et al 2010 hayllar 2010 nobel and jones 2006 koppenjan 2005 kaplinsky and morris 2001 2 the government is encouraged to upgrade the produce to sell value chain for the selected crop by creating better value for customers for purchasing products and services from the minority regions these value creation activities should be considered in terms of culture brand distribution channel and consumer experience hansen et al 2018 found there were relationships between consumer motivations health environmental and social consciousness food identity and food behavior the experts have also suggested that the value creation activity of agricultural culture is to build a brand story that promotes the linkage between the minority culture and the selected crop that is plums stockebrand et al 2011 hsu et al 2009 woodside et al 2008 fog et al 2010 keller 2003 believed that a good brand story of product or service could help strengthening the consumer s recognition of product value and may therefore add value to the whole industry chain regarding the brand the value creation activities are suggested to focus on upgrading the present brand that can make agricultural products from the minority regions stand out of products from other places a good identification system can potentially mitigate price risk and market competition the identification system is crucial especially when a similar product from other regions may compete in the market with products from the minority regions aizaki 2015 docherty 2012 schulz et al 2012 believed that a global brand can increase consumers demand for a particular crop establishing the local farmer market network of the selected crop and attending the agricultural product exhibition in other regions regularly can be considered as value adding activities in distribution hara et al 2013 and quaye et al 2013 found local farmer market network could reconnect local farmers and consumers and eventually could improve the farmers income local affordability of healthy nutritious and sustainable food the food sovereignty and the energy efficiency 3 to raise consumers interest toward the selected crop the experts suggested several activities taking plums as the major ingredient such as creative cooking competition and food making class harrison and maharaj 2013 webber and labaste 2010 fleischer and tchetchik 2005 claimed that the cooking activities recipe collection and other consumer experience activities could contribute to the development of the agricultural sector 4 with regard to improvement in soil and water conservation the experts suggested mixed land use for farming and forest these measures can reduce soil erosion excessive land reclamation negative externalities decline in soil fertility to help the soil and water conservation in minority regions as a support of this suggestion sharma et al 2001 found an increase in agroforestry components would bring higher economic return and hydrologically sustainability 4 conclusion the government in taiwan plans to grow an economic crop with a social assistance program in minority regions to improve the household income the employment rate and water and soil conversation therefore the present study aims to 1 develop an effective selection process to determine the optimal economic crop 2 explore the water and soil conservation concerns in growing the selected crop 3 come up with a promotion plan including possible value creation activities in the produce to sell flow staging as production breeding production and processing logistics etc marketing brand channel etc and integration heterogeneous integration horizontal integration etc in order to reach the abovementioned aim a literature review and interviews with experts were conducted in the present study to decide five selection criteria to select the optimal crop for the social assistance program in minority regions these criteria includes the linkage with agriculture heritage and culture the linkage with food heritage and culture the benefits of production processing and marketing stages in the value chain of the chosen crop the potential of industrial integration in the value chain of the chosen crop and the benefits of soil and water conservation brought by the chosen crop based on the above quantitative criteria a combined approach of fuzzy ahp and topsis methods was used in the present study which is an easy and effective method to select the optimal candidate as a result plum has been selected as the optimal crops to be planted in renai and xinyi township where residents are mostly taiwanese and aborigines constituting nearly 79 67 and 57 00 of the population in terms of the promotion plan the experts provided three suggestions as follows first it is important to empower and energize the administrative organization as well as consolidating available resources in minority regions that can maximize the effectiveness of assisting the selected crop second it may be beneficial to upgrade the produce to sell value chain for the selected crop by creating higher value for customers in purchasing products and services from minority regions the value adding activities may consider relevant elements such as culture brand distribution channel and consumer experience third the government is encouraged to promote a mixed land use of the selected crop and forest to ensure food security and self sufficiency leisure recreation and tourism in minority regions these approaches would bring more employment opportunities and increase farmers income it would also help maintaining ecological social and cultural functions of the lands such as soil and water conservation resource sustainability and biodiversity and cultural assets inherit accordingly kouelo et al 2016 found that reducing the size of farms increased the obstacles to the widespread adoption of soil and water conservation practices based on our findings some suggestions for future research are provided first of all future study may consider validating and further enhancing the selection model by exploring alternative approaches such as linear programming l p goal programming g p data envelopment analysis dea cost point methods cpm and the analytic network process anp secondly in reality two or more minority groups may resident within the same minority region and as a result a crop can be linked to more than one culture and vice versa the current study only explored the scenario of linking one crop to one culture with the selection criteria it is possible that when more minority cultures are included and considered the optimal candidate would be different finally the promotion plan can also cover a broader range of topic such as the planting area market demand tribal will and agro food processing equipment and facilities such as stores cold storage etc as well as humanistic environment as a suggestion future researchers may use an integrated fuzzy topsis mcgp model this problem can be solved with the following formula fuzzy topsis mcgp model 1 min z d 1 d 1 d 2 d 2 d 3 d 3 d 4 d 4 d 5 d 5 d 6 d 6 e 1 e 2 e 2 e 1 2 6 s t

10477,taiwan intends to select an economic crop to be planted in a minority region to improve the farmers income and soil and water conversation this paper therefore applied a combination of three well established techniques including analytical hierarchy process ahp and fuzzy topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution to optimize the selection process of an economic crop based on a literature review and in depth interviews with government officials farming experts and farmers several selection criteria are developed including soil and water conservation the continuity of food and cultural heritage in minority regions and the value adding activities that may increase the household income and the employment in the entire agricultural produce to sell value chain as a result plum is selected as the optimal candidate by the fuzzy model for the social assistance program of agricultural development the experts also suggested that government might empower and energize the administrative organization maintain soil and water conservation on hillsides and consolidate available resources to maximize the effectiveness of assistance moreover the economic value in the plum produce to sell value chain can be enhanced through considering culture brand distribution channel and consumer experience keywords soil and water conservation crop industry of minority area the continuity of minority culture the value chain of agricultural goods analytical hierarchy process ahp fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis 1 introduction agriculture is often considered as a primary economic activity and a vital industry in minority regions as most minority regions are located alongside hills soil and water conservation becomes an essential consideration for developing agriculture in these areas there were evidences suggesting that agricultural employment and revenue are important part of the total employment and total household income for farmer families therefore government in taiwan tends to foster an economic crop with a social assistance program in minority regions to improve the household income and the employment rate there the minority regions include renai and xinyi township which are located on central mountains range in taiwan in these regions the main residents are taiwanese and aborigines constituting nearly 79 67 and 57 00 of the population according to the government for residents in these areas agriculture is their primary source of income increasing agricultural employment and sales would contribute to their total employment and family income significantly therefore an effective program launched by the government would help scaling up the aborigine living in the renai and xinyi township it would also foster a suitable economic crop produce the associated products and promote the market with improving industrial integration the total employment and household income the 2014 census of the united states department of agriculture usda showed that there were 151 942 minority operated farms united states department of agriculture 2014 accordingly barrett et al 2001 found that livelihood improving strategies in rural africa should consider the asset activity and income diversification empirical studies have emphasized that three critical issues need to be addressed in minority regions the unstable price of agricultural goods low household income for farmers and the contradiction between soil and water conservation and agricultural development aizaki 2015 mottaleb et al 2013 this study therefore aims to promote the decision making process by finding a scientific methodology to translate the selection criteria into a quantitative model to improve the effectiveness of decision making and optimize the public resource allocation the model has been tested by the economic crop selection in a minority region in taiwan where the government aims to assist in agricultural development according to a literature review and interviews with farming experts the drivers of the unstable price of agricultural goods and low household income for farmers are associated with several trends such as higher market competition higher price risk aging farmers as well as production imbalances for example united states department of agriculture 2014 reported that 130 680 minority operated farms in the united states still had a profit less than 10 000 u s dollars an increasing number of minority agricultural legal disputes are originated in minority agricultural areas which overlap with soil and water conservation areas to help the government providing social assistance for agricultural development two issues need to be addressed the selection of economic crop and an effective promotion plan including soil and water conservation united states department of agriculture 2014 found that minority operated farms grew various kinds of crops such as oilseed grains vegetables and melons fruits tree nuts tobacco cotton sugarcane and hay knowler and bradshaw 2007 concluded that the government s efforts to promote conservation agriculture should be different from the particular conditions of individual locales due to budget resource and environmental constraints the government needs to select a single economic crop out of various crop candidates the optimal crop should have been grown by the farms in minority regions and have a best fit for the inherent characteristics of agriculture in the next step the government needs to come up with a promotion plan a proper selection of economic crop with a good fostered plan is vital to convincing the farmers to grow the selected crop in minority regions in addition there were some papers finding that in making crop planting strategies farmers generally neglected soil and water conservation so the criteria of soil and water conservation were critical when government designs and implements appropriate policies and programs bekele and drake 2003 calatrava et al 2011 found the effectiveness of agricultural soil conservation would be affected by the policies of land use rural development and water and the education levels of farmers longworth and williamson 1993 found that government was encouraged to provide incentives to encourage the adoption of sustainable management practices e g soil and water conservation among the minority nationality communities in china most studies discussing the economic and management issues of water and soil conservation employed various econometric models to analyze the factors affecting farmers decision in adopting the water and soil conservation strategies for example mathieu et al 2019 used a probit model to analyze the factors that determine the adoption of water and soil conservation techniques among bam cotton producers and the results showed that early warning group membership smartphone ownership and cotton income are decisive factors however technical assistance and an access to the pesticide were negative factors wang et al 2019 used a bivariate probit model to identify factors affecting the adoption of the two soil conservation practices which are diversified crop rotation dcr and integrated cropping and livestock system icls kpadonou et al 2017 used both multivariate and ordered probit models to analyze farmers adoption decisions for eleven on farm water and soil conservation practices in western african drylands and the results showed that labor knowledge and capital intensive farmers were more likely to make adoption decisions the decision making process to choose the optimal economic crop can be complicated and uncertain first the multiple criteria decision making mcdm fuzzy methodology is considered in this study an increasing number of papers have considered the mcdm fuzzy model as an essential part of decision theory it refers to a decision making analysis method that chooses ranks and evaluates with multiple criteria taking into account that uncertainty and fuzziness are ubiquitous in the decision making process for example wadhwa et al 2009 set an mcdm fuzzy model of the reverse logistics system yang and hsieh 2009 discussed the selection problem of the six sigma project by the approach of the mcdm fuzzy model al najjar and alsyouf 2003 selected the most efficient maintenance approach using an mcdm fuzzy model according to a literature review and interviews with farming experts the relevant selection criteria include how the economic crop was related to the minority culture and heritage soil and water conservation and the cost and benefit analysis for the possible produce to sell option in the crop value chain zheng et al 2012 showed there was a close relationship between the cultural traditions and minority ethnicities in agriculture in yunnan province in china zilberman et al 2019 found that the innovation induced food supply chain design is significant for the value of food janssen and swinnen 2019 discussed the ways how value chains affect technology transfer and adoption in food chains of developing countries the multiple criteria mentioned above would potentially increase the risk of a wrong selection considering the risk of selecting an incorrect economic crop in minority regions this study further included the concept of analytical hierarchy process ahp for selecting the optimal economic crop fuzzy topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method for reducing risks and they are rarely used in previous literature to optimize the selection process based on a literature review and interviews with experts topsis has the advantages of being straightforward more comprehensible more computational efficient and had a better performance than the other mathematical models zhu et al 2013 tsaur 2011 shih et al 2007 additionally the market structure of agricultural products tends to be a completely competitive market and it is more difficult to highlight the characteristics of similar products as a result the planting process is easily affected by external factors therefore there is a high degree of uncertainty and ambiguity in the choice of crops to plant therefore combining the method of ahp and fuzzy topsis method in the present study may be beneficial to the selection of agricultural crops accordingly webber and labaste 2009 used the revealed comparative advantage rca index and domestic resource cost drc coefficient to evaluate value chain interventions of the crop industry this approach may provide an alternative to optimize the decision making process agriculture is usually the main economic activity of minorities as most minority areas are located alongside hillsides soil and water conservation is considered as an essential factor that need more attention the timely intervention of the government to increase the sales of agricultural products may therefore significantly increase the income of these minorities thus this paper extended on a multiple criteria decision making mcdm approach by introducing a fuzzy model to integrate the ahp and fuzzy topsis method to optimize a selection process for the predefined aim the model employed in taiwan aims to select an economic crop that would receive public assistance of agricultural development in a minority region this paper is organized as follows the aim and background information of this study are introduced in the first section the proposed method with a literature review is summarized in section 2 section 3 elaborates on the mcdm approach with an application of this approach in the case study about how the fussy model selects the economic crop in combination with ahp and fuzzy topsis in section 4 suggestions and practical implications from experts were provided the conclusion is presented in section 5 2 literature review and the proposed method in this paper a combined approach of ahp and fuzzy topsis methods was applied to solve the mcdm problem in selecting an optimal crop out of a set of economic crop candidates in minority regions the method and an integrating process flow diagram are shown in fig 1 qureshi et al 2017 chen et al 2014 zhang 2012 liao and kao 2010 önü and soner 2008 hwang and yoon 1981 zadeh 1965 first of all to build an initial list of economic crops in minority regions multiple sources with reached and considered including an investigation of existed economic crops in minority regions consulting with farming experts and examining historical research on similar topics based on the price of agricultural goods gergely 2005 also performed an initial list of mozambique s major agricultural economic crops for a targeted agricultural program which is implemented with loan funds from the world bank secondly the farming experts with professional knowledge about the minority regions shortlisted the recommended candidates of economic crops from the initial list built in step one in support of this idea the world bank 2006 applied a similar expert review to decide which specific crops in mozambique were the optimal candidates for intervention mozambique was selected to receive the international development association ida loan funds from the world bank for a targeted agricultural program their initial crop list was vetted by the office of commercial agricultural sector promotion within gpsca gabinete de promoção do sector commercial agrário a department of the mozambique ministry of agriculture third the criteria of selection c c 1 c 2 c c 1 c 2 c 5 was created based on a literature review and interviews with farming experts the results showed that economic crops should link with minority cultural heritage while at the same time be able to provide expected income therefore five criteria c c 1 c 2 c n are determined that is the linkage with agriculture heritage and culture the linkage with food heritage and culture the benefits of production processing and marketing of agricultural products the potential of industrial integration and the conservation of soil and water these criteria can further be divided into three types namely minority culture criteria c m expected benefit criteria c e and soil and water conservation criteria c s w therefore the selection criteria can be expressed as c c 1 c 2 c 5 c m c e c s w c m c e c m c s w and c e c s w liao 2013 to provide justification for the two criteria related to minority culture and heritage c m c 1 c 2 it is noted that a significant amount of crops were already growing in the minority region most of them are similar to the crops grown in other areas the linkage with minority culture and heritage might create an added value to the chosen agricultural goods producing in the minority region as stated in the japan act on the sixth industry promotion and the local consumption of local products 2010 a 2010b local agricultural industries should effectively make use of regional resources in this paper these regional resources can be considered as minority customs skills heritage and totem moreover the minority culture has gradually been assimilated by majority groups the government has been taken actions to sustain minority cultures by adopting minority related laws sautman 1999 li and bryan 2007 additionally rerkasem et al 2009 found that indigenous knowledge and skills played an important role in forest management on the land use in the mountainous region the other two criteria are set to evaluate the expected benefits from the value adding activities in growing the chosen crop c e c 3 c 4 the expected tangible and intangible benefits of the value chain have been commonly used as the selection criteria in previous research for example webber and labaste 2010 mentioned that value adding activities were conducted at each stage of the entire value chain in the agricultural industries these value adding activities not only fulfill the consumer needs but also generate required incomes for business this paper divided the value adding activities into three stages namely production breeding production processing and logistics marketing brand and channel and integration heterogeneous integration and horizontal integration other considerations were discussed in previous literature about agricultural value chains mckenna 2017 english et al 2006 reardon and flores 2006 humphrey 2005 westlake 2005 van roekel et al 2002 emphasized on five topics of relevance to agricultural industry value chains trust and cooperation governance market power innovation and knowledge focus intervention points j e austin associates inc 2006 claimed that mozambican cashew domestic value chain included farmers traders processors and exporters the last criterion focuses on the advantages of the conservation of soil and water in growing the chosen crop c s w c 5 soil and water conservation would help increase the output of crops whereas the cultivation of crops fertilizers and pesticides are harmful to soil and water conservation especially in the minority agriculture regions alongside hills for example kouelo et al 2016 found the adoption of soil and water conservation practices by farmers was very low bowley 2015 found that wind and water which were unimpeded by forest cover would devastate crops and the soil and water conservation practices promoted by government as well as the management of farmland would improve crop production the fourth step is therefore using ahp to identify the relative weights of each criterion based on experts subjective judgments after that as the final step the fuzzy topsis method is applied to obtain the closeness coefficient of each agricultural industry candidate of the minority region concerning each criterion in support of this method chen et al 2017 applied mqcac and fuzzy topsis to improve versions in multi criteria decision analysis to develop the unleaded gasoline quality adopting the fuzzy topsis approach is able to convert decision makers experience into meaningful results by applying linguistic values to assess each criterion and alternative candidates in the end the optimal economic crop for minority region could be determined 3 case study fostering economic crops in minority regions this paper conducted a case study on fostering economic crops in minority regions the renai and xinyi township of taiwan the decision making group dmg five experts consists of a government officer d 1 two farming experts d 2 d 3 and two farmers d 4 d 5 who are invited to provide their opinions and feedback in the decision making process the present included only five experts and stakeholders about fostering economic crops in minority regions participating in the group inviting five experts instead of more irrelevant interviewees could make the decision making process more cost effective comprehensive and representative the initial list ended up with more than fifty crops in the renai and xinyi township of taiwan based on literature reviews after the being reviewed by the experts six crops were shortlisted by the dmg that is tea v 1 vegetable v 2 lindera v 3 glutinous rice v 4 mushroom v 5 and plum v 6 in this study crops were considered not only by their native forms but also by their linkages with agriculture heritage and value chain moreover there were various vegetables that seem to be incompatible with other crops whereas farmers in minority regions could consider these six crops independently to select the optimal economic crop to grow in the regions five criteria are applied as 1 c 1 the linkage between agriculture heritage and culture and the chosen crop 2 c 2 the linkage between food heritage and culture and the chosen crop 3 c 3 the benefits of production processing and marketing stages in the value chain of the chosen crop 4 c 4 the potential of industrial integration in the value chain of the chosen crop 5 c 5 the advantages of soil and water conservation brought by growing the chosen crop the hierarchical structure of group decision making is shown in fig 2 five experts use the linguistic variables to weight the importance of criteria and the matrix of fuzzy triangular numbers in addition fuzzy preference is also used for the linguistic variables very low low fairly low fairly high high very high which are 0 0 0 20 0 0 20 0 40 0 20 0 40 0 60 0 40 0 60 0 80 0 60 0 80 1 00 0 80 1 00 1 00 the linguistic variables of fuzzy ratings of the alternative preferences are presented in fig 3 in fig 3 a triangular fuzzy number can be defined as a triplet α β γ the utility function u δ x of the fuzzy rating δ is defined as follows liao 2011 chen et al 2006 u δ x x α β α x α β γ x γ β x β γ 0 o t h e r w i s e where α β γ the fuzzy weight matrix of the criteria determined by the five experts is shown in table 1 the five experts use the linguistic variables to assess the fuzzy preference rating of each candidate regarding each criterion and the ratings are presented in table 2 the reasons to present rating of each group in table 2 are as follows 1 only three crops such as a lender glutinous rice and plum were linked to minority culture in agriculture 2 none of the crops has shown breeding activities in the value chain 3 all crops can generate income at the production processing and logistics stages in the value chain 4 tea glutinous rice and plum can generate the additional value of the brand and marketing stages in the value chain 5 tea and plum can create additional value at the heterogeneous integration stage in the value chain 6 tea and plum can help the conservation of soil and water the weights of each criterion are listed in table 1 the fuzzy preference evaluations of policy subjects by experts are shown in table 2 both tables are used to construct the fuzzy weighted decision matrix in table 3 in addition the linguistic variables for the importance of fuzzy weights of each criterion are similar to that presented in fig 3 the shortest distance from the fuzzy positive ideal solution fpis d v i v i 1 2 6 and the farthest distance from the fuzzy negative ideal solution fnis d v i v i 1 2 6 are determined by using the method of zhang et al 2011 the distance of each candidate from fpis and fnis is calculated respectively with respect to each criterion as shown in tables 4 the data of table 4 are from v max i v i j j j min i v ij j j and v min i v i j j j max i v

ranked in descending order by c c i as follows v 6 v 4 v 3 v 5 v 2 v 1 therefore based on quantitative criterion measures plum has been selected as the optimal economic crop to grow in the minority region by using the fuzzy method advices from experts about the promotion plan of the economic crop in the minority region based on the proposed fuzzy method plum is selected in the social assistance program of agriculture to improve farmers household income and the employment rate in minority regions from previous studies and suggestions from farming experts it is better to have a similar program focusing on the promotion of minority culture in collaboration with growing the selected crop thereafter it is possible to upgrade and deepen the value chains of agricultural products from the selected crop in the region in line with this idea j e austin associates inc 2006 argued that the way to upgrade and deepen the value chains of crop industries was to create value by improving efficiency considerately enhancing product quality and adding innovative operations to the value chain hu et al 2019 found that farmers were adopting technologies and products and this process often required collaborative inter segments with other actors in the value chain in terms of the promotion plan interviews were conducted with government officers farmers peasant association and researchers and the advices were summarized as follows 1 it is important to empower and energize the administrative organization as well as consolidating available resources in minority regions that can maximize the effectiveness of assisting the selected crop the present parties involved in the produce to sell value chain of the targeted crop i e plum are only farms taking charge in its stage of production and peasant association focusing on processing branding marketing logistics and heterogeneous integration rejuvenation in these minority regions through the public private partnerships is suggested the recommended activities include empowering and energizing the administrative organization who lead the social assistance program of agricultural development to consolidate the available resources for the selected crop to upskill taiwanese aborigines in the stage of production and to enlarge the value adding activities in the entire plum produce to sell value chain such as heterogeneous industrial integration forre et al 2010 hayllar 2010 nobel and jones 2006 koppenjan 2005 kaplinsky and morris 2001 2 the government is encouraged to upgrade the produce to sell value chain for the selected crop by creating better value for customers for purchasing products and services from the minority regions these value creation activities should be considered in terms of culture brand distribution channel and consumer experience hansen et al 2018 found there were relationships between consumer motivations health environmental and social consciousness food identity and food behavior the experts have also suggested that the value creation activity of agricultural culture is to build a brand story that promotes the linkage between the minority culture and the selected crop that is plums stockebrand et al 2011 hsu et al 2009 woodside et al 2008 fog et al 2010 keller 2003 believed that a good brand story of product or service could help strengthening the consumer s recognition of product value and may therefore add value to the whole industry chain regarding the brand the value creation activities are suggested to focus on upgrading the present brand that can make agricultural products from the minority regions stand out of products from other places a good identification system can potentially mitigate price risk and market competition the identification system is crucial especially when a similar product from other regions may compete in the market with products from the minority regions aizaki 2015 docherty 2012 schulz et al 2012 believed that a global brand can increase consumers demand for a particular crop establishing the local farmer market network of the selected crop and attending the agricultural product exhibition in other regions regularly can be considered as value adding activities in distribution hara et al 2013 and quaye et al 2013 found local farmer market network could reconnect local farmers and consumers and eventually could improve the farmers income local affordability of healthy nutritious and sustainable food the food sovereignty and the energy efficiency 3 to raise consumers interest toward the selected crop the experts suggested several activities taking plums as the major ingredient such as creative cooking competition and food making class harrison and maharaj 2013 webber and labaste 2010 fleischer and tchetchik 2005 claimed that the cooking activities recipe collection and other consumer experience activities could contribute to the development of the agricultural sector 4 with regard to improvement in soil and water conservation the experts suggested mixed land use for farming and forest these measures can reduce soil erosion excessive land reclamation negative externalities decline in soil fertility to help the soil and water conservation in minority regions as a support of this suggestion sharma et al 2001 found an increase in agroforestry components would bring higher economic return and hydrologically sustainability 4 conclusion the government in taiwan plans to grow an economic crop with a social assistance program in minority regions to improve the household income the employment rate and water and soil conversation therefore the present study aims to 1 develop an effective selection process to determine the optimal economic crop 2 explore the water and soil conservation concerns in growing the selected crop 3 come up with a promotion plan including possible value creation activities in the produce to sell flow staging as production breeding production and processing logistics etc marketing brand channel etc and integration heterogeneous integration horizontal integration etc in order to reach the abovementioned aim a literature review and interviews with experts were conducted in the present study to decide five selection criteria to select the optimal crop for the social assistance program in minority regions these criteria includes the linkage with agriculture heritage and culture the linkage with food heritage and culture the benefits of production processing and marketing stages in the value chain of the chosen crop the potential of industrial integration in the value chain of the chosen crop and the benefits of soil and water conservation brought by the chosen crop based on the above quantitative criteria a combined approach of fuzzy ahp and topsis methods was used in the present study which is an easy and effective method to select the optimal candidate as a result plum has been selected as the optimal crops to be planted in renai and xinyi township where residents are mostly taiwanese and aborigines constituting nearly 79 67 and 57 00 of the population in terms of the promotion plan the experts provided three suggestions as follows first it is important to empower and energize the administrative organization as well as consolidating available resources in minority regions that can maximize the effectiveness of assisting the selected crop second it may be beneficial to upgrade the produce to sell value chain for the selected crop by creating higher value for customers in purchasing products and services from minority regions the value adding activities may consider relevant elements such as culture brand distribution channel and consumer experience third the government is encouraged to promote a mixed land use of the selected crop and forest to ensure food security and self sufficiency leisure recreation and tourism in minority regions these approaches would bring more employment opportunities and increase farmers income it would also help maintaining ecological social and cultural functions of the lands such as soil and water conservation resource sustainability and biodiversity and cultural assets inherit accordingly kouelo et al 2016 found that reducing the size of farms increased the obstacles to the widespread adoption of soil and water conservation practices based on our findings some suggestions for future research are provided first of all future study may consider validating and further enhancing the selection model by exploring alternative approaches such as linear programming l p goal programming g p data envelopment analysis dea cost point methods cpm and the analytic network process anp secondly in reality two or more minority groups may resident within the same minority region and as a result a crop can be linked to more than one culture and vice versa the current study only explored the scenario of linking one crop to one culture with the selection criteria it is possible that when more minority cultures are included and considered the optimal candidate would be different finally the promotion plan can also cover a broader range of topic such as the planting area market demand tribal will and agro food processing equipment and facilities such as stores cold storage etc as well as humanistic environment as a suggestion future researchers may use an integrated fuzzy topsis mcgp model this problem can be solved with the following formula fuzzy topsis mcgp model 1 min z d 1 d 1 d 2 d 2 d 3 d 3 d 4 d 4 d 5 d 5 d 6 d 6 e 1 e 2 e 2 e 1 2 6 s t

10478,the present study evaluated the potential impacts of climate change of hamadan bahar plain on dimensions including economical physiological hydrological and meteorological aspects the results showed that climate change in the region has negative impacts on the agricultural sector by reducing the crop yield as well as groundwater balance in the most optimistic scenario on the horizon of 2090 rainfall and groundwater levels would reduce by 14 4 and 12 3 respectively and the average temperature would rise by 14 7 accordingly the economic value of water would increase by 44 and the agricultural value added net income would fall by 19 indicating the intensification of water shortage crisis and agricultural recession also the results of this study show that optimal deficit irrigation strategy in the production of water intensive crops as well as improving irrigation technologies would be potential solutions to the climate change crisis in the coming years however the common pool nature of groundwater resources in addition to capital inadequacy are the challenges faced when adopting these two approaches by farmers keywords global warming groundwater resources co2 deficit irrigation crop yield 1 introduction climate is a combination of dominating and enduring atmospheric characteristics of a geographic zone over time and is often determined based on variables such as temperature rainfall moisture wind and solar radiation zhang et al 2017 various studies have shown the effect of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions on the earth s climate e g long et al 2005 najafi alamdarlo 2018 after vapor co2 is the most important greenhouse gas that absorbs infrared rays in the atmosphere agriculture as a biophysical system is heavily dependent on climatic conditions and any change can affect agricultural output through crop yield variation chen et al 2016 the initial effect of increasing co2 emission on agricultural products is the enhancement of the photosynthesis process and reduction in transpiration of plants which will have a positive effect on plant yield long et al 2005 on the other hand an increase in co2 and the associated greenhouse effect results in a higher temperature drier plant environment is due to rainfall reduction and increased evaporation from the soil surface both attributed to temperature rise vanuytrecht et al 2012 this phenomenon increases the water requirement of plants water usage and as a result water demand will increase in the agricultural sector gosling and arnell 2016 moreover the soil nutrients are damaged by the increase of temperature because the rise of temperature leads to increased microbial activity in the soil and in fact an increase in the rate of degradation of organic matter in the soil which will lead to gradual soil erosion the higher temperature shorter durability of the plant s growth stages and the biomass will be reduced accordingly the crop yield is changed by fluctuating the level of co2 emissions and the resulting climate changes frenck et al 2011 this event has more harmful effects on arid and semi arid regions of the world like iran for instance an increase in temperature and reduction of rainfall as a part of the effects of climate change will be the future crisis in most agrarian plains of iran bijani et al 2017 soltani and mosavi 2015 the watershed hamadan bahar located in western iran is a clear example of this event according to meteorological data released climate change has appeared in the plain with the increase in temperature reduction of rainfall and increase in co2 emissions in the past two decades so that in hamadan bahar plain in years 1991 and 2011 the temperature has been 8 2 and 12 c rainfall has been 430 and 200 mm and co2 emissions have been 3500 and 5110 million kg respectively iran meteorological organization 2013 iran ministry of energy 2013 mosavi 2016 therefore according to the stated problem long term agricultural planning requires careful analysis of weather conditions in the plain several studies have been conducted to estimate the effects of climate change on the agricultural sector around the world attavanich and mccarl 2011 analyzed the welfare consequences of climate changes and improvement of technology in the agricultural sector of the us and found that over the horizon of 2050 the consumers surplus will increase the producers surplus will decrease and the overall welfare will increase up to 2 27 billion medellin azuara et al 2011 also note that until 2050 due to climate changes such as rising temperatures and reduced precipitation agricultural land use water supply and the yield of most crops will decrease and the production costs will increase in california van passel et al 2017 using the ricardian approach found that the loss of european farmers in the face of various climate scenarios in the horizon of 2100 is in the range of 5 to 32 calzadilla et al 2013 showed that climate change in sub saharan africa will lead to a 1 6 drop in food production and a 0 2 decline in gross domestic product however a 3 increase in the productivity of crops by 2050 can compensate for these losses najafi alamdarlo et al 2016 also showed that the scarcity of water resources and heavy exploitation of groundwater as a consequence of climate change in the varamin plain of iran will be reduced by adopting proper water pricing policies and providing subsidies to improve the efficiency of irrigation systems the above results have also been discussed in salehi et al 2017 in this regard soltani and mosavi 2016 acknowledged that in the most pessimistic scenario the increase in the level of carbon dioxide emissions and climate changes in hamadan bahar plain will reduce the groundwater resources and increase the economic value of water until 2040 it should be noted that similar results were obtained in the study by thamo et al 2017 investigating the effects of climate change on the australian agricultural sector the contribution of this study to the literature is the holistic view on all economics physiologic hydrologic and meteorological aspects of climate change in the agricultural sector this study may be useful to future researchers and policy makers in adopting the more relevant policy for the climate change phenomenon this study aims at investigating the economic effects of climate change on the agricultural sector including the yield of crops water resources and profitability in hamadan bahar plain the hypothesis tested in this research is that climate change has negative impacts on the agricultural sector in the study area and it is necessary to present solutions to reduce these effects accordingly the question answered in this study is whether climate change in the region reduces crop yields the profitability of the agricultural sector and aggravation of the scarcity of water resources the various solutions to these problems are also sought 2 methodology the present study tracked the probable impacts of climate change of hamadan bahar plain on dimensions including economical agronomic hydrological and meteorological aspects in the hydrological and agronomic aspects the reaction of groundwater and crop yield to climatic variables were estimated respectively also in the meteorological aspect climate change was predicted these estimations were simulated in an economic model and then potential solutions to cope with climate change were analyzed 2 1 study area the watershed hamadan bahar fig 1 with the extent of 2459 sq km is located in the northern hillsides of alvand mountain in western iran about 141744 ha of the area is used for agricultural activities out of which about 77035 ha are cultivated under irrigated crops 40 surface irrigation and 60 pressurized irrigation and about 64709 ha are rainfed soltani and mosavi 2015 there is no permanent river in hamadan bahar plain and surface water plays a limited role in the provision of agricultural water supply therefore existing groundwater resources are the most important source of water supply for agricultural purposes on the other hand excessive use of groundwater resources has negatively affected water balance since 1992 and endangered these rare resources of the plain balali et al 2011 2 2 physiological model in the physiological aspect of the study the sensitivity of crop yield concerning co2 emissions level temperature and rainfall was determined using a quadratic yield response regression model shown in eq 1 attavanich and mccarl 2011 chang 2002 ozkan and akcaoz 2002 shi et al 2013 1 y θ 0 θ 1 t e s θ 2 t e s 2 θ 3 r a s θ 4 r a s 2 θ 5 c o 2 θ 6 c o 2 2 θ 7 v t e s θ 8 v r a s θ 9 v c o 2 θ 10 t r in this equation s represents the season of cultivation y represents the crop yield t e s is mean season temperature r a s is total rainfall of season s co2 is emission levels of carbon dioxide and v t e s v r a s and v c o 2 indicate the deviation of temperature rainfall and carbon dioxide emission level from their long term mean value respectively additionally t r is the time trend variable and represents the change in crop production technology over time and θ 0 to θ 10 are coefficients that should be estimated it should be noted that in this study to observe the parsimony principle and the rational paucity of variables some variables that have less effect on the model were discarded however in the yield response regression model eq 1 the impact of other factors affecting the crop yield that is not considered were covered in the error component baltagi 2005 after estimating the coefficients the sensitivity of each crop yield was determined relative to temperature rainfall and co2 emission level it should be noted that the sensitivity elasticity is the percentage change of the dependent variable relative to the percentage variation of the independent variables general maximum entropy gme method was used to estimate the above model because too many explanatory variables of the model lead to a reduction in the degree of freedom and the ill posed problem occurred caputo and paris 2008 the adoption of gme for estimating the ill posed problem led to obtaining unique and efficient results the approach used for estimating the coefficients of yield function is as follows let x be considered as a random variable with a discrete distribution p x x i p i where i p i 1 the entropy measure introduced by shannon 1948 is defined by h i p i l n p i consider the yield response model in the form of y x β e also suppose we have j prior information in the form of bounds or support points on the parameter β now parameter β i can be rewritten by the linear combination of the bounds 2 β i p i 1 θ i 1 p i 2 θ i 2 p i j θ i j β i j 1 j j p i j θ i j p i j 0 1 i p i j 1 similarly for the error term e i we have 3 e i π i 1 φ i 1 π i 2 φ i 2 π i j φ i k e i k 1 k k π i k φ i k π i k 0 1 i π i k 1 the maximum entropy problem for the yield response model can now be stated as 4 max h i j p ij ln p ij i k π ik ln π ik s t y xβ e β i j 1 j j p ij θ ij e i k 1 k k π ik φ ik i p ij 1 i π ik 1 p ij 0 1 π ik 0 1 to find response coefficients this model was executed and solved for each crop separately and also the accuracy and the validity of the estimated coefficients were examined using the normalized entropy criterion this criterion is introduced as follows huang et al 2012 5 s h m l n n in this equation which indicates the ratio of the unexplained changes to the total variation h is entropy m is the total number of estimated coefficients and n is the number of support values for each of the coefficients 1 s indicates the degree of model fit to estimate the yield response regression model eq 1 the data on crop yield 1992 2013 was collected by referring to iran ministry of agriculture jihad 2013 also the data on rainfall temperate and co2 emission in the plain 1992 2013 were collected by referring to iran meteorological organization 2013 and iran ministry of energy 2013 2 3 hydrological model in the hydrological aspect the sensitivity of groundwater resources was determined concerning temperature and rainfall variations as well as net extracting extraction minus return flow in fact in this section according to the concept of sensitivity the percentage change in groundwater resources was determined concerning 1 changes in independent variables such as temperature and rainfall baltagi 2005 for this purpose the initial depth level of water was selected as an indicator of groundwater changes khan et al 2008 shahid and hazarika 2010 then changes in the groundwater level of the plain were also predicted using the panel data regression model arellano 2003 baltagi 2005 izady et al 2012 for this purpose the following groundwater conceptual model was used 6 ln h t μ 0 μ 1 ln p t μ 2 ln t m i n t μ 3 ln t m a x t μ 4 ln h t 1 in this equation t represents time μ 0 to μ 4 are the model coefficients that should be estimated h t is groundwater level in t year r a t is total annual rainfall t m i n and t m a x are the minimum and maximum temperature on the annual scale respectively and finally h t 1 is the level of groundwater in the past time period alternative to net extraction and return flow in the model online appendix a1 releases detailed information about the groundwater conceptual model to estimate the above model first the piezometric wells in the plain were classified by cluster analysis process and in each cluster a piezometer well was introduced as the representative of that cluster to determine the precise number of clusters and study total plain surface a 99 similarity level was considered within the cluster accordingly selected piezometric wells were classified into 7 clusters and in each of them a piezometer with the least deviations from the cluster average was introduced as the representative after using gis the location of each representative piezometer as well as the meteorological stations located in the plain were determined after determining piezometric wells as sectional units in eq 6 rainfall level minimum and maximum temperatures affecting the groundwater level of each section were obtained then the conceptual model of groundwater eq 6 was estimated by using the panel data regression model concerning representative piezometers as cross units from 1998 to 2011 i e 7 wells and 14 years to estimate the regression model of the panel data eq 6 first the stationarity of variables was examined fisher 1999 im et al 2003 levin et al 2003 also the occurrence of a long term equilibrium relationship among the variables was investigated by the results of kao 1999 and pedroni 1999 tests in the next stage the lagrange multiplier test lm was used to determine the existence of variance heteroscedasticity in the model breusch and pagan 1980 as shown the hypothesis of the variance homoscedasticity between cross sectional units was not confirmed therefore the gls generalized least squares method was used to estimate the model to eliminate heterogeneity of variance then chow hausman and lagrange multiplier tests were used to find the appropriate estimation strategy for the developed panel data model chow 1960 hausman 1978 according to the results the fixed effects model was selected as the most suitable pattern for estimating the panel data regression model the conceptual model of groundwater eq 6 was estimated using fixed effects approach in the logarithmic form arellano 2003 baltagi 2005 to estimate the model eq 6 the data 1998 2011 on piezometric wells and groundwater depth in the plain were collected by referring to iran water resources management 2013 also the data on climatic parameters 1998 2011 were collected from iran meteorological organization 2013 2 4 meteorological model and climate scenarios temperature and rainfall variations were predicted on the horizons of 2050 the period 2040 2069 and 2090 the period 2070 2099 using lars wg long ashton research station weather generator meteorological data simulator model at the synoptic weather stations located in the plain and through three climatic scenarios that is ssp1 ssp2 and ssp3 in cmip6 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 absar and preston 2015 bohmelt 2017 dellink et al 2017 in the lars wg model the data generation process is done in three steps calibration evaluation and simulation first for each of the parameters the difference between the mean value of the data generated in the base period and the average value of data generated in the future period is calculated and then this difference is added to the mean value of observational data the eq 7 presents this concept 7 f f u t f o b s f g c m f u t f g c m b a s e in this regard f f u t f o b s f g c m f u t and f g c m b a s e respectively represent predicted observed predicted on the network in the upcoming period and generated parameter on the network during the base period the above equation was calculated for each of the rainfall radiation minimum and maximum temperatures in the 2050 and 2090 horizons in three scenarios ssp1 ssp2 and ssp3 after that the change of these variables was determined as compared to 2013 more information about scenarios calibration evaluation and simulation of the meteorological model is presented in online appendix a2 the data in this section were collected from iran meteorological organization 2013 to predict the level of carbon dioxide emissions in the climatic scenarios on the horizons of 2050 and 2090 in the plain the results of previous studies in the region such as soltani and mosavi 2016 were used then the percentage change of co2 emission level was compared with that of 2013 in each scenario attavanich and mccarl 2011 2 5 economic model in the last stage the cultivation pattern of the region was simulated using the positive mathematical programming pmp approach howitt 1995 howitt et al 2001 akbari et al 2020 pmp is a threefold method used traditionally to calibrate an agricultural model online appendix a3 releases detailed information about pmp then the effects of changes in co2 emission temperature and rainfall on the cultivation pattern were simulated using the previous findings of this study the empirical model of this study was expanded in the linear programming framework as set out in the eqs 8 to 15 8 max gm i 1 x i p i y i c w i c i 9 s t i 1 w c i x i gw sw 10 i 1 x i tland 11 i 1 k i x i tinvest 12 i 1 m i x i tmachin 13 i 1 l i x i

ha c w i is the cost of using water per ha of the crop i c i the cost of using other production inputs rather than water per ha of the crop i and w c i k i m i l i and f i are the consumption rate of water capital machinery labor and chemical fertilizers per ha for the production of the crop i in addition gw sw tland tlabour and tfeltilizer represent the total amount of the resources of groundwater surface water land labor and fertilizers available for the crop activities in the plain tinvest also represents the total cash available in the region and tmachin shows the total capacity of the machinery in hours eq 8 represents the objective function and eqs 9 to 15 represent the constraints considered in the model the objective function maximizes the annual gross return of all crop activities in the plain the cost functions used in the objective function are the sum of costs related to land water labor fertilizers and machinery also the model constraints include water resources crop area capital machinery labor and chemical fertilizers it should be noted that the constraint related to the fertilizer is reused for each fertilizer i e nitrogen phosphate and potash the constraint of water resources shows that the water required for cultivation is the sum of the groundwater and surface water available there is no permanent river in the study plain and the water is mainly supplied through groundwater resources so the constraint of the groundwater resources is the most important constraint in the plain soltani and mosavi 2016 other model constraints also indicate that the use of any land capital machinery labor and chemical fertilizers to produce each hectare of crop i cannot exceed the total available plain resources the developed pmp model was executed in gams general algebraic modeling system programming environment and was solved using the conopt3 computational nonlinear optimizer algorithm to obtain valid simulated results on changing co2 emission temperature and rainfall in the cultivation pattern the model was calibrated using maximum entropy me and simulations were done considering the predicted parameters at the previous stages to simulate the pmp model the data and information on technical coefficients crop yield prices inputs and outputs resource availability and costs were obtained using a two stage cluster sampling method in 2013 to do this a sample of 360 farmers in the plain was selected and the designed questionnaires online appendix a5 were completed 2 6 management strategies to mitigate climate change effects 2 6 1 strategy 1 deficit irrigation in this study two strategies for compliance with climate change in the agricultural sector of hamadan bahar plain were discussed the predominantly irrigated crops in the plain include water intensive crops such as potato wheat and alfalfa which alone account for more than 86 of the total irrigated crop of the region therefore the adoption of optimal deficit irrigation strategy for water intensive crops was considered as the first approach for compliance with the phenomenon of climate change deficit irrigation is an optimization plan that intentionally allows the plants to tolerate some degree of dehydration and yield loss the main purpose of deficit irrigation is to increase water use efficiency which can be achieved through the reduction in the amount of water needed in each irrigation or removal of irrigation without productivity asaadi 2017 in the present study 20 scenarios of deficit irrigation by reducing 1 20 amount of water used per hectare for water intensive crops that is potato wheat and alfalfa together with the acceptance of reduced yield of these crops in pmp model were simulated it is noteworthy that the generalizable plants coefficients sensitivity to the water calculated by doorenbos and kassam 1979 and reported in fao irrigation and drainage guidebook 33 were used to evaluate crop yield reduction in each irrigation scenario finally percentage changes of economic indicators on the climate scenarios and various dehydration plans were evaluated 2 6 2 strategy 2 improved irrigation infrastructure the use of new irrigation techniques and attention on the productivity of water used in agriculture increased by researchers and policymakers mosavi and alipour 2019 with the use of these new technologies the efficiency of water use increased by about 30 lamaddalena and sagardoy 2000 as stated earlier about 33 of the agricultural lands of the plain are equipped with modern irrigation systems in this study the extension of the use of modern irrigation systems to the total irrigated area has been considered as another policy to compensate for the harmful effects of climate change 2 7 assessment of farmer viewpoints finally to examine the operational capability of the adaptive strategies their acceptance level by the farmers was evaluated azizi khalkheili et al 2016 taher abadi et al 2016 for this purpose different legal institutional environmental economic and social aspects of adopting the two strategies were analyzed statistically by obtaining survey data from farmers in hamadan bahar plain the questionnaire form is presented in online appendix a4 for example in the legal aspects of the discussion issues such as the number of farmers exploited wells the legality of the use of wells and having permission for the use of wells from legal authorities observance of the legal distance between wells etc were examined and the legal barriers which the farmers are confronted with for the use of optimal irrigation methods and new irrigation systems were specified 3 results and discussion some observed data such as crop yield and cultivated area of the region in 2013 are presented in table 1 among the crops potato irrigated wheat and alfalfa have the highest cultivated area and forage corn and potato have the highest yield in the region also at the baseline 2013 in hamadan bahar plain the average annual temperature was 13 20 c the total annual precipitation was 188 mm the carbon dioxide emission level 5330 million kg the absolute groundwater depth based on free water level 1711 m gross return us 177 94 million and the economic value of water us 8 to estimate the elasticity of crop yield relative to co2 emission level temperature and rainfall the yield response regression model was estimated using the gme method the obtained results are presented in table 2 as shown the yield sensitivity of c3 crops to co2 emission is positive this result is also found in other studies such as attavanich and mccarl 2011 and long et al 2005 it is necessary to explain that about 90 of the plant species of the earth are among the c3 plants edwards and ogburn 2012 gowik and westhoff 2011 miyao 2003 all crops examined in this study are the c3 crops among which only forage corn is a c4 crop sage and zhu 2011 grodzinski et al 1998 as shown in table 2 rainfed wheat chickpea and alfalfa had the highest sensitivity to co2 emissions level in the case of forage corn the yield will not change with an increase in co2 emissions but would increase with temperature rise in the explanation should be said the c4 plants have higher photosynthesis rates than the c3 plants but at temperatures below 25 degrees celsius the opposite happens ehleringer and björkman 1977 sage and zhu 2011 also because of higher photosynthetic yields in the c4 plants the saturation point of carbon dioxide in the c3 plants is more than the c4 plants kim et al 2007 therefore the c4 plants do not react to high concentrations of carbon dioxide with increase in temperature table 2 the yield of majority of cucurbits and not all of the cucurbits is improved but the results for pumpkin are in contrast to other the cucurbits it should be explained that sensitivity of crop yield to climate conditions depends on environmental conditions and various factors such as soil type irrigation rate and date of cultivation are effective for example rainfed watermelon and irrigated watermelon have different sensitivities to climatic variables due to the different cultivation conditions more precisely the sensitivity of crop yield to climate variables varies between regions and among crops chang 2002 the rainfall parameter in some cases e g rainfed lentil and rainfed watermelon has a negative impact on the yield because rainfall increases air humidity and reduces sun radiation in such cases probability of the damage caused by pests and diseases is increased which causes reduced yield kokic et al 2004 in addition lack of coordination between time distribution of rainfall and plant growth stages can be another reason for reduction of yield crops for sugar beet rapeseed and pumpkin due to the negativity of sensitivities with increasing temperature yield decreases and with decreasing precipitation yield increases therefore the final change in yield depends on the exact amount of temperature rise and precipitation decline in the coming years for irrigated wheat bean irrigated barley chickpea garlic and alfalfa the yield decreases with decreasing rainfall and decreases with rising temperature therefore if the current trend of the plain climate change continues in the coming years falling rainfall and rising temperature the yield of these crops will decrease with this explanation the yield of cucumber and rainfed watermelon was positively affected by the current trend of climate parameters the obtained results of the normalized entropy criterion s p ˆ presented in the last column of table 2 indicate that accuracy and validity of the estimated coefficients in the yield response model using the gme technique is more than 85 in most crops in the following the groundwater level was predicted as a result of the climate parameter change the results showed the stationarity of all the variables online appendix a1 also the occurrence of a long term equilibrium relationship among the variables was confirmed online appendix a1 the results of the estimated model are shown in table 3 the results show that rainfall had a positive effect and the minimum and maximum temperatures had a negative impact on the groundwater level in hamadan bahar plain during the period of 1998 2011 these results have been confirmed in many previous studies such as shahvari et al 2019 and izady et al 2012 also the durbin watson statistic the coefficient of determination and the estimated error term were equal to 1 9 0 96 and 0 19 respectively these parameters indicate that the panel data model is valid enough to predict groundwater level in this region the climatic scenarios were downscaled in the studied region the climatic parameters of the plain were projected using the lars wg meteorological data model in the scenarios ssp1 ssp2 and ssp3 on the horizons of 2050 and 2090 then the percentage change of parameters was calculated and compared with the base year 2013 the obtained results are presented in table 4 based on the results the level of co2 emissions in the plain will increase in the coming years for example in the most optimistic prediction ssp1 on the horizon of 2090 there would be about 22 8 increase in the initial level of this gas as compared to the baseline similarly the temperature is projected to rise by about 14 7 and rainfall would reduce by almost 14 4 changes in temperature and rainfall based on the computational coefficients in table 3 lead to changes in groundwater available in the region the amount of these changes is presented in table 4 accordingly in the most optimistic prediction on the horizon 2090 groundwater available in the plain is anticipated to reduce by about 12 3 it should be noted that in most previous studies in iran such as shahvari et al 2019 it is predicted that temperature precipitation and co2 will increase decrease and increase in the coming decades respectively yield responses as compared to the baseline as a result of changes in temperature rainfall and co2 predicted in each of the climatic scenarios table 5 on the horizon 2090 the yield of irrigated barley rainfed barley potato garlic pumpkin rapeseed irrigated wheat bean and chickpea would decrease among all the highest yield reduction in all scenarios is related to rainfed barley irrigated barley and chickpea respectively besides in all the scenarios among other crops that their yield would increase tomato is pioneering because tomato has the highest positive sensitivity to temperature therefore with increasing temperature tomato yield will increase more than other crops this result is also found in tomato crop in other studies such as lobell et al 2007 and medellin azuara et al 2011 in the following crops yield changes as well as changes in the groundwater available were included in the pmp model and changes in crop pattern changes in the agricultural value added and economic value of water were calculated as compared to the baseline the results of the simulations for each of the climatic scenarios are presented in fig 2 and table 6 as shown in fig 2 the share of water intensive crops such as irrigated wheat irrigated barley alfalfa potato watermelon tomato sugar beet rapeseed forage corn cucumber and bean would decrease and the share of other water saving crops like all rainfed products would increase in future years and the face of climate change the economic value of water would increase in the future decades in hamadan bahar plain which itself represents the severity of water scarcity in the agricultural sector for example in the most optimistic prediction on the horizon of 2090 the increase in temperature equals 14 7 the reduction in rainfall is about 14 4 and the increase in co2 emission would be equal to 22 8 as a result scarcity of water would intensify and therefore the economic value of water at the mentioned horizon would rise by 44 as compared to the baseline also in the most pessimistic prediction based on scenario ssp3 the economic value of water is predicted to rise by 55 this result is also found in other studies such as soltani and mosavi 2015 and shahvari et al 2019 these results show the yield of crops improved moderately by an increase in co2 emissions but this improvement does not have the capacity to compensate for the loss caused by increased temperature and reduced rainfall and as a result the yield of most crops would reduce also groundwater resources were negatively affected by the reduction of rainfall and an increase in temperature and therefore climate change in the plain in future decades would reduce the availability of groundwater resources in the region also the results of the economic analysis indicate a reduction in agricultural value added and an increase in the economic value of water in the agricultural sector therefore it can be concluded that climate change is accompanied by a reduced amount of water allocated to agricultural activities in this study zone and farmers would face more shortage of water resources in the coming decades this result is also found in other studies such as balali et al 2011 and medellin azuara et al 2011 as a remedy it is indispensable to adopt counteract policies to eliminate the mentioned harmful effects in the following sections in addition to the reduction of the cultivation area of water intensive crops two strategies for compliance with climate change in the agricultural sector of the zone were discussed 3 1 strategy 1 deficit irrigation in this strategy percentage changes of economic indicators on the average climate scenarios and various dehydration plans were discussed table 7 with regards to the observed results and for conciseness the results of deficit irrigation scenarios of 3 5 and 10 were presented it is also worth noting that in table 7 in the row related to the current irrigation plan the results of table 6 in the previous section were summarized and each number in this row represents the mean of the predicted parameters in the climatic scenarios for example number 19 in this row indicates that the plain as a result of the climate change projected in the scenarios of ssp1 ssp2 and ssp3 would face on average 19 reduction in agricultural value added on the horizon of 2050 similarly the numbers in the other rows in table 7 indicate the level of change in value added and or economic value of water after applying deficit irrigation in the average climatic scenarios as shown the least increase in the economic value of water occurred in the scenario of 10 deficit irrigation but in this scenario the value added reduction is more than that of the current irrigation plan table 6 therefore the mentioned scenario is not optimal and is not recommended as an adaptive approach similarly the scenario of 5 deficit irrigation is also not optimal the profit reduction in the scenario of 3 deficit irrigation would be lower than the current plan therefore the scenario of 3 deficit irrigation may be recommended as an optimal solution in compliance with the climate change in hamadan bahar plain these results are confirmed by the previous findings of soltani and mosavi 2015 and asaadi 2017 the operational mechanism for 3 deficit irrigation is through an increase in irrigation period by only one day from 10 to 11 or by eliminating just one irrigation in the late growing season of the mentioned water intensive plant usually in august 3 2 strategy 2 improved irrigation infrastructure table 8 presents the percentage of changes in the economic value of water as well as the value added changes as compared to 2013 when all farmers in the region use modern irrigation technology in their cultivation pattern as shown after upgrading the irrigation technology used by farmers in the region the percentage of increase in the economic value of water in the mean of climatic scenarios would be equal to 19 and 24 on the horizons of 2050 and 2090 respectively it should be noted that the numbers are derived from the calculation of the average value of each column in table 8 comparison of the results with those presented in table 6 that is in the absence of upgrading irrigation technology show that increase decrease in the economic value of water value added in the average climatic scenarios would fall therefore considering the above results it can be concluded that farmers tendency towards new methods of irrigation would be beneficial in reducing the scarcity of water resources in the region table 9 presents the results of the statistical comparison of these two strategies among farmers the results of the survey indicate that from a legal perspective the common pool nature of groundwater resources is the biggest factor for a reduction in willingness to accept deficit irrigation strategies by farmers it was also observed that farmers tend to use saved water in the production of other products in their cultivation pattern also farmers were reluctant to improve their irrigation technology due to insufficient capital inadequate collateral for loans and institutional problems in obtaining loans it was also observed that farmers did not consider a significant difference between the two strategies from social and environmental aspects however the survey showed a high acceptance level of improving irrigation technology as compared to deficit irrigation strategy since the common pool nature of groundwater has always been the major challenge to optimal extraction of these resources it means that there is fear among farmers that by reducing their water consumption and profits the consumption of other farmers from this common source may not be reduced and probably be increased in other words the lack of a necessary legal mechanism requiring all farmers to implement this policy would reduce its acceptance level as compared to the capital intensive strategy of improving irrigation technology 4 conclusions this study was conducted to evaluate the potential impact of climate change in a typical semi arid agrarian plain of iran hamadan bahar and to find the best strategy to compensate for the probable harmful impacts for this purpose the physiological hydrological and meteorological aspects of the problem were integrated into an economic model and the changes in cultivation pattern of the plain were projected in counterfactual climatic scenarios the results indicate a reduction in agricultural value added and an increase in the economic value of water in the agricultural sector under such conditions the adoption of the strategies for compliance with climate change in the agricultural sector will play a significant role in mitigating the potential damage of this phenomenon the results of the study also show that deficit irrigation strategy and upgrading irrigation technology from the surface to pressurized as two appropriate policies may partly compensate for the harmful effects of the climate change phenomenon however it is noteworthy that acceptance of the two adaptive strategies is not the same among the farmers the common pool nature of groundwater resources as well as the profit reduction together with the adoption of deficit irrigation strategy resulted in a lower acceptance level of this policy as compared to other capital intensive plans therefore it is suggested to adapt and apply necessary measures to invest in and develop innovative irrigation systems by farmers in the coming years in compliance with climate change besides restricting the cultivation of water intensive crops such as potato wheat and alfalfa furthermore the determination of specific strategies to explain the ownership and extraction of underground water resources by farmers are other challenges that need to be addressed fundamentally in the plain declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found in the online version at doi https doi org 10 1016 j agwat 2020 106332 appendix a supplementary data the following is supplementary data to this article 
10478,the present study evaluated the potential impacts of climate change of hamadan bahar plain on dimensions including economical physiological hydrological and meteorological aspects the results showed that climate change in the region has negative impacts on the agricultural sector by reducing the crop yield as well as groundwater balance in the most optimistic scenario on the horizon of 2090 rainfall and groundwater levels would reduce by 14 4 and 12 3 respectively and the average temperature would rise by 14 7 accordingly the economic value of water would increase by 44 and the agricultural value added net income would fall by 19 indicating the intensification of water shortage crisis and agricultural recession also the results of this study show that optimal deficit irrigation strategy in the production of water intensive crops as well as improving irrigation technologies would be potential solutions to the climate change crisis in the coming years however the common pool nature of groundwater resources in addition to capital inadequacy are the challenges faced when adopting these two approaches by farmers keywords global warming groundwater resources co2 deficit irrigation crop yield 1 introduction climate is a combination of dominating and enduring atmospheric characteristics of a geographic zone over time and is often determined based on variables such as temperature rainfall moisture wind and solar radiation zhang et al 2017 various studies have shown the effect of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions on the earth s climate e g long et al 2005 najafi alamdarlo 2018 after vapor co2 is the most important greenhouse gas that absorbs infrared rays in the atmosphere agriculture as a biophysical system is heavily dependent on climatic conditions and any change can affect agricultural output through crop yield variation chen et al 2016 the initial effect of increasing co2 emission on agricultural products is the enhancement of the photosynthesis process and reduction in transpiration of plants which will have a positive effect on plant yield long et al 2005 on the other hand an increase in co2 and the associated greenhouse effect results in a higher temperature drier plant environment is due to rainfall reduction and increased evaporation from the soil surface both attributed to temperature rise vanuytrecht et al 2012 this phenomenon increases the water requirement of plants water usage and as a result water demand will increase in the agricultural sector gosling and arnell 2016 moreover the soil nutrients are damaged by the increase of temperature because the rise of temperature leads to increased microbial activity in the soil and in fact an increase in the rate of degradation of organic matter in the soil which will lead to gradual soil erosion the higher temperature shorter durability of the plant s growth stages and the biomass will be reduced accordingly the crop yield is changed by fluctuating the level of co2 emissions and the resulting climate changes frenck et al 2011 this event has more harmful effects on arid and semi arid regions of the world like iran for instance an increase in temperature and reduction of rainfall as a part of the effects of climate change will be the future crisis in most agrarian plains of iran bijani et al 2017 soltani and mosavi 2015 the watershed hamadan bahar located in western iran is a clear example of this event according to meteorological data released climate change has appeared in the plain with the increase in temperature reduction of rainfall and increase in co2 emissions in the past two decades so that in hamadan bahar plain in years 1991 and 2011 the temperature has been 8 2 and 12 c rainfall has been 430 and 200 mm and co2 emissions have been 3500 and 5110 million kg respectively iran meteorological organization 2013 iran ministry of energy 2013 mosavi 2016 therefore according to the stated problem long term agricultural planning requires careful analysis of weather conditions in the plain several studies have been conducted to estimate the effects of climate change on the agricultural sector around the world attavanich and mccarl 2011 analyzed the welfare consequences of climate changes and improvement of technology in the agricultural sector of the us and found that over the horizon of 2050 the consumers surplus will increase the producers surplus will decrease and the overall welfare will increase up to 2 27 billion medellin azuara et al 2011 also note that until 2050 due to climate changes such as rising temperatures and reduced precipitation agricultural land use water supply and the yield of most crops will decrease and the production costs will increase in california van passel et al 2017 using the ricardian approach found that the loss of european farmers in the face of various climate scenarios in the horizon of 2100 is in the range of 5 to 32 calzadilla et al 2013 showed that climate change in sub saharan africa will lead to a 1 6 drop in food production and a 0 2 decline in gross domestic product however a 3 increase in the productivity of crops by 2050 can compensate for these losses najafi alamdarlo et al 2016 also showed that the scarcity of water resources and heavy exploitation of groundwater as a consequence of climate change in the varamin plain of iran will be reduced by adopting proper water pricing policies and providing subsidies to improve the efficiency of irrigation systems the above results have also been discussed in salehi et al 2017 in this regard soltani and mosavi 2016 acknowledged that in the most pessimistic scenario the increase in the level of carbon dioxide emissions and climate changes in hamadan bahar plain will reduce the groundwater resources and increase the economic value of water until 2040 it should be noted that similar results were obtained in the study by thamo et al 2017 investigating the effects of climate change on the australian agricultural sector the contribution of this study to the literature is the holistic view on all economics physiologic hydrologic and meteorological aspects of climate change in the agricultural sector this study may be useful to future researchers and policy makers in adopting the more relevant policy for the climate change phenomenon this study aims at investigating the economic effects of climate change on the agricultural sector including the yield of crops water resources and profitability in hamadan bahar plain the hypothesis tested in this research is that climate change has negative impacts on the agricultural sector in the study area and it is necessary to present solutions to reduce these effects accordingly the question answered in this study is whether climate change in the region reduces crop yields the profitability of the agricultural sector and aggravation of the scarcity of water resources the various solutions to these problems are also sought 2 methodology the present study tracked the probable impacts of climate change of hamadan bahar plain on dimensions including economical agronomic hydrological and meteorological aspects in the hydrological and agronomic aspects the reaction of groundwater and crop yield to climatic variables were estimated respectively also in the meteorological aspect climate change was predicted these estimations were simulated in an economic model and then potential solutions to cope with climate change were analyzed 2 1 study area the watershed hamadan bahar fig 1 with the extent of 2459 sq km is located in the northern hillsides of alvand mountain in western iran about 141744 ha of the area is used for agricultural activities out of which about 77035 ha are cultivated under irrigated crops 40 surface irrigation and 60 pressurized irrigation and about 64709 ha are rainfed soltani and mosavi 2015 there is no permanent river in hamadan bahar plain and surface water plays a limited role in the provision of agricultural water supply therefore existing groundwater resources are the most important source of water supply for agricultural purposes on the other hand excessive use of groundwater resources has negatively affected water balance since 1992 and endangered these rare resources of the plain balali et al 2011 2 2 physiological model in the physiological aspect of the study the sensitivity of crop yield concerning co2 emissions level temperature and rainfall was determined using a quadratic yield response regression model shown in eq 1 attavanich and mccarl 2011 chang 2002 ozkan and akcaoz 2002 shi et al 2013 1 y θ 0 θ 1 t e s θ 2 t e s 2 θ 3 r a s θ 4 r a s 2 θ 5 c o 2 θ 6 c o 2 2 θ 7 v t e s θ 8 v r a s θ 9 v c o 2 θ 10 t r in this equation s represents the season of cultivation y represents the crop yield t e s is mean season temperature r a s is total rainfall of season s co2 is emission levels of carbon dioxide and v t e s v r a s and v c o 2 indicate the deviation of temperature rainfall and carbon dioxide emission level from their long term mean value respectively additionally t r is the time trend variable and represents the change in crop production technology over time and θ 0 to θ 10 are coefficients that should be estimated it should be noted that in this study to observe the parsimony principle and the rational paucity of variables some variables that have less effect on the model were discarded however in the yield response regression model eq 1 the impact of other factors affecting the crop yield that is not considered were covered in the error component baltagi 2005 after estimating the coefficients the sensitivity of each crop yield was determined relative to temperature rainfall and co2 emission level it should be noted that the sensitivity elasticity is the percentage change of the dependent variable relative to the percentage variation of the independent variables general maximum entropy gme method was used to estimate the above model because too many explanatory variables of the model lead to a reduction in the degree of freedom and the ill posed problem occurred caputo and paris 2008 the adoption of gme for estimating the ill posed problem led to obtaining unique and efficient results the approach used for estimating the coefficients of yield function is as follows let x be considered as a random variable with a discrete distribution p x x i p i where i p i 1 the entropy measure introduced by shannon 1948 is defined by h i p i l n p i consider the yield response model in the form of y x β e also suppose we have j prior information in the form of bounds or support points on the parameter β now parameter β i can be rewritten by the linear combination of the bounds 2 β i p i 1 θ i 1 p i 2 θ i 2 p i j θ i j β i j 1 j j p i j θ i j p i j 0 1 i p i j 1 similarly for the error term e i we have 3 e i π i 1 φ i 1 π i 2 φ i 2 π i j φ i k e i k 1 k k π i k φ i k π i k 0 1 i π i k 1 the maximum entropy problem for the yield response model can now be stated as 4 max h i j p ij ln p ij i k π ik ln π ik s t y xβ e β i j 1 j j p ij θ ij e i k 1 k k π ik φ ik i p ij 1 i π ik 1 p ij 0 1 π ik 0 1 to find response coefficients this model was executed and solved for each crop separately and also the accuracy and the validity of the estimated coefficients were examined using the normalized entropy criterion this criterion is introduced as follows huang et al 2012 5 s h m l n n in this equation which indicates the ratio of the unexplained changes to the total variation h is entropy m is the total number of estimated coefficients and n is the number of support values for each of the coefficients 1 s indicates the degree of model fit to estimate the yield response regression model eq 1 the data on crop yield 1992 2013 was collected by referring to iran ministry of agriculture jihad 2013 also the data on rainfall temperate and co2 emission in the plain 1992 2013 were collected by referring to iran meteorological organization 2013 and iran ministry of energy 2013 2 3 hydrological model in the hydrological aspect the sensitivity of groundwater resources was determined concerning temperature and rainfall variations as well as net extracting extraction minus return flow in fact in this section according to the concept of sensitivity the percentage change in groundwater resources was determined concerning 1 changes in independent variables such as temperature and rainfall baltagi 2005 for this purpose the initial depth level of water was selected as an indicator of groundwater changes khan et al 2008 shahid and hazarika 2010 then changes in the groundwater level of the plain were also predicted using the panel data regression model arellano 2003 baltagi 2005 izady et al 2012 for this purpose the following groundwater conceptual model was used 6 ln h t μ 0 μ 1 ln p t μ 2 ln t m i n t μ 3 ln t m a x t μ 4 ln h t 1 in this equation t represents time μ 0 to μ 4 are the model coefficients that should be estimated h t is groundwater level in t year r a t is total annual rainfall t m i n and t m a x are the minimum and maximum temperature on the annual scale respectively and finally h t 1 is the level of groundwater in the past time period alternative to net extraction and return flow in the model online appendix a1 releases detailed information about the groundwater conceptual model to estimate the above model first the piezometric wells in the plain were classified by cluster analysis process and in each cluster a piezometer well was introduced as the representative of that cluster to determine the precise number of clusters and study total plain surface a 99 similarity level was considered within the cluster accordingly selected piezometric wells were classified into 7 clusters and in each of them a piezometer with the least deviations from the cluster average was introduced as the representative after using gis the location of each representative piezometer as well as the meteorological stations located in the plain were determined after determining piezometric wells as sectional units in eq 6 rainfall level minimum and maximum temperatures affecting the groundwater level of each section were obtained then the conceptual model of groundwater eq 6 was estimated by using the panel data regression model concerning representative piezometers as cross units from 1998 to 2011 i e 7 wells and 14 years to estimate the regression model of the panel data eq 6 first the stationarity of variables was examined fisher 1999 im et al 2003 levin et al 2003 also the occurrence of a long term equilibrium relationship among the variables was investigated by the results of kao 1999 and pedroni 1999 tests in the next stage the lagrange multiplier test lm was used to determine the existence of variance heteroscedasticity in the model breusch and pagan 1980 as shown the hypothesis of the variance homoscedasticity between cross sectional units was not confirmed therefore the gls generalized least squares method was used to estimate the model to eliminate heterogeneity of variance then chow hausman and lagrange multiplier tests were used to find the appropriate estimation strategy for the developed panel data model chow 1960 hausman 1978 according to the results the fixed effects model was selected as the most suitable pattern for estimating the panel data regression model the conceptual model of groundwater eq 6 was estimated using fixed effects approach in the logarithmic form arellano 2003 baltagi 2005 to estimate the model eq 6 the data 1998 2011 on piezometric wells and groundwater depth in the plain were collected by referring to iran water resources management 2013 also the data on climatic parameters 1998 2011 were collected from iran meteorological organization 2013 2 4 meteorological model and climate scenarios temperature and rainfall variations were predicted on the horizons of 2050 the period 2040 2069 and 2090 the period 2070 2099 using lars wg long ashton research station weather generator meteorological data simulator model at the synoptic weather stations located in the plain and through three climatic scenarios that is ssp1 ssp2 and ssp3 in cmip6 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 absar and preston 2015 bohmelt 2017 dellink et al 2017 in the lars wg model the data generation process is done in three steps calibration evaluation and simulation first for each of the parameters the difference between the mean value of the data generated in the base period and the average value of data generated in the future period is calculated and then this difference is added to the mean value of observational data the eq 7 presents this concept 7 f f u t f o b s f g c m f u t f g c m b a s e in this regard f f u t f o b s f g c m f u t and f g c m b a s e respectively represent predicted observed predicted on the network in the upcoming period and generated parameter on the network during the base period the above equation was calculated for each of the rainfall radiation minimum and maximum temperatures in the 2050 and 2090 horizons in three scenarios ssp1 ssp2 and ssp3 after that the change of these variables was determined as compared to 2013 more information about scenarios calibration evaluation and simulation of the meteorological model is presented in online appendix a2 the data in this section were collected from iran meteorological organization 2013 to predict the level of carbon dioxide emissions in the climatic scenarios on the horizons of 2050 and 2090 in the plain the results of previous studies in the region such as soltani and mosavi 2016 were used then the percentage change of co2 emission level was compared with that of 2013 in each scenario attavanich and mccarl 2011 2 5 economic model in the last stage the cultivation pattern of the region was simulated using the positive mathematical programming pmp approach howitt 1995 howitt et al 2001 akbari et al 2020 pmp is a threefold method used traditionally to calibrate an agricultural model online appendix a3 releases detailed information about pmp then the effects of changes in co2 emission temperature and rainfall on the cultivation pattern were simulated using the previous findings of this study the empirical model of this study was expanded in the linear programming framework as set out in the eqs 8 to 15 8 max gm i 1 x i p i y i c w i c i 9 s t i 1 w c i x i gw sw 10 i 1 x i tland 11 i 1 k i x i tinvest 12 i 1 m i x i tmachin 13 i 1 l i x i

water capital machinery labor and chemical fertilizers per ha for the production of the crop i in addition gw sw tland tlabour and tfeltilizer represent the total amount of the resources of groundwater surface water land labor and fertilizers available for the crop activities in the plain tinvest also represents the total cash available in the region and tmachin shows the total capacity of the machinery in hours eq 8 represents the objective function and eqs 9 to 15 represent the constraints considered in the model the objective function maximizes the annual gross return of all crop activities in the plain the cost functions used in the objective function are the sum of costs related to land water labor fertilizers and machinery also the model constraints include water resources crop area capital machinery labor and chemical fertilizers it should be noted that the constraint related to the fertilizer is reused for each fertilizer i e nitrogen phosphate and potash the constraint of water resources shows that the water required for cultivation is the sum of the groundwater and surface water available there is no permanent river in the study plain and the water is mainly supplied through groundwater resources so the constraint of the groundwater resources is the most important constraint in the plain soltani and mosavi 2016 other model constraints also indicate that the use of any land capital machinery labor and chemical fertilizers to produce each hectare of crop i cannot exceed the total available plain resources the developed pmp model was executed in gams general algebraic modeling system programming environment and was solved using the conopt3 computational nonlinear optimizer algorithm to obtain valid simulated results on changing co2 emission temperature and rainfall in the cultivation pattern the model was calibrated using maximum entropy me and simulations were done considering the predicted parameters at the previous stages to simulate the pmp model the data and information on technical coefficients crop yield prices inputs and outputs resource availability and costs were obtained using a two stage cluster sampling method in 2013 to do this a sample of 360 farmers in the plain was selected and the designed questionnaires online appendix a5 were completed 2 6 management strategies to mitigate climate change effects 2 6 1 strategy 1 deficit irrigation in this study two strategies for compliance with climate change in the agricultural sector of hamadan bahar plain were discussed the predominantly irrigated crops in the plain include water intensive crops such as potato wheat and alfalfa which alone account for more than 86 of the total irrigated crop of the region therefore the adoption of optimal deficit irrigation strategy for water intensive crops was considered as the first approach for compliance with the phenomenon of climate change deficit irrigation is an optimization plan that intentionally allows the plants to tolerate some degree of dehydration and yield loss the main purpose of deficit irrigation is to increase water use efficiency which can be achieved through the reduction in the amount of water needed in each irrigation or removal of irrigation without productivity asaadi 2017 in the present study 20 scenarios of deficit irrigation by reducing 1 20 amount of water used per hectare for water intensive crops that is potato wheat and alfalfa together with the acceptance of reduced yield of these crops in pmp model were simulated it is noteworthy that the generalizable plants coefficients sensitivity to the water calculated by doorenbos and kassam 1979 and reported in fao irrigation and drainage guidebook 33 were used to evaluate crop yield reduction in each irrigation scenario finally percentage changes of economic indicators on the climate scenarios and various dehydration plans were evaluated 2 6 2 strategy 2 improved irrigation infrastructure the use of new irrigation techniques and attention on the productivity of water used in agriculture increased by researchers and policymakers mosavi and alipour 2019 with the use of these new technologies the efficiency of water use increased by about 30 lamaddalena and sagardoy 2000 as stated earlier about 33 of the agricultural lands of the plain are equipped with modern irrigation systems in this study the extension of the use of modern irrigation systems to the total irrigated area has been considered as another policy to compensate for the harmful effects of climate change 2 7 assessment of farmer viewpoints finally to examine the operational capability of the adaptive strategies their acceptance level by the farmers was evaluated azizi khalkheili et al 2016 taher abadi et al 2016 for this purpose different legal institutional environmental economic and social aspects of adopting the two strategies were analyzed statistically by obtaining survey data from farmers in hamadan bahar plain the questionnaire form is presented in online appendix a4 for example in the legal aspects of the discussion issues such as the number of farmers exploited wells the legality of the use of wells and having permission for the use of wells from legal authorities observance of the legal distance between wells etc were examined and the legal barriers which the farmers are confronted with for the use of optimal irrigation methods and new irrigation systems were specified 3 results and discussion some observed data such as crop yield and cultivated area of the region in 2013 are presented in table 1 among the crops potato irrigated wheat and alfalfa have the highest cultivated area and forage corn and potato have the highest yield in the region also at the baseline 2013 in hamadan bahar plain the average annual temperature was 13 20 c the total annual precipitation was 188 mm the carbon dioxide emission level 5330 million kg the absolute groundwater depth based on free water level 1711 m gross return us 177 94 million and the economic value of water us 8 to estimate the elasticity of crop yield relative to co2 emission level temperature and rainfall the yield response regression model was estimated using the gme method the obtained results are presented in table 2 as shown the yield sensitivity of c3 crops to co2 emission is positive this result is also found in other studies such as attavanich and mccarl 2011 and long et al 2005 it is necessary to explain that about 90 of the plant species of the earth are among the c3 plants edwards and ogburn 2012 gowik and westhoff 2011 miyao 2003 all crops examined in this study are the c3 crops among which only forage corn is a c4 crop sage and zhu 2011 grodzinski et al 1998 as shown in table 2 rainfed wheat chickpea and alfalfa had the highest sensitivity to co2 emissions level in the case of forage corn the yield will not change with an increase in co2 emissions but would increase with temperature rise in the explanation should be said the c4 plants have higher photosynthesis rates than the c3 plants but at temperatures below 25 degrees celsius the opposite happens ehleringer and björkman 1977 sage and zhu 2011 also because of higher photosynthetic yields in the c4 plants the saturation point of carbon dioxide in the c3 plants is more than the c4 plants kim et al 2007 therefore the c4 plants do not react to high concentrations of carbon dioxide with increase in temperature table 2 the yield of majority of cucurbits and not all of the cucurbits is improved but the results for pumpkin are in contrast to other the cucurbits it should be explained that sensitivity of crop yield to climate conditions depends on environmental conditions and various factors such as soil type irrigation rate and date of cultivation are effective for example rainfed watermelon and irrigated watermelon have different sensitivities to climatic variables due to the different cultivation conditions more precisely the sensitivity of crop yield to climate variables varies between regions and among crops chang 2002 the rainfall parameter in some cases e g rainfed lentil and rainfed watermelon has a negative impact on the yield because rainfall increases air humidity and reduces sun radiation in such cases probability of the damage caused by pests and diseases is increased which causes reduced yield kokic et al 2004 in addition lack of coordination between time distribution of rainfall and plant growth stages can be another reason for reduction of yield crops for sugar beet rapeseed and pumpkin due to the negativity of sensitivities with increasing temperature yield decreases and with decreasing precipitation yield increases therefore the final change in yield depends on the exact amount of temperature rise and precipitation decline in the coming years for irrigated wheat bean irrigated barley chickpea garlic and alfalfa the yield decreases with decreasing rainfall and decreases with rising temperature therefore if the current trend of the plain climate change continues in the coming years falling rainfall and rising temperature the yield of these crops will decrease with this explanation the yield of cucumber and rainfed watermelon was positively affected by the current trend of climate parameters the obtained results of the normalized entropy criterion s p ˆ presented in the last column of table 2 indicate that accuracy and validity of the estimated coefficients in the yield response model using the gme technique is more than 85 in most crops in the following the groundwater level was predicted as a result of the climate parameter change the results showed the stationarity of all the variables online appendix a1 also the occurrence of a long term equilibrium relationship among the variables was confirmed online appendix a1 the results of the estimated model are shown in table 3 the results show that rainfall had a positive effect and the minimum and maximum temperatures had a negative impact on the groundwater level in hamadan bahar plain during the period of 1998 2011 these results have been confirmed in many previous studies such as shahvari et al 2019 and izady et al 2012 also the durbin watson statistic the coefficient of determination and the estimated error term were equal to 1 9 0 96 and 0 19 respectively these parameters indicate that the panel data model is valid enough to predict groundwater level in this region the climatic scenarios were downscaled in the studied region the climatic parameters of the plain were projected using the lars wg meteorological data model in the scenarios ssp1 ssp2 and ssp3 on the horizons of 2050 and 2090 then the percentage change of parameters was calculated and compared with the base year 2013 the obtained results are presented in table 4 based on the results the level of co2 emissions in the plain will increase in the coming years for example in the most optimistic prediction ssp1 on the horizon of 2090 there would be about 22 8 increase in the initial level of this gas as compared to the baseline similarly the temperature is projected to rise by about 14 7 and rainfall would reduce by almost 14 4 changes in temperature and rainfall based on the computational coefficients in table 3 lead to changes in groundwater available in the region the amount of these changes is presented in table 4 accordingly in the most optimistic prediction on the horizon 2090 groundwater available in the plain is anticipated to reduce by about 12 3 it should be noted that in most previous studies in iran such as shahvari et al 2019 it is predicted that temperature precipitation and co2 will increase decrease and increase in the coming decades respectively yield responses as compared to the baseline as a result of changes in temperature rainfall and co2 predicted in each of the climatic scenarios table 5 on the horizon 2090 the yield of irrigated barley rainfed barley potato garlic pumpkin rapeseed irrigated wheat bean and chickpea would decrease among all the highest yield reduction in all scenarios is related to rainfed barley irrigated barley and chickpea respectively besides in all the scenarios among other crops that their yield would increase tomato is pioneering because tomato has the highest positive sensitivity to temperature therefore with increasing temperature tomato yield will increase more than other crops this result is also found in tomato crop in other studies such as lobell et al 2007 and medellin azuara et al 2011 in the following crops yield changes as well as changes in the groundwater available were included in the pmp model and changes in crop pattern changes in the agricultural value added and economic value of water were calculated as compared to the baseline the results of the simulations for each of the climatic scenarios are presented in fig 2 and table 6 as shown in fig 2 the share of water intensive crops such as irrigated wheat irrigated barley alfalfa potato watermelon tomato sugar beet rapeseed forage corn cucumber and bean would decrease and the share of other water saving crops like all rainfed products would increase in future years and the face of climate change the economic value of water would increase in the future decades in hamadan bahar plain which itself represents the severity of water scarcity in the agricultural sector for example in the most optimistic prediction on the horizon of 2090 the increase in temperature equals 14 7 the reduction in rainfall is about 14 4 and the increase in co2 emission would be equal to 22 8 as a result scarcity of water would intensify and therefore the economic value of water at the mentioned horizon would rise by 44 as compared to the baseline also in the most pessimistic prediction based on scenario ssp3 the economic value of water is predicted to rise by 55 this result is also found in other studies such as soltani and mosavi 2015 and shahvari et al 2019 these results show the yield of crops improved moderately by an increase in co2 emissions but this improvement does not have the capacity to compensate for the loss caused by increased temperature and reduced rainfall and as a result the yield of most crops would reduce also groundwater resources were negatively affected by the reduction of rainfall and an increase in temperature and therefore climate change in the plain in future decades would reduce the availability of groundwater resources in the region also the results of the economic analysis indicate a reduction in agricultural value added and an increase in the economic value of water in the agricultural sector therefore it can be concluded that climate change is accompanied by a reduced amount of water allocated to agricultural activities in this study zone and farmers would face more shortage of water resources in the coming decades this result is also found in other studies such as balali et al 2011 and medellin azuara et al 2011 as a remedy it is indispensable to adopt counteract policies to eliminate the mentioned harmful effects in the following sections in addition to the reduction of the cultivation area of water intensive crops two strategies for compliance with climate change in the agricultural sector of the zone were discussed 3 1 strategy 1 deficit irrigation in this strategy percentage changes of economic indicators on the average climate scenarios and various dehydration plans were discussed table 7 with regards to the observed results and for conciseness the results of deficit irrigation scenarios of 3 5 and 10 were presented it is also worth noting that in table 7 in the row related to the current irrigation plan the results of table 6 in the previous section were summarized and each number in this row represents the mean of the predicted parameters in the climatic scenarios for example number 19 in this row indicates that the plain as a result of the climate change projected in the scenarios of ssp1 ssp2 and ssp3 would face on average 19 reduction in agricultural value added on the horizon of 2050 similarly the numbers in the other rows in table 7 indicate the level of change in value added and or economic value of water after applying deficit irrigation in the average climatic scenarios as shown the least increase in the economic value of water occurred in the scenario of 10 deficit irrigation but in this scenario the value added reduction is more than that of the current irrigation plan table 6 therefore the mentioned scenario is not optimal and is not recommended as an adaptive approach similarly the scenario of 5 deficit irrigation is also not optimal the profit reduction in the scenario of 3 deficit irrigation would be lower than the current plan therefore the scenario of 3 deficit irrigation may be recommended as an optimal solution in compliance with the climate change in hamadan bahar plain these results are confirmed by the previous findings of soltani and mosavi 2015 and asaadi 2017 the operational mechanism for 3 deficit irrigation is through an increase in irrigation period by only one day from 10 to 11 or by eliminating just one irrigation in the late growing season of the mentioned water intensive plant usually in august 3 2 strategy 2 improved irrigation infrastructure table 8 presents the percentage of changes in the economic value of water as well as the value added changes as compared to 2013 when all farmers in the region use modern irrigation technology in their cultivation pattern as shown after upgrading the irrigation technology used by farmers in the region the percentage of increase in the economic value of water in the mean of climatic scenarios would be equal to 19 and 24 on the horizons of 2050 and 2090 respectively it should be noted that the numbers are derived from the calculation of the average value of each column in table 8 comparison of the results with those presented in table 6 that is in the absence of upgrading irrigation technology show that increase decrease in the economic value of water value added in the average climatic scenarios would fall therefore considering the above results it can be concluded that farmers tendency towards new methods of irrigation would be beneficial in reducing the scarcity of water resources in the region table 9 presents the results of the statistical comparison of these two strategies among farmers the results of the survey indicate that from a legal perspective the common pool nature of groundwater resources is the biggest factor for a reduction in willingness to accept deficit irrigation strategies by farmers it was also observed that farmers tend to use saved water in the production of other products in their cultivation pattern also farmers were reluctant to improve their irrigation technology due to insufficient capital inadequate collateral for loans and institutional problems in obtaining loans it was also observed that farmers did not consider a significant difference between the two strategies from social and environmental aspects however the survey showed a high acceptance level of improving irrigation technology as compared to deficit irrigation strategy since the common pool nature of groundwater has always been the major challenge to optimal extraction of these resources it means that there is fear among farmers that by reducing their water consumption and profits the consumption of other farmers from this common source may not be reduced and probably be increased in other words the lack of a necessary legal mechanism requiring all farmers to implement this policy would reduce its acceptance level as compared to the capital intensive strategy of improving irrigation technology 4 conclusions this study was conducted to evaluate the potential impact of climate change in a typical semi arid agrarian plain of iran hamadan bahar and to find the best strategy to compensate for the probable harmful impacts for this purpose the physiological hydrological and meteorological aspects of the problem were integrated into an economic model and the changes in cultivation pattern of the plain were projected in counterfactual climatic scenarios the results indicate a reduction in agricultural value added and an increase in the economic value of water in the agricultural sector under such conditions the adoption of the strategies for compliance with climate change in the agricultural sector will play a significant role in mitigating the potential damage of this phenomenon the results of the study also show that deficit irrigation strategy and upgrading irrigation technology from the surface to pressurized as two appropriate policies may partly compensate for the harmful effects of the climate change phenomenon however it is noteworthy that acceptance of the two adaptive strategies is not the same among the farmers the common pool nature of groundwater resources as well as the profit reduction together with the adoption of deficit irrigation strategy resulted in a lower acceptance level of this policy as compared to other capital intensive plans therefore it is suggested to adapt and apply necessary measures to invest in and develop innovative irrigation systems by farmers in the coming years in compliance with climate change besides restricting the cultivation of water intensive crops such as potato wheat and alfalfa furthermore the determination of specific strategies to explain the ownership and extraction of underground water resources by farmers are other challenges that need to be addressed fundamentally in the plain declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of

10479,this study is to evaluate the bmps in the reduction of surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield from paddy cultivation for three future time slices e g the 2010s 2040s and 2070s using apex paddy agricultural policy environmental extender paddy model the model was calibrated and validated for surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield using 3 year monitoring data 2013 2015 from the conventional paddy management field cmp 1 for surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield estimates the future projections of 29 gcms general circulation model were bias corrected and applied to the calibrated apex paddy model we investigated five specific management strategies related to paddy drainage outlet regulation and new fertilization methods as the bmps minimize the mineral nitrogen yield and surface discharges due to climate change the modeling results indicated that the effects of bmps would vary by future climate scenarios i e rcp4 5 rcp8 5 and periods i e the 2010s 2040s 2070s it was generally expected that the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields would increase in the future the combination of raising drainage outlets and soil test based fertilization dor stf showed a substantial reduction in surface discharge in both scenarios rcp4 5 and 8 5 the highest reduction rate was observed in the 2010s and was estimated at 21 9 under rcp4 5 soil test based fertilization stf showed a substantial reduction in mineral nitrogen yield by 31 0 and 28 3 during the 2010s under rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 respectively followed by dor stf as compared to conventional management practice cmp 1 however the combination of drainage outlet raising and fertilizer application before outlet weir installation dor fabwi management resulted in increased mineral nitrogen yield of up to 31 0 under rcp4 5 and 36 7 under rcp8 5 the study findings indicate that climate change will increase exports of mineral nitrogen from paddy fields nevertheless appropriate bmps may play a vital role in reducing the mineral nitrogen yields for the production of paddy rice in future climates and these effects may vary according to future climate conditions keywords apex model bmps climate change mineral nitrogen yield 1 introduction the rate of agricultural production has to be increased considerably to feed the increasing global population hasler et al 2017 hazell and wood 2008 since inefficient and unsustainable use of inorganic fertilizer causes significant environmental degradation advanced agricultural technologies such as efficient fertilization methods are needed to meet the growing demand of crops tilman et al 2002 reported a 6 9 and 3 5 fold increase in nitrogen n and phosphorus p fertilization to double the yield of agricultural food worldwide up to the 1990s respectively as is evident from the data the application rate of nitrogen is likely to be too high than other fertilizers in recent years a major focus of crop breeding has been to boost yields by improving the growth response to nitrogen nonetheless it seems inefficient to use nitrogen the essential nutrient in growing and developing crops as a result large amounts of nitrogen are lost by surface runoff leaching volatilization and other natural processes brady and weil 2008 n typically enter aquatic environments through surface discharges from non point sources nps such as agricultural drainage are a significant component of diffuse water pollution gastal and lemaire 2002 as nitrogen losses are high under flooded conditions the problem is most noticeable in irrigated paddy fields nowadays the paddy field has become a vital source of nonpoint pollution nps with several factors such as excessive flood irrigation overuse of n etc consequently reducing nps pollution from paddy fields by water and n management approaches is of great importance in the water quality context different management practices called best management practices bmps are widely used to minimize the discharge of nutrients from paddy fields bmps are approaches which have been established as being the most efficient and realistic means of preventing or reducing non point source contamination to help achieve water quality objectives effective bmps for paddy water management include shallow ponding depth raising drainage outlet and no midseason forced drainage yoon et al 2003 song et al 2012 mishra et al 1998 confirmed that raising drainage outlets can save 57 100 of rainfall and thus reduce surface drainage from paddy fields reducing the rate of ponding depth to soil saturation can save 23 of irrigation water with minimal yield loss bouman and tuong 2001 paddy nutrient loss can also be reduced through proper fertilization practices yoon et al 2003 reported that fertilization impact on nutrient loss might be alleviated when paddy water is appropriately managed during the fertilizer application period however climate change is a future threat that is expected to change regional hydrological patterns thus altering the transformation and transport characteristics of nutrients discharge bouraoui et al 2002 the scientific agreement is that future increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations will result in elevated global mean temperatures with subsequent effects on regional precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture and different flow regimes in downstream water wilby et al 1994 arnell 2004 ide et al 2019 demonstrated that increased frequency of heavy rainfall due to climate change may affect agricultural land transporting nutrients into downstream water bodies therefore it is important to assess the impacts of climate change on water quantity and quality it can be assessed with data from general circulation models gcms and effective management practices in modeling strategies to minimize the nitrogen loss from paddy fields such work will allow us to prevent water shortages by providing policy analysis information and useful guidance to policymakers who can devise a framework for water resource management as well as agricultural adaptation in the future the best source for developing future climate change scenarios is the gcms however most of the gcms usually run on coarse horizontal about 100 300 km scales consequently the gcm outputs are characteristically unable to assess the impact of climate change on any national or local scale climate variables projections must be downscaled from the gcm level to obtain information on local climate change at the desired scale using either dynamic or statistical methods xu et al 2005 fowler and kilsby 2007 dynamic downscaling of climate data is more reflective of fine physical processes than statistical downscaling data but in comparison with statistical downscaling high priced computing resources are needed hong and kanamitsu 2014 kang et al 2014 lee and hong 2014 conversely climate change research is still unpredictable because of the existence of a variety of climate models and scenarios science uncertainties typically originate from a mixture of climate models downscaling methods and hydrological models brigode et al 2013 taking into account the uncertainties associated with all of the above mentioned sources would have a major effect on the simulation results and thus on the modeling performance lespinas et al 2014 one way of tackling this ambiguity is to include multiple climate models and efficiently measured climate scenarios using a statistical approach that is well accepted in the scientific community and commonly used in downscaling climate projections robock et al 1993 consequently the performance of a greater number of gcms are more representative of the structural uncertainty in climate models claudia and reto 2007 the world climate research program s wcrp coupled model intercomparison projects cmips have made general circulation model gcm outputs available phase wise this is intended to encourage improvements in the climate model in phases however these products have played a significant role in calculating climate variability sperber et al 2013 demonstrated that the cmip5 models are better able to capture certain aspects of the asian monsoon climate temperature would increase and the distribution of rainfall would be different under climate change according to the findings of the aforementioned studies with the above facts forecasting future changes in the hydrologic cycle using climate data from new sets of cimp5 gcm projections at a regional scale is of paramount importance besides the gcm projections include biases that are originated by the uncertainty inherent in the parameterization of unsolved processes the biases may be substantial enough to affect regional climate and thus bias correction is essential for the local climate impact and vulnerability assessment kunkel et al 2006 to resolve the problems associated with the use of gcms and create a better and more accurate representation of regional climate statistical downscaling and the quantile mapping method are widely used xu et al 2005 fowler and kilsby 2007 wilcke et al 2013 although many studies have examined the effects of water and fertilizer management practices on the reduction of nutrient losses from paddy fields a long term modeling approach is still needed especially where future climate change is concerned over the years several mathematical models were developed to simulate water balance and nutrient fate in flooded rice cultivation in particular such as chemicals runoﬀ and erosion from agricultural management systems in paddy ﬁelds creams paddy chin et al 2002 groundwater loading eﬀ ects of agricultural management systems in paddy ﬁelds gleams paddy chung et al 2003 and paddimod jeon et al 2004 were developed for ﬁeld scale simulation jeon et al 2007 incorporated the paddy simulation module into a watershed scale model to develop the hydrological simulation program fortran model hspf paddy in paddy ﬁelds however these models are less compatible with simulating various farming conditions and best management practices jeon et al 2005 the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model has been widely used to estimate the effects of management changes on a landscape havlik et al 2011 and to predict sediment and nutrient loss kiniry et al 1995 ramirez avila et al 2017 in upland condition however the apex model was developed without the capacity to simulate hydrology sediment and nutrient cycles in flooded paddy fields the rural development administration rda along with texas a m university revised the original apex model to enable incorporation of paddy management practices into water and nutrient discharge simulation kamruzzaman et al 2020b showed that the calibrated model was able to simulate surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield from the paddy field however the sediment and phosphorus yield is not reasonably predicted due to the limitation of the sediment water erosion sub routine of the apex paddy model kamruzzaman et al 2020a recently applied the apex paddy model to assess the components of the paddy water balance considering future climate scenarios choi et al 2017a evaluated the apex paddy model and reported higher accuracy in ﬂow and mineral nitrogen yield prediction from paddy fields choi et al 2017b also applied the apex paddy model to estimate crop yield and evapotranspiration in paddy rice cultivation under future climate scenarios however the apex paddy model has not been used to evaluate the effects of bmps on mineral nitrogen yields from paddy fields under future climate projections this is the primary motivation for our study the objective of this study was to evaluate the bmps in the reduction of surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield from paddy rice cultivation for future climate scenarios the analysis was performed based on bias corrected cmip5 simulations of the representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios 4 5 and 8 5 from 2010 2100 twenty nine different global climate models gcms outputs were applied to assess the effects of bmps on surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields from paddy fields under future climate prediction in three future time slices e g the 2010s 2040s and 2070s using the apex paddy model 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the field experiments were conducted at the paddy farms 35 9016 n 127 0331 e located near ikasn a city in the jeonbuk province of south korea as shown in fig 1 the predominant soils at the iksan experimental site are jeonbug series which is a poorly drained silty clay loam built on the ﬂuvio marine plain the physical properties of the soil s upper layer 20 cm include 11 1 sand 71 1 silt and 17 8 clay the daily meteorological records of this study were retrieved from the jeonju meteorological station near the experiment field the total rainfall during the cropping period may to october in the region varied from 707 1 mm to 1860 mm during 1976 and 2005 and the 30 years average annual rainfall was approximately 1300 mm precipitation at the study site is highly inﬂuenced by the monsoon season a rainy season in korea that lasts from july through august the average maximum and minimum temperatures were 27 c and 17 c respectively 2 2 experiment field management and data collection a saenuri japonica rice variety was seeded and grown for 25 30 days in nursery beds and then transplanted after 1 5 2 leaves appear the experimental paddy fields were 35 m wide and 110 m long in size with irrigation and drainage ditches located along both of its sides paddy water level irrigation and drainage amount and water quality were investigated during the growing season in 2013 2014 five management practices including conventional paddy farming were applied to the experiments based on the three cultivation factors of drainage outlet height drainage outlet installation time and amount of fertilizer applied table 1 displays defined dates for management operations including transplantation fertilizer and water management the irrigation canal water was pumped to the paddy ﬁeld using a submerged pump when the water level fell below the specified ponding depth for a particular time span a propeller type ﬂowmeter was installed at the outlet of the pumping hose to measure the amount of irrigation a weir was also installed at the paddy drainage outlet to measure the amount of drainage water the outlet weir was also used to control the ponding depth inside the paddy ﬁeld an ultrasonic water level gauge was used to measure paddy ponding depth we collected irrigation and paddy water samples on a bi weekly basis while continuous water samples of varying time intervals 20 min 24 h were collected when major storm event occurred all water samples were transported in a styrofoam icebox and analyzed using the standard methods specified in apha 1998 for determining the mineral nitrogen content the bmps effective for paddy nutrient discharge reduction considered in this study are as follows 2 2 1 conventional management practice cmp paddy fields in korea are surrounded by earth berm of about 10 30 cm in height and flooded with water by 3 10 cm deep for the most of the growing season kim et al 2006 irrigation water was supplied to maintain flooding conditions except during midsummer drainage between the maximum tillering and panicle initiation stage water levels at the study fields were kept below a maximum of 7 cm in depth except during transplanting when the depth was set at 4 cm 2 2 2 drainage outlet raising dor yoon et al 2003 suggested that raising the height of drainage outlets can be a measure to reduce nutrient discharge from paddy fields by increasing effective rainfall raising paddy ponding depth in the early growing season is impractical for farmers because of concerns about the submergence of immature rice stand may severely damage rice crop leading to substantial yield loss outlet height therefore needs to stay low in the early growing season and can be raised after the midseason drainage when the rice plant is fully established in this study the outlet height began at 7 cm the average for ponding depths during the growing season after mid season drainage the height raised to 12 cm for dor management practices 2 2 3 soil test based fertilization stf paddy farmers in korea commonly apply fertilizers heavily as the government subsidized the cost of chemical fertilizers to stimulate an increase in production in the 1970s ha and chung 2012 however due to recent public attention to environmental conservation the central government has changed its policy to reduce the amount of fertilization and adopted soil analytical tests to prescribe fertilizer application rates based on soil nutrient content of individual paddy fields for stf management the level of standing water reached a maximum of 7 cm depth for the majority of the growing season except during mid season drainage 2 2 4 fertilizer application before weir installation and dor dor fabwi paddy outlet weir is installed before fertilizer application which is the common practice in korea according to the management practice of dor fabwi outlet weir was fitted after application of the fertilizer followed by ponding depth control 2 2 5 combinations of dor and stf the combination of drainage outlet control with soil test based fertilization dor stf management was developed to assess the mixed effects of two bmps on mineral nitrogen yield reduction the application rate of nitrogen and management drainage outlet control is listed above as summarized in table 1 2 3 model selection and setup as the apex model was not designed to simulate ponded conditions of the rice paddy field the apex paddy model was developed the apex paddy model is a revised version of the apex physically based on the field scale model to more accurately simulate discharge and mineral nitrogen from paddy fields in ponded conditions choi et al 2017a in this study the apex paddy model was used to estimate surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields from rice paddy fields soil characteristics are essential factors when modeling discharge from a basin in this study the hydrologic soil group b was selected because paddy fields are terraced in apex a user may either create a new weather station or use one of the default stations defined by the program steglich et al 2016 as apex works on a daily time step jeonju weather station data from 1976 to 2015 was used to prepare a daily weather file dly the six parameters used in the weather file were precipitation maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed apex offers five separate estimation methods for potential evaporation such as hargreaves penman priestley taylor penman monteith and baier robertson penman and penman monteith are the most data intensive methods that include solar radiation as inputs air temperature wind speed and relative humidity however only a few gcms provide certain parameters such as solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity consequently the hargreaves and samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 were used in this study for future estimation of potential evapotranspiration pet hargreaves is a model based on temperature and utilizes temperature and extraterrestrial radiation to measure daily pet it is evident that the hargreaves approach offers the best pet approximation if relative humidity and wind speed are not available williams and izaurralde 2005 when a sub area is conﬁgured to simulate the management of paddy rice apex paddy switches from the soil conservation service curve number scs cn hawkins et al 2009 system to a weir discharge mechanism to regulate the paddy water balance during off seasons or when paddy field management does not implement water ponding apex paddy switches back to default sub area modules to model upland non ponding land processes such as the scs cn runoff estimation method 2 4 water balance model of irrigated paddy field apex paddy offers a collection of new subroutines to model water ponding paddy management and discharge control choi et al 2017a the water balance mechanism by apex paddy illustrated as in fig 2 we have ignored the rise of the capillary from groundwater in this analysis in addition field topography is almost flat so cross flow lateral flow loss of seepage is not considered through the bunds the apex paddy model calculates the water balance using the following equations

level and precipitation minus daily evapotranspiration and infiltration percolation and deep percolation if paddy field water level were lower than it the model was constructed to irrigate by the difference between the td and the current paddy field water level choi et al 2017a as shown in fig 2 however drainage or surface discharge o occurred if the paddy field water level was higher than the outlet weir height h a representative irrigation schedule is required for long term simulation of ponding depth and amount apex paddy model can simulate irrigation amounts for different management practices using an automatic irrigation option for automated irrigation simulation the target and minimum ponding depth must be provided through the apex paddy management file the target and minimum ponding depth were fixed by using a trial and error procedure satisfying an optimal irrigation amount by the apex paddy water balance simulation mechanisms in this study the applicability of an automatic irrigation option was evaluated by simulating irrigation amounts for the different management practices during the cropping period of 2013 and 2014 2 5 model calibration and validation in this study the apex paddy was calibrated before we evaluated the various management practices for the reduction of mineral nitrogen yield in surface discharge the model was calibrated for surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield using two years monitoring data 2013 and 2014 obtained from the conventional paddy management field cmp 1 while 2015 data were used for model validation the applicability of the apex paddy model was tested using the daily surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield data obtained from conventionally managed paddy fields cmp 2 and fig 2 during the 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons two independent conventionally managed paddy fields cmp 1 and cmp 2 with similar soils were also managed with the same irrigation and fertilizer regime feld management data such as tillage fertilization rates and times application method date of transplanting and harvesting etc were used to develop the apex paddy management file generally models require a warm up period defined as the time the model will run before starting to generate the actual outputs to eliminate the initial bias in this study it was found that after 30 years the water and nutrient related variables reached stable conditions the field operation schedules for two years and fifteen rotations were simulated therefore model was run for 30 years 1984 2014 but only the last rotation 2013 2014 was assessed the apex auto calibration and uncertainty estimator apex cute programs 4 1 edition texas a m agrilife research temple tx us https epicapex tamu edu apex was employed for model calibration and sensitivity analysis eighteen parameters related to surface discharge and nitrogen yield were selected for model calibration through a sensitivity analysis using apex cute as shown in table 2 the hydrology sub module was calibrated for the surface discharge amount and then the nitrogen module calibration was followed for mineral nitrogen yield simulation the model was evaluated based on the statistical relation between the outputs of the simulated and observed surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield it is recommended that both graphical techniques and quantitative statistics be used in model evaluation moriasi et al 2015 three different evaluation statistics were used to quantify this study namely the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias one of the most commonly used criteria for model performance is the r2 correlation coefficient eq 5 which is used to determine the goodness of fit moriasi et al 2015 values for r2 bound by 0 and 1 closer to 1 indicate a better fit with a quantity of 1 indicating a perfect match for comparing expected values against observed results the nse is a standardized statistic expressing the relative magnitude of the residual variance noise in comparison with the variance of the calculated data information nash and sutcliffe 1970 the nse ranges between and 1 when nse 1 eq 6 implies a perfect fit between the observed and expected values mudgal et al 2010 values between 0 0 and 1 0 are usually considered to be acceptable performance levels while values below 0 0 suggest that the mean observed value is better than the simulated value implying unacceptable results pbias tests key patterns in output by measuring the number of residuals and the discrepancy between real and expected data points by standardizing the amount of data observed moriasi et al 2015 for pbias the optimal value is 0 with low magnitude values showing precise model simulation positive and negative values reflect under estimation of model and bias in overestimation respectively pbias was determined using eq 7 5 r 2 x x y y x x 2 y y 2 2 6 n s e 1 y x 2 y y 2 7 p b i a s y x y 100 in the equation x and y are the predicted and observed values x and y are the means of variables moriasi et al 2015 suggested assessment criteria focusing on the performance value of the field scale model they suggest that model output can be considered satisfactory if daily weekly or annual r2 0 60 nse 0 55 and pbias 20 for surface discharge and r2 0 60 nse 0 50 and pbias 50 for nitrogen in this study the model simulation outcome was evaluated on the basis of these criteria the calibration process was defined in detail in the preceding study by kamruzzaman et al 2020b 2 6 evaluation of the apex paddy model for different bmps during the 2013 2014 cropping season the different management practices in paddy cultivation were assessed by comparing simulated versus observed surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields in the apex paddy modeling method the annual surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield data were obtained from the outlet of the paddy ﬁeld and compared with the model simulated data the statistical index pbias was used to measure the degree of consistency between the simulated and observed annual surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield the simulated surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield of different bmps were also evaluated in comparison to conventional management practices 2 7 future climate change scenarios a representative concentration pathway rcp is a path introduced by ipcc to concentrate greenhouse gases not emissions in 2014 the ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 used four pathways for climate modeling and analysis the strategies represent various climate scenarios that are all considered feasible depending on the volume of greenhouse gases ghg emitted in the years to come the rcps originally rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 and rcp8 5 was named in the year 2100 2 6 4 5 6 and 8 5 w m2 respectively after a potential range of radioactive force values rcp4 5 is a long term global greenhouse gas emission scenario a short lived cycle and land use land cover stabilizing radiative forcing at 4 5 w m2 around 650 ppm co2 equivalent in the year 2100 without ever exceeding that value while rcp8 5 blends moderately high population projections and relatively slow income growth with moderate levels of technological change and increased energy efficiency leading to high energy demand and ghg emissions in the long term in the absence of climate change policies ipcc 2014 in this situation the greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations rise dramatically over time resulting in an 8 5 w m2 greater than 1370 ppm co2 equivalent radiative forcing at the end of the century ipcc 2014 the cmip5 provides a regular set of simulations of the gcm model based on specific procedures taylor et al 2012 in general climate change scenario data uses the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 data used in the ipcc 5th report and through the esgf portal https esgf node llnl gov search cmip5 since the original cmip5 data provided is global the capacity is large so it is inefficient for general users who need only prospect data for a specific area to collect large amounts of data individually and repeatedly the apec climate center https www apcc21 org offers the historical and two future scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 of 29 global climate models gcms data for the korean peninsula used in this study existing data were used to assess the effects of management practices of paddy fields for surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields reduction in future table 3 provides summary information on the gcms used in this study the gcm outputs vary considerably in the spatial resolution and include systematic biases that need to be corrected before the application for the assessment of climate change impacts in this study daily data were downscaled from 1976 to 2100 and bias corrected against the observation data from the jeonju weather station by using the simple quantile mapping sqm method cho et al 2018 the sqm method independently performs details for each point of observation and weather variable spatially the gcm grid value corresponding to a particular observation point is used directly and temporarily using the empirical quantile mapping method the observation data and the value of the raw gcm are included in the daily gcm data the sqm follows a three step process 1 extraction of gcm grid data corresponding to the target meteorological station 2 estimation of the biases of the retrospective simulations and 3 correction of the biases of future predictions in other words a single grid covering the target station was extracted from each gcm then the biases of retrospective simulation outputs were estimated in comparison to observations for the selected particular grid cell the differences between the simulated and observed cumulative distribution functions cdfs for the retrospective period were quantified and then applied to the future simulations for a given percentile eq 8 8 x p t x p t f o b s 1 f p s i m x p t f r s i m 1 f p s i m x p t where x p t and x p t signify the bias corrected and raw future projections on day t and f θ f x and f 1 θ are a cdf of the daily data θ and its inverse respectively the subscripts p sim r sim and obs designate future projection retrospective simulation and observed daily data respectively the non parametric empirical equation temporally measured the amount of daily observation data and raw gcm data according to gudmundsson et al 2012 nonparametric methods have shown better performance in reducing systematic bias when compared to the parametric approach this is because nonparametric methods use the real distribution of the observed and simulated data without assuming a probability distribution function in this study we used 29 gcms outputs individually as the input for the apex paddy model for surface discharge q and mineral nitrogen yield qn calculations then we averaged the values against different time spans 2010s 2040s and 2070s and scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 to assess the impacts of climate change on surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields from paddy fields under different bmps projected q and qn yields in each bmps were compared with those in the present climate represented by the years 1976 2005 2 8 climate indices for evaluations of gcms in this study the reproducibility of climate change data was analyzed for the historical period 1976 2005 a reproducibility analysis for the historical period provides information on how well the climate change scenario data reproduce the temporal patterns compared to the results from observed climate data the joint expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi has defined a set of 27 core climate indices mainly focusing on extreme events which are derived from the daily climate data a set of eight extreme climate indices was made as an example for assessing the reproducibility of climate change data and validating the performance of bias correction algorithms as shown in table 4 these indices were used to quantitatively evaluate the future extremes rainfall and temperature patterns of 29 cmip5 gcm data 2 9 rate of change change rates were determined by considering four separate time periods the first is the baseline historical 1976 2005 era the remaining three periods are the estimated phases 2010 2039 2010s 2040 2069 2040s and 2070 2099 2070s the mean was calculated for each period and then the rate of change was calculated using eq 9 9 change rate xp xo xo 100 where xp and xo are the mean values over the considered projected period and historical period respectively 3 results 3 1 model calibration validation and applicability test fig 3 a b shows the simulated surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield against the observed values for the calibration periods the results of model performance are displayed in table 5 the hydrology sub module performed well with the statistics of 0 78 0 65 and 5 41 for r2 nse and pbias respectively for the calibration period the model performed reasonably well for the nitrogen yield simulation with statistics of 0 51 0 68 and 20 93 for the respective r2 nse and pbias for the calibration period fig 4 displays the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield simulated against the values observed during the validation period 2015 the hydrology sub module performed excellently with the statistics of 0 67 0 74 and 6 12 for r2 nse and pbias respectively the model performed reasonably well for the mineral nitrogen yield simulation with statistics of 0 89 0 70 and 25 12 for the respective r2 nse and pbias table 5 which also supports the accurate simulation of ﬁeld data according to the decision criteria by moriasi et al 2015 the model hydrological and nitrogen yield simulation appeared to be good enough for the long term application fig 5 a shows the simulated surface drainage against the observed values for cmp 2 during the testing periods the hydrology sub module performed well with the statistics of 0 75 0 80 and 10 45 for r2 nse and pbias respectively the model performed reasonably well for the mineral nitrogen yield simulation with statistics of 0 54 0 61 and 18 85 for the respective r2 nse and pbias fig 5 b overall the model performance showed good agreement between the observed and simulated surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield according to the statistical and graphical model evaluations in addition it is observed that the mineral nitrogen yield is high during surface discharge due to heavy rainfall early in the rice growing stage in conventional management practices 3 2 evaluation of the apex paddy model performance for estimating surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield in different bmps the annual surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield data were obtained from the outlet of the paddy ﬁeld and compared with the model simulated results as shown in table 6 the statistical index pbias of the model showed consistency between simulated and observed annual surface discharge and mineral nitrogen both of the years according to the decision criteria pbias 20 for surface discharge and 50 n for as satisfactory level by moriasi et al 2015 the apex paddy can be used to assess surface drainage and mineral nitrogen transport from a paddy field for different management practices furthermore the statistical measure pbias suggested that the model overestimated surface discharge for cmp 1 and stf management in crop years 2013 and 2014 compared with the results observed whereas the model underestimated for the remaining of managements excluding for dor fabwi management the model overestimated mineral nitrogen yield for stf and dor in 2013 while dor fabwi management in both years however the model underestimated mineral nitrogen yields for the management of cmp and dor stf management in 2013 whereas in 2014 all of the managements except for dor fabwi table 6 also demonstrates the increase or decrease in surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield in different bmps the rate increases or decreases vary according to different bmps in compare with conventional management practices the results showed that most of the bmps significantly reduced surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield the dor fabwi management and dor management demonstrated the most considerable reduction of surface discharge amounting to 19 9 and 39 13 in 2013 and 2014 respectively however only stf management practice showed an increase in surface discharge amounting to 16 in 2013 in the case of mineral nitrogen the combination of outlet raising and soil test based fertilization dor stf and dor demonstrated the most considerable reduction yield of 32 6 and 41 91 in 2013 and 2014 respectively however dor fabwi management appeared to increase a yield of mineral nitrogen by 155 52 in 2013 while the reduction rate 0 68 was negligible in 2014 moreover dor fabwi management showed the highest amount of nitrogen transport in both the observed and simulated measures this result may reflect the influence of the outlet weir installation time the outlet weir was installed after the application of fertilizer if rainfall occurred just after fertilization a considerable amount of fertilizer was likely to be washed away during this time thus bmps with raised outlet weir may reduce surface discharge however the mineral nitrogen yield depends on the application amount of fertilizer as well as crop management including outlet weir installation time 3 3 test of automatic irrigation system fig 6 a b shows the annual irrigation amounts observed and model simulated by using the auto irrigation method for various bmps including conventional management for crop years 2013 and 2014 the statistical measure indicates that the pbias varied with a range of 4 10 14 60 in 2013 and 13 3 38 8 in 2014 in compare with observes results the overall performance of the auto irrigation simulation was more accurate in estimating the amount of irrigation in 2013 compared with 2014 for the different management operations therefore bmps with the management operations of 2013 cropping year can be considered for long time simulations under climate change scenarios 3 4 evaluations for retrospective simulations of gcms in this study the reproducibility of output from 29 cmip5 gcms for the historical period from 1976 to 2005 was evaluated through comparisons with observed data concerning etccdi climate extreme indices as shown in fig 7 to validate the performance of the bias correction algorithms etccdi precipitation and temperature extreme indices were used the statistical characteristics of each gcm model have been compared with an observed median to determine the performance of each model before raw and after bias correction and these results are presented in fig 7 it was found that the bias corrected gcm results reasonably captured the observed patterns of etccdi climate extremes indices while raw gcm outputs included significant differences from the observed indices definitions of the indices are given in table 4 after bias correction most of the errors were removed and only fractions of errors remained which were related to the temporal pattern of a precipitation event as a result it was determined that the non parametric quantile mapping approach is ideal for reproducing temporal patterns of future climate scenarios that can be used in impact assessment of climate change 3 5 future changes in agro climatic parameters the average precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures of the cropping period may to october over the gcms were evaluated in the 2010s 2040s and 2070s compared to the baseline period 1976 2005 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios as shown in fig 8 the projected percentage change in precipitation as well as maximum and minimum temperatures tended to increase in the future over the study area for the beginning of the century the 2010s precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to increase by 7 40 4 05 and 6 54 respectively under rcp4 5 under rcp8 5 there were increases of 9 66 4 11 and 6 81 respectively as compared to the baseline period an increase of 8 65 in precipitation 4 31 in maximum temperature and 7 36 in minimum temperature were also projected by the middle of the century the 2040s under rcp4 5 compared to the baseline period however the most significant increase in rainfall with a maximum and minimum temperature of 12 04 5 21 and 8 15 respectively was projected during the middle of the century the 2040s under rcp8 5 precipitation was also expected to increase by 9 72 and 6 18 by the end of the century the 2070s under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the maximum temperatures were expected to rise by 5 79 and 8 84 while the minimum temperatures were projected to increase by 5 9 and 9 79 under respective climate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 overall the dominant trend that was detected was that widespread precipitation as well as maximum and minimum temperatures would increase during the 21 st century in the jeonju station area this finding agreed with the previous study by li and kim 2019 which reported gradual increases of 70 9 233 8 mm and 1 7 5 7 c in annual precipitation and temperature respectively for two periods 2019 2059 2060 2099 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate change scenarios 3 6 gcm skills in reproducing surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield reproducibility of surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield was evaluated through model outputs calculated from bias corrected gcms projected climate data which was compared with the observed model values calculated from the weather station data from 1976 to 2005 as shown in table 7 the average surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield of different bmps from 29 gcms for the same period were considered as historical outputs over 30 years the statistical method pbias suggested that the model overestimated the surface discharge for all bmps as opposed to the observed results in the case of mineral nitrogen yield the model has been overestimated for the management of dor fabwi and stf whereas underestimated for the management of cmp 1 dor and dor stf compared with the observed performance although most of the simulations for the bmps tend to be greater for the gcms comparing to observation overall pbias statistics were reasonably small enough to fit into the satisfactory level as suggested by moriasi et al 2015 3 7 estimating the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield in different bmps under future climate the impacts of future climate change on surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields for the different bmps were evaluated using the apex paddy model twenty nine bias corrected cmip5 gcm models outputs of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios were applied to the bmps evaluation and future projection results were arranged for the historical 1976 2005 and the three periods the 2010s 2040s and 2070s as shown in fig 9 the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield generally expected to increase over time in the future for most of the bmps under both climate scenarios in particular the surface discharge with the cmp 1 varied the most from 522 to 840 54 and from 486 07 to 1060 83 mm during the 2070s for respective rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios however relatively smaller ranges were found in dor stf management with a range of 399 89 481 86 mm during the historical period under both scenarios the future surface discharge has shown an increasing trend in all bmps under both scenarios it makes sense as there is a strong positive relationship between surface discharge and precipitation amount however the highest amount of precipitation has shown in the 2040s under rcp8 5 which is higher than the 2070s fig 6 the surface discharge is not reflected in the precipitation amount compare to the 2040s and 2070s under rcp8 5 it may be happened due to the precipitation pattern it is indicated that the bmps related to raising outlet weir demonstrated comparatively lower surface discharge to other bmps the results demonstrated that the surface discharge depends on precipitation amount precipitation pattern and outlet height during the cropping period in the case of mineral nitrogen yield the highest amount was found in the combination of outlet raising and fertilizer application before outlet weir install dor fabwi with a range of 13 86 33 53 kg ha during the 2070s under rcp8 5 it may happen due to the fertilizer application time if the fertilizer applied before the outlet weir installation a huge amount of fertilizer washes out the smallest amount was demonstrated in the dor stf management during the 2010s under both scenarios the lowest amount was found with a range of 6 30 12 43 under rcp8 5 on the other hand the soil test based fertilization stf management demonstrated the lowest median values during the historical period under both scenarios and also gradually increased with times followed by dor stf moreover the future mineral nitrogen yield has shown an increasing trend in all bmps under both scenarios the rcp8 5 scenario demonstrated comparatively larger median values than rcp4 5 in all bmps according to usda scs usda scs 1972 mineral nitrogen yields are often correlated with surface runoff rates temperature changes would affect mineralization and nitriﬁcation by changing soil temperature and temperatures there is a robust positive relationship have found between surface discharge and the amount of mineral nitrogen yield moreover the stf related bmps have demonstrated a lower amount of mineral nitrogen yields than other bmps this correlation makes sense that there is a strong positive relationship between mineral nitrogen yield and fertilizer application rate surface discharge rate outlet weir installing time as well as overall crop management practices 3 8 evaluating the bmps for surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield under future climate table 8 displays the model simulated surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield under future climate conditions in different bmps including traditional management practices compared with conventional management practices the increasing and falling rate has also been shown in table 8 overall the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen under most of the bmps continue to increase in the future in particular the dor stf practices demonstrated a greater reduction of surface discharge under both scenarios as compared to the cmp 1 the highest reduction rate was found during the 2010s by 21 87 under rcp4 5 however the relatively smaller reduction was found with the stf practices the lowest rate was found during the 2010s by 5 59 under rcp8 5 the raised outlet weir height related managements dor dor stf and dor fabwi demonstrated a comparatively higher reduction rate of surface discharge than other bmps likewise the decrease or increases rate of mineral nitrogen for each management practice was estimated compare to the cmp 1 the mineral nitrogen yields reduction rate tends to decrease in the future under different bmps except for dor fabwi management the dor fabwi management showed an increased yield with a rate of 26 30 98 under rcp4 5 and 20 37 36 69 under rcp8 5 scenarios when compared to the cmp 1 it might be happening due to the outlet weir installation time in dor fabwi management the outlet weir installed after the application of fertilizer if the rainfall occurred just after fertilization a considerable amount of fertilizer is likely to be washed away during this time the stf management practice has demonstrated a higher reduction rate of mineral nitrogen yield compared to cmp 1 under both scenarios the most significant reduction rate of mineral nitrogen was found in the stf during the 2010s by 30 98 under rcp8 5 it was found that the stf related bmps stf dor stf have demonstrated a higher reduction of mineral nitrogen yields than other bmps the mineral nitrogen yields reduction rate is strongly correlated with the fertilizer application rate the study revealed that the lowest reduction of surface discharge has shown in stf managements however the highest reduction of mineral nitrogen yields was found in the same management table 7 so it can be said the surface discharge is less influential in reducing mineral nitrogen yields our results indicate that the mineral nitrogen yields depend on the fertilizer application rate outlet weir installing time and overall crop management practices 4 discussion one of the important aspects of this study was to measure the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen export in future climate scenarios from rice fields treated with various best management practices bmps related to drainage weir height and fertilizer management different bmps were tested using the calibrated and validated apex paddy model these steps have been shown to be effective in reducing mineral nitrogen yield in future climate conditions the study found that bmps stf dor stf linked to soil test fertilization stf showed lower mineral nitrogen yields in the future environment than other bmps table 7 fig 9 in addition the future mineral nitrogen yield showed an increasing trend in all bmps under both scenarios in contrast reducing rice paddy fertilization may not work well to mitigate the loading of non point source nutrients in the range of normal farming practices instead it could be important to control the loading to reduce surface drainage yoon et al 2003 however this study revealed that mineral nitrogen yield is high during surface discharge caused by heavy rainfall events early in the rice culture period in conventional management practices figs 3 5 mineral nitrogen yield from paddy fields occurs where nitrogen is carried by the outflow water agricultural activities such as forced drainage or lower weir heights and the characteristics of rainfall patterns may cause surface discharge early in the rice culture cycle kim et al 2020 stated that rainfall pattern characteristics e g regular maximum rainfall and rainfall intensity would influence the t n load occurring in different gcms jeon et al 2006 demonstrated that surface drainage control during the initial phase may be the most critical factor in reducing the non point source load from paddy rice fields as its concentration may be high due to the large amount of fertilization they also estimated that tn and tp surface loads were reduced by about 78 and 49 due to the increased weir height the study indicated that the bmps associated with increased outlet weir height dor dor stf and dor fabwi showed a comparatively higher surface discharge reduction rate than others table 7 increasing the drainage weir height in diked rice fields can increase storage of rainwater by reducing overflow from the fields as well as reducing excess rainfall through surface drainage a three year experimental study mishra et al 1998 in india with weir heights of 6 and 30 cm at 4 cm intervals showed that around 57 and 100 of the rainfall could be stored in 6 and 30 cm weir height plots respectively without any significant impact on grain yield bouman and tuong 2001 found that reducing ponded water depths from 5 10 cm to soil saturation level did not reduce land productivity and observed that water savings of 23 led to a reduction in yields of only 6 the study suggests that the future surface discharge has shown an increasing trend in all bmps under both scenarios fig 9 the surface discharge depends on precipitation amount precipitation pattern and outlet height during the cropping period kamruzzaman et al 2020a recommended that there is a strong positive relationship between surface discharge and precipitation amount however the highest amount of precipitation has shown in the 2040s under rcp8 5 which is higher than the 2070s fig 8 the surface discharge is not reflected in the precipitation amount compare to the 2040s and 2070s under rcp8 5 kim et al 2016 reported that effective rainfall varied according to climate change scenarios and periods due to effects of rainfall days rainfall intensities and freshwater conditions of the field hence using effective bmps it may be possible to monitor more effectively the mineral nitrogen yield from paddies under future climate condition the reduction of non point source nutrient loading to the receiving water bodies is an important factor for reducing surface drainage water water quality issues in rural areas are thought to be largely due to excessive fertilization and the subsequent agricultural runoff in many countries like korea raising the drainage weir height in diked rice ﬁelds soil test based fertilization and outlet weir installing before fertilizer application could be suggested as measures to reduce mineral nitrogen yield from paddy fields in future climate scenarios the potential benefits could include reduced irrigation water use and more efficient water resource distribution increased storage of rainwater with subsequent flood mitigation and recharge effects on groundwater and reduced nutrient loss i e reduced nutrient loading and improved water quality such activities however often affect some aspects of the overall water environment and may have other consequences however excessively increased weir height for example can cause submerging damage or cold water damage to the rice crop and low irrigation requires support for participation and irrigation facilities therefore when developing practical bmps for paddies other diverse aspects and local conditions need to be considered in addition to environmental concerns 5 conclusions different best management practices bmps were assessed using the apex paddy agricultural policy environmental extender paddy model to reduce the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield from paddy cultivation for three future time slices e g the 2010s 2040s and 2070s the combination of raising paddy drainage outlets and soil test based fertilization dor stf showed a substantial reduction in surface discharge in both scenarios rcp4 5 and 8 5 the highest reduction rate was observed in the 2010s and was estimated at 21 87 under rcp4 5 compared to conventional management practice cmp 1 stf demonstrated a substantial reduction in mineral nitrogen yield under rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 by 30 98 and 28 32 respectively followed by dor stf during the 2010s however the combination of drainage outlet raising and fertilizer application before outlet weir installation dor fabwi management resulted in an increased load of mineral nitrogen with a rate of up to 30 98 under rcp4 5 and up to 36 69 under rcp8 5 scenarios surface discharge depends on precipitation pattern and drainage outlet height during the cropping period while mineral nitrogen yield mainly depends on fertilizer application rate surface discharge control in fertilization period and crop management the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields have been predicted to rise in the future under climate change the drainage outlet raising dor and soil test based fertilization stf are the most effective bmps in mineral nitrogen yield reduction and their combination can be used for paddy nutrient management for future climate adaptation the apex paddy model is expected to be used as a tool for water management plans on climate change consideration and rice productivity vulnerability assessment this study refers directly to the iksan area in south korea but indirectly to comparable regions due to the advantages in methodological terms as a follow up apex paddy will continue to be used to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing bmps for sustainable water management in paddy ﬁelds at korea s national scale and the findings will be incorporated into agricultural policy development this study demonstrated a suitable approach of reducing mineral nitrogen yields from paddies under future climate alteration in korea however the performance of bmps could also be influenced by future changes in climate patterns as well as extreme climate events such as storm rain therefore further studies are needed to consider more possible climate patterns extreme climatic

10479,this study is to evaluate the bmps in the reduction of surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield from paddy cultivation for three future time slices e g the 2010s 2040s and 2070s using apex paddy agricultural policy environmental extender paddy model the model was calibrated and validated for surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield using 3 year monitoring data 2013 2015 from the conventional paddy management field cmp 1 for surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield estimates the future projections of 29 gcms general circulation model were bias corrected and applied to the calibrated apex paddy model we investigated five specific management strategies related to paddy drainage outlet regulation and new fertilization methods as the bmps minimize the mineral nitrogen yield and surface discharges due to climate change the modeling results indicated that the effects of bmps would vary by future climate scenarios i e rcp4 5 rcp8 5 and periods i e the 2010s 2040s 2070s it was generally expected that the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields would increase in the future the combination of raising drainage outlets and soil test based fertilization dor stf showed a substantial reduction in surface discharge in both scenarios rcp4 5 and 8 5 the highest reduction rate was observed in the 2010s and was estimated at 21 9 under rcp4 5 soil test based fertilization stf showed a substantial reduction in mineral nitrogen yield by 31 0 and 28 3 during the 2010s under rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 respectively followed by dor stf as compared to conventional management practice cmp 1 however the combination of drainage outlet raising and fertilizer application before outlet weir installation dor fabwi management resulted in increased mineral nitrogen yield of up to 31 0 under rcp4 5 and 36 7 under rcp8 5 the study findings indicate that climate change will increase exports of mineral nitrogen from paddy fields nevertheless appropriate bmps may play a vital role in reducing the mineral nitrogen yields for the production of paddy rice in future climates and these effects may vary according to future climate conditions keywords apex model bmps climate change mineral nitrogen yield 1 introduction the rate of agricultural production has to be increased considerably to feed the increasing global population hasler et al 2017 hazell and wood 2008 since inefficient and unsustainable use of inorganic fertilizer causes significant environmental degradation advanced agricultural technologies such as efficient fertilization methods are needed to meet the growing demand of crops tilman et al 2002 reported a 6 9 and 3 5 fold increase in nitrogen n and phosphorus p fertilization to double the yield of agricultural food worldwide up to the 1990s respectively as is evident from the data the application rate of nitrogen is likely to be too high than other fertilizers in recent years a major focus of crop breeding has been to boost yields by improving the growth response to nitrogen nonetheless it seems inefficient to use nitrogen the essential nutrient in growing and developing crops as a result large amounts of nitrogen are lost by surface runoff leaching volatilization and other natural processes brady and weil 2008 n typically enter aquatic environments through surface discharges from non point sources nps such as agricultural drainage are a significant component of diffuse water pollution gastal and lemaire 2002 as nitrogen losses are high under flooded conditions the problem is most noticeable in irrigated paddy fields nowadays the paddy field has become a vital source of nonpoint pollution nps with several factors such as excessive flood irrigation overuse of n etc consequently reducing nps pollution from paddy fields by water and n management approaches is of great importance in the water quality context different management practices called best management practices bmps are widely used to minimize the discharge of nutrients from paddy fields bmps are approaches which have been established as being the most efficient and realistic means of preventing or reducing non point source contamination to help achieve water quality objectives effective bmps for paddy water management include shallow ponding depth raising drainage outlet and no midseason forced drainage yoon et al 2003 song et al 2012 mishra et al 1998 confirmed that raising drainage outlets can save 57 100 of rainfall and thus reduce surface drainage from paddy fields reducing the rate of ponding depth to soil saturation can save 23 of irrigation water with minimal yield loss bouman and tuong 2001 paddy nutrient loss can also be reduced through proper fertilization practices yoon et al 2003 reported that fertilization impact on nutrient loss might be alleviated when paddy water is appropriately managed during the fertilizer application period however climate change is a future threat that is expected to change regional hydrological patterns thus altering the transformation and transport characteristics of nutrients discharge bouraoui et al 2002 the scientific agreement is that future increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations will result in elevated global mean temperatures with subsequent effects on regional precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture and different flow regimes in downstream water wilby et al 1994 arnell 2004 ide et al 2019 demonstrated that increased frequency of heavy rainfall due to climate change may affect agricultural land transporting nutrients into downstream water bodies therefore it is important to assess the impacts of climate change on water quantity and quality it can be assessed with data from general circulation models gcms and effective management practices in modeling strategies to minimize the nitrogen loss from paddy fields such work will allow us to prevent water shortages by providing policy analysis information and useful guidance to policymakers who can devise a framework for water resource management as well as agricultural adaptation in the future the best source for developing future climate change scenarios is the gcms however most of the gcms usually run on coarse horizontal about 100 300 km scales consequently the gcm outputs are characteristically unable to assess the impact of climate change on any national or local scale climate variables projections must be downscaled from the gcm level to obtain information on local climate change at the desired scale using either dynamic or statistical methods xu et al 2005 fowler and kilsby 2007 dynamic downscaling of climate data is more reflective of fine physical processes than statistical downscaling data but in comparison with statistical downscaling high priced computing resources are needed hong and kanamitsu 2014 kang et al 2014 lee and hong 2014 conversely climate change research is still unpredictable because of the existence of a variety of climate models and scenarios science uncertainties typically originate from a mixture of climate models downscaling methods and hydrological models brigode et al 2013 taking into account the uncertainties associated with all of the above mentioned sources would have a major effect on the simulation results and thus on the modeling performance lespinas et al 2014 one way of tackling this ambiguity is to include multiple climate models and efficiently measured climate scenarios using a statistical approach that is well accepted in the scientific community and commonly used in downscaling climate projections robock et al 1993 consequently the performance of a greater number of gcms are more representative of the structural uncertainty in climate models claudia and reto 2007 the world climate research program s wcrp coupled model intercomparison projects cmips have made general circulation model gcm outputs available phase wise this is intended to encourage improvements in the climate model in phases however these products have played a significant role in calculating climate variability sperber et al 2013 demonstrated that the cmip5 models are better able to capture certain aspects of the asian monsoon climate temperature would increase and the distribution of rainfall would be different under climate change according to the findings of the aforementioned studies with the above facts forecasting future changes in the hydrologic cycle using climate data from new sets of cimp5 gcm projections at a regional scale is of paramount importance besides the gcm projections include biases that are originated by the uncertainty inherent in the parameterization of unsolved processes the biases may be substantial enough to affect regional climate and thus bias correction is essential for the local climate impact and vulnerability assessment kunkel et al 2006 to resolve the problems associated with the use of gcms and create a better and more accurate representation of regional climate statistical downscaling and the quantile mapping method are widely used xu et al 2005 fowler and kilsby 2007 wilcke et al 2013 although many studies have examined the effects of water and fertilizer management practices on the reduction of nutrient losses from paddy fields a long term modeling approach is still needed especially where future climate change is concerned over the years several mathematical models were developed to simulate water balance and nutrient fate in flooded rice cultivation in particular such as chemicals runoﬀ and erosion from agricultural management systems in paddy ﬁelds creams paddy chin et al 2002 groundwater loading eﬀ ects of agricultural management systems in paddy ﬁelds gleams paddy chung et al 2003 and paddimod jeon et al 2004 were developed for ﬁeld scale simulation jeon et al 2007 incorporated the paddy simulation module into a watershed scale model to develop the hydrological simulation program fortran model hspf paddy in paddy ﬁelds however these models are less compatible with simulating various farming conditions and best management practices jeon et al 2005 the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model has been widely used to estimate the effects of management changes on a landscape havlik et al 2011 and to predict sediment and nutrient loss kiniry et al 1995 ramirez avila et al 2017 in upland condition however the apex model was developed without the capacity to simulate hydrology sediment and nutrient cycles in flooded paddy fields the rural development administration rda along with texas a m university revised the original apex model to enable incorporation of paddy management practices into water and nutrient discharge simulation kamruzzaman et al 2020b showed that the calibrated model was able to simulate surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield from the paddy field however the sediment and phosphorus yield is not reasonably predicted due to the limitation of the sediment water erosion sub routine of the apex paddy model kamruzzaman et al 2020a recently applied the apex paddy model to assess the components of the paddy water balance considering future climate scenarios choi et al 2017a evaluated the apex paddy model and reported higher accuracy in ﬂow and mineral nitrogen yield prediction from paddy fields choi et al 2017b also applied the apex paddy model to estimate crop yield and evapotranspiration in paddy rice cultivation under future climate scenarios however the apex paddy model has not been used to evaluate the effects of bmps on mineral nitrogen yields from paddy fields under future climate projections this is the primary motivation for our study the objective of this study was to evaluate the bmps in the reduction of surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield from paddy rice cultivation for future climate scenarios the analysis was performed based on bias corrected cmip5 simulations of the representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios 4 5 and 8 5 from 2010 2100 twenty nine different global climate models gcms outputs were applied to assess the effects of bmps on surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields from paddy fields under future climate prediction in three future time slices e g the 2010s 2040s and 2070s using the apex paddy model 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the field experiments were conducted at the paddy farms 35 9016 n 127 0331 e located near ikasn a city in the jeonbuk province of south korea as shown in fig 1 the predominant soils at the iksan experimental site are jeonbug series which is a poorly drained silty clay loam built on the ﬂuvio marine plain the physical properties of the soil s upper layer 20 cm include 11 1 sand 71 1 silt and 17 8 clay the daily meteorological records of this study were retrieved from the jeonju meteorological station near the experiment field the total rainfall during the cropping period may to october in the region varied from 707 1 mm to 1860 mm during 1976 and 2005 and the 30 years average annual rainfall was approximately 1300 mm precipitation at the study site is highly inﬂuenced by the monsoon season a rainy season in korea that lasts from july through august the average maximum and minimum temperatures were 27 c and 17 c respectively 2 2 experiment field management and data collection a saenuri japonica rice variety was seeded and grown for 25 30 days in nursery beds and then transplanted after 1 5 2 leaves appear the experimental paddy fields were 35 m wide and 110 m long in size with irrigation and drainage ditches located along both of its sides paddy water level irrigation and drainage amount and water quality were investigated during the growing season in 2013 2014 five management practices including conventional paddy farming were applied to the experiments based on the three cultivation factors of drainage outlet height drainage outlet installation time and amount of fertilizer applied table 1 displays defined dates for management operations including transplantation fertilizer and water management the irrigation canal water was pumped to the paddy ﬁeld using a submerged pump when the water level fell below the specified ponding depth for a particular time span a propeller type ﬂowmeter was installed at the outlet of the pumping hose to measure the amount of irrigation a weir was also installed at the paddy drainage outlet to measure the amount of drainage water the outlet weir was also used to control the ponding depth inside the paddy ﬁeld an ultrasonic water level gauge was used to measure paddy ponding depth we collected irrigation and paddy water samples on a bi weekly basis while continuous water samples of varying time intervals 20 min 24 h were collected when major storm event occurred all water samples were transported in a styrofoam icebox and analyzed using the standard methods specified in apha 1998 for determining the mineral nitrogen content the bmps effective for paddy nutrient discharge reduction considered in this study are as follows 2 2 1 conventional management practice cmp paddy fields in korea are surrounded by earth berm of about 10 30 cm in height and flooded with water by 3 10 cm deep for the most of the growing season kim et al 2006 irrigation water was supplied to maintain flooding conditions except during midsummer drainage between the maximum tillering and panicle initiation stage water levels at the study fields were kept below a maximum of 7 cm in depth except during transplanting when the depth was set at 4 cm 2 2 2 drainage outlet raising dor yoon et al 2003 suggested that raising the height of drainage outlets can be a measure to reduce nutrient discharge from paddy fields by increasing effective rainfall raising paddy ponding depth in the early growing season is impractical for farmers because of concerns about the submergence of immature rice stand may severely damage rice crop leading to substantial yield loss outlet height therefore needs to stay low in the early growing season and can be raised after the midseason drainage when the rice plant is fully established in this study the outlet height began at 7 cm the average for ponding depths during the growing season after mid season drainage the height raised to 12 cm for dor management practices 2 2 3 soil test based fertilization stf paddy farmers in korea commonly apply fertilizers heavily as the government subsidized the cost of chemical fertilizers to stimulate an increase in production in the 1970s ha and chung 2012 however due to recent public attention to environmental conservation the central government has changed its policy to reduce the amount of fertilization and adopted soil analytical tests to prescribe fertilizer application rates based on soil nutrient content of individual paddy fields for stf management the level of standing water reached a maximum of 7 cm depth for the majority of the growing season except during mid season drainage 2 2 4 fertilizer application before weir installation and dor dor fabwi paddy outlet weir is installed before fertilizer application which is the common practice in korea according to the management practice of dor fabwi outlet weir was fitted after application of the fertilizer followed by ponding depth control 2 2 5 combinations of dor and stf the combination of drainage outlet control with soil test based fertilization dor stf management was developed to assess the mixed effects of two bmps on mineral nitrogen yield reduction the application rate of nitrogen and management drainage outlet control is listed above as summarized in table 1 2 3 model selection and setup as the apex model was not designed to simulate ponded conditions of the rice paddy field the apex paddy model was developed the apex paddy model is a revised version of the apex physically based on the field scale model to more accurately simulate discharge and mineral nitrogen from paddy fields in ponded conditions choi et al 2017a in this study the apex paddy model was used to estimate surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields from rice paddy fields soil characteristics are essential factors when modeling discharge from a basin in this study the hydrologic soil group b was selected because paddy fields are terraced in apex a user may either create a new weather station or use one of the default stations defined by the program steglich et al 2016 as apex works on a daily time step jeonju weather station data from 1976 to 2015 was used to prepare a daily weather file dly the six parameters used in the weather file were precipitation maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed apex offers five separate estimation methods for potential evaporation such as hargreaves penman priestley taylor penman monteith and baier robertson penman and penman monteith are the most data intensive methods that include solar radiation as inputs air temperature wind speed and relative humidity however only a few gcms provide certain parameters such as solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity consequently the hargreaves and samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 were used in this study for future estimation of potential evapotranspiration pet hargreaves is a model based on temperature and utilizes temperature and extraterrestrial radiation to measure daily pet it is evident that the hargreaves approach offers the best pet approximation if relative humidity and wind speed are not available williams and izaurralde 2005 when a sub area is conﬁgured to simulate the management of paddy rice apex paddy switches from the soil conservation service curve number scs cn hawkins et al 2009 system to a weir discharge mechanism to regulate the paddy water balance during off seasons or when paddy field management does not implement water ponding apex paddy switches back to default sub area modules to model upland non ponding land processes such as the scs cn runoff estimation method 2 4 water balance model of irrigated paddy field apex paddy offers a collection of new subroutines to model water ponding paddy management and discharge control choi et al 2017a the water balance mechanism by apex paddy illustrated as in fig 2 we have ignored the rise of the capillary from groundwater in this analysis in addition field topography is almost flat so cross flow lateral flow loss of seepage is not considered through the bunds the apex paddy model calculates the water balance using the following equations 1 p d t p d t 1 r t 2 i r t t d p d t p d t t d e t t p t i f p d t i t p d t p d t o t e t t p t i f p d t h 3 o t h 1 24 1 838 b p d t h h 1000 3 2 p d t h p d t i h o t i 4 p d t p d t e t t p t i

the irrigation mm t d is the irrigation target depth mm e t is the evapotranspiration mm p is percolation mm i t irrigation trigger depth mm o is the overflow or surface discharge mm h is the outlet weir height and b is outlet weir width m the allowable time for this analysis was 24 h the paddy field ponding depth at the end of the day 24 h was the amount of the previous day s paddy field water level and precipitation minus daily evapotranspiration and infiltration percolation and deep percolation if paddy field water level were lower than it the model was constructed to irrigate by the difference between the td and the current paddy field water level choi et al 2017a as shown in fig 2 however drainage or surface discharge o occurred if the paddy field water level was higher than the outlet weir height h a representative irrigation schedule is required for long term simulation of ponding depth and amount apex paddy model can simulate irrigation amounts for different management practices using an automatic irrigation option for automated irrigation simulation the target and minimum ponding depth must be provided through the apex paddy management file the target and minimum ponding depth were fixed by using a trial and error procedure satisfying an optimal irrigation amount by the apex paddy water balance simulation mechanisms in this study the applicability of an automatic irrigation option was evaluated by simulating irrigation amounts for the different management practices during the cropping period of 2013 and 2014 2 5 model calibration and validation in this study the apex paddy was calibrated before we evaluated the various management practices for the reduction of mineral nitrogen yield in surface discharge the model was calibrated for surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield using two years monitoring data 2013 and 2014 obtained from the conventional paddy management field cmp 1 while 2015 data were used for model validation the applicability of the apex paddy model was tested using the daily surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield data obtained from conventionally managed paddy fields cmp 2 and fig 2 during the 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons two independent conventionally managed paddy fields cmp 1 and cmp 2 with similar soils were also managed with the same irrigation and fertilizer regime feld management data such as tillage fertilization rates and times application method date of transplanting and harvesting etc were used to develop the apex paddy management file generally models require a warm up period defined as the time the model will run before starting to generate the actual outputs to eliminate the initial bias in this study it was found that after 30 years the water and nutrient related variables reached stable conditions the field operation schedules for two years and fifteen rotations were simulated therefore model was run for 30 years 1984 2014 but only the last rotation 2013 2014 was assessed the apex auto calibration and uncertainty estimator apex cute programs 4 1 edition texas a m agrilife research temple tx us https epicapex tamu edu apex was employed for model calibration and sensitivity analysis eighteen parameters related to surface discharge and nitrogen yield were selected for model calibration through a sensitivity analysis using apex cute as shown in table 2 the hydrology sub module was calibrated for the surface discharge amount and then the nitrogen module calibration was followed for mineral nitrogen yield simulation the model was evaluated based on the statistical relation between the outputs of the simulated and observed surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield it is recommended that both graphical techniques and quantitative statistics be used in model evaluation moriasi et al 2015 three different evaluation statistics were used to quantify this study namely the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias one of the most commonly used criteria for model performance is the r2 correlation coefficient eq 5 which is used to determine the goodness of fit moriasi et al 2015 values for r2 bound by 0 and 1 closer to 1 indicate a better fit with a quantity of 1 indicating a perfect match for comparing expected values against observed results the nse is a standardized statistic expressing the relative magnitude of the residual variance noise in comparison with the variance of the calculated data information nash and sutcliffe 1970 the nse ranges between and 1 when nse 1 eq 6 implies a perfect fit between the observed and expected values mudgal et al 2010 values between 0 0 and 1 0 are usually considered to be acceptable performance levels while values below 0 0 suggest that the mean observed value is better than the simulated value implying unacceptable results pbias tests key patterns in output by measuring the number of residuals and the discrepancy between real and expected data points by standardizing the amount of data observed moriasi et al 2015 for pbias the optimal value is 0 with low magnitude values showing precise model simulation positive and negative values reflect under estimation of model and bias in overestimation respectively pbias was determined using eq 7 5 r 2 x x y y x x 2 y y 2 2 6 n s e 1 y x 2 y y 2 7 p b i a s y x y 100 in the equation x and y are the predicted and observed values x and y are the means of variables moriasi et al 2015 suggested assessment criteria focusing on the performance value of the field scale model they suggest that model output can be considered satisfactory if daily weekly or annual r2 0 60 nse 0 55 and pbias 20 for surface discharge and r2 0 60 nse 0 50 and pbias 50 for nitrogen in this study the model simulation outcome was evaluated on the basis of these criteria the calibration process was defined in detail in the preceding study by kamruzzaman et al 2020b 2 6 evaluation of the apex paddy model for different bmps during the 2013 2014 cropping season the different management practices in paddy cultivation were assessed by comparing simulated versus observed surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields in the apex paddy modeling method the annual surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield data were obtained from the outlet of the paddy ﬁeld and compared with the model simulated data the statistical index pbias was used to measure the degree of consistency between the simulated and observed annual surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield the simulated surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield of different bmps were also evaluated in comparison to conventional management practices 2 7 future climate change scenarios a representative concentration pathway rcp is a path introduced by ipcc to concentrate greenhouse gases not emissions in 2014 the ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 used four pathways for climate modeling and analysis the strategies represent various climate scenarios that are all considered feasible depending on the volume of greenhouse gases ghg emitted in the years to come the rcps originally rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 and rcp8 5 was named in the year 2100 2 6 4 5 6 and 8 5 w m2 respectively after a potential range of radioactive force values rcp4 5 is a long term global greenhouse gas emission scenario a short lived cycle and land use land cover stabilizing radiative forcing at 4 5 w m2 around 650 ppm co2 equivalent in the year 2100 without ever exceeding that value while rcp8 5 blends moderately high population projections and relatively slow income growth with moderate levels of technological change and increased energy efficiency leading to high energy demand and ghg emissions in the long term in the absence of climate change policies ipcc 2014 in this situation the greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations rise dramatically over time resulting in an 8 5 w m2 greater than 1370 ppm co2 equivalent radiative forcing at the end of the century ipcc 2014 the cmip5 provides a regular set of simulations of the gcm model based on specific procedures taylor et al 2012 in general climate change scenario data uses the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 data used in the ipcc 5th report and through the esgf portal https esgf node llnl gov search cmip5 since the original cmip5 data provided is global the capacity is large so it is inefficient for general users who need only prospect data for a specific area to collect large amounts of data individually and repeatedly the apec climate center https www apcc21 org offers the historical and two future scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 of 29 global climate models gcms data for the korean peninsula used in this study existing data were used to assess the effects of management practices of paddy fields for surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields reduction in future table 3 provides summary information on the gcms used in this study the gcm outputs vary considerably in the spatial resolution and include systematic biases that need to be corrected before the application for the assessment of climate change impacts in this study daily data were downscaled from 1976 to 2100 and bias corrected against the observation data from the jeonju weather station by using the simple quantile mapping sqm method cho et al 2018 the sqm method independently performs details for each point of observation and weather variable spatially the gcm grid value corresponding to a particular observation point is used directly and temporarily using the empirical quantile mapping method the observation data and the value of the raw gcm are included in the daily gcm data the sqm follows a three step process 1 extraction of gcm grid data corresponding to the target meteorological station 2 estimation of the biases of the retrospective simulations and 3 correction of the biases of future predictions in other words a single grid covering the target station was extracted from each gcm then the biases of retrospective simulation outputs were estimated in comparison to observations for the selected particular grid cell the differences between the simulated and observed cumulative distribution functions cdfs for the retrospective period were quantified and then applied to the future simulations for a given percentile eq 8 8 x p t x p t f o b s 1 f p s i m x p t f r s i m 1 f p s i m x p t where x p t and x p t signify the bias corrected and raw future projections on day t and f θ f x and f 1 θ are a cdf of the daily data θ and its inverse respectively the subscripts p sim r sim and obs designate future projection retrospective simulation and observed daily data respectively the non parametric empirical equation temporally measured the amount of daily observation data and raw gcm data according to gudmundsson et al 2012 nonparametric methods have shown better performance in reducing systematic bias when compared to the parametric approach this is because nonparametric methods use the real distribution of the observed and simulated data without assuming a probability distribution function in this study we used 29 gcms outputs individually as the input for the apex paddy model for surface discharge q and mineral nitrogen yield qn calculations then we averaged the values against different time spans 2010s 2040s and 2070s and scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 to assess the impacts of climate change on surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields from paddy fields under different bmps projected q and qn yields in each bmps were compared with those in the present climate represented by the years 1976 2005 2 8 climate indices for evaluations of gcms in this study the reproducibility of climate change data was analyzed for the historical period 1976 2005 a reproducibility analysis for the historical period provides information on how well the climate change scenario data reproduce the temporal patterns compared to the results from observed climate data the joint expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi has defined a set of 27 core climate indices mainly focusing on extreme events which are derived from the daily climate data a set of eight extreme climate indices was made as an example for assessing the reproducibility of climate change data and validating the performance of bias correction algorithms as shown in table 4 these indices were used to quantitatively evaluate the future extremes rainfall and temperature patterns of 29 cmip5 gcm data 2 9 rate of change change rates were determined by considering four separate time periods the first is the baseline historical 1976 2005 era the remaining three periods are the estimated phases 2010 2039 2010s 2040 2069 2040s and 2070 2099 2070s the mean was calculated for each period and then the rate of change was calculated using eq 9 9 change rate xp xo xo 100 where xp and xo are the mean values over the considered projected period and historical period respectively 3 results 3 1 model calibration validation and applicability test fig 3 a b shows the simulated surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield against the observed values for the calibration periods the results of model performance are displayed in table 5 the hydrology sub module performed well with the statistics of 0 78 0 65 and 5 41 for r2 nse and pbias respectively for the calibration period the model performed reasonably well for the nitrogen yield simulation with statistics of 0 51 0 68 and 20 93 for the respective r2 nse and pbias for the calibration period fig 4 displays the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield simulated against the values observed during the validation period 2015 the hydrology sub module performed excellently with the statistics of 0 67 0 74 and 6 12 for r2 nse and pbias respectively the model performed reasonably well for the mineral nitrogen yield simulation with statistics of 0 89 0 70 and 25 12 for the respective r2 nse and pbias table 5 which also supports the accurate simulation of ﬁeld data according to the decision criteria by moriasi et al 2015 the model hydrological and nitrogen yield simulation appeared to be good enough for the long term application fig 5 a shows the simulated surface drainage against the observed values for cmp 2 during the testing periods the hydrology sub module performed well with the statistics of 0 75 0 80 and 10 45 for r2 nse and pbias respectively the model performed reasonably well for the mineral nitrogen yield simulation with statistics of 0 54 0 61 and 18 85 for the respective r2 nse and pbias fig 5 b overall the model performance showed good agreement between the observed and simulated surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield according to the statistical and graphical model evaluations in addition it is observed that the mineral nitrogen yield is high during surface discharge due to heavy rainfall early in the rice growing stage in conventional management practices 3 2 evaluation of the apex paddy model performance for estimating surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield in different bmps the annual surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield data were obtained from the outlet of the paddy ﬁeld and compared with the model simulated results as shown in table 6 the statistical index pbias of the model showed consistency between simulated and observed annual surface discharge and mineral nitrogen both of the years according to the decision criteria pbias 20 for surface discharge and 50 n for as satisfactory level by moriasi et al 2015 the apex paddy can be used to assess surface drainage and mineral nitrogen transport from a paddy field for different management practices furthermore the statistical measure pbias suggested that the model overestimated surface discharge for cmp 1 and stf management in crop years 2013 and 2014 compared with the results observed whereas the model underestimated for the remaining of managements excluding for dor fabwi management the model overestimated mineral nitrogen yield for stf and dor in 2013 while dor fabwi management in both years however the model underestimated mineral nitrogen yields for the management of cmp and dor stf management in 2013 whereas in 2014 all of the managements except for dor fabwi table 6 also demonstrates the increase or decrease in surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield in different bmps the rate increases or decreases vary according to different bmps in compare with conventional management practices the results showed that most of the bmps significantly reduced surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield the dor fabwi management and dor management demonstrated the most considerable reduction of surface discharge amounting to 19 9 and 39 13 in 2013 and 2014 respectively however only stf management practice showed an increase in surface discharge amounting to 16 in 2013 in the case of mineral nitrogen the combination of outlet raising and soil test based fertilization dor stf and dor demonstrated the most considerable reduction yield of 32 6 and 41 91 in 2013 and 2014 respectively however dor fabwi management appeared to increase a yield of mineral nitrogen by 155 52 in 2013 while the reduction rate 0 68 was negligible in 2014 moreover dor fabwi management showed the highest amount of nitrogen transport in both the observed and simulated measures this result may reflect the influence of the outlet weir installation time the outlet weir was installed after the application of fertilizer if rainfall occurred just after fertilization a considerable amount of fertilizer was likely to be washed away during this time thus bmps with raised outlet weir may reduce surface discharge however the mineral nitrogen yield depends on the application amount of fertilizer as well as crop management including outlet weir installation time 3 3 test of automatic irrigation system fig 6 a b shows the annual irrigation amounts observed and model simulated by using the auto irrigation method for various bmps including conventional management for crop years 2013 and 2014 the statistical measure indicates that the pbias varied with a range of 4 10 14 60 in 2013 and 13 3 38 8 in 2014 in compare with observes results the overall performance of the auto irrigation simulation was more accurate in estimating the amount of irrigation in 2013 compared with 2014 for the different management operations therefore bmps with the management operations of 2013 cropping year can be considered for long time simulations under climate change scenarios 3 4 evaluations for retrospective simulations of gcms in this study the reproducibility of output from 29 cmip5 gcms for the historical period from 1976 to 2005 was evaluated through comparisons with observed data concerning etccdi climate extreme indices as shown in fig 7 to validate the performance of the bias correction algorithms etccdi precipitation and temperature extreme indices were used the statistical characteristics of each gcm model have been compared with an observed median to determine the performance of each model before raw and after bias correction and these results are presented in fig 7 it was found that the bias corrected gcm results reasonably captured the observed patterns of etccdi climate extremes indices while raw gcm outputs included significant differences from the observed indices definitions of the indices are given in table 4 after bias correction most of the errors were removed and only fractions of errors remained which were related to the temporal pattern of a precipitation event as a result it was determined that the non parametric quantile mapping approach is ideal for reproducing temporal patterns of future climate scenarios that can be used in impact assessment of climate change 3 5 future changes in agro climatic parameters the average precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures of the cropping period may to october over the gcms were evaluated in the 2010s 2040s and 2070s compared to the baseline period 1976 2005 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios as shown in fig 8 the projected percentage change in precipitation as well as maximum and minimum temperatures tended to increase in the future over the study area for the beginning of the century the 2010s precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to increase by 7 40 4 05 and 6 54 respectively under rcp4 5 under rcp8 5 there were increases of 9 66 4 11 and 6 81 respectively as compared to the baseline period an increase of 8 65 in precipitation 4 31 in maximum temperature and 7 36 in minimum temperature were also projected by the middle of the century the 2040s under rcp4 5 compared to the baseline period however the most significant increase in rainfall with a maximum and minimum temperature of 12 04 5 21 and 8 15 respectively was projected during the middle of the century the 2040s under rcp8 5 precipitation was also expected to increase by 9 72 and 6 18 by the end of the century the 2070s under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the maximum temperatures were expected to rise by 5 79 and 8 84 while the minimum temperatures were projected to increase by 5 9 and 9 79 under respective climate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 overall the dominant trend that was detected was that widespread precipitation as well as maximum and minimum temperatures would increase during the 21 st century in the jeonju station area this finding agreed with the previous study by li and kim 2019 which reported gradual increases of 70 9 233 8 mm and 1 7 5 7 c in annual precipitation and temperature respectively for two periods 2019 2059 2060 2099 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate change scenarios 3 6 gcm skills in reproducing surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield reproducibility of surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield was evaluated through model outputs calculated from bias corrected gcms projected climate data which was compared with the observed model values calculated from the weather station data from 1976 to 2005 as shown in table 7 the average surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield of different bmps from 29 gcms for the same period were considered as historical outputs over 30 years the statistical method pbias suggested that the model overestimated the surface discharge for all bmps as opposed to the observed results in the case of mineral nitrogen yield the model has been overestimated for the management of dor fabwi and stf whereas underestimated for the management of cmp 1 dor and dor stf compared with the observed performance although most of the simulations for the bmps tend to be greater for the gcms comparing to observation overall pbias statistics were reasonably small enough to fit into the satisfactory level as suggested by moriasi et al 2015 3 7 estimating the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield in different bmps under future climate the impacts of future climate change on surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields for the different bmps were evaluated using the apex paddy model twenty nine bias corrected cmip5 gcm models outputs of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios were applied to the bmps evaluation and future projection results were arranged for the historical 1976 2005 and the three periods the 2010s 2040s and 2070s as shown in fig 9 the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield generally expected to increase over time in the future for most of the bmps under both climate scenarios in particular the surface discharge with the cmp 1 varied the most from 522 to 840 54 and from 486 07 to 1060 83 mm during the 2070s for respective rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios however relatively smaller ranges were found in dor stf management with a range of 399 89 481 86 mm during the historical period under both scenarios the future surface discharge has shown an increasing trend in all bmps under both scenarios it makes sense as there is a strong positive relationship between surface discharge and precipitation amount however the highest amount of precipitation has shown in the 2040s under rcp8 5 which is higher than the 2070s fig 6 the surface discharge is not reflected in the precipitation amount compare to the 2040s and 2070s under rcp8 5 it may be happened due to the precipitation pattern it is indicated that the bmps related to raising outlet weir demonstrated comparatively lower surface discharge to other bmps the results demonstrated that the surface discharge depends on precipitation amount precipitation pattern and outlet height during the cropping period in the case of mineral nitrogen yield the highest amount was found in the combination of outlet raising and fertilizer application before outlet weir install dor fabwi with a range of 13 86 33 53 kg ha during the 2070s under rcp8 5 it may happen due to the fertilizer application time if the fertilizer applied before the outlet weir installation a huge amount of fertilizer washes out the smallest amount was demonstrated in the dor stf management during the 2010s under both scenarios the lowest amount was found with a range of 6 30 12 43 under rcp8 5 on the other hand the soil test based fertilization stf management demonstrated the lowest median values during the historical period under both scenarios and also gradually increased with times followed by dor stf moreover the future mineral nitrogen yield has shown an increasing trend in all bmps under both scenarios the rcp8 5 scenario demonstrated comparatively larger median values than rcp4 5 in all bmps according to usda scs usda scs 1972 mineral nitrogen yields are often correlated with surface runoff rates temperature changes would affect mineralization and nitriﬁcation by changing soil temperature and temperatures there is a robust positive relationship have found between surface discharge and the amount of mineral nitrogen yield moreover the stf related bmps have demonstrated a lower amount of mineral nitrogen yields than other bmps this correlation makes sense that there is a strong positive relationship between mineral nitrogen yield and fertilizer application rate surface discharge rate outlet weir installing time as well as overall crop management practices 3 8 evaluating the bmps for surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield under future climate table 8 displays the model simulated surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield under future climate conditions in different bmps including traditional management practices compared with conventional management practices the increasing and falling rate has also been shown in table 8 overall the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen under most of the bmps continue to increase in the future in particular the dor stf practices demonstrated a greater reduction of surface discharge under both scenarios as compared to the cmp 1 the highest reduction rate was found during the 2010s by 21 87 under rcp4 5 however the relatively smaller reduction was found with the stf practices the lowest rate was found during the 2010s by 5 59 under rcp8 5 the raised outlet weir height related managements dor dor stf and dor fabwi demonstrated a comparatively higher reduction rate of surface discharge than other bmps likewise the decrease or increases rate of mineral nitrogen for each management practice was estimated compare to the cmp 1 the mineral nitrogen yields reduction rate tends to decrease in the future under different bmps except for dor fabwi management the dor fabwi management showed an increased yield with a rate of 26 30 98 under rcp4 5 and 20 37 36 69 under rcp8 5 scenarios when compared to the cmp 1 it might be happening due to the outlet weir installation time in dor fabwi management the outlet weir installed after the application of fertilizer if the rainfall occurred just after fertilization a considerable amount of fertilizer is likely to be washed away during this time the stf management practice has demonstrated a higher reduction rate of mineral nitrogen yield compared to cmp 1 under both scenarios the most significant reduction rate of mineral nitrogen was found in the stf during the 2010s by 30 98 under rcp8 5 it was found that the stf related bmps stf dor stf have demonstrated a higher reduction of mineral nitrogen yields than other bmps the mineral nitrogen yields reduction rate is strongly correlated with the fertilizer application rate the study revealed that the lowest reduction of surface discharge has shown in stf managements however the highest reduction of mineral nitrogen yields was found in the same management table 7 so it can be said the surface discharge is less influential in reducing mineral nitrogen yields our results indicate that the mineral nitrogen yields depend on the fertilizer application rate outlet weir installing time and overall crop management practices 4 discussion one of the important aspects of this study was to measure the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen export in future climate scenarios from rice fields treated with various best management practices bmps related to drainage weir height and fertilizer management different bmps were tested using the calibrated and validated apex paddy model these steps have been shown to be effective in reducing mineral nitrogen yield in future climate conditions the study found that bmps stf dor stf linked to soil test fertilization stf showed lower mineral nitrogen yields in the future environment than other bmps table 7 fig 9 in addition the future mineral nitrogen yield showed an increasing trend in all bmps under both scenarios in contrast reducing rice paddy fertilization may not work well to mitigate the loading of non point source nutrients in the range of normal farming practices instead it could be important to control the loading to reduce surface drainage yoon et al 2003 however this study revealed that mineral nitrogen yield is high during surface discharge caused by heavy rainfall events early in the rice culture period in conventional management practices figs 3 5 mineral nitrogen yield from paddy fields occurs where nitrogen is carried by the outflow water agricultural activities such as forced drainage or lower weir heights and the characteristics of rainfall patterns may cause surface discharge early in the rice culture cycle kim et al 2020 stated that rainfall pattern characteristics e g regular maximum rainfall and rainfall intensity would influence the t n load occurring in different gcms jeon et al 2006 demonstrated that surface drainage control during the initial phase may be the most critical factor in reducing the non point source load from paddy rice fields as its concentration may be high due to the large amount of fertilization they also estimated that tn and tp surface loads were reduced by about 78 and 49 due to the increased weir height the study indicated that the bmps associated with increased outlet weir height dor dor stf and dor fabwi showed a comparatively higher surface discharge reduction rate than others table 7 increasing the drainage weir height in diked rice fields can increase storage of rainwater by reducing overflow from the fields as well as reducing excess rainfall through surface drainage a three year experimental study mishra et al 1998 in india with weir heights of 6 and 30 cm at 4 cm intervals showed that around 57 and 100 of the rainfall could be stored in 6 and 30 cm weir height plots respectively without any significant impact on grain yield bouman and tuong 2001 found that reducing ponded water depths from 5 10 cm to soil saturation level did not reduce land productivity and observed that water savings of 23 led to a reduction in yields of only 6 the study suggests that the future surface discharge has shown an increasing trend in all bmps under both scenarios fig 9 the surface discharge depends on precipitation amount precipitation pattern and outlet height during the cropping period kamruzzaman et al 2020a recommended that there is a strong positive relationship between surface discharge and precipitation amount however the highest amount of precipitation has shown in the 2040s under rcp8 5 which is higher than the 2070s fig 8 the surface discharge is not reflected in the precipitation amount compare to the 2040s and 2070s under rcp8 5 kim et al 2016 reported that effective rainfall varied according to climate change scenarios and periods due to effects of rainfall days rainfall intensities and freshwater conditions of the field hence using effective bmps it may be possible to monitor more effectively the mineral nitrogen yield from paddies under future climate condition the reduction of non point source nutrient loading to the receiving water bodies is an important factor for reducing surface drainage water water quality issues in rural areas are thought to be largely due to excessive fertilization and the subsequent agricultural runoff in many countries like korea raising the drainage weir height in diked rice ﬁelds soil test based fertilization and outlet weir installing before fertilizer application could be suggested as measures to reduce mineral nitrogen yield from paddy fields in future climate scenarios the potential benefits could include reduced irrigation water use and more efficient water resource distribution increased storage of rainwater with subsequent flood mitigation and recharge effects on groundwater and reduced nutrient loss i e reduced nutrient loading and improved water quality such activities however often affect some aspects of the overall water environment and may have other consequences however excessively increased weir height for example can cause submerging damage or cold water damage to the rice crop and low irrigation requires support for participation and irrigation facilities therefore when developing practical bmps for paddies other diverse aspects and local conditions need to be considered in addition to environmental concerns 5 conclusions different best management practices bmps were assessed using the apex paddy agricultural policy environmental extender paddy model to reduce the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yield from paddy cultivation for three future time slices e g the 2010s 2040s and 2070s the combination of raising paddy drainage outlets and soil test based fertilization dor stf showed a substantial reduction in surface discharge in both scenarios rcp4 5 and 8 5 the highest reduction rate was observed in the 2010s and was estimated at 21 87 under rcp4 5 compared to conventional management practice cmp 1 stf demonstrated a substantial reduction in mineral nitrogen yield under rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 by 30 98 and 28 32 respectively followed by dor stf during the 2010s however the combination of drainage outlet raising and fertilizer application before outlet weir installation dor fabwi management resulted in an increased load of mineral nitrogen with a rate of up to 30 98 under rcp4 5 and up to 36 69 under rcp8 5 scenarios surface discharge depends on precipitation pattern and drainage outlet height during the cropping period while mineral nitrogen yield mainly depends on fertilizer application rate surface discharge control in fertilization period and crop management the surface discharge and mineral nitrogen yields have been predicted to rise in the future under climate change the drainage outlet raising dor and soil test based fertilization stf are the most effective bmps in mineral nitrogen yield reduction and their combination can be used for paddy nutrient management for future climate adaptation the apex paddy model is expected to be used as a tool for water management plans on climate change consideration and rice productivity vulnerability assessment this study refers directly to the iksan area in south korea but indirectly to comparable regions due to the advantages in methodological terms as a follow up apex paddy will continue to be used to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing bmps for sustainable water management in paddy ﬁelds at korea s national scale and the findings will be incorporated into agricultural policy development this study demonstrated a suitable approach of reducing mineral nitrogen yields from paddies under future climate alteration in korea however the performance of bmps could also be influenced by future changes in climate patterns as well as extreme climate events such as storm rain therefore further studies are needed to consider more possible climate patterns extreme climatic events and different soil conditions to strengthen the results of this study funding this study was carried out with the support of the research program for agricultural science technology development
