4450,three dimensional x ray computed tomographic ct images of specimens often serve as a flow simulation domain for numerical analysis particularly for permeability estimation but there exists uncertainty in classifying image pixels into pore or solid structures due to the complex pore geometry and limited resolution of x ray ct image this limitation has been tackled by ternary segmentation of ct images into resolved pore unresolved pore and solid phases but it is still challenging to segment each phase and estimate local permeability of unresolved pore this study proposed the estimation of the hydraulic diameter of each unresolved pore voxel in ct images to evaluate the local permeability by a general porosity permeability model hidden markov random field hmrf was implemented to achieve reliable ternary segmentation of porous rock images with different resolutions by considering the statistical and spatial distribution of ct numbers brinkman force lattice boltzmann method bf lbm was then used to compute permeability the results showed that the estimated permeability of berea sandstone and limestone was analogous to experimentally measured values the proposed procedure which does not require experimental characterization of the pore size distribution can be used to nondestructively estimate the permeability of porous rocks using x ray ct images while being less

has been used not only to perform pore structure characterization internal crack detection and drainage process observation for porous materials but also to quantify domain properties such as pore connectivity geometrical tortuosity and porosity cnudde et al 2011 cnudde and boone 2013 hamamoto et al 2016 lindquist et al 2000 luquot et al 2016 promentilla et al 2016 acquisitions of high quality x ray ct images allow pore scale direct numerical simulation dns of fluid flow in porous media which helps to estimate the transport characteristics such as permeability hydraulic tortuosity electrical conductivity and dispersion diffusion coefficients miller et al 2017 mostaghimi et al 2013 2010 øren et al 2007 zhang et al 2019a 2019b additionally image based dns has been utilized to understand multiphase flow phenomena in porous media related to relative permeability curves and immiscible displacement patterns frank et al 2018 li et al 2005 liu et al 2015 ramstad et al 2012 furthermore image based dns is advantageous because it requires fewer assumptions for phenomena of interests and fewer idealization of complex pore structure despite the merits of image based dns performance challenges persist given the fact that image quality and segmentation methods mainly determine the accuracy of the results derived from dns segmentation of pore space from ct images which is a prerequisite of image based analysis inherently involves uncertainty in classifying pixels into pores or solids and often results in distortion of original pore structure geometry because of the limited resolution of x ray ct equipment and segmentation algorithm iassonov et al 2009 leu et al 2014 peng et al 2012 schlüter et al 2014 this is related to the presences of the unresolved pixels which unavoidably originate from the finite size of image resolution and partial volume effect johns et al 1993 ketcham and carlson 2001 however it is challenging to securely obtain x ray ct images of porous rocks with sufficient resolution by satisfying the representative elementary volume rev and capturing authentic pore sizes at the same time because the pore structure and its size are highly heterogeneous for carbonate rocks which consist of both intragranular pores and intergranular pores gerke and van genuchten 1993 knackstedt et al 2006 in particular the permeability of porous media tends to be inconsistent when the x ray image of carbonate rocks is binarized for the simulation domain using global thresholding because the unresolved pore is often misclassified according to the resolution size gooya et al 2016 also drag force based lattice boltzmann model reasonably simulated darcy flow in heterogeneous mudrock by using reconstructed equivalent images and 2d scattered electron microscopic images chen et al 2015a 2015b nonetheless to overcome the uncertainties due to the interplay between the binary segmentation algorithm and x ray ct image quality the following efforts have been employed the capture of unresolved pores by differential imaging between the scan at dry state and the scan saturated by injection of opaque fluid lin et al 2016 the three phase segmentation i e resolved pore unresolved pore and resolved solid for carbonate rocks by converging active contour method qajar and arns 2016 sok et al 2010 and hysteresis segmentation smal et al 2018 iterative growing region algorithm for sandstone soulaine et al 2016 and conventional k means clustering ckc conducted for the contaminated soil scheibe et al 2015 alternatively the multiphase segmentation of 3d x ray ct images was successfully implemented for porous materials by markov random field mrf model kulkarni et al 2012 although the ternary segmentation can produce more reliable pore geometry in porous rocks than the binary segmentation there are still issues such as how to choose the threshold ct values to determine unresolved pores and what porosity or permeability value should be assigned to unresolved pores for the implementation of flow simulation a few attempts have recently presented approaches to correlate the x ray ct images with gray pore diameter based on experimentally measured pore size distribution for soil and rocks bijeljic et al 2018 kang et al 2019 korneev et al 2018 therefore the effect of segmentation method and image resolution on pore structure quality should be explored for fluid flow characteristics this study proposes an alternative approach to conduct the ternary segmentation of 3d x ray ct images followed by computing permeability of porous rocks ternary segmentation is performed by using hmrf algorithm with initialization by hierarchical k means clustering hkc the determination of hydraulic diameter in each unresolved pore i e gray pore diameter is introduced to construct the flow domain of two types of porous rocks with different resolutions prior to the implementation of bf lbm the proposed approach allows numerically computing permeability solely based on the segmentation of 3d x ray images with least a priori information 2 specimen characterization for segmentation two types of rock specimens were used in his study indiana limestone kocurek industries candwell texas and berea sandstone cleveland quarries for each specimen the 16 bit x ray ct images with two different resolutions dx were obtained the images of indiana limestone with a resolution of dx 11 87 μm il11 and those of berea sandstone with dx 4 86 μm bs04 and 32 21 μm bs32 were obtained by x ray ct equipment pct g3 sec ltd the tube current and voltage for x ray ct scanning was set to 210 μa and 140 kvp for il11 160 μa and 110 kvp for bs04 and 200 μa and 120 kvp for bs32 respectively the images of indiana limestone with dx 45 26 il45 found in de paulo ferreira et al 2020 were obtained from digital rocks portal www digitalrocksportal org the tube current and voltage of x ray ct scanning is reported as 250 ma and 140 kv indiana limestone in de paulo ferreira et al 2020 has almost identical porosity and permeability values to the core sample of il11 so that the corresponding images from digital rocks portal were used as a low resolution case il45 for comparison with the high resolution case il11 a total of four 3d images used in this study were shown in fig 1 it is noted that the pores and solids are represented by dark and bright colors respectively and 16 bit pixel information i e ct number in images naturally indicates the relative density of constituents two dimensional 2d sliced images clearly show the size and spatial distribution of pores indiana limestone has as various pore sizes and the gray color in solid matrix looks similar the similar pore size and white dots in solid are predominant in berea sandstone the investigation of mineral composition by x ray diffraction xrd in fig 1 presents that indiana limestone consists of only calcite however multiple minerals such as quartz kaolinite and orthoclase are included in berea sandstone note that kaolinite particles trapped in pore space of berea sandstone are shown in dark gray color the mercury intrusion porosimetry mip was performed to obtain the pore size distribution for each specimen indiana limestone has a wide range of pore size whereas berea sandstone includes more uniform sized pores 60 of total pores by volume fraction has the size range between 4 μm and 20 μm the bulk porosity measured by mip is 14 9 for the indiana limestone and 19 3 for the berea sandstone the permeability of berea sandstone used in this study are 200 md and the average permeability of indiana limestone is reported as 12 5 md by the manufacturer the analyses on the mineral composition and pore size distribution by xrd and mip confirms that the indiana limestone is mineralogically homogeneous only calcite and structurally heterogeneous wide pore size distribution while the berea sandstone is heterogeneous in mineral composition mainly quartz with some kaolinite and orthoclase and structurally homogeneous uniform pore size distribution the resolution of corresponding x ray ct images was marked on the pore size distribution curves in fig 1 it is noted that the pores smaller than the resolution value cannot be detected by the x ray ct imaging and those volume fractions are 67 3 and 87 5 for il11 and il45 and 21 9 and 90 9 for bs04 and bs32 respectively therefore those invisible pores are further processed through ternary segmentation integrated with direct flow simulation when porous rocks with different resolutions are encountered 3 phase segmentation 3 1 hierarchical k means clustering hkc for a given set of observation y y 1 y2 yn ckc divides y into the given number k of groups g g 1 g2 gk k n by minimizing the within cluster sum of squares i e sum of euclidean distances from the centroid µi of each group as shown in eq 1 macqueen 1967 1 arg min g i 1 k y g i y μ i 2 in image segmentation the observation y is usually chosen as the ct numbers of all pixels in the x ray ct image ckc is widely used algorithm for the fast convergence and simple implementation but the algorithm is inherently sensitive to the outlier data due to the squared euclidean distance summation celebi and kingravi 2012 for more consistent and accurate clustering various hkc methods were developed but hkc is limited to bisecting k means clustering in this study chen and chien 2011 liu et al 2014 moseley and wang 2017 the distribution of ct numbers in the x ray ct image of il11 and the original 16 bit image were shown in fig 2 a ckc performed binary segmentation of the original 16 bit ct numbers into two clusters of pores and solids by determining a threshold value λs with k 2 fig 2a left by ckc with k 3 the ternary segmentation into apparent pore gray pore and solid was also possible when the cluster labeling was defined by three phases as shown in fig 2b and it outlines two threshold values of λpp for the boundary between apparent pore and gray pore and λps for the boundary between gray pore and solid fig 2b left the term of apparent pore is defined as image pixels with only pore attributes while gray pore refers to probabilistically either solid or pore the gray pores appear near the boundary between solid and apparent pore or inside solid zones fig 2b right hkc performed the ternary segmentation by repeating the binarization process using the ckc process once the pixels in the original 16 bit images were clustered into pores and solids by the first ckc process pore cluster was segmented further into apparent pore and gray pore by second iteration of ckc then the original ct images were segmented into three clusters of apparent pores resolved pores gray pores unresolved pores and solid resolved solid therefore the threshold λps between gray pore and solid obtained by hkc fig 2c is the same as the threshold λs between pore and solid determined through the binarization using ckc fig 2a the resultant segmentation in the ct number histogram and corresponding segmented image show that the pore fraction segmented by hkc is smaller than that by ckc fig 2b and c the ternary phase domain obtained by hkc was used as input initialization for the segmentation algorithm of hmrf that incorporates the spatial relationship among neighboring pixels which will be described in the following section 3 2 hidden markov random field hmrf hmrf model is optimized by the expectation maximization em algorithm and its dependency on the initialization decreases compared with markov random field mrf wang 2012 zhang et al 2001 with the least assumption of prior knowledge about the given image maximum a posterior map estimation to segment the multiphase 3d image of porous rock can be accomplished in an unsupervised manner by considering the images as the combination of gaussian mixture model and mrf model characterized by gibbs distribution given a lattice system s we define two random variables the labels x xi i s and xi l and its ct numbers y yi i s corresponding to ct numbers in x ray ct images in the ternary segmentation of apparent pore ap gray pore gp and solid s the phase label set is given as l ap gp s the posterior probability is represented by bayes rule eq 2 2 p x y p y x p x p y the likelihood probability is estimated by gaussian distribution eq 3 which fits ct number distribution of each phase i e apparent pore gray pore and solid fig 3 a upper 3 p y x i s p y i x i 1 2 π n exp i s y i μ x i 2 2 σ x i 2 ln σ x i where n is the total number of voxels and σ x i and μ x i are the standard deviation and average of ct numbers y i labeled as phase x i the prior probability p x given by mrf can be also characterized by gibbs distribution according to hammersley clifford theorem eq 4 4 p x 1 z exp i s c c v ic where z is the normalizing constant and vic is clique potential function for possible cliques c of ith voxel the clique potential function is defined in eq 5 5 v ic β 1 δ x i x c where β is gibbs distribution parameter and δ x i x c is kronecker delta for labels x i and x c corresponding to ith voxel adjacent to cth voxel which are included in one clique note that previous studies suggested the connectivity of 4 for 2d images and 6 for 3d images for the sake of simplicity because the clustered images should serve as domains for the flow simulation by bf lbm with three dimensional nineteen velocity directions d3q19 lattice model afterwards the connectivity of each voxel was set as 18 by modifying the hmrf model implemented by wang 2012 for the implementation gibbs distribution parameter β is adjusted similar to the weight distribution of velocity set for d3q19 model while being multiplied by 9 so as to make the maximum β be 1 2 following the geometry of d3q19 model the number of neighboring labels x c for label x i is equal to 18 then the equivalent posterior probability is shown as eq 6 6 p y x p x p y exp i s y i μ x i 2 2 σ x i 2 ln σ x i i s c 1 18 v ic c o n s t finally map estimation optimizes the model parameters to maximize the posterior probability and is reduced to a problem that finds the distribution of label x to maximize eq 7 7 x arg max i s y i μ x i 2 2 σ x i 2 ln σ x i i s c 1 18 v ic in addition class specific weighting is introduced to impose penalties for mislabeled class so that the model drives preferential clustering to the certain class monaco and madabhushi 2012 then eq 7 reads as 8 x arg min i s y i μ x i 2 2 σ x i 2 ln σ x i i s c 1 18 v ic i s ln α x i l l α l 1 where α is a weight function of phases in this study the labels determined by the hkc were used for the initialization of the hmrf at each iteration of hmrf based on the labels determined from the previous iteration the statistical parameters for the gaussian distribution σ x i and μ x i were estimated by fitting the gaussian mixture model the clique potential was calculated by considering the local characteristics of the previous label distribution then the label distribution is updated to minimize the energy function of eq 8 starting from initially labeled by hkc hmrf segmentation for il11 results in the gradual evolution of gray pore over the entire range of ct number distribution as shown in fig 3a bottom accordingly the volume of gray pore increases so that the estimated bulk porosity by hmrf segmentation tends to be higher than that computed by hkc 3 3 selection of phase weights phases were classified by the optimization of the weighted map estimation in hmrf after hmrf segmentation the apparent pore voxel has local porosity of 1 0 the solid voxel has local porosity of 0 0 and the gray pore voxel has local porosity between 0 0 and 1 0 according to its ct number consequently the bulk porosity of x ray ct images can be estimated the detailed procedure is described in the next section the segmentation of the x ray ct images of porous rocks was more sensitive to the phase weight of gray pore α gp than those of apparent pore α ap or solid α s thus the phase weights were set as α a p α s 0 5 1 α g p to reduce the number of control parameters by conducting multiple segmentation simulations the phase weight for gray pore was selected when the estimated porosity by hmrf model becomes close to the measured porosity fig 3b the evolution of certain phase is favored with low value of phase weight by eq 8 thus it is found that the estimated bulk porosity and the porosity of gray pore increase as the phase weight of gray pore decreases note that the difference in bulk porosity and the porosity of apparent pore is the porosity of gray pore the phase weight of gray pore for berea sandstone was larger than that for indiana limestone the estimated porosity of bs04 does not change significantly with respect to the phase weight of gray pore finally the phase weights for each specimen are determined as shown in table 1 4 flow simulation by brinkman force lattice boltzmann model bf lbm 4 1 determination of local permeability for gray pore to construct the flow domain from the ternary segmented images the local permeability k of gray voxels should be determined in a rational way the previous study kang et al 2019 presented the determination of gray pore diameter by combining experimentally measured pore size distribution with segmented gray pore volume in x ray ct images and a general permeability porosity relationship e g the kozeny carman equation seems also applicable in this study a simple pore diameter model was applied to estimate gray pore diameter in the gray pore voxel without experimentally measured pore size distribution the tortuosity of a porous media τ the ratio of average length of flow path lf over the specimen length l is given as a function of porosity ϕ eq 9 barrande et al 2007 matyka et al 2008 9 τ l f l 1 0 49 ln ϕ as the gray pore can be regarded as micro porous media in the meso scale ct image domain the gray pore voxel corresponding to the jth ct number from the largest ct number among the gray pore phase can be exemplified by a cube with a volume of dx 3 penetrated by a channel between two curved parallel plates having a channel length of l f j and a cross sectional area with a gap of dgp j i e gray pore dimeter and a width of dx the pore volume in the gray pore voxel v j is also equivalent to the volume determined by the local porosity of a gray pore voxel ϕ j 10 v j ϕ j d x 3 d gp j l f j d x d gp j τ j d x 2 where the curved channel length l f j is equal to the product of voxel length dx and the local tortuosity of the gray pore voxel τ j then a simple pore diameter model for the gray pore diameter can be made from eqs 9 and 10 11 d gp j ϕ j 1 0 49 ln ϕ j 1 d x the local permeability of a voxel can be determined as a general porosity permeability relationship for parallel plates modified from kozeny carman equation by substituting the gray pore dimeter dgp j in eq 11 12 k j d gp j 2 ϕ j 12 τ j 2 the local porosity of gray pore voxel ϕ j in eq 12 is determined from the relationship between x ray attenuation coefficient and the relative density of materials the x ray attenuation coefficient of a mixture μmix can be estimated by the combination of each x ray attenuation coefficient and density of individual constituent by the following relationship johns et al 1993 vinegar and wellington 1987 13 μ mix a m a ρ a m mix ρ mix μ a a v a v mix μ a where ρa μa ma and va are the density x ray attenuation coefficient mass and volume of ath individual component and ρmix mmix and vmix are the density mass and volume of mixture respectively for the two phase materials composed of solid and pore eq 13 can be expressed in terms of ct number because of the linear relationship between x ray attenuation coefficient and ct number 14 ϕ j λ solid λ mix λ solid λ pore λ solid λ j λ solid λ pore where λsolid and λpore are the threshold ct numbers of solid and pore voxel respectively after hmrf segmentation the maximum and minimum ct numbers of gray pore phase are defined as λsolid and λpore respectively λj is the jth ct number from the maximum ct number λsolid of the gray pore phase λpore λj λsolid consequently the local porosity of gray pore ϕ j is estimated to be the value between 0 and 1 according to the ct number λj while the local porosity for apparent pore is 1 0 and that for solid is 0 0 the substitution of eq 14 into eq 12 results in the local permeability of a gray voxel as an input parameter for bf lbm simulation 4 2 brinkman force lattice boltzmann method bf lbm the bf lbm proposed by ginzburg et al 2015 and later implemented by kang et al 2019 was used for the flow simulation based on ternary segmented 3d image it recovers macroscopically stokes brinkman equation for incompressible and single phase fluid flow at steady state eq 15 15 u 0 μ k u p μ e 2 u where u is voxel averaged velocity field μ is dynamic viscosity of fluid μe is effective dynamic viscosity k is local permeability and p is fluid pressure the addition of shear term in darcy s equation makes stokes brinkman equation applicable to the domains of ternary phases consisting of 1 open flow region governed by stokes equation when the local permeability is infinite i e apparent pore 2 darcy flow region affected by drag force as a function of local permeability i e gray pore and 3 impermeable solid region it is known that the results derived from the conventional lattice boltzmann model lbm with bhatnagar gross krook bgk collision operator using a single relaxation time are viscosity dependent and its incorporation with brinkman force based scheme presents inconsistent results therefore bf lbm used in this study adopts two relaxation time trt framework for linear hydrodynamic model to tune the relaxation of symmetric and asymmetric parts eq 16 16 f i r e δ t t δ t f i r t λ 1 2 1 f i f i eq λ 1 2 1 f i f i eq λ f i where fi is particle distribution function of the i th direction at position r and time t fi is the symmetric part or asymmetric part of particle distribution function e i is discrete particle velocity of i th direction λ is a magic parameter of standard trt scheme and λ is eigenvalue functions of trt operators f i eq is the symmetric part and asymmetric part of the equilibrium distribution function the equilibrium distribution function f i eq is given by eq 17 17 f i eq w i p c s 2 ρ 0 e i u c s 2 where wi is the weight in the ith direction cs is the speed of sound for d3q19 lattice model and ρ0 is reference density of fluid the source term f i is calculated by the body force f including the external force f and the drag force eq 18 18 f i w i e i f c s 2 f f μ k u the relaxation function varies in spatial domain depending on local permeability the two eigenvalue functions of λ are as follows eq 19 19 λ 9 4 b ν e 4 3 2 b λ and λ λ 3 ν e where b f ϕ k ve is effective kinematic viscosity v f ϕ and f ϕ is a function of local porosity representing the micro geometry of interest which is regarded as unity brinkman 1949 ginzburg et al 2015 note that the when the local permeability k goes to infinity in the open flow region apparent pore and then λ and drag force term approach 3ve and zero respectively then bf lbm is reduced to standard trt scheme which solves stokes equation equivalently while stokes brinkman equation in darcy flow region is solved according to the local permeability k and the drag force 5 results and analyses 5 1 phase evolution in this study we prepared bulk domains in a way to take the largest rectangular shaped domain from x ray ct images each bulk domain has the size of 506 506 500 voxels for bs04 600 600 600 voxels for bs32 536 536 614 voxels for il11 and 532 532 700 voxels for il45 the segmentation and assignment of properties are applied to the bulk domains and the flow simulation is conducted for the 4003 voxel subdomain obtained from the bulk domain the 2d image selected from the 3d x ray ct image stacks of il11 is shown on fig 4 1st column as the iteration progresses during hmrf process the initially assigned phase evolves into another phase the evolution of gray pores during the iterations is shown in color fig 4 lower the dark region surrounded by the gray pore phase is apparent pore phase and the opened bright region is solid phase the optimization of segmentation by hmrf is achieved when the energy function eq 8 reaches the global minima during the optimization the region occupied by each phase can be expanded or contracted the new gray pores converted from apparent pore or solid during the iterations were labeled as from orange to purple color expansion of gray pore region additionally the initial gray pores that is converted into other phases after the iterations were labeled from green to dark navy color withdrawal of gray pore region as shown in the lower insets in fig 4 gray pore phase in il11 evolved through the entire iterations because the gray pore phase was labeled from orange to purple color in the zone shown in fig 4 some region initially labeled as gray pore phase was converted into apparent pore phase withdrawal case and some region initially labeled as solid phase was converted into gray pore phase expansion case one of the main factors enforcing the evolution of phases is the prior potential energy determined from gibbs distribution considering the 3d local contexts moreover the phase transition tends to smooth solid walls by removing the protruded areas which affects the evolution of velocity field during lbm flow simulation it was also found that after certain iterations isolated grains with considerably high ct numbers were converted into gray pore phase because the isolated grains are not different from the isolated gray pores morphologically this states that the global minima of potential energy function would not be exactly equivalent to the solution of the ternary segmentation of geomaterials however the early stopping of iterations gives reliable segmentation by the estimated porosity shown in the next section and the phase evolution completes within a shorter iteration for high resolution images after careful observation on the evolution pattern for all four images it is noticeable that the region previously being solid was dominantly converted to gray pore expansion of gray pore for il11 il45 and bs04 however there was a mutual evolution between gray pore and solid for bs32 segmentation results for four 3d x ray ct images are shown in fig 5 the portion of apparent pore black gray pore gray and solid white are represented with the global histogram of x ray ct numbers for both il11 and il45 the voxels initially labeled as solid phase were converted into gray pore phases fig 5a and b the maximum ct number of gray pore phase for il11 was λps 2194 threshold between gray pore and solid determined by hkc and the value increased to near 2370 after hmrf clustering the maximum ct number of gray pore phase for il45 was λps 10694 and it increased to 12488 however at the interface between apparent pore and gray pore mutual evolution occurred apparent pores were converted to gray pores and vice versa shown in the expanded insets in fig 5a and b for example the minimum ct number of gray pore of il11 decreased from 2084 to 2024 through hmrf process meanwhile the maximum ct number of the apparent pore phase increased to 2120 these evolution trends at the interface between gray pore and solid and between apparent pore and gray pore were also found in il45 and bs04 fig 5b and c especially for bs32 the dominant conversion from apparent pore to gray pore was found at the interface between apparent pore and gray pore while mutual evolution was found at the interface between gray pore and solid phase fig 5d 5 2 voxel count fraction and porosity voxel count fraction f is defined as the ratio of voxel counts for certain phase to the voxel counts of the bulk domain and it accounts for the effect of hmrf segmentation table 2 for both il11 and il45 the voxel count fraction of apparent pore fap was maintained constant during hmrf however the gray pore fraction fgp dramatically increased while the solid fraction fas reduced the porosity of a gray pore voxel can be calculated by its ct number as the maximum and minimum ct numbers of gray pore phase determined by hmrf segmentation are set to the threshold ct number for the solid and pore phase in eq 14 respectively the bulk porosity of domains ϕ is equal to the sum of the porosity of apparent pore ϕ ap and the porosity of gray pore ϕ gp since the local porosity of apparent pore is equal to 1 0 the porosity of apparent pore is identical to f ap with the total number of voxels n the bulk porosity is given as follows ϕ ϕ ap ϕ gp f ap j n j n ϕ j where ϕ j and n j are the porosity of gray pore and the number of gray pore voxels corresponding to the jth ct number from the maximum ct number among the gray pore phase consequently the bulk porosity of the indiana limestone il11 and il45 almost doubled through hmrf process from 7 to 14 mainly because of the conversion of solid to gray pore however the porosity of berea sandstone showed only a 2 3 increase after hmrf table 2 the increase in bulk porosity of bs04 during hmrf largely resulted from the conversion of solid phase into gray pore because the conversion of apparent pore to gray pore was only 1 as the quality of images was enhanced from low resolution to high resolution image for a given rock type the porosity of apparent pore increased from 3 23 to 4 2 for il and from 4 32 to 10 14 for bs and the porosity of gray pore decreased from 11 1 to 10 69 for il and from 15 26 to 8 7 for bs compared to the deterministic segmentation of hkc or ckc hmrf segmentation can provide the estimated porosity closer to the measured porosity of 14 9 for indiana limestone and 19 3 for berea sandstone fig 6 5 3 phase distribution confirmed by sem image x ray ct and scanning electron microscope sem images were obtained for the same cross section in il11 fig 7 a additionally local porosity distribution obtained by ckc hkc and hmrf is shown fig 7b the preparation of the specimen for sem imaging was conducted by careful manual grinding and polishing so the cross section of the sem image very closely matched the sliced section of the x ray ct image the sem image with higher resolution showed detailed and clear pore and solid distribution compared to the x ray ct image the sem image clearly showed small particles in the pore space and protruded solid surface that were shown as dark gray blurry zone i e p1 and p2 in x ray ct image the porosity map for il11 by using ckc hkc and hmrf algorithms is shown on fig 7b the ckc algorithm classified most pore areas as apparent pores with the porosity of 1 and showed a narrow gray pore distribution between apparent pores shown in brown and solids shown in blue some gray pores were found within solid zone the hkc algorithm resulted in less porous distribution some gray pores identified by the ckc were now shown as solid by hkc and some apparent pores identified by ckc were shown as gray pore in hkc algorithm the hmrf algorithm produced more gray zones between apparent pore and solid and inside solid area which appeared more similar to pore and solid structures found in the sem image some gray pore phase scattered within solid phase shown in the local porosity map of ckc was not observed in porosity map of hmrf possibly because the scattered gray pore phase has no local contexts no neighboring gray or apparent pores in 3d finally hmrf captures the connected gray pore well allowing the evaluation of the potential contribution of the gray pore to the transport phenomena 5 4 flow simulation using bf lbm incompressible single phase fluid flow at steady state was simulated using the bf lbm in the simulation the different pressures in inlet and outlet boundaries were imposed for applying the unit hydraulic gradient the gray pores smaller than 0 001 μm were assumed to be solid to avoid the numerical oscillation due to the extremely small permeability the detailed procedure of flow simulation can be found in our previous study kang et al 2019 simulated streamlines and the porosity map for the indiana limestone and berea sandstone were visualized fig 8 the subdomain selected for the visualization of the streamlines has the size of 1603 voxels for il11 and 1403 voxels for bs04 the simulation results show that well developed streamlines with higher flow velocity were observed for the bs04 domain the apparent pore phase in il11 shown in red was covered by an isosurface of gray pore phase having porosity of 0 5 shown in gray fig 8a middle apparent pores in il11 were not directly connected to each other especially in the box a apparent pore phase red was separated but gray pore phase gray formed a continuous flow channel fig 8a right clearly the streamlines from the right side to the top side of the box marked as white triangles were connected through the gray pore region where the local porosity was between 0 0 and 1 0 fig 8a right the streamlines of bs04 were well developed throughout the domain because the apparent pore phase was well connected fig 8b the streamlines in box b were majorly developed through apparent pore phase as the streamlines were enveloped by apparent pore phase surface fig 8b right the simulation of bf lbm integrated with the simple pore diameter model showed that the permeability has an exponential relationship with the estimated porosity regardless of the segmentation method fig 9 the measured permeability values available in the literature were compiled and a regression analysis black solid line in fig 9 was conducted k 0 0021 exp 56 289 ϕ with r2 of 0 94 for indiana limestone and k 0 0697 exp 0 3904 ϕ with r2 of 0 84 for berea sandstone the reported values and the references are listed in supplementary materials the dashed lines define the range within 1 order of magnitude from the regression model the comparison with experimental data shows that the image based permeability prediction overestimated the permeability of indiana limestone however it predicted permeability values close to the experimental values of berea sandstone the porosity estimated from hmrf was close to the measured porosity regardless of the resolution of images the simulated permeability of il11 was 38 md while the permeability of il45 was 201 md consequently only the estimation by hmrf for il11 is within 1 order of magnitude from the regression model for the berea sandstone regardless of the segmentation methods the simulated permeability values resided within one order of magnitude from the regression model however the most accurate estimation for the porosity and the permeability of berea sandstone was obtained in the domain segmented by hmrf 6 discussions the volume of apparent pores was divided into 3 types connected apparent pore from the inlet to the outlet boundary cap virtually connected apparent pore by the interaction with gray pore vap and isolated apparent pore iap the fractions of each type of apparent pores were summarized dependent on rock type resolution and segmentation algorithm table 3 especially for the berea sandstone image with high resolution bs04 most apparent pores 90 for all three types of segmentation algorithms were connected from the inlet to the outlet boundary by themselves cap however other cases indiana limestone with both high and low resolution and berea sandstone with low resolution showed that most apparent pores had global connectivity through the interaction with gray pores vap we compared the cumulative pore volume fraction cpvf curve estimated by the simple pore diameter model and the measured curve by mip the cpvf for dgp j cfj can be calculated by sequentially accumulating local pore volumes from ϕ1 the smallest porosity of voxels to ϕj as 20 c f d gp j c f j 1 1 v p q 1 j v q n q 1 1 v p q 1 j ϕ q n q d x 3 where the gray pore diameter of j th ct number dgp j is determined by the ct number and the simple pore diameter model vp is the total pore volume nq is the number of voxels having q th ct number note that the pore diameter is not assigned to the apparent pore phase therefore the calculated cpvf curve is drawn only in the range corresponding to the gray pores in bs04 the gray pore diameter of the simple pore diameter model corresponding to cf 55 85 was underestimated compared to the cpvf measured by mip fig 10 a this may lead to the underestimated contribution of gray pores on the transport phenomena the apparent pores having 54 5 of total pore volume are well interconnected as described above and the stokes flow in the apparent pore might be dominant in bs32 the apparent pores have only 21 7 of the total pore volume and are only virtually connected through gray pores so that the transport properties of gray pores have significant contributions to the flow fortunately it is shown that the gray pore diameter of the simple pore diameter model corresponding to cf 25 65 was well matched to the measured one by mip fig 10a these observations help to describe why the calculated permeability of bs04 and bs32 fit the experimental value well fig 9b in the aspect of practical implementation it seems that the simple pore diameter model with hmrf segmentation could produce the reasonable flow domain for a sandstone having a single critical pore size in other words this method well works for a steep cpvf curve in indiana limestone the pore sizes are more widely distributed compared to berea sandstone and the apparent pore volumes of il11 and il45 are smaller than 30 of the total pore volume so that most of the pore volume is occupied by the gray pore it shows that the simple pore diameter model tended to overestimate the gray pore diameter of il11 and il45 although the gray pore diameter for il11 corresponding to cf 25 40 is slightly underestimated also their calculated permeability was obviously overestimated fig 9a these results imply that the simple pore diameter model has limitations for carbonate rocks having multiple critical pore sizes to mitigate that problem with preserving our concept we modified eq 11 by assuming the number of pore channels increases inversely proportional to ϕ as 21 d gp j ϕ j 2 1 0 49 ln ϕ j 1 d x the modified pore diameter model improved the cpvf curves dashed lines closer to the measured one fig 10b and reduced the computed permeability from 38 md to 12 md for il11 and from 201 md to 58 md for il45 fig 10c therefore it can be concluded that the appropriate pore diameter model should be selected according to the rock types though the hmrf segmentation method gives successful ternary phase segmentation the simple or modified pore diameter model does not provide the unique cpvf curve for given rock type and image resolution nevertheless the proposed method can provide the practically efficient and accurate image based direct flow simulation for indiana limestone and berea sandstone 7 conclusions this study presented the ternary segmentation of x ray ct images for two porous rocks with different resolutions and the reliable estimation of permeability without prior information by experiments for segmentation the hmrf method was used by considering the spatial correlation within neighboring voxels a procedure to estimate local porosity gray pore diameter and local permeability of each pore voxel was also proposed salient conclusions are summarized as shown below in ternary segmentation the estimated porosity by conventional k means clustering ckc highly varied depending on image resolution the hierarchical k means clustering hkc tended to result in underestimated porosity despite the independency of image resolution the hidden markov random field hmrf segmentation initialized by hkc was able to determine the optimized label distribution of ternary phases corroborated by direct comparison of sem image with the same section of ct image which made the estimated porosity similar to the measured porosity it was attributed to that the hmrf consider the spatial correlation of neighboring voxels with tunable parameters i e phase weights and gibbs parameter the simple and modified pore diameter models for berea sandstone and limestone images were proposed to estimate the gray pore diameter of unresolved gray pore by combining the micropore geometry model with the local pore volume the simulation using the bf lbm adopted with both pore diameter models resulted in reliable permeability values similar to experimental values the proposed approach improves the merit of digital rock physics with minimized experimental data in numerically estimating permeability of

4450,three dimensional x ray computed tomographic ct images of specimens often serve as a flow simulation domain for numerical analysis particularly for permeability estimation but there exists uncertainty in classifying image pixels into pore or solid structures due to the complex pore geometry and limited resolution of x ray ct image this limitation has been tackled by ternary segmentation of ct images into resolved pore unresolved pore and solid phases but it is still challenging to segment each phase and estimate local permeability of unresolved pore this study proposed the estimation of the hydraulic diameter of each unresolved pore voxel in ct images to evaluate the local permeability by a general porosity permeability model hidden markov random field hmrf was implemented to achieve reliable ternary segmentation of porous rock images with different resolutions by considering the statistical and spatial distribution of ct numbers brinkman force lattice boltzmann method bf lbm was then used to compute permeability the results showed that the estimated permeability of berea sandstone and limestone was analogous to experimentally measured values the proposed procedure which does not require experimental characterization of the pore size distribution can be used to nondestructively estimate the permeability of porous rocks using x ray ct images while being less

has been used not only to perform pore structure characterization internal crack detection and drainage process observation for porous materials but also to quantify domain properties such as pore connectivity geometrical tortuosity and porosity cnudde et al 2011 cnudde and boone 2013 hamamoto et al 2016 lindquist et al 2000 luquot et al 2016 promentilla et al 2016 acquisitions of high quality x ray ct images allow pore scale direct numerical simulation dns of fluid flow in porous media which helps to estimate the transport characteristics such as permeability hydraulic tortuosity electrical conductivity and dispersion diffusion coefficients miller et al 2017 mostaghimi et al 2013 2010 øren et al 2007 zhang et al 2019a 2019b additionally image based dns has been utilized to understand multiphase flow phenomena in porous media related to relative permeability curves and immiscible displacement patterns frank et al 2018 li et al 2005 liu et al 2015 ramstad et al 2012 furthermore image based dns is advantageous because it requires fewer assumptions for phenomena of interests and fewer idealization of complex pore structure despite the merits of image based dns performance challenges persist given the fact that image quality and segmentation methods mainly determine the accuracy of the results derived from dns segmentation of pore space from ct images which is a prerequisite of image based analysis inherently involves uncertainty in classifying pixels into pores or solids and often results in distortion of original pore structure geometry because of the limited resolution of x ray ct equipment and segmentation algorithm iassonov et al 2009 leu et al 2014 peng et al 2012 schlüter et al 2014 this is related to the presences of the unresolved pixels which unavoidably originate from the finite size of image resolution and partial volume effect johns et al 1993 ketcham and carlson 2001 however it is challenging to securely obtain x ray ct images of porous rocks with sufficient resolution by satisfying the representative elementary volume rev and capturing authentic pore sizes at the same time because the pore structure and its size are highly heterogeneous for carbonate rocks which consist of both intragranular pores and intergranular pores gerke and van genuchten 1993 knackstedt et al 2006 in particular the permeability of porous media tends to be inconsistent when the x ray image of carbonate rocks is binarized for the simulation domain using global thresholding because the unresolved pore is often misclassified according to the resolution size gooya et al 2016 also drag force based lattice boltzmann model reasonably simulated darcy flow in heterogeneous mudrock by using reconstructed equivalent images and 2d scattered electron microscopic images chen et al 2015a 2015b nonetheless to overcome the uncertainties due to the interplay between the binary segmentation algorithm and x ray ct image quality the following efforts have been employed the capture of unresolved pores by differential imaging between the scan at dry state and the scan saturated by injection of opaque fluid lin et al 2016 the three phase segmentation i e resolved pore unresolved pore and resolved solid for carbonate rocks by converging active contour method qajar and arns 2016 sok et al 2010 and hysteresis segmentation smal et al 2018 iterative growing region algorithm for sandstone soulaine et al 2016 and conventional k means clustering ckc conducted for the contaminated soil scheibe et al 2015 alternatively the multiphase segmentation of 3d x ray ct images was successfully implemented for porous materials by markov random field mrf model kulkarni et al 2012 although the ternary segmentation can produce more reliable pore geometry in porous rocks than the binary segmentation there are still issues such as how to choose the threshold ct values to determine unresolved pores and what porosity or permeability value should be assigned to unresolved pores for the implementation of flow simulation a few attempts have recently presented approaches to correlate the x ray ct images with gray pore diameter based on experimentally measured pore size distribution for soil and rocks bijeljic et al 2018 kang et al 2019 korneev et al 2018 therefore the effect of segmentation method and image resolution on pore structure quality should be explored for fluid flow characteristics this study proposes an alternative approach to conduct the ternary segmentation of 3d x ray ct images followed by computing permeability of porous rocks ternary segmentation is performed by using hmrf algorithm with initialization by hierarchical k means clustering hkc the determination of hydraulic diameter in each unresolved pore i e gray pore diameter is introduced to construct the flow domain of two types of porous rocks with different resolutions prior to the implementation of bf lbm the proposed approach allows numerically computing permeability solely based on the segmentation of 3d x ray images with least a priori information 2 specimen characterization for segmentation two types of rock specimens were used in his study indiana limestone kocurek industries candwell texas and berea sandstone cleveland quarries for each specimen the 16 bit x ray ct images with two different resolutions dx were obtained the images of indiana limestone with a resolution of dx 11 87 μm il11 and those of berea sandstone with dx 4 86 μm bs04 and 32 21 μm bs32 were obtained by x ray ct equipment pct g3 sec ltd the tube current and voltage for x ray ct scanning was set to 210 μa and 140 kvp for il11 160 μa and 110 kvp for bs04 and 200 μa and 120 kvp for bs32 respectively the images of indiana limestone with dx 45 26 il45 found in de paulo ferreira et al 2020 were obtained from digital rocks portal www digitalrocksportal org the tube current and voltage of x ray ct scanning is reported as 250 ma and 140 kv indiana limestone in de paulo ferreira et al 2020 has almost identical porosity and permeability values to the core sample of il11 so that the corresponding images from digital rocks portal were used as a low resolution case il45 for comparison with the high resolution case il11 a total of four 3d images used in this study were shown in fig 1 it is noted that the pores and solids are represented by dark and bright colors respectively and 16 bit pixel information i e ct number in images naturally indicates the relative density of constituents two dimensional 2d sliced images clearly show the size and spatial distribution of pores indiana limestone has as various pore sizes and the gray color in solid matrix looks similar the similar pore size and white dots in solid are predominant in berea sandstone the investigation of mineral composition by x ray diffraction xrd in fig 1 presents that indiana limestone consists of only calcite however multiple minerals such as quartz kaolinite and orthoclase are included in berea sandstone note that kaolinite particles trapped in pore space of berea sandstone are shown in dark gray color the mercury intrusion porosimetry mip was performed to obtain the pore size distribution for each specimen indiana limestone has a wide range of pore size whereas berea sandstone includes more uniform sized pores 60 of total pores by volume fraction has the size range between 4 μm and 20 μm the bulk porosity measured by mip is 14 9 for the indiana limestone and 19 3 for the berea sandstone the permeability of berea sandstone used in this study are 200 md and the average permeability of indiana limestone is reported as 12 5 md by the manufacturer the analyses on the mineral composition and pore size distribution by xrd and mip confirms that the indiana limestone is mineralogically homogeneous only calcite and structurally heterogeneous wide pore size distribution while the berea sandstone is heterogeneous in mineral composition mainly quartz with some kaolinite and orthoclase and structurally homogeneous uniform pore size distribution the resolution of corresponding x ray ct images was marked on the pore size distribution curves in fig 1 it is noted that the pores smaller than the resolution value cannot be detected by the x ray ct imaging and those volume fractions are 67 3 and 87 5 for il11 and il45 and 21 9 and 90 9 for bs04 and bs32 respectively therefore those invisible pores are further processed through ternary segmentation integrated with direct flow simulation when porous rocks with different resolutions are encountered 3 phase segmentation 3 1 hierarchical k means clustering hkc for a given set of observation y y 1 y2 yn ckc divides y into the given number k of groups g g 1 g2 gk k n by minimizing the within cluster sum of squares i e sum of euclidean distances from the centroid µi of each group as shown in eq 1 macqueen 1967 1 arg min g i 1 k y g i y μ i 2 in image segmentation the observation y is usually chosen as the ct numbers of all pixels in the x ray ct image ckc is widely used algorithm for the fast convergence and simple implementation but the algorithm is inherently sensitive to the outlier data due to the squared euclidean distance summation celebi and kingravi 2012 for more consistent and accurate clustering various hkc methods were developed but hkc is limited to bisecting k means clustering in this study chen and chien 2011 liu et al 2014 moseley and wang 2017 the distribution of ct numbers in the x ray ct image of il11 and the original 16 bit image were shown in fig 2 a ckc performed binary segmentation of the original 16 bit ct numbers into two clusters of pores and solids by determining a threshold value λs with k 2 fig 2a left by ckc with k 3 the ternary segmentation into apparent pore gray pore and solid was also possible when the cluster labeling was defined by three phases as shown in fig 2b and it outlines two threshold values of λpp for the boundary between apparent pore and gray pore and λps for the boundary between gray pore and solid fig 2b left the term of apparent pore is defined as image pixels with only pore attributes while gray pore refers to probabilistically either solid or pore the gray pores appear near the boundary between solid and apparent pore or inside solid zones fig 2b right hkc performed the ternary segmentation by repeating the binarization process using the ckc process once the pixels in the original 16 bit images were clustered into pores and solids by the first ckc process pore cluster was segmented further into apparent pore and gray pore by second iteration of ckc then the original ct images were segmented into three clusters of apparent pores resolved pores gray pores unresolved pores and solid resolved solid therefore the threshold λps between gray pore and solid obtained by hkc fig 2c is the same as the threshold λs between pore and solid determined through the binarization using ckc fig 2a the resultant segmentation in the ct number histogram and corresponding segmented image show that the pore fraction segmented by hkc is smaller than that by ckc fig 2b and c the ternary phase domain obtained by hkc was used as input initialization for the segmentation algorithm of hmrf that incorporates the spatial relationship among neighboring pixels which will be described in the following section 3 2 hidden markov random field hmrf hmrf model is optimized by the expectation maximization em algorithm and its dependency on the initialization decreases compared with markov random field mrf wang 2012 zhang et al 2001 with the least assumption of prior knowledge about the given image maximum a posterior map estimation to segment the multiphase 3d image of porous rock can be accomplished in an unsupervised manner by considering the images as the combination of gaussian mixture model and mrf model characterized by gibbs distribution given a lattice system s we define two random variables the labels x xi i s and xi l and its ct numbers y yi i s corresponding to ct numbers in x ray ct images in the ternary segmentation of apparent pore ap gray pore gp and solid s the phase label set is given as l ap gp s the posterior probability is represented by bayes rule eq 2 2 p x y p y x p x p y the likelihood probability is estimated by gaussian distribution eq 3 which fits ct number distribution of each phase i e apparent pore gray pore and solid fig 3 a upper 3 p y x i s p y i x i 1 2 π n exp i s y i μ x i 2 2 σ x i 2 ln σ x i where n is the total number of voxels and σ x i and μ x i are the standard deviation and average of ct numbers y i labeled as phase x i the prior probability p x given by mrf can be also characterized by gibbs distribution according to hammersley clifford theorem eq 4 4 p x 1 z exp i s c c v ic where z is the normalizing constant and vic is clique potential function for possible cliques c of ith voxel the clique potential function is defined in eq 5 5 v ic β 1 δ x i x c where β is gibbs distribution parameter and δ x i x c is kronecker delta for labels x i and x c corresponding to ith voxel adjacent to cth voxel which are included in one clique note that previous studies suggested the connectivity of 4 for 2d images and 6 for 3d images for the sake of simplicity because the clustered images should serve as domains for the flow simulation by bf lbm with three dimensional nineteen velocity directions d3q19 lattice model afterwards the connectivity of each voxel was set as 18 by modifying the hmrf model implemented by wang 2012 for the implementation gibbs distribution parameter β is adjusted similar to the weight distribution of velocity set for d3q19 model while being multiplied by 9 so as to make the maximum β be 1 2 following the geometry of d3q19 model the number of neighboring labels x c for label x i is equal to 18 then the equivalent posterior probability is shown as eq 6 6 p y x p x p y exp i s y i μ x i 2 2 σ x i 2 ln σ x i i s c 1 18 v ic c o n s t finally map estimation optimizes the model parameters to maximize the posterior probability and is reduced to a problem that finds the distribution of label x to maximize eq 7 7 x arg max i s y i μ x i 2 2 σ x i 2 ln σ x i i s c 1 18 v ic in addition class specific weighting is introduced to impose penalties for mislabeled class so that the model drives preferential clustering to the certain class monaco and madabhushi 2012 then eq 7 reads as 8 x arg min i s y i μ x i 2 2 σ x i 2 ln σ x i i s c 1 18 v ic i s ln α x i l l α l 1 where α is a weight function of phases in this study the labels determined by the hkc were used for the initialization of the hmrf at each iteration of hmrf based on the labels determined from the previous iteration the statistical parameters for the gaussian distribution σ x i and μ x i were estimated by fitting the gaussian mixture model the clique potential was calculated by considering the local characteristics of the previous label distribution then the label distribution is updated to minimize the energy function of eq 8 starting from initially labeled by hkc hmrf segmentation for il11 results in the gradual evolution of gray pore over the entire range of ct number distribution as shown in fig 3a bottom accordingly the volume of gray pore increases so that the estimated bulk porosity by hmrf segmentation tends to be higher than that computed by hkc 3 3 selection of phase weights phases were classified by the optimization of the weighted map estimation in hmrf after hmrf segmentation the apparent pore voxel has local porosity of 1 0 the solid voxel has local porosity of 0 0 and the gray pore voxel has local porosity between 0 0 and 1 0 according to its ct number consequently the bulk porosity of x ray ct images can be estimated the detailed procedure is described in the next section the segmentation of the x ray ct images of porous rocks was more sensitive to the phase weight of gray pore α gp than those of apparent pore α ap or solid α s thus the phase weights were set as α a p α s 0 5 1 α g p to reduce the number of control parameters by conducting multiple segmentation simulations the phase weight for gray pore was selected when the estimated porosity by hmrf model becomes close to the measured porosity fig 3b the evolution of certain phase is favored with low value of phase weight by eq 8 thus it is found that the estimated bulk porosity and the porosity of gray pore increase as the phase weight of gray pore decreases note that the difference in bulk porosity and the porosity of apparent pore is the porosity of gray pore the phase weight of gray pore for berea sandstone was larger than that for indiana limestone the estimated porosity of bs04 does not change significantly with respect to the phase weight of gray pore finally the phase weights for each specimen are determined as shown in table 1 4 flow simulation by brinkman force lattice boltzmann model bf lbm 4 1 determination of local permeability for gray pore to construct the flow domain from the ternary segmented images the local permeability k of gray voxels should be determined in a rational way the previous study kang et al 2019 presented the determination of gray pore diameter by combining experimentally measured pore size distribution with segmented gray pore volume in x ray ct images and a general permeability porosity relationship e g the kozeny carman equation seems also applicable in this study a simple pore diameter model was applied to estimate gray pore diameter in the gray pore voxel without experimentally measured pore size distribution the tortuosity of a porous media τ the ratio of average length of flow path lf over the specimen length l is given as a function of porosity ϕ eq 9 barrande et al 2007 matyka et al 2008 9 τ l f l 1 0 49 ln ϕ as the gray pore can be regarded as micro porous media in the meso scale ct image domain the gray pore voxel corresponding to the jth ct number from the largest ct number among the gray pore phase can be exemplified by a cube with a volume of dx 3 penetrated by a channel between two curved parallel plates having a channel length of l f j and a cross sectional area with a gap of dgp j i e gray pore dimeter and a width of dx the pore volume in the gray pore voxel v j is also equivalent to the volume determined by the local porosity of a gray pore voxel ϕ j 10 v j ϕ j d x 3 d gp j l f j d x d gp j τ j d x 2 where the curved channel length l f j is equal to the product of voxel length dx and the local tortuosity of the gray pore voxel τ j then a simple pore diameter model for the gray pore diameter can be made from eqs 9 and 10 11 d gp j ϕ j 1 0 49 ln ϕ j 1 d x the local permeability of a voxel can be determined as a general porosity permeability relationship for parallel plates modified from kozeny carman equation by substituting the gray pore dimeter dgp j in eq 11 12 k j d gp j 2 ϕ j 12 τ j 2 the local porosity of gray pore voxel ϕ j in eq 12 is determined from the relationship between x ray attenuation coefficient and the relative density of materials the x ray attenuation coefficient of a mixture μmix can be estimated by the combination of each x ray attenuation coefficient and density of individual constituent by the following relationship johns et al 1993 vinegar and wellington 1987 13 μ mix a m a ρ a m mix ρ mix μ a a v a v mix μ a where ρa μa ma and va are the density x ray attenuation coefficient mass and volume of ath individual component and ρmix mmix and vmix are the density mass and volume of mixture respectively for the two phase materials composed of solid and pore eq 13 can be expressed in terms of ct number because of the linear relationship between x ray attenuation coefficient and ct number 14 ϕ j λ solid λ mix λ solid λ pore λ solid λ j λ solid λ pore where λsolid and λpore are the threshold ct numbers of solid and pore voxel respectively after hmrf segmentation the maximum and minimum ct numbers of gray pore phase are defined as λsolid and λpore respectively λj is the jth ct number from the maximum ct number λsolid of the gray pore phase λpore λj λsolid consequently the local porosity of gray pore ϕ j is estimated to be the value between 0 and 1 according to the ct number λj while the local porosity for apparent pore is 1 0 and that for solid is 0 0 the substitution of eq 14 into eq 12 results in the local permeability of a gray voxel as an input parameter for bf lbm simulation 4 2 brinkman force lattice boltzmann method bf lbm the bf lbm proposed by ginzburg et al 2015 and later implemented by kang et al 2019 was used for the flow simulation based on ternary segmented 3d image it recovers macroscopically stokes brinkman equation for incompressible and single phase fluid flow at steady state eq 15 15 u 0 μ k u p μ e 2 u where u is voxel averaged velocity field μ is dynamic viscosity of fluid μe is effective dynamic viscosity k is local permeability and p is fluid pressure the addition of shear term in darcy s equation makes stokes brinkman equation applicable to the domains of ternary phases consisting of 1 open flow region governed by stokes equation when the local permeability is infinite i e apparent pore 2 darcy flow region affected by drag force as a function of local permeability i e gray pore and 3 impermeable solid region it is known that the results derived from the conventional lattice boltzmann model lbm with bhatnagar gross krook bgk collision operator using a single relaxation time are viscosity dependent and its incorporation with brinkman force based scheme presents inconsistent results therefore bf lbm used in this study adopts two relaxation time trt framework for linear hydrodynamic model to tune the relaxation of symmetric and asymmetric parts eq 16 16 f i r e δ t t δ t f i r t λ 1 2 1 f i f i eq λ 1 2 1 f i f i eq

velocity of i th direction λ is a magic parameter of standard trt scheme and λ is eigenvalue functions of trt operators f i eq is the symmetric part and asymmetric part of the equilibrium distribution function the equilibrium distribution function f i eq is given by eq 17 17 f i eq w i p c s 2 ρ 0 e i u c s 2 where wi is the weight in the ith direction cs is the speed of sound for d3q19 lattice model and ρ0 is reference density of fluid the source term f i is calculated by the body force f including the external force f and the drag force eq 18 18 f i w i e i f c s 2 f f μ k u the relaxation function varies in spatial domain depending on local permeability the two eigenvalue functions of λ are as follows eq 19 19 λ 9 4 b ν e 4 3 2 b λ and λ λ 3 ν e where b f ϕ k ve is effective kinematic viscosity v f ϕ and f ϕ is a function of local porosity representing the micro geometry of interest which is regarded as unity brinkman 1949 ginzburg et al 2015 note that the when the local permeability k goes to infinity in the open flow region apparent pore and then λ and drag force term approach 3ve and zero respectively then bf lbm is reduced to standard trt scheme which solves stokes equation equivalently while stokes brinkman equation in darcy flow region is solved according to the local permeability k and the drag force 5 results and analyses 5 1 phase evolution in this study we prepared bulk domains in a way to take the largest rectangular shaped domain from x ray ct images each bulk domain has the size of 506 506 500 voxels for bs04 600 600 600 voxels for bs32 536 536 614 voxels for il11 and 532 532 700 voxels for il45 the segmentation and assignment of properties are applied to the bulk domains and the flow simulation is conducted for the 4003 voxel subdomain obtained from the bulk domain the 2d image selected from the 3d x ray ct image stacks of il11 is shown on fig 4 1st column as the iteration progresses during hmrf process the initially assigned phase evolves into another phase the evolution of gray pores during the iterations is shown in color fig 4 lower the dark region surrounded by the gray pore phase is apparent pore phase and the opened bright region is solid phase the optimization of segmentation by hmrf is achieved when the energy function eq 8 reaches the global minima during the optimization the region occupied by each phase can be expanded or contracted the new gray pores converted from apparent pore or solid during the iterations were labeled as from orange to purple color expansion of gray pore region additionally the initial gray pores that is converted into other phases after the iterations were labeled from green to dark navy color withdrawal of gray pore region as shown in the lower insets in fig 4 gray pore phase in il11 evolved through the entire iterations because the gray pore phase was labeled from orange to purple color in the zone shown in fig 4 some region initially labeled as gray pore phase was converted into apparent pore phase withdrawal case and some region initially labeled as solid phase was converted into gray pore phase expansion case one of the main factors enforcing the evolution of phases is the prior potential energy determined from gibbs distribution considering the 3d local contexts moreover the phase transition tends to smooth solid walls by removing the protruded areas which affects the evolution of velocity field during lbm flow simulation it was also found that after certain iterations isolated grains with considerably high ct numbers were converted into gray pore phase because the isolated grains are not different from the isolated gray pores morphologically this states that the global minima of potential energy function would not be exactly equivalent to the solution of the ternary segmentation of geomaterials however the early stopping of iterations gives reliable segmentation by the estimated porosity shown in the next section and the phase evolution completes within a shorter iteration for high resolution images after careful observation on the evolution pattern for all four images it is noticeable that the region previously being solid was dominantly converted to gray pore expansion of gray pore for il11 il45 and bs04 however there was a mutual evolution between gray pore and solid for bs32 segmentation results for four 3d x ray ct images are shown in fig 5 the portion of apparent pore black gray pore gray and solid white are represented with the global histogram of x ray ct numbers for both il11 and il45 the voxels initially labeled as solid phase were converted into gray pore phases fig 5a and b the maximum ct number of gray pore phase for il11 was λps 2194 threshold between gray pore and solid determined by hkc and the value increased to near 2370 after hmrf clustering the maximum ct number of gray pore phase for il45 was λps 10694 and it increased to 12488 however at the interface between apparent pore and gray pore mutual evolution occurred apparent pores were converted to gray pores and vice versa shown in the expanded insets in fig 5a and b for example the minimum ct number of gray pore of il11 decreased from 2084 to 2024 through hmrf process meanwhile the maximum ct number of the apparent pore phase increased to 2120 these evolution trends at the interface between gray pore and solid and between apparent pore and gray pore were also found in il45 and bs04 fig 5b and c especially for bs32 the dominant conversion from apparent pore to gray pore was found at the interface between apparent pore and gray pore while mutual evolution was found at the interface between gray pore and solid phase fig 5d 5 2 voxel count fraction and porosity voxel count fraction f is defined as the ratio of voxel counts for certain phase to the voxel counts of the bulk domain and it accounts for the effect of hmrf segmentation table 2 for both il11 and il45 the voxel count fraction of apparent pore fap was maintained constant during hmrf however the gray pore fraction fgp dramatically increased while the solid fraction fas reduced the porosity of a gray pore voxel can be calculated by its ct number as the maximum and minimum ct numbers of gray pore phase determined by hmrf segmentation are set to the threshold ct number for the solid and pore phase in eq 14 respectively the bulk porosity of domains ϕ is equal to the sum of the porosity of apparent pore ϕ ap and the porosity of gray pore ϕ gp since the local porosity of apparent pore is equal to 1 0 the porosity of apparent pore is identical to f ap with the total number of voxels n the bulk porosity is given as follows ϕ ϕ ap ϕ gp f ap j n j n ϕ j where ϕ j and n j are the porosity of gray pore and the number of gray pore voxels corresponding to the jth ct number from the maximum ct number among the gray pore phase consequently the bulk porosity of the indiana limestone il11 and il45 almost doubled through hmrf process from 7 to 14 mainly because of the conversion of solid to gray pore however the porosity of berea sandstone showed only a 2 3 increase after hmrf table 2 the increase in bulk porosity of bs04 during hmrf largely resulted from the conversion of solid phase into gray pore because the conversion of apparent pore to gray pore was only 1 as the quality of images was enhanced from low resolution to high resolution image for a given rock type the porosity of apparent pore increased from 3 23 to 4 2 for il and from 4 32 to 10 14 for bs and the porosity of gray pore decreased from 11 1 to 10 69 for il and from 15 26 to 8 7 for bs compared to the deterministic segmentation of hkc or ckc hmrf segmentation can provide the estimated porosity closer to the measured porosity of 14 9 for indiana limestone and 19 3 for berea sandstone fig 6 5 3 phase distribution confirmed by sem image x ray ct and scanning electron microscope sem images were obtained for the same cross section in il11 fig 7 a additionally local porosity distribution obtained by ckc hkc and hmrf is shown fig 7b the preparation of the specimen for sem imaging was conducted by careful manual grinding and polishing so the cross section of the sem image very closely matched the sliced section of the x ray ct image the sem image with higher resolution showed detailed and clear pore and solid distribution compared to the x ray ct image the sem image clearly showed small particles in the pore space and protruded solid surface that were shown as dark gray blurry zone i e p1 and p2 in x ray ct image the porosity map for il11 by using ckc hkc and hmrf algorithms is shown on fig 7b the ckc algorithm classified most pore areas as apparent pores with the porosity of 1 and showed a narrow gray pore distribution between apparent pores shown in brown and solids shown in blue some gray pores were found within solid zone the hkc algorithm resulted in less porous distribution some gray pores identified by the ckc were now shown as solid by hkc and some apparent pores identified by ckc were shown as gray pore in hkc algorithm the hmrf algorithm produced more gray zones between apparent pore and solid and inside solid area which appeared more similar to pore and solid structures found in the sem image some gray pore phase scattered within solid phase shown in the local porosity map of ckc was not observed in porosity map of hmrf possibly because the scattered gray pore phase has no local contexts no neighboring gray or apparent pores in 3d finally hmrf captures the connected gray pore well allowing the evaluation of the potential contribution of the gray pore to the transport phenomena 5 4 flow simulation using bf lbm incompressible single phase fluid flow at steady state was simulated using the bf lbm in the simulation the different pressures in inlet and outlet boundaries were imposed for applying the unit hydraulic gradient the gray pores smaller than 0 001 μm were assumed to be solid to avoid the numerical oscillation due to the extremely small permeability the detailed procedure of flow simulation can be found in our previous study kang et al 2019 simulated streamlines and the porosity map for the indiana limestone and berea sandstone were visualized fig 8 the subdomain selected for the visualization of the streamlines has the size of 1603 voxels for il11 and 1403 voxels for bs04 the simulation results show that well developed streamlines with higher flow velocity were observed for the bs04 domain the apparent pore phase in il11 shown in red was covered by an isosurface of gray pore phase having porosity of 0 5 shown in gray fig 8a middle apparent pores in il11 were not directly connected to each other especially in the box a apparent pore phase red was separated but gray pore phase gray formed a continuous flow channel fig 8a right clearly the streamlines from the right side to the top side of the box marked as white triangles were connected through the gray pore region where the local porosity was between 0 0 and 1 0 fig 8a right the streamlines of bs04 were well developed throughout the domain because the apparent pore phase was well connected fig 8b the streamlines in box b were majorly developed through apparent pore phase as the streamlines were enveloped by apparent pore phase surface fig 8b right the simulation of bf lbm integrated with the simple pore diameter model showed that the permeability has an exponential relationship with the estimated porosity regardless of the segmentation method fig 9 the measured permeability values available in the literature were compiled and a regression analysis black solid line in fig 9 was conducted k 0 0021 exp 56 289 ϕ with r2 of 0 94 for indiana limestone and k 0 0697 exp 0 3904 ϕ with r2 of 0 84 for berea sandstone the reported values and the references are listed in supplementary materials the dashed lines define the range within 1 order of magnitude from the regression model the comparison with experimental data shows that the image based permeability prediction overestimated the permeability of indiana limestone however it predicted permeability values close to the experimental values of berea sandstone the porosity estimated from hmrf was close to the measured porosity regardless of the resolution of images the simulated permeability of il11 was 38 md while the permeability of il45 was 201 md consequently only the estimation by hmrf for il11 is within 1 order of magnitude from the regression model for the berea sandstone regardless of the segmentation methods the simulated permeability values resided within one order of magnitude from the regression model however the most accurate estimation for the porosity and the permeability of berea sandstone was obtained in the domain segmented by hmrf 6 discussions the volume of apparent pores was divided into 3 types connected apparent pore from the inlet to the outlet boundary cap virtually connected apparent pore by the interaction with gray pore vap and isolated apparent pore iap the fractions of each type of apparent pores were summarized dependent on rock type resolution and segmentation algorithm table 3 especially for the berea sandstone image with high resolution bs04 most apparent pores 90 for all three types of segmentation algorithms were connected from the inlet to the outlet boundary by themselves cap however other cases indiana limestone with both high and low resolution and berea sandstone with low resolution showed that most apparent pores had global connectivity through the interaction with gray pores vap we compared the cumulative pore volume fraction cpvf curve estimated by the simple pore diameter model and the measured curve by mip the cpvf for dgp j cfj can be calculated by sequentially accumulating local pore volumes from ϕ1 the smallest porosity of voxels to ϕj as 20 c f d gp j c f j 1 1 v p q 1 j v q n q 1 1 v p q 1 j ϕ q n q d x 3 where the gray pore diameter of j th ct number dgp j is determined by the ct number and the simple pore diameter model vp is the total pore volume nq is the number of voxels having q th ct number note that the pore diameter is not assigned to the apparent pore phase therefore the calculated cpvf curve is drawn only in the range corresponding to the gray pores in bs04 the gray pore diameter of the simple pore diameter model corresponding to cf 55 85 was underestimated compared to the cpvf measured by mip fig 10 a this may lead to the underestimated contribution of gray pores on the transport phenomena the apparent pores having 54 5 of total pore volume are well interconnected as described above and the stokes flow in the apparent pore might be dominant in bs32 the apparent pores have only 21 7 of the total pore volume and are only virtually connected through gray pores so that the transport properties of gray pores have significant contributions to the flow fortunately it is shown that the gray pore diameter of the simple pore diameter model corresponding to cf 25 65 was well matched to the measured one by mip fig 10a these observations help to describe why the calculated permeability of bs04 and bs32 fit the experimental value well fig 9b in the aspect of practical implementation it seems that the simple pore diameter model with hmrf segmentation could produce the reasonable flow domain for a sandstone having a single critical pore size in other words this method well works for a steep cpvf curve in indiana limestone the pore sizes are more widely distributed compared to berea sandstone and the apparent pore volumes of il11 and il45 are smaller than 30 of the total pore volume so that most of the pore volume is occupied by the gray pore it shows that the simple pore diameter model tended to overestimate the gray pore diameter of il11 and il45 although the gray pore diameter for il11 corresponding to cf 25 40 is slightly underestimated also their calculated permeability was obviously overestimated fig 9a these results imply that the simple pore diameter model has limitations for carbonate rocks having multiple critical pore sizes to mitigate that problem with preserving our concept we modified eq 11 by assuming the number of pore channels increases inversely proportional to ϕ as 21 d gp j ϕ j 2 1 0 49 ln ϕ j 1 d x the modified pore diameter model improved the cpvf curves dashed lines closer to the measured one fig 10b and reduced the computed permeability from 38 md to 12 md for il11 and from 201 md to 58 md for il45 fig 10c therefore it can be concluded that the appropriate pore diameter model should be selected according to the rock types though the hmrf segmentation method gives successful ternary phase segmentation the simple or modified pore diameter model does not provide the unique cpvf curve for given rock type and image resolution nevertheless the proposed method can provide the practically efficient and accurate image based direct flow simulation for indiana limestone and berea sandstone 7 conclusions this study presented the ternary segmentation of x ray ct images for two porous rocks with different resolutions and the reliable estimation of permeability without prior information by experiments for segmentation the hmrf method was used by considering the spatial correlation within neighboring voxels a procedure to estimate local porosity gray pore diameter and local permeability of each pore voxel was also proposed salient conclusions are summarized as shown below in ternary segmentation the estimated porosity by conventional k means clustering ckc highly varied depending on image resolution the hierarchical k means clustering hkc tended to result in underestimated porosity despite the independency of image resolution the hidden markov random field hmrf segmentation initialized by hkc was able to determine the optimized label distribution of ternary phases corroborated by direct comparison of sem image with the same section of ct image which made the estimated porosity similar to the measured porosity it was attributed to that the hmrf consider the spatial correlation of neighboring voxels with tunable parameters i e phase weights and gibbs parameter the simple and modified pore diameter models for berea sandstone and limestone images were proposed to estimate the gray pore diameter of unresolved gray pore by combining the micropore geometry model with the local pore volume the simulation using the bf lbm adopted with both pore diameter models resulted in reliable permeability values similar to experimental values the proposed approach improves the merit of digital rock physics with minimized experimental data in numerically estimating permeability of

4451,this work introduces a general multi objective parameter estimation framework to exploit modis based snow cover maps to reduce predictive streamflow uncertainty in snow dominated catchments the well known glue methodology is applied with a multi objective approach combining streamflow observations recorded at the outlet section and satellite derived snow cover maps aggregated to fractional values of the catchment area the hydrological model used in this study includes a snowpack routine which exploits a statistical representation of the distribution of clear sky potential solar radiation a significant advantage when parameter sensitivity and uncertainty estimation procedures are carried out the study provides an assessment of this approach based on operational quality data from two medium size mountainous basins a nested one included in a larger parent basin located in the eastern italian alps the nested basin is considered as ungauged thus allowing a spatial assessment of the multi objective approach results show a positive feedback between streamflow and snow cover area likelihoods highlighted by means of the pareto plot moreover a better identifiability of the parameters driving snowmelt rate is found and consequently a shrink of the predictive streamflow uncertainty is observed a containing ratio of 0 54 and a mean sharpness of 0 11 are found at the outlet of the parent basin while a containing ratio equal to 0 65 and a mean sharpness equal to 0 17 are estimated at the nested basin used as a validation test these results confirm the potential of modis snow cover maps as additional data to inform hydrological models leading to more reliable and sharper streamflow simulations this approach might be also appealing when streamflow simulations are required for ungauged basins keywords uncertainty analysis modis snow cover maps multiobjective parameter estimation snow hydrology hydrological modelling 1 introduction hydrological models play a key role for supporting the development of efficient water resources planning management and adaptation strategies indeed they can provide valuable information to better address issues related to e g natural hazards such as floods and droughts sene 2010 competing water uses bellin et al 2016 and hydropower energy production majone et al 2016 wagner et al 2017 in snow dominated catchments hydrological modelling reliability also depends on the capability of simulating snow accumulation and melting valéry et al 2014 warscher et al 2013 since snow dynamics strongly affects floods förster et al 2014 as well as both seasonal and annual runoff regimes mazouz et al 2012 moreover hydrological models output usually depends on several parameters accurate parameter estimation might be challenging because of the well known equifinality issue beven 2006 turning into potentially unreliable parameter estimates out of the model calibration period starting with the pioneering works of duan et al 1992 and gupta et al 1998 it was clear the need to consider the inherent multi objective nature of the inference problem to quantify and reduce the uncertainty related to model parameter estimation several methods address the issue of multi objective parameter estimation as thoroughly described by madsen 2003 among the different approaches multi variable methods revealed their utility in improving parameter identifiability and model prediction capabilities see efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 the main benefit of the multi objective approach is an improved identification of the hydrological model which in principle allows a good reproduction of the variable of interest typically streamflow without introducing large biases in the simulation of the other components of the hydrological cycle wagener et al 2001 such methodology proved to be effective also in snow dominated catchments where streamflow records and snow related observations e g ground or satellite data are used simultaneously snow related observations have been typically used for improving the performances of hydrological models through calibration experiments see e g tuo et al 2018 shrestha et al 2014 roy et al 2010 parajka and blöschl 2008b among the different types of snow related measurements satellite derived snow cover data have been increasingly used to improve runoff estimates parajka and blöschl 2008b parajka et al 2012 shrestha et al 2014 riboust et al 2019 as well as joint streamflow and snow water equivalent predictions stigter et al 2017 in this context the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer hereinafter referred as modis snow cover maps represent a valuable information due to their high temporal i e 1 day and spatial resolution i e 500 m according to the standard nasa products modis snow cover area sca maps accuracy was extensively validated across different areas by comparison with in situ snow depth observations parajka and bloschl 2006 notarnicola et al 2013b di marco et al 2020 and other satellite derived snow cover products such as landsat gascoin et al 2015 modis based sca and streamflow records were used jointly by teweldebrhan et al 2018 to perform uncertainty parameter estimation of a conceptual hydrological model however despite a better parameter identifiability the authors did not find any significant improvement in streamflow simulation other studies focused on the joint application of streamflow data and modis based sca retrievals though hydrological response uncertainty quantification combining such datasets did not receive adequate attention in the literature as reported by teweldebrhan et al 2018 finger et al 2015 used streamflow data modis sca and glacier mass balance records to improve the robustness of hbv model estimating model parameters within a montecarlo framework shrestha et al 2014 combined modis sca maps with streamflow to improve the spatial distribution of snowfall in a small size catchment and in turn the accuracy of the simulated streamflow a similar approach based on avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer retrievals was presented by duethmann et al 2014 to evaluate the benefit of using an increasing number of images within a multi objective model parameter estimation framework however none of the abovementioned studies focused on the explicit quantification of predicted streamflow uncertainty reduction or on the validation of the proposed modelling at nested sites within the catchments i e a spatial validation of the parameter estimation procedure we speculate that the scarce literature on combining satellite derived sca and streamflow data within an uncertainty framework might be caused by the large computational effort of such analysis indeed reproducing a massive number of model realizations for the variables of interest e g streamflow snow water equivalent swe and sca as required for a thorough uncertainty estimation analysis might be very expensive from a computational point of view this is especially true for spatially distributed variables such as swe which in turn leads to the sca quantification in this work we exploited the capabilities of topmelt zaramella et al 2019 a recently proposed extended temperature index model particularly suited for montecarlo based uncertainty analyses as shown by di marco et al 2020 comparing topmelt and modis based sca over an alpine catchment based on the abovementioned background we aim to introduce a general multi objective parameter estimation framework to exploit modis based sca maps to reduce predictive streamflow uncertainty in snow dominated catchments such framework is relatively easy to extend over different even data scarce regions we also provide a spatial validation of the proposed framework simulating streamflow in a nested sub catchment where streamflow data are available but not used in the parameter estimation phase finally we show how modis based sca information might be used to reduce swe predicted uncertainty even though it is acknowledged that a validation is not provided because of lack of data the paper is organized as follows sect 2 provides a short description of the adopted hydrological and snowpack models the case study area and the multi objective parameter estimation method main results are presented in sect 3 and further discussed in sect 4 finally sect 5 reports some concluding remarks 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrological and snowpack model the conceptual semi distributed hydrological model ichymod norbiato et al 2009 2008 was used to simulate hydrological fluxes at hourly time resolution ichymod exploits the runoff production module of the pdm rainfall runoff model moore 2007 1985 in which the so called probability distributed soil moisture storage a function that describes the spatial variability of the soil infiltration capacity is used to estimate the rainfall excess the pdm takes up water from rainfall and snowmelt and loses water by evapotranspiration and recharge to groundwater computed as a function of the soil water content through a power law relationship potential evapotranspiration is estimated by means of the hargreaves model direct runoff is routed to the outlet of the sub basin by means of a cascade of two linear reservoirs while baseflow is transferred downstream through the adoption of a nonlinear storage the well known muskingam cunge scheme is used to propagate the flow from each sub basin outlet along the river network the required meteorological inputs are hourly time series of precipitation and temperature snow accumulation and melting are computed by means of topmelt zaramella et al 2019 puspitarini et al 2020 scorpio et al 2020 model topmelt is a semi distributed snowpack model based on an extended temperature index approach capable to estimate the full spatial distribution of the swe at each time step the clear sky shortwave solar radiation is computed at each element of the digital terrain model dtm by taking into account shadow and complex topography calculating the apparent sun motion and the intersection of radiation with topography diffuse radiation is computed by accounting for self shading by slope and aspect and occlusions produced by the visible horizon with topmelt the catchment is divided into elevation bands and the full spatial distribution of clear sky potential solar radiation is discretised into a number of radiation classes for each elevation band the computation required to generate a spatially distributed water equivalent thus reduces to a single calculation for each radiation class ensuring a high computational efficiency the work by zaramella et al 2019 shows that aggregating radiation into ten classes for each elevation band has a minimal impact on model results compared to a distributed model therefore based on the spatial distribution of the clear sky solar radiation pixels included in each elevation band are grouped in ten radiation classes the snowmelt routine is applied to each radiation class in place of to each pixel during day dry hours the snowmelt rate fi j t mm h 1 for the i th elevation band the j th radiation class and at time t is computed as follows 1 f i j t c m f ri i j t 1 a l b s t m a x 0 t i t t b where cmf is the combined melting factor mm m2 c 1 mj 1 ri is the clear sky solar radiation mj m 2 h 1 and albs t is the snow albedo at the current time step t modelled as a function of the fresh snow albedo albs brock et al 2000 ti is the air temperature at the i th elevation band while tb is the temperature threshold above which snowmelt is assumed to occur both in c the model accounts for rain on snow and melt during night by means of a temperature index approach through two additional parameters the rain melt factor rmf and the night melt factor nmf respectively see zaramella et al 2019 for further details with topmelt air temperature is computed at each elevation band by assuming a linear temperature lapse rate estimated at hourly time step with a linear regression on the available temperature data to account for gauge catch deficiencies that occur during periods of snow precipitation data are corrected with a snow correction factor scf scf is set to the constant value of 1 4 after a sensitivity analysis and in agreement with previous works conducted over the upper adige river basin engel et al 2017 di marco et al 2020 for the analyses reported in this work the thiessen method was used to calculate the mean precipitation over the basin then the mean areal precipitation estimate was corrected with a precipitation correction factor pcf to account for poor spatial representativeness of the rain gages pcf is a dimensionless parameter acting as a multiplicative factor on the mean sub catchment precipitation moreover a lapse rate g is applied to distribute such mean areal precipitation over each elevation band estimation of the precipitation phase solid or liquid is therefore performed over each elevation band according to the threshold temperature tc the selection of the parameters involved in the uncertainty analysis among all those available in the pdm implementation see moore 2007 was performed on the basis of a preliminary sensitivity analysis conducted with the glue method beven and binley 1992 the list of the ten pdm topmelt calibration parameters adopted in the present study is presented in table 1 together with their respective ranges of variation 2 2 study area and data the analysis was performed over the passer passirio river basin 428 km2 one of the main tributaries of the adige river basin eastern italian alps fig 1 stergiadi et al 2020 with elevations ranging between 360 m a m s l and 3500 m a m s l two basins in the passer passirio river system were considered passer passirio river basin at meran 414 km2 and its sub basin plan river at pfelders plan 49 km2 precipitation and temperature data from nine weather stations table 2 as well as discharge data at the two outlet sections are available at hourly time step over the period selected for the study ranging from 01 10 2014 to 30 09 2017 the mean annual precipitation over the passer passirio river basin in the period of interest is about 1150 mm close to the long term annual average chiogna et al 2016 mallucci et al 2019 avesani et al 2021 precipitation mainly occurs in fall and summer fig 2 a as typically observed across the adige river basin laiti et al 2018 chiogna et al 2016 fig 2b and fig 2c show the monthly pattern of the hourly unit discharge at meran merano and pfelders plan respectively the hydrological regime is a typical snow dominated regime with a significant difference between winter low flows and spring high flows the hydrological model was applied to the passer passirio watershed by dividing the main basin in different sub catchments average size about 20 km2 over which hydrological properties are assumed to be uniform flow data from the plan river basin at pfelders plan were used to validate the robustness of our analysis at a location different from that selected during the model conditioning procedure accordingly the streamflow records of pfelders plan station were not involved in the parameter identification phase daily snow cover area maps were provided with a spatial resolution of 250x250m by eurac notarnicola et al 2013a 2013b this resolution is finer than the standard nasa modis snow products 500x500m and allows better snow detection at a local scale especially in harsh environments notarnicola et al 2013a where topography and land cover i e forests may prevent an optimal signal acquisition by modis simic et al 2004 engel et al 2017 moreover eurac products have been extensively tested in other studies conducted either in the eastern italian alps engel et al 2017 di marco et al 2020 and across europe thirel et al 2012 modis sca maps were processed to discard days with cloud coverage greater than a fixed fraction of the catchment area following finger et al 2015 we fixed this threshold value at 10 of the total passer passirio catchment area i e about 41 km2 moreover we discarded modis maps during the period from july to september since fractional sca was negligible and limited to high elevation portions of the watershed where modis products is known to be less reliable mainly because of cloud misclassifications and patchy snow covered area parajka and blöschl 2008a notarnicola et al 2013b as a result a discontinuous time series of 187 days of snow cover area maps was made available as an input for the multi objective parameter estimation method see sect 2 following duethmann et al 2014 we assumed that the presence of gaps in the data did not affect the multi objective uncertainty analysis procedure a good consistency between topmelt outputs and modis based sca was found by di marco et al 2020 either in terms of fractional snow covered area fsca i e the percentage of the overall catchment area covered by snow based on either modis maps or simulated spatial distributions of snowpack and sca spatial distribution carried out on a sub catchment of the upper adige river basin which includes the passer passirio tributary area following that work we estimated topmelt fsca taking advantage of the distributed structure of the snowpack model which allows to estimate the fractional snow covered area as the ratio between the area with swe greater than a fixed threshold and the total area of the catchment such threshold was set equal to 5 mm swe moreover it has to be specified that topmelt works at hourly time step while modis maps are available on a daily basis therefore daily time series of topmelt fsca were estimated averaging the original hourly simulations 2 3 uncertainty estimation methodology 2 3 1 selection of behavioural simulations with the glue approach model parameters uncertainty estimation was performed using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation i e the glue methodology beven 2006 glue relies on the generation of a high number of independent model realizations i e monte carlo simulations each associated with a specific parametrization and a likelihood measure the selection of both the likelihood measure and the cutoff threshold separating behavioral from non behavioral simulations is a subjective choice of the modeler blasone et al 2008 jin et al 2010 furthermore the procedure is not meant to find a single optimum configuration yet a set of acceptable models efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 brazier et al 2000 according with the abovementioned concept of equifinality accordingly first of all we performed a random sampling from the parameter space by means of latin hypercube sampling scheme mckay et al 1979 assuming a uniform distribution for every parameter listed in table 1 since we did not have any a priori information about the parameter distribution we considered each parameter set as equally likely see e g gan et al 2018 teweldebrhan et al 2018 to this end a sample of 10 000 different parameter sets was generated each associated with a likelihood measure for the evaluation of the modelling efficiency behavioural parametrizations were then identified based on suitable thresholds simulations producing likelihood measures below the identified thresholds were considered not behavioural and their likelihoods were set equal to 0 the likelihoods associated with the retained simulations i e behavioral parameter set were rescaled so that their cumulative total is one with the resulting probability density function representing our new knowledge about the model parameters moreover in order to estimate the predictive uncertainty bounds of the simulated variables e g streamflow the behavioural runs were ranked according to the magnitude of the rescaled likelihood measure producing the empirical cumulative likelihood weighted distribution efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 brazier et al 2000 franks et al 1998 the uncertainty range is given by such cumulative distribution neglecting the tails identified with the quantiles 5 and 95 teweldebrhan et al 2018 as likelihood measure for both streamflow and fsca variables we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 index the streamflow nse is computed as follows 2 n s e q 1 t 1 n q sim t q obs t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs m e a n 2 while the fractional sca nse assumes the following form 3 n s e f s c a 1 t 1 n fsca sim t fsca modis t 2 t 1 n fsca modis t fsca modis m e a n 2 where t is the current time step qsim and qobs are the simulated and observed streamflow time series respectively qobs mean is the mean observed streamflow fscasim and fscaobs are the simulated and modis based fractional snow covered area time series respectively and fscamodis mean is the modis based averaged fractional snow covered area finally n is the total number of time steps following moriasi et al 2007 the threshold for the identification of behavioural streamflow simulations was set at 0 5 the selection of the threshold value for nse fsca deserves an in depth discussion that is provided in sect 4 1 here it is worth noting that the value was fixed equal to the median of the simulated nse fsca values resulting in a nse fsca 0 67 2 3 2 multi objective parameters estimation multi objective parameters estimation was carried out in two separate steps following an informal bayesian approach first streamflow measurements recorded at meran merano hydrometric gauging station i e the catchment outlet section were used to constrain model parameters the resulting distribution of the likelihood measures was assumed as informative of the prior information i e it defines our knowledge about the system before introducing the additional modis fsca data next the combined posterior likelihood distribution clh was estimated multiplying streamflow and fsca likelihoods eqn 2 and 3 and introducing a suitable rescaling factor c in order to obtain a combined probability distribution function see e g brazier et al 2000 franks et al 1998 among others this function represents the posterior parameter distribution 4 c l h p i q s c a 1 c l h q p i l h f s c a p i where pi is one of the parameter sets considered in the monte carlo sample sampling lh q pi is the streamflow likelihood i e the prior distribution lh fsca pi is the snow cover related likelihood obtained by comparing topmelt module outputs and modis fractional sca data finally c is a normalization constant introduced in order to have a unitary integral of clh i observed streamflow time series available at the pfelders plan gauging station were used only for the spatial validation of our approach and hence were not considered for model conditioning 2 4 metrics for uncertainty quantification we used two metrics to quantify the benefit of multi objective model conditioning over the mono criteria case i e the case in which only streamflow observations are exploited the first metric is the so called containing ratio cr teweldebrhan et al 2018 also known as reliability zhang et al 2008 defined as following 5 cr 1 n t 1 n i o t x s i m 0 05 t x s i m 0 95 t where t is the current time step n is the total number of time steps and o t xsim 0 05 t and xsim 0 95 t are respectively the observed variable i e streamflow or fsca and the prediction corresponding to the 0 05 and 0 95 percentiles i is a function that assumes the values of 1 if the simulated percentile range brackets the observation and 0 otherwise the second metric we adopted is the sharpness shafii et al 2014 zhang et al 2008 which allows to estimate the reduction of the prediction uncertainty range obtained by adding modis fsca data in the parameter constraining process sharpness sh is defined as 1 minus the ratio between the posterior uncertainty range of a given variable to the uncertainty range given by the prior distribution as reported in eqn 6 6 sh 1 c l h p i q f s c a lh q p i notice that a perfect model conditioning would lead to both cr and sh equal to 1 assuming a predicted posterior uncertainty range that asymptotically tends to 0 in other words with a perfect multi objective conditioning the predicted uncertainty band tends to 0 i e the simulated variable has no uncertainty accordingly such simulated variable would perfectly match the observation thus leading to cr equal to 1 3 results as specified in section 2 the parameters of the hydrological model were inferred by maximizing the likelihood measures at meran merano gauging station during the period from 01 10 2013 to 30 09 2017 the first year of the time series 01 10 2013 30 09 2014 was used as spin up period for the simulations and therefore was excluded from the computation of the efficiency metrics within the glue procedure model parameters were conditioned using only streamflow records at the catchment outlet meran merano station to identify a priori information then we applied the multi objective conditioning to infer posterior parameter distributions combining both streamflow observations at meran merano and fractional sca data relative to the overall catchment area finally prediction uncertainty of streamflow fsca and mean areal snow water equivalent swe were estimated either at meran merano and at pfelders plan basins using both prior and poster parameter distributions such approach allows to quantify to what extent the parametric uncertainty might be reduced because of the joint use of fsca and streamflow information we highlight that we consider the pfelders plan catchment as ungauged therefore it can be considered as a validation test for the proposed approach 3 1 behavioral simulations for each run of the overall monte carlo sample we computed likelihood values for both streamflow and fsca using streamflow records taken at meran merano stream gage and modis fsca relative to the overall passer passirio catchment the pareto fronts green dots in fig 3 obtained either at meran merano and pfelders plan locations are presented in fig 3 together with the entire set of dominated solutions i e solutions not belonging to the pareto front we remark again that fsca observations were not used for the identification of behavioural simulation i e a priori information but only for ensuing identification of posterior parameter distributions fig 3 highlights that for both sites a positive feedback between fsca and streamflow likelihoods is present in other words an increase of streamflow likelihood is not associated with a decrease of likelihood values for fsca as often observed in multi objective optimization problems yapo et al 1998 such positive feedback is even more evident at pfelders plan location where snow dynamics controls the hydrological regime more largely than at meran merano because of higher elevation and smaller drainage basin size 3 2 prior and posterior parameter distributions prior i e model conditioning conducted using only meran merano streamflow data and posterior distributions for each model parameter are shown in fig 4 it is worth noting that in the figure we report only the comparison for topmelt module parameters since the parameter distributions relative to the rainfall runoff module did not show any appreciable variation this result is expected since multi objective model conditioning is performed using fsca as additional data therefore it seems reasonable that the further constrain on model parameters acts only in snow related parameters visual inspection of prior parameter distributions blue lines in fig 4 evidences that combined melting factor cmf and precipitation correction factor pcf are the most sensitive parameters i e their likelihood distributions vary significantly depending on the parameter value both parameters are related with the streamflow generation in a straightforward manner since snowmelt is linearly dependent to cmf through eq 1 and pcf is a multiplier of the estimated precipitation values introduced in order to compensate poor spatial representativeness of rain gages not surprisingly for pcf values far from 1 the likelihood shows a sharp decrease suggesting that precipitation estimates requires only a slight adjustment in this case study we double checked the reliability of available meteorological data estimating the runoff coefficient i e the ratio of the total annual runoff over the total annual precipitation for several hydrological years and the analysis confirmed that pcf optimal value is coherently close to 1 posterior parameters distribution for albs tc rmf and g display an almost flat behaviour for most of their range of variation and start to decrease significantly toward the boundaries of the range this means that the interplay among the parameters has a major role in determining the likelihood rather than the variation of the single parameter beven and freer 2001 the multi objective model conditioning based on fsca data has a different impact on the parameter distributions depending on the considered parameter cmf is the parameter mostly affected by the further constrain imposed by fsca data fig 4a concerning the other posterior parameter distributions shown in fig 4 the effect of using modis fsca as additional data is not as clear as cmf pcf posterior distribution fig 4d almost does not show any differences with respect to the prior distribution while a slight better parameter identifiability is observed for the parameters albs tc rmf and g fig 4b fig 4c fig 4e fig 4f 3 3 streamflow and fsca prediction uncertainty range the prior and posterior likelihood weighted cumulative distributions estimated as described in sect 2 are here used to simulate the 5 95 percentile prediction uncertainty range for both hourly streamflow and daily fsca we remind that prior distribution was obtained by conditioning the model using only meran merano streamflow data while posterior distributions was derived from multi objective conditioning using modis fsca data over the same basin the comparison between available observations and predictive uncertainty ranges is summarised in fig 5 where for easiness of visualization the overall time window is split into three sub periods ranging from march 01 to august 31 for 2015 2016 and 2017 years we concentrated our attention on the period from march to august of every year since snowmelt occur mostly in these months as confirmed by the observed fsca time series fig 5a1 3 which range from about 0 8 at beginning of march to about 0 05 at the beginning of august for every year dark grey bands in fig 5a1 3 represent the predictive uncertainty range related to the prior distribution meaning that the hydrological modelling including simulation of fsca was conditioned only based on observed streamflow data at the meran merano gauging station the predictive uncertainty range includes most of the available modis related fsca observations which we remind are not available continuously in time due to cloud cover issues see sect 2 the uncertainty range of fsca derived from prior information is relatively large up to 0 5 during the spring snowmelt season e g april 2016 as expected the multi objective conditioning leads to a narrower predictive uncertainty range light grey band over the entire melting season particularly from march to may i e during the onset of the snowmelt season at the end of the melting season the simulated predictive uncertainty range regardless if estimated using prior or posterior distributions tends to slightly underestimate modis based fsca across the different years especially on 2017 the driest year of the considered sample streamflow predictive uncertainty ranges are shown in fig 5b1 3 and fig 5c1 3 for meran merano and pfelders plan gauging stations respectively similarly to the case of fsca both prior dark grey and posterior light grey uncertainty ranges are presented in general higher streamflow values are associated with larger uncertainty ranges due to the interaction among the different perturbed rainfall runoff and snow related parameters visual inspection reveals that the larger shrink of the predictive uncertainty bounds occurs during the spring summer 2015 while during years 2016 and 2017 the difference between prior and posterior distribution is less evident and mostly occurring on june we attribute this to the presence of a very wet winter season in 2014 2015 fig 2a that leads to a persisting snowmelt control on the hydrological regime over spring and summer 2015 accordingly average sh values reported in table 4 highlight the ability of multi objective conditioning in reducing the predictive uncertainty band at both locations in particular streamflow mean sh estimated at meran merano hydrometric station is 0 11 while at pfelders plan is 0 17 a more detailed discussion on this is provided in section 4 fig 6 shows the temporal evolution of sh time series at both gauging stations in general sh is positive i e posterior uncertainty range is narrower than prior one but some periods display a sharpness lower than 0 meaning that in such periods the multi objective failed in improving the sharpness of the prediction the reliability of the predictive streamflow uncertainty range was assessed through the containing ratio index table 5 cr relative to prior distribution is 0 54 at meran merano and 0 73 at pfelders plan considering the case in which modis related sca data are used posterior distribution cr is still 0 54 at meran merano while slightly decreases to the value of 0 65 at pfelders plan moreover we estimated the containing ratio focusing only on the sub periods with positive sharpness this aims to assess that the narrower uncertainty band of the posterior streamflow distribution does not lead to a failure in reliability cr at meran merano is 0 46 resulting in a reduction of about 10 compared with the posterior cr estimated throughout the simulated period at pfelders plan site cr is 0 59 showing a reduction of about 5 with respect to the previous cr confirming that the sharper streamflow posterior uncertainty obtained through the multi objective approach does not imply any significant drop in simulation reliability 4 discussion 4 1 identification of thresholds for defining behavioural simulations likelihood measures and their associated thresholds used to identify behavioural simulations are a subjective choice of the modeller teweldebrhan et al 2018 shafii et al 2014 franks et al 1998 as reported in sect 2 we used nash sutcliffe efficiency index for both streamflow and fsca variables while nse is an efficiency metric typically used in hydrology to evaluate the goodness of fit between simulated and observed streamflow the same consideration does not hold for fsca products indeed most of the studies adopted root mean square error rmse as objective function when dealing with snow cover area see e g duethmann et al 2014 notarnicola et al 2013b parajka and blöschl 2008b even though nse was already used as evaluation metric for fsca udnæs et al 2007 pellicciotti et al 2012 in the present work we tested a three different objective functions to estimate fsca likelihood namely nse rmse and klinge gupta efficiency index kge gupta et al 2009 among these three metrics we found nse as the best likelihood for updating the prior distribution since it has shown relatively higher variability in the range of simulated efficiencies with respect to rmse and kge results not shown for the sake of brevity in this sense nse fsca was more effective for a better identification of the combined posterior likelihood see eqn 4 we are aware that nse index may overrate modelling performance of seasonal time series such as fsca see e g gupta et al 2009 however in this study we are not interested in evaluating topmelt skills already proven by other studies di marco et al 2020 zaramella et al 2019 our aim is rather to select a likelihood measure for fsca leading to the best possible identification of the posterior likelihood nse fsca fits this purpose better than any other likelihood functions tested concerning the threshold values we opted for the median of simulated nse fsca after several tests despite the range of variability of simulated nse fsca was larger than either rmse and kge cases such range was still relatively narrow nse fsca standard deviation equal to 0 125 thus the identification of a large threshold value would have made useless the estimation of the posterior likelihood i e only few retained runs on the contrary a small threshold value would have led to a poor identification of the posterior and as a consequence to a negligible reduction of streamflow predictive uncertainty moreover no existing guidelines on how to select fsca threshold are proposed in literature to the best of our knowledge however it should be noted that defining a likelihood threshold to identify acceptable models based on the distribution of such likelihood i e the median likelihood was recently prosed massmann 2020 in that work the authors compare multiple hydrological models in terms of streamflow simulation with a specific likelihood threshold set in order to retain behaviorals of every model regardless the absolute value of such likelihood threshold the threshold value for streamflow was fixed equal to nse q 0 5 fig 3 according to moriasi et al 2007 to select acceptable model performance however we also tested the sensitivity of the results to nse q threshold by investigating the additional cases of nse q 0 4 and nse q 0 6 table 5 shows the cr values using different nse q thresholds at both meran merano and pfelders plan sub catchments the lower the nse q threshold the higher the cr as a consequence of the increased number of retained behavioural simulations increases which in turn leads to a larger prediction uncertainty band for streamflow at both locations however we notice how changing nse q threshold does not affect significantly the magnitude of cr variations at both locations see table 6 this result is in accordance with other studies showing that a small variation in the threshold value did not lead to significantly different uncertainty bounds prediction shafii et al 2014 lamb et al 1998 we remark that the pareto plot shown in fig 3 is seldom reported in the literature despite the valuable information it provides i e modis fsca might be a very good additional data to be used in a multi objective framework to reduce equifinality issue because of the very positive feedback with streamflow to the author s knowledge only duethmann et al 2014 plotted the likelihoods of fsca and streamflow resulting from a montecarlo based procedure we believe this is mostly related to the potentially unaffordable computational costs related to the simulation of the fsca ensemble required this need is hardly met by physically based snow models and not surprisingly duethmann et al 2014 used a temperature index approach for snowmelt modelling the snow model exploited in this work topmelt was conceived to balancing model structure complexity i e it is more detailed than a degree day model and computational requirements thus it represents an ideal tool to perform computationally intensive modelling accordingly topmelt was already successfully applied in montecarlo like framework to quantify predicted fsca uncertainty di marco et al 2020 4 2 improved model identifiability using multi objective conditioning pareto fronts reported in fig 3 show a clear positive feedback between streamflow and fsca simulations suggesting that satellite derived fsca maps are a suitable product to inform the hydrological model this agrees with previous findings using both modis and avhrr retrievals finger et al 2015 duethmann et al 2014 roy et al 2010 parajka and blöschl 2008b however only duethmann et al 2014 reported a pareto front between fsca and streamflow concluding that a good performance in terms of fsca does not preclude a good simulation of discharge moreover such positive feedback indicates that the model conceptualization adopted allows a consistent simulation of both the response variables see e g piccolroaz et al 2015 different approaches for exploiting satellite derived sca maps are present in the literature where simulated and observed sca are compared either at the level of the individual elevation band duethmann et al 2014 parajka and blöschl 2008b or even at pixel scale roy et al 2010 shrestha et al 2014 in this work we rely on a simpler approach considering the fraction of snow cover area to the total drainage basin which has been already proven to be effective in the context of a multi objective calibration teweldebrhan et al 2018 finger et al 2015 multi objective conditioning based on the use of whole sca map information might be addressed in future works for instance to correct snowfall distribution at catchment scale as suggested by shrestha et al 2014 however in this paper our main goal is to assess the potential of combining modis sca maps and streamflow records to better quantify model predictive uncertainty for gauged basins and for ungauged basins where parameter distributions are transposed from gauged basins this might be especially useful at ungauged sites thus providing the ground for a relatively easy way to implement a suitable framework for operational uses e g in the context of short term streamflow forecasting for hydropower exploitation concerning the parameter identifiability fig 4 depicts the comparison between prior and posterior snow related parameter distributions a clear improved identifiability of the combined melt factor cmf parameter is obtained by constraining the model parameters with the additional modis fsca data fig 4a while the other parameters do not show the same appreciable variation we attribute this latter observation to the use of an aggregated efficiency metric the fractional sca to condition the hydrological model using more accurate indexes such as accounting for different elevation bands parajka and blöschl 2008b might have led to a better parameter identifiability for the other parameters of topmelt module e g rainfall snowfall threshold temperature tc or fresh snow albedo however accounting for different elevation bands to evaluate model performance is not straightforward as pointed out by duethmann et al 2014 furthermore developing an even more sophisticated pixel based evaluation criterion would have implied to store the overall sca maps instead of one scalar number i e the fsca leading to computational constrain which would have limited the number of monte carlo simulation within the glue procedure the posterior distribution of cmf is more positively skewed than the prior one with a peak around 0 018 mm m2 mj 1m 2h 1 larger cmf values are penalized in the posterior distribution likely because they would have led to unphysically fast snowmelt therefore runs with larger cmf are associated with smaller values of the combined likelihood and they fall in the tails of the empirical cumulative likelihood weighted posterior distribution in terms of predictive uncertainty range reduction this effect is evident by looking at the fsca and streamflow time series relative to spring summer 2015 fig 5a1 fig 5b1 and fig 5c1 the year it snowed the most within the considered dataset see fig 2a visual inspection of streamflow predictive uncertainty bounds i e 5 95 percentiles range reveals that the reduction in the uncertainty band mostly occur during periods with high streamflow in spring and low streamflow in summer concerning spring the better identifiability of the cmf parameter due to the multi objective approach reduces the spring streamflow uncertainty mainly by preventing early snow melt due to high cmf values accordingly the reduced low summer streamflow uncertainty is associated with high cmf values because a decrease of summer runoff is related to an enhanced reduction of the accumulated snow mantle during spring concerning fsca the posterior distribution is sharper and more reliable compared with the prior one simulated fsca tends to underestimate modis based fsca on late june however satellite derived estimates of sca at the end of the melting season are known to be less accurate mainly because of cloud snow misclassification notarnicola et al 2013b and dirty patchy snowpack parajka and blöschl 2008a rittger et al 2013 hamper an optimal snow detection by modis leading to a general overestimation of the actual sca fig 6 shows the sharpness time series estimated at meran merano and pfelders plan gauging stations the green line highlights the periods when sh is 0 as well as the posterior uncertainty band includes the observation here we focus our attention on meran merano location since that was the gauging station adopted for constraining model parameters during most of the investigated time period sh is 0 with an average value of 0 11 thus indicating that predictive uncertainty ranges of the posterior distribution is narrower than the prior when sh is 0 the cr at meran merano is 0 46 table 5 slightly lower than the cr value provided by the posterior and prior distributions throughout the whole period both cr equal to 0 54 this proves that the uncertainty estimation adding modis fsca is sharper than that performed using solely streamflow and it is still reliable since the cr does not show a significant drop related to the shrink of the uncertainty streamflow band nonetheless through the simulated period mostly during april and the end of summer a negative sharpness occasionally occurs meaning that the posterior uncertainty range is wider than the prior and therefore no shrink of the predictive uncertainty occurs this might be related to the aggregated metric used i e the fractional snow cover area which in some periods may not be completely informative indeed besides fsca also ground based snow measurements might be used to inform hydrological models and reducing their uncertainty however point scale snow depth observations have limited spatial representativeness scipión et al 2013 thirel et al 2013 grünewald et al 2010 making challenging their use to represent snow dynamics at the catchment scale unless a dense station network is present however some periods with negative sharpness are somehow expected when dealing with multi objective framework as reported by efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 within its review paper on multi objective approaches finally we estimated the predictive uncertainty for another variable i e the mean areal snow water equivalent swe fig 7 a shows the predictive uncertainty of the mean areal swe of the whole catchment closed at meran merano gauging station the shrinking of the uncertainty band is in this case evident and occurs throughout all the period of investigation with an average sharpness value of 0 32 table 3 reliability was not estimated since scarce swe records are available but it is still worth noting the potential of using modis fsca data to obtain sharper uncertainty predictions of swe a key state variable for water resource strategy planning e g for seasonal hydroelectric reservoir management not often taking into account in uncertainty estimation analysis jobst et al 2018 4 3 validation of uncertainty estimation procedure at internal sites model conditioning was performed using streamflow recorded at the meran merano outlet section combined with modis based fsca those data are representative of the dynamics of the whole catchment therefore evaluating reliability and sharpness of the uncertainty prediction at upstream nested sub catchments can represent a valuable way to validate the robustness of the proposed approach since sub catchment streamflow data were not involved in the parameter estimation procedure available data at pfelders plan gauging station perfectly fit this objective fig 6b shows the daily streamflow sharpness estimated at pfelders plan sharpness is 0 for most of the simulation time thus supporting the idea that the addition of modis fsca data can reduce the predictive streamflow uncertainty also at locations different from that used in the conditioning procedure overall the mean sh value at pfelders plan is 0 17 table 4 slightly greater than the value obtained at meran merano sh 0 11 on average the reduction of the streamflow uncertainty is relatively small yet not negligible since it can rise to 0 50 at meran merano and 0 64 at pfelders plan table 4 the uncertainty reduction found at pfelders plan does not lead to a significant drop in simulated streamflow reliability as proven by the cr statistics for pfelders plan reported in table 5 in the case of prior distribution cr is equal to 0 73 while it decreases only down to 0 65 when considering the posterior distribution in particular when only the period with positive sharpness is considered cr equals 0 59 therefore cr values demonstrate a reasonably good capability of the model to reproduce streamflow at pfelders plan location which data we remind were not involved in the model conditioning the slightly larger sharpness and cr with respect to meran merano station case suggest that modis related sca maps are more informative at pfelders plan because snow dynamics plays a major role in this sub catchment due to its higher altitude seasonal peak of swe is indeed higher over the basin closed at pfelders plan than for the meran merano basin throughout the whole simulation period fig 7 moreover fig 2 shows the monthly observed median flow at meran merano and pfelders plan hydrometric stations the latter one displays a larger difference between winter low flows and spring high flows suggesting therefore a larger contribution of snowmelt runoff in shaping the hydrograph according to schaefli et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge this is the first work presenting a spatial validation for a multi objective uncertainty assessment showing that better results are obtained at the validation site of pfelders plan rather than at the calibration site of meran merano this finding suggests that the proposed procedure may be more effective with increasing the altitude of concerned catchment finally we also investigated the predictive uncertainty bounds of swe a key variable to plan seasonal management of hydropower reservoirs in the region yet not estimated together with streamflow in uncertainty analysis fig 7 reports a comparison between the simulated time series of the mean areal swe over pfelders plan and meran merano sub catchments at pfelders plan the average sharpness is 0 30 similar to the value estimated at meran merano sh 0 32 thus supporting our idea that the multi objective approach using modis related products shows a good potential in inferring predictive swe uncertainty reduction across the catchment no reliability analysis was performed due to lack of measurements 5 conclusions with this work we aim to evaluate a multi objective parameter estimation framework which exploits modis based snow cover maps to reduce predictive streamflow uncertainty in snow dominated catchments we performed this analysis over an alpine catchment equipped with two hydrometric stations one at the outlet of the main basin meran merano and one internal located upstream pfelders plan the streamflow recorded at the outlet section was used to constrain the model parameters in order to build the prior distribution then the posterior parameter distribution was obtained by using a multi objective conditioning i e by exploiting the modis based fractional snow covered area fsca as additional data streamflow data observed at the upstream internal station were used to spatially validate the model conditioning carried out using the overall catchment data i e streamflow and satellite based fsca for the parent main basin applying the glue framework with the joint use of streamflow and fsca data arises computational issues mainly because a large ensemble of fsca is required topmelt snow model fits perfectly this need thank to its parsimonious approach as well as its capability of simulating the snow water equivalent spatial distribution and in turn sca results showed that using modis based fsca to further condition the model parameters enhances the parameters identifiability especially in the case of the combined melt factor cmf and this in turn leads to a reliable and generally sharper uncertainty prediction of the streamflow with respect to the case in which only streamflow observations are used sharper predicted uncertainty ranges for streamflow was found at the upstream pfelders plan hydrometric station with respect to meran merano suggesting a promising application of the current multi objective approach whenever it is of interest to infer the streamflow uncertainty range at ungauged locations moreover we investigated the predictive uncertainty band of the mean areal swe sca maps proved themselves to provide valuable information to reduce significantly the predicted swe uncertainty range at both meran merano and pfelders plan sites the reliability of such sharper prediction was not assessed since only few direct swe observations were available finally the described procedure can be easily extended to other catchments and it is not model dependent i e any hydrological model able to estimate the fractional snow cover area can be in principle used an extended temperature index model would be ideal due the balance between model complexity and computational efficiency further work might concern the exploitation of the overall spatial information of the snow cover maps rather than the aggregated fractional snow cover perhaps considering also sentinel or landsat products along with modis introducing snow ground measurements to constrain snow related model parameters might lead to a better parameter identifiability

4451,this work introduces a general multi objective parameter estimation framework to exploit modis based snow cover maps to reduce predictive streamflow uncertainty in snow dominated catchments the well known glue methodology is applied with a multi objective approach combining streamflow observations recorded at the outlet section and satellite derived snow cover maps aggregated to fractional values of the catchment area the hydrological model used in this study includes a snowpack routine which exploits a statistical representation of the distribution of clear sky potential solar radiation a significant advantage when parameter sensitivity and uncertainty estimation procedures are carried out the study provides an assessment of this approach based on operational quality data from two medium size mountainous basins a nested one included in a larger parent basin located in the eastern italian alps the nested basin is considered as ungauged thus allowing a spatial assessment of the multi objective approach results show a positive feedback between streamflow and snow cover area likelihoods highlighted by means of the pareto plot moreover a better identifiability of the parameters driving snowmelt rate is found and consequently a shrink of the predictive streamflow uncertainty is observed a containing ratio of 0 54 and a mean sharpness of 0 11 are found at the outlet of the parent basin while a containing ratio equal to 0 65 and a mean sharpness equal to 0 17 are estimated at the nested basin used as a validation test these results confirm the potential of modis snow cover maps as additional data to inform hydrological models leading to more reliable and sharper streamflow simulations this approach might be also appealing when streamflow simulations are required for ungauged basins keywords uncertainty analysis modis snow cover maps multiobjective parameter estimation snow hydrology hydrological modelling 1 introduction hydrological models play a key role for supporting the development of efficient water resources planning management and adaptation strategies indeed they can provide valuable information to better address issues related to e g natural hazards such as floods and droughts sene 2010 competing water uses bellin et al 2016 and hydropower energy production majone et al 2016 wagner et al 2017 in snow dominated catchments hydrological modelling reliability also depends on the capability of simulating snow accumulation and melting valéry et al 2014 warscher et al 2013 since snow dynamics strongly affects floods förster et al 2014 as well as both seasonal and annual runoff regimes mazouz et al 2012 moreover hydrological models output usually depends on several parameters accurate parameter estimation might be challenging because of the well known equifinality issue beven 2006 turning into potentially unreliable parameter estimates out of the model calibration period starting with the pioneering works of duan et al 1992 and gupta et al 1998 it was clear the need to consider the inherent multi objective nature of the inference problem to quantify and reduce the uncertainty related to model parameter estimation several methods address the issue of multi objective parameter estimation as thoroughly described by madsen 2003 among the different approaches multi variable methods revealed their utility in improving parameter identifiability and model prediction capabilities see efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 the main benefit of the multi objective approach is an improved identification of the hydrological model which in principle allows a good reproduction of the variable of interest typically streamflow without introducing large biases in the simulation of the other components of the hydrological cycle wagener et al 2001 such methodology proved to be effective also in snow dominated catchments where streamflow records and snow related observations e g ground or satellite data are used simultaneously snow related observations have been typically used for improving the performances of hydrological models through calibration experiments see e g tuo et al 2018 shrestha et al 2014 roy et al 2010 parajka and blöschl 2008b among the different types of snow related measurements satellite derived snow cover data have been increasingly used to improve runoff estimates parajka and blöschl 2008b parajka et al 2012 shrestha et al 2014 riboust et al 2019 as well as joint streamflow and snow water equivalent predictions stigter et al 2017 in this context the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer hereinafter referred as modis snow cover maps represent a valuable information due to their high temporal i e 1 day and spatial resolution i e 500 m according to the standard nasa products modis snow cover area sca maps accuracy was extensively validated across different areas by comparison with in situ snow depth observations parajka and bloschl 2006 notarnicola et al 2013b di marco et al 2020 and other satellite derived snow cover products such as landsat gascoin et al 2015 modis based sca and streamflow records were used jointly by teweldebrhan et al 2018 to perform uncertainty parameter estimation of a conceptual hydrological model however despite a better parameter identifiability the authors did not find any significant improvement in streamflow simulation other studies focused on the joint application of streamflow data and modis based sca retrievals though hydrological response uncertainty quantification combining such datasets did not receive adequate attention in the literature as reported by teweldebrhan et al 2018 finger et al 2015 used streamflow data modis sca and glacier mass balance records to improve the robustness of hbv model estimating model parameters within a montecarlo framework shrestha et al 2014 combined modis sca maps with streamflow to improve the spatial distribution of snowfall in a small size catchment and in turn the accuracy of the simulated streamflow a similar approach based on avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer retrievals was presented by duethmann et al 2014 to evaluate the benefit of using an increasing number of images within a multi objective model parameter estimation framework however none of the abovementioned studies focused on the explicit quantification of predicted streamflow uncertainty reduction or on the validation of the proposed modelling at nested sites within the catchments i e a spatial validation of the parameter estimation procedure we speculate that the scarce literature on combining satellite derived sca and streamflow data within an uncertainty framework might be caused by the large computational effort of such analysis indeed reproducing a massive number of model realizations for the variables of interest e g streamflow snow water equivalent swe and sca as required for a thorough uncertainty estimation analysis might be very expensive from a computational point of view this is especially true for spatially distributed variables such as swe which in turn leads to the sca quantification in this work we exploited the capabilities of topmelt zaramella et al 2019 a recently proposed extended temperature index model particularly suited for montecarlo based uncertainty analyses as shown by di marco et al 2020 comparing topmelt and modis based sca over an alpine catchment based on the abovementioned background we aim to introduce a general multi objective parameter estimation framework to exploit modis based sca maps to reduce predictive streamflow uncertainty in snow dominated catchments such framework is relatively easy to extend over different even data scarce regions we also provide a spatial validation of the proposed framework simulating streamflow in a nested sub catchment where streamflow data are available but not used in the parameter estimation phase finally we show how modis based sca information might be used to reduce swe predicted uncertainty even though it is acknowledged that a validation is not provided because of lack of data the paper is organized as follows sect 2 provides a short description of the adopted hydrological and snowpack models the case study area and the multi objective parameter estimation method main results are presented in sect 3 and further discussed in sect 4 finally sect 5 reports some concluding remarks 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrological and snowpack model the conceptual semi distributed hydrological model ichymod norbiato et al 2009 2008 was used to simulate hydrological fluxes at hourly time resolution ichymod exploits the runoff production module of the pdm rainfall runoff model moore 2007 1985 in which the so called probability distributed soil moisture storage a function that describes the spatial variability of the soil infiltration capacity is used to estimate the rainfall excess the pdm takes up water from rainfall and snowmelt and loses water by evapotranspiration and recharge to groundwater computed as a function of the soil water content through a power law relationship potential evapotranspiration is estimated by means of the hargreaves model direct runoff is routed to the outlet of the sub basin by means of a cascade of two linear reservoirs while baseflow is transferred downstream through the adoption of a nonlinear storage the well known muskingam cunge scheme is used to propagate the flow from each sub basin outlet along the river network the required meteorological inputs are hourly time series of precipitation and temperature snow accumulation and melting are computed by means of topmelt zaramella et al 2019 puspitarini et al 2020 scorpio et al 2020 model topmelt is a semi distributed snowpack model based on an extended temperature index approach capable to estimate the full spatial distribution of the swe at each time step the clear sky shortwave solar radiation is computed at each element of the digital terrain model dtm by taking into account shadow and complex topography calculating the apparent sun motion and the intersection of radiation with topography diffuse radiation is computed by accounting for self shading by slope and aspect and occlusions produced by the visible horizon with topmelt the catchment is divided into elevation bands and the full spatial distribution of clear sky potential solar radiation is discretised into a number of radiation classes for each elevation band the computation required to generate a spatially distributed water equivalent thus reduces to a single calculation for each radiation class ensuring a high computational efficiency the work by zaramella et al 2019 shows that aggregating radiation into ten classes for each elevation band has a minimal impact on model results compared to a distributed model therefore based on the spatial distribution of the clear sky solar radiation pixels included in each elevation band are grouped in ten radiation classes the snowmelt routine is applied to each radiation class in place of to each pixel during day dry hours the snowmelt rate fi j t mm h 1 for the i th elevation band the j th radiation class and at time t is computed as follows 1 f i j t c m f ri i j t 1 a l b s t m a x 0 t i t t b where cmf is the combined melting factor mm m2 c 1 mj 1 ri is the clear sky solar radiation mj m 2 h 1 and albs t is the snow albedo at the current time step t modelled as a function of the fresh snow albedo albs brock et al 2000 ti is the air temperature at the i th elevation band while tb is the temperature threshold above which snowmelt is assumed to occur both in c the model accounts for rain on snow and melt during night by means of a temperature index approach through two additional parameters the rain melt factor rmf and the night melt factor nmf respectively see zaramella et al 2019 for further details with topmelt air temperature is computed at each elevation band by assuming a linear temperature lapse rate estimated at hourly time step with a linear regression on the available temperature data to account for gauge catch deficiencies that occur during periods of snow precipitation data are corrected with a snow correction factor scf scf is set to the constant value of 1 4 after a sensitivity analysis and in agreement with previous works conducted over the upper adige river basin engel et al 2017 di marco et al 2020 for the analyses reported in this work the thiessen method was used to calculate the mean precipitation over the basin then the mean areal precipitation estimate was corrected with a precipitation correction factor pcf to account for poor spatial representativeness of the rain gages pcf is a dimensionless parameter acting as a multiplicative factor on the mean sub catchment precipitation moreover a lapse rate g is applied to distribute such mean areal precipitation over each elevation band estimation of the precipitation phase solid or liquid is therefore performed over each elevation band according to the threshold temperature tc the selection of the parameters involved in the uncertainty analysis among all those available in the pdm implementation see moore 2007 was performed on the basis of a preliminary sensitivity analysis conducted with the glue method beven and binley 1992 the list of the ten pdm topmelt calibration parameters adopted in the present study is presented in table 1 together with their respective ranges of variation 2 2 study area and data the analysis was performed over the passer passirio river basin 428 km2 one of the main tributaries of the adige river basin eastern italian alps fig 1 stergiadi et al 2020 with elevations ranging between 360 m a m s l and 3500 m a m s l two basins in the passer passirio river system were considered passer passirio river basin at meran 414 km2 and its sub basin plan river at pfelders plan 49 km2 precipitation and temperature data from nine weather stations table 2 as well as discharge data at the two outlet sections are available at hourly time step over the period selected for the study ranging from 01 10 2014 to 30 09 2017 the mean annual precipitation over the passer passirio river basin in the period of interest is about 1150 mm close to the long term annual average chiogna et al 2016 mallucci et al 2019 avesani et al 2021 precipitation mainly occurs in fall and summer fig 2 a as typically observed across the adige river basin laiti et al 2018 chiogna et al 2016 fig 2b and fig 2c show the monthly pattern of the hourly unit discharge at meran merano and pfelders plan respectively the hydrological regime is a typical snow dominated regime with a significant difference between winter low flows and spring high flows the hydrological model was applied to the passer passirio watershed by dividing the main basin in different sub catchments average size about 20 km2 over which hydrological properties are assumed to be uniform flow data from the plan river basin at pfelders plan were used to validate the robustness of our analysis at a location different from that selected during the model conditioning procedure accordingly the streamflow records of pfelders plan station were not involved in the parameter identification phase daily snow cover area maps were provided with a spatial resolution of 250x250m by eurac notarnicola et al 2013a 2013b this resolution is finer than the standard nasa modis snow products 500x500m and allows better snow detection at a local scale especially in harsh environments notarnicola et al 2013a where topography and land cover i e forests may prevent an optimal signal acquisition by modis simic et al 2004 engel et al 2017 moreover eurac products have been extensively tested in other studies conducted either in the eastern italian alps engel et al 2017 di marco et al 2020 and across europe thirel et al 2012 modis sca maps were processed to discard days with cloud coverage greater than a fixed fraction of the catchment area following finger et al 2015 we fixed this threshold value at 10 of the total passer passirio catchment area i e about 41 km2 moreover we discarded modis maps during the period from july to september since fractional sca was negligible and limited to high elevation portions of the watershed where modis products is known to be less reliable mainly because of cloud misclassifications and patchy snow covered area parajka and blöschl 2008a notarnicola et al 2013b as a result a discontinuous time series of 187 days of snow cover area maps was made available as an input for the multi objective parameter estimation method see sect 2 following duethmann et al 2014 we assumed that the presence of gaps in the data did not affect the multi objective uncertainty analysis procedure a good consistency between topmelt outputs and modis based sca was found by di marco et al 2020 either in terms of fractional snow covered area fsca i e the percentage of the overall catchment area covered by snow based on either modis maps or simulated spatial distributions of snowpack and sca spatial distribution carried out on a sub catchment of the upper adige river basin which includes the passer passirio tributary area following that work we estimated topmelt fsca taking advantage of the distributed structure of the snowpack model which allows to estimate the fractional snow covered area as the ratio between the area with swe greater than a fixed threshold and the total area of the catchment such threshold was set equal to 5 mm swe moreover it has to be specified that topmelt works at hourly time step while modis maps are available on a daily basis therefore daily time series of topmelt fsca were estimated averaging the original hourly simulations 2 3 uncertainty estimation methodology 2 3 1 selection of behavioural simulations with the glue approach model parameters uncertainty estimation was performed using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation i e the glue methodology beven 2006 glue relies on the generation of a high number of independent model realizations i e monte carlo simulations each associated with a specific parametrization and a likelihood measure the selection of both the likelihood measure and the cutoff threshold separating behavioral from non behavioral simulations is a subjective choice of the modeler blasone et al 2008 jin et al 2010 furthermore the procedure is not meant to find a single optimum configuration yet a set of acceptable models efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 brazier et al 2000 according with the abovementioned concept of equifinality accordingly first of all we performed a random sampling from the parameter space by means of latin hypercube sampling scheme mckay et al 1979 assuming a uniform distribution for every parameter listed in table 1 since we did not have any a priori information about the parameter distribution we considered each parameter set as equally likely see e g gan et al 2018 teweldebrhan et al 2018 to this end a sample of 10 000 different parameter sets was generated each associated with a likelihood measure for the evaluation of the modelling efficiency behavioural parametrizations were then identified based on suitable thresholds simulations producing likelihood measures below the identified thresholds were considered not behavioural and their likelihoods were set equal to 0 the likelihoods associated with the retained simulations i e behavioral parameter set were rescaled so that their cumulative total is one with the resulting probability density function representing our new knowledge about the model parameters moreover in order to estimate the predictive uncertainty bounds of the simulated variables e g streamflow the behavioural runs were ranked according to the magnitude of the rescaled likelihood measure producing the empirical cumulative likelihood weighted distribution efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 brazier et al 2000 franks et al 1998 the uncertainty range is given by such cumulative distribution neglecting the tails identified with the quantiles 5 and 95 teweldebrhan et al 2018 as likelihood measure for both streamflow and fsca variables we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 index the streamflow nse is computed as follows 2 n s e q 1 t 1 n q sim t q obs t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs m e a n 2 while the fractional sca nse assumes the following form 3 n s e f s c a 1 t 1 n fsca sim t fsca modis t 2 t 1 n fsca modis t fsca modis m e a n 2 where t is the current time step qsim and qobs are the simulated and observed streamflow time series respectively qobs mean is the mean observed streamflow fscasim and fscaobs are the simulated and modis based fractional snow covered area time series respectively and fscamodis mean is the modis based averaged fractional snow covered area finally n is the total number of time steps following moriasi et al 2007 the threshold for the identification of behavioural streamflow simulations was set at 0 5 the selection of the threshold value for nse fsca deserves an in depth discussion that is provided in sect 4 1 here it is worth noting that the value was fixed equal to the median of the simulated nse fsca values resulting in a nse fsca 0 67 2 3 2 multi objective parameters estimation multi objective parameters estimation was carried out in two separate steps following an informal bayesian approach first streamflow measurements recorded at meran merano hydrometric gauging station i e the catchment outlet section were used to constrain model parameters the resulting distribution of the likelihood measures was assumed as informative of the prior information i e it defines our knowledge about the system before introducing the additional modis fsca data next the combined posterior likelihood distribution clh was estimated multiplying streamflow and fsca likelihoods eqn 2 and 3 and introducing a suitable rescaling factor c in order to obtain a combined probability distribution function see e g brazier et al 2000 franks et al 1998 among others this function represents the posterior parameter distribution 4 c l h p i q s c a 1 c l h q p i l h f s c a p i where pi is one of the parameter sets considered in the monte carlo sample sampling lh q pi is the streamflow likelihood i e the prior distribution lh fsca pi is the snow cover related likelihood obtained by comparing topmelt module outputs and modis fractional sca data finally c is a normalization constant introduced in order to have a unitary integral of clh i observed streamflow time series available at the pfelders plan gauging station were used only for the spatial validation of our approach and hence were not considered for model conditioning 2 4 metrics for uncertainty quantification we used two metrics to quantify the benefit of multi objective model conditioning over the mono criteria case i e the case in which only streamflow observations are exploited the first metric is the so called containing ratio cr teweldebrhan et al 2018 also known as reliability zhang et al 2008 defined as following 5 cr 1 n t 1 n i o t x s i m 0 05 t x s i m 0 95 t where t is the current time step n is the total number of time steps and o t xsim 0 05 t and xsim 0 95 t are respectively the observed variable i e streamflow or fsca and the prediction corresponding to the 0 05 and 0 95 percentiles i is a function that assumes the values of 1 if the simulated percentile range brackets the observation and 0 otherwise the second metric we adopted is the sharpness shafii et al 2014 zhang et al 2008 which allows to estimate the reduction of the prediction uncertainty range obtained by adding modis fsca data in the parameter constraining process sharpness sh is defined as 1 minus the ratio between the posterior uncertainty range of a given variable to the uncertainty range given by the prior distribution as reported in eqn 6 6 sh 1 c l h p i q f s c a lh q p i notice that a perfect model conditioning would lead to both cr and sh equal to 1 assuming a predicted posterior uncertainty range that asymptotically tends to 0 in other words with a perfect multi objective conditioning the predicted uncertainty band tends to 0 i e the simulated variable has no uncertainty accordingly such simulated variable would perfectly match the observation thus leading to cr equal to 1 3 results as specified in section 2 the parameters of the hydrological model were inferred by maximizing the likelihood measures at meran merano gauging station during the period from 01 10 2013 to 30 09 2017 the first year of the time series 01 10 2013 30 09 2014 was used as spin up period for the simulations and therefore was excluded from the computation of the efficiency metrics within the glue procedure model parameters were conditioned using only streamflow records at the catchment outlet meran merano station to identify a priori information then we applied the multi objective conditioning to infer posterior parameter distributions combining both streamflow observations at meran merano and fractional sca data relative to the overall catchment area finally prediction uncertainty of streamflow fsca and mean areal snow water equivalent swe were estimated either at meran merano and at pfelders plan basins using both prior and poster parameter distributions such approach allows to quantify to what extent the parametric uncertainty might be reduced because of the joint use of fsca and streamflow information we highlight that we consider the pfelders plan catchment as ungauged therefore it can be considered as a validation test for the proposed approach 3 1 behavioral simulations for each run of the overall monte carlo sample we computed likelihood values for both streamflow and fsca using streamflow records taken at meran merano stream gage and modis fsca relative to the overall passer passirio catchment the pareto fronts green dots in fig 3 obtained either at meran merano and pfelders plan locations are presented in fig 3 together with the entire set of dominated solutions i e solutions not belonging to the pareto front we remark again that fsca observations were not used for the identification of behavioural simulation i e a priori information but only for ensuing identification of posterior parameter distributions fig 3 highlights that for both sites a positive feedback between fsca and streamflow likelihoods is present in other words an increase of streamflow likelihood is not associated with a decrease of likelihood values for fsca as often observed in multi objective optimization problems yapo et al 1998 such positive feedback is even more evident at pfelders plan location where snow dynamics controls the hydrological regime more largely than at meran merano because of higher elevation and smaller drainage basin size 3 2 prior and posterior parameter distributions prior i e model conditioning conducted using only meran merano streamflow data and posterior distributions for each model parameter are shown in fig 4 it is worth noting that in the figure we report only the comparison for topmelt module parameters since the parameter distributions relative to the rainfall runoff module did not show any appreciable variation this result is expected since multi objective model conditioning is performed using fsca as additional data therefore it seems reasonable that the further constrain on model parameters acts only in snow related parameters visual inspection of prior parameter distributions blue lines in fig 4 evidences that combined melting factor cmf and precipitation correction factor pcf are the most sensitive parameters i e their likelihood distributions vary significantly depending on the parameter value both parameters are related with the streamflow generation in a straightforward manner since snowmelt is linearly dependent to cmf through eq 1 and pcf is a multiplier of the estimated precipitation values introduced in order to compensate poor spatial representativeness of rain gages not surprisingly for pcf values far from 1 the likelihood shows a sharp decrease suggesting that precipitation estimates requires only a slight adjustment in this case study we double checked the reliability of available meteorological data estimating the runoff coefficient i e the ratio of the total annual runoff over the total annual precipitation for several hydrological years and the analysis confirmed that pcf optimal value is coherently close to 1 posterior parameters distribution for albs tc rmf and g display an almost flat behaviour for most of their range of variation and start to decrease significantly toward the boundaries of the range this means that the interplay among the parameters has a major role in determining the likelihood rather than the variation of the single parameter beven and freer 2001 the multi objective model conditioning based on fsca data has a different impact on the parameter distributions depending on the considered parameter cmf is the parameter mostly affected by the further constrain imposed by fsca data fig 4a concerning the other posterior parameter distributions shown in fig 4 the effect of using modis fsca as additional data is not as clear as cmf pcf posterior distribution fig 4d almost does not show any differences with respect to the prior distribution while a slight better parameter identifiability is observed for the parameters albs tc rmf and g fig 4b fig 4c fig 4e fig 4f 3 3 streamflow and fsca prediction uncertainty range the prior and posterior likelihood weighted cumulative distributions estimated as described in sect 2 are here used to simulate the 5 95 percentile prediction uncertainty range for both hourly streamflow and daily fsca we remind that prior distribution was obtained by conditioning the model using only meran merano streamflow data while posterior distributions was derived from multi objective conditioning using modis fsca data over the same basin the comparison between available observations and predictive uncertainty ranges is summarised in fig 5 where for easiness of visualization the overall time window is split into three sub periods ranging from march 01 to august 31 for 2015 2016 and 2017 years we concentrated our attention on the period from march to august of every year since snowmelt occur mostly in these months as confirmed by the observed fsca time series fig 5a1 3 which range from about 0 8 at beginning of march to about 0 05 at the beginning of august for every year dark grey bands in fig 5a1 3 represent the predictive uncertainty range related to the prior distribution meaning that the hydrological modelling including simulation of fsca was conditioned only based on observed streamflow data at the meran merano gauging station the predictive uncertainty range includes most of the available modis related fsca observations which we remind are not available continuously in time due to cloud cover issues see sect 2 the uncertainty range of fsca derived from prior information is relatively large up to 0 5 during the spring snowmelt season e g april 2016 as expected the multi objective conditioning leads to a narrower predictive uncertainty range light grey band over the entire melting season particularly from march to may i e during the onset of the snowmelt season at the end of the melting season the simulated predictive uncertainty range regardless if estimated using prior or posterior distributions tends to slightly underestimate modis based fsca across the different years especially on 2017 the driest year of the considered sample streamflow predictive uncertainty ranges are shown in fig 5b1 3 and fig 5c1 3 for meran merano and pfelders plan gauging stations respectively similarly to the case of fsca both prior dark grey and posterior light grey uncertainty ranges are presented in general higher streamflow values are associated with larger uncertainty ranges due to the interaction among the different perturbed rainfall runoff and snow related parameters visual inspection reveals that the larger shrink of the predictive uncertainty bounds occurs during the spring summer 2015 while during years 2016 and 2017 the difference between prior and posterior distribution is less evident and mostly occurring on june we attribute this to the presence of a very wet winter season in 2014 2015 fig 2a that leads to a persisting snowmelt control on the hydrological regime over spring and summer 2015 accordingly average sh values reported in table 4 highlight the ability of multi objective conditioning in reducing the predictive uncertainty band at both locations in particular streamflow mean sh estimated at meran merano hydrometric station is 0 11 while at pfelders plan is 0 17 a more detailed discussion on this is provided in section 4 fig 6 shows the temporal evolution of sh time series at both gauging stations in general sh is positive i e posterior uncertainty range is narrower than prior one but some periods display a sharpness lower than 0 meaning that in such periods the multi objective failed in improving the sharpness of the prediction the reliability of the predictive streamflow uncertainty range was assessed through the containing ratio index table 5 cr relative to prior distribution is 0 54 at meran merano and 0 73 at pfelders plan considering the case in which modis related sca data are used posterior distribution cr is still 0 54 at meran merano while slightly decreases to the value of 0 65 at pfelders plan moreover we estimated the containing ratio focusing only on the sub periods with positive sharpness this aims to assess that the narrower uncertainty band of the posterior streamflow distribution does not lead to a failure in reliability cr at meran merano is 0 46 resulting in a reduction of about 10 compared with the posterior cr estimated throughout the simulated period at pfelders plan site cr is 0 59 showing a reduction of about 5 with respect to the previous cr confirming that the sharper streamflow posterior uncertainty obtained through the multi objective approach does not imply any significant drop in simulation reliability 4 discussion 4 1 identification of thresholds for defining behavioural simulations likelihood measures and their associated thresholds used to identify behavioural simulations are a subjective choice of the modeller teweldebrhan et al 2018 shafii et al 2014 franks et al 1998 as reported in sect 2 we used nash sutcliffe efficiency index for both streamflow and fsca variables while nse is an efficiency metric typically used in hydrology to evaluate the goodness of fit between simulated and observed streamflow the same consideration does not hold for fsca products indeed most of the studies adopted root mean square error rmse as objective function when dealing with snow cover area see e g duethmann et al 2014 notarnicola et al 2013b parajka and blöschl 2008b even though nse was already used as evaluation metric for fsca udnæs et al 2007 pellicciotti et al 2012 in the present work we tested a three different objective functions to estimate fsca likelihood namely nse rmse and klinge gupta efficiency index kge gupta et al 2009 among these three metrics we found nse as the best likelihood for updating the prior distribution since it has shown relatively higher variability in the range of simulated efficiencies with respect to rmse and kge results not shown for the sake of brevity in this sense nse fsca was more effective for a better identification of the combined posterior likelihood see eqn 4 we are aware that nse index may overrate modelling performance of seasonal time series such as fsca see e g gupta et al 2009 however in this study we are not interested in evaluating topmelt skills already proven by other studies di marco et al 2020 zaramella et al 2019 our aim is rather to select a likelihood measure for fsca leading to the best possible identification of the posterior likelihood nse fsca fits this purpose better than any other likelihood functions tested concerning the threshold values we opted for the median of simulated nse fsca after several tests despite the range of variability of simulated nse fsca was larger than either rmse and kge cases such range was still relatively narrow nse fsca standard deviation equal to 0 125 thus the identification of a large threshold value would have made useless the estimation of the posterior likelihood i e only few retained runs on the contrary a small threshold value would have led to a poor identification of the posterior and as a consequence to a negligible reduction of streamflow predictive uncertainty moreover no existing guidelines on how to select fsca threshold are proposed in literature to the best of our knowledge however it should be noted that defining a likelihood threshold to identify acceptable models based on the distribution of such likelihood i e the median likelihood was recently prosed massmann 2020 in that work the authors compare multiple hydrological models in terms of streamflow simulation with a specific likelihood threshold set in order to retain behaviorals of every model regardless the absolute value of such likelihood threshold the threshold value for streamflow was fixed equal to nse q 0 5 fig 3 according to moriasi et al 2007 to select acceptable model performance however we also tested the sensitivity of the results to nse q threshold by investigating the additional cases of nse q 0 4 and nse q 0 6 table 5 shows the cr values using different nse q thresholds at both meran merano and pfelders plan sub catchments the lower the nse q threshold the higher the cr as a consequence of the increased number of retained behavioural simulations increases which in turn leads to a larger prediction uncertainty band for streamflow at both locations however we notice how changing nse q threshold does not affect significantly the magnitude of cr variations at both locations see table 6 this result is in accordance with other studies showing that a small variation in the threshold value did not lead to significantly different uncertainty bounds prediction shafii et al 2014 lamb et al 1998 we remark that the pareto plot shown in fig 3 is seldom reported in the literature despite the valuable information it provides i e modis fsca might be a very good additional data to be used in a multi objective framework to reduce equifinality issue because of the very positive feedback with streamflow to the author s knowledge only duethmann et al 2014 plotted the likelihoods of fsca and streamflow resulting from a montecarlo based procedure we believe this is mostly related to the potentially unaffordable computational costs related to the simulation of the fsca ensemble required this need is hardly met by physically based snow models and not surprisingly duethmann et al 2014 used a temperature index approach for snowmelt modelling the snow model exploited in this work topmelt was conceived to balancing model structure complexity i e it is more detailed than a degree day model and computational requirements thus it represents an ideal tool to perform computationally intensive modelling accordingly topmelt was already successfully applied in montecarlo like framework to quantify predicted fsca uncertainty di marco et al 2020 4 2 improved model identifiability using multi objective conditioning pareto fronts reported in fig 3 show a clear positive feedback between streamflow and fsca simulations suggesting that satellite derived fsca maps are a suitable product to inform the hydrological model this agrees with previous findings using both modis and avhrr retrievals finger et al 2015 duethmann et al 2014 roy et al 2010 parajka and blöschl 2008b however only duethmann et al 2014 reported a pareto front between fsca and streamflow concluding that a good performance in terms of fsca does not preclude a good simulation of discharge moreover such positive feedback indicates that the model conceptualization adopted allows a consistent simulation of both the response variables see e g piccolroaz et al 2015 different approaches for exploiting satellite derived sca maps are present in the literature where simulated and observed sca are compared either at the level of the individual elevation band duethmann et al 2014 parajka and blöschl 2008b or even at pixel scale roy et al 2010 shrestha et al 2014 in this work we rely on a simpler approach considering the fraction of snow cover area to the total drainage basin which has been already proven to be effective in the context of a multi objective calibration teweldebrhan et al 2018 finger et al 2015 multi objective conditioning based on the use of whole sca map information might be addressed in future works for instance to correct snowfall distribution at catchment scale as suggested by shrestha et al 2014 however in this paper our main goal is to assess the potential of combining modis sca maps and streamflow records to better quantify model predictive uncertainty for gauged basins and for ungauged basins where parameter distributions are transposed from gauged basins this might be especially useful at ungauged sites thus providing the ground for a relatively easy way to implement a suitable framework for operational uses e g in the context of short term streamflow forecasting for hydropower exploitation concerning the parameter identifiability fig 4 depicts the comparison between prior and posterior snow related parameter distributions a clear improved identifiability of the combined melt factor cmf parameter is obtained by constraining the model parameters with the additional modis fsca data fig 4a while the other parameters do not show the same appreciable variation we attribute this latter observation to the use of an aggregated efficiency metric the fractional sca to condition the hydrological model using more accurate indexes such as accounting for different elevation bands parajka and blöschl 2008b might have led to a better parameter identifiability for the other parameters of topmelt module e g rainfall snowfall threshold temperature tc or fresh snow albedo however accounting for different elevation bands to evaluate model performance is not straightforward as pointed out by duethmann et al 2014 furthermore developing an even more sophisticated pixel based evaluation criterion would have implied to store the overall sca maps instead of one scalar number i e the fsca leading to computational constrain which would have limited the number of monte carlo simulation within the glue procedure the posterior distribution of cmf is more positively skewed than the prior one with a peak around 0 018 mm m2 mj 1m 2h 1 larger cmf values are penalized in the posterior distribution likely because they would have led to unphysically fast snowmelt therefore runs with larger cmf are associated with smaller values of the combined likelihood and they fall in the tails of the empirical cumulative likelihood weighted posterior distribution in terms of predictive uncertainty range reduction this effect is evident by looking at the fsca and streamflow time series relative to spring summer 2015 fig 5a1 fig 5b1 and fig 5c1 the year it snowed the most within the considered dataset see fig 2a visual inspection of streamflow predictive uncertainty bounds i e 5 95 percentiles range reveals that the reduction in the uncertainty band mostly occur during periods with high streamflow in spring and low streamflow in summer concerning spring the better identifiability of the cmf parameter due to the multi objective approach reduces the spring streamflow uncertainty mainly by preventing early snow melt due to high cmf values accordingly the reduced low summer streamflow uncertainty is associated with high cmf values because a decrease of summer runoff is related to an enhanced reduction of the accumulated snow mantle during spring concerning fsca the posterior distribution is sharper and more reliable compared with the prior one simulated fsca tends to underestimate modis based fsca on late june however satellite derived estimates of sca at the end of the melting season are known to be less accurate mainly because of cloud snow misclassification notarnicola et al 2013b and dirty patchy snowpack parajka and blöschl 2008a rittger et al 2013 hamper an optimal snow detection by modis leading to a general overestimation of the actual sca fig 6 shows the sharpness time series estimated at meran merano and pfelders plan gauging stations the green line highlights the periods when sh is 0 as well as the posterior uncertainty band includes the observation here we focus our attention on meran merano location since that was the gauging station adopted for constraining model parameters during most of the investigated time period sh is 0 with an average value of 0 11 thus indicating that predictive uncertainty ranges of the posterior distribution is narrower than the prior when sh is 0 the cr at meran merano is 0 46 table 5 slightly lower than the cr value provided by the posterior and prior distributions throughout the whole period both cr equal to 0 54 this proves that the uncertainty estimation adding modis fsca is sharper than that performed using solely streamflow and it is still reliable since the cr does not show a significant drop related to the shrink of the uncertainty streamflow band nonetheless through the simulated period mostly during april and the end of summer a negative sharpness occasionally occurs meaning that the posterior uncertainty range is wider than the prior and therefore no shrink of the predictive uncertainty occurs this might be related to the aggregated metric used i e the fractional snow cover area which in some periods may not be completely informative indeed besides fsca also ground based snow measurements might be used to inform hydrological models and reducing their uncertainty however point scale snow depth observations have limited spatial representativeness scipión et al 2013 thirel et al 2013 grünewald et al 2010 making challenging their use to represent snow dynamics at the catchment scale unless a dense station network is present however some periods with negative sharpness are somehow expected when dealing with multi objective framework as reported by efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 within its review paper on multi objective approaches finally we estimated the predictive uncertainty for another variable i e the mean areal snow water equivalent swe fig 7 a shows the predictive uncertainty of the mean areal swe of the whole catchment closed at meran merano gauging station the shrinking of the uncertainty band is in this case evident and occurs throughout all the period of investigation with an average sharpness value of 0 32 table 3 reliability was not estimated since scarce swe records are available but it is still worth noting the potential of using modis fsca data to obtain sharper uncertainty predictions of swe a key state variable for water resource strategy planning e g for seasonal hydroelectric reservoir management not often taking into account in uncertainty estimation analysis jobst et al 2018 4 3 validation of uncertainty estimation procedure at internal sites model conditioning was performed using streamflow recorded at the meran merano outlet section combined with modis based fsca those data are representative of the dynamics of the whole catchment therefore evaluating reliability and sharpness of the uncertainty prediction at upstream nested sub catchments can represent a valuable way to validate the robustness of the proposed approach since sub catchment streamflow data were not involved in the parameter estimation procedure available data at pfelders plan gauging station perfectly fit this objective fig 6b shows the daily streamflow sharpness estimated at pfelders plan sharpness is 0 for most of the simulation time thus supporting the idea that the addition of modis fsca data can reduce the predictive streamflow uncertainty also at locations different from that used in the conditioning procedure overall the mean sh value at pfelders plan is 0 17 table 4 slightly greater than the value obtained at meran merano sh 0 11 on average the reduction of the streamflow uncertainty is relatively small yet not negligible since it can rise to 0 50 at meran merano and 0 64 at pfelders plan table 4 the uncertainty reduction found at pfelders plan does not lead to a significant drop in simulated streamflow reliability as proven by the cr statistics for pfelders plan reported in table 5 in the case of prior distribution cr is equal to 0 73 while it decreases only down to 0 65 when considering the posterior distribution in particular when only the period with positive sharpness is considered cr equals 0 59 therefore cr values demonstrate a reasonably good capability of the model to reproduce streamflow at pfelders plan location which data we remind were not involved in the model conditioning the slightly larger sharpness and cr with respect to meran merano station case suggest that modis related sca maps are more informative at pfelders plan because snow dynamics plays a major role in this sub catchment due to its higher altitude seasonal peak of swe is indeed higher over the basin closed at pfelders plan than for the meran merano basin throughout the whole simulation period fig 7 moreover fig 2 shows the monthly observed median flow at meran merano and pfelders plan hydrometric stations the latter one displays a larger difference between winter low flows and spring high flows suggesting therefore a larger contribution of snowmelt runoff in shaping the hydrograph according to schaefli et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge this is the first work presenting a spatial validation for a multi objective uncertainty assessment showing that better results are obtained at the validation site of pfelders plan rather than at the calibration site of meran merano this finding suggests that the proposed procedure may be more effective with increasing the altitude of concerned catchment finally we also investigated the predictive uncertainty bounds of swe a key variable to plan seasonal management of hydropower reservoirs in the region yet not estimated together with streamflow in uncertainty analysis fig 7 reports a comparison between the simulated time series of the mean areal swe over pfelders plan and meran merano sub catchments at pfelders plan the average sharpness is 0 30 similar to the value estimated at meran merano sh 0 32 thus supporting our idea that the multi objective approach using modis related products shows a good potential in inferring predictive swe uncertainty reduction across the catchment no reliability analysis was performed due to lack of measurements 5 conclusions with this work we aim to evaluate a multi objective parameter estimation framework which exploits modis based snow cover maps to reduce predictive streamflow uncertainty in snow dominated catchments we performed this analysis over an alpine catchment equipped with two hydrometric stations one at the outlet of the main basin meran merano and one internal located upstream pfelders plan the streamflow recorded at the outlet section was used to constrain the model parameters in order to build the prior distribution then the posterior parameter distribution was obtained by using a multi objective conditioning i e by exploiting the modis based fractional snow covered area fsca as additional data streamflow data observed at the upstream internal station were used to spatially validate the model conditioning carried out using the overall catchment data i e streamflow and satellite based fsca for the parent main basin applying the glue framework with the joint use of streamflow and fsca data arises computational issues mainly because a large ensemble of fsca is required topmelt snow model fits perfectly this need thank to its parsimonious approach as well as its capability of simulating the snow water equivalent spatial distribution and in turn sca results showed that using modis based fsca to further condition the model parameters enhances the parameters identifiability especially in the case of the combined melt factor cmf and this in turn leads to a reliable and generally sharper uncertainty prediction of the streamflow with respect to the case in which only streamflow observations are used sharper predicted uncertainty ranges for streamflow was found at the upstream pfelders plan hydrometric station with respect to meran merano suggesting a promising application of the current multi objective approach whenever it is of interest to infer the streamflow uncertainty range at ungauged locations moreover we investigated the predictive uncertainty band of the mean areal swe sca maps proved themselves to provide valuable information to reduce significantly the predicted swe uncertainty range at both meran merano and pfelders plan sites the reliability of such sharper prediction was not assessed since only few direct swe observations were available finally the described procedure can be easily extended to other catchments and it is not model dependent i e any hydrological model able to estimate the fractional snow cover area can be in principle used an extended temperature index model would be ideal due the balance between model complexity and computational efficiency further work might concern the exploitation of the overall spatial information of the snow cover maps rather than the aggregated fractional snow cover perhaps considering also sentinel or landsat products along with modis introducing snow ground measurements to constrain snow related model parameters might lead to a better parameter identifiability

4452,the application of two dimensional shallow water equations models 2d swes for the description of hydrodynamic based surface runoff computations is becoming a reference approach in rainfall runoff simulations at the catchment scale due to their ability in generation of flow patterns throughout the basin they can be used not only as an advanced method for flood mapping studies and hazard assessment but also as an innovative tool for the analysis of river drainage networks opening new perspectives for several environmental processes in particular in this work we put the river networks in a 2d swes framework meaning that the traditional tree like fluvial structure represented by a skeleton composed of a set of lines is replaced by a collection of points discretizing the 2 d geometry of the river structure itself for which the values of the hydrodynamic values are provided by the numerical simulations this approach is used here to derive a new scaling property that relates the specific discharge threshold used to identify the river network cells to the total areas of the network cells themselves the hydrodynamic and geomorphological interpretation of this power law function and the influence of grid resolution on some relevant parameters of this curve have inspired the development of a heuristic procedure for non uniform grid generation able to detect the most hydrodynamically active areas of the basins for which the grid refinement process makes sense moreover information related to how much grid refinement is needed is provided as well the performances of this procedure are very promising in terms of accuracy of simulated discharges hydrodynamic behaviour of the river network and flooded areas reducing significantly the computational times in respect to the use of fine uniform grids keywords 2d shallow water equations surface runoff river networks non uniform grids channel heads scaling laws 1 introduction river drainage networks have been studied for several decades from a range of geomorphological and hydrological perspectives since they represent pathways to transport environmental fluxes such as water intended as resource and hazard counts nutrient and sediment rodríguez iturbe et al 2009 therefore several environmental processes need their structure and dynamics to be understood and quantified in order to provide an effective management and prediction of various phenomena in hydrology hazard assessment sediment transport and ecology see for example benda et al 2004 zaliapin et al 2010 czuba and foufoula georgiou 2015 pilotti et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 river networks have been shown to exhibit various properties such as self similarity and scaling laws across a range of scales rodríguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 specifically they were studied from a physical geometrical and hydraulic point of view introducing specific scaling laws that represent within a given river basin the relationships of scale invariance between topological variables dodds rothman 1999 gangodagamage et al 2011 le and kumar 2014 mantilla et al 2012 or between channel characteristics such as mean depth water surface width mean velocity length of active wet channels and discharge see for example godsey and kirchner 2014 hooshyar et al 2015 lawrence 2007 nardi et al 2006 stewardson 2005 due to the importance for geomorphologic analyses environmental assessments and hydrologic simulations it is evident that the accuracy of drainage networks is a key factor for the reliability and validity of related research in this context one of the main relevant aspects is represented by the precise detection of channel heads which plays a fundamental role for drainage network extraction for a couple of reasons li et al 2020 first the differentiation between overland runoff on hillslopes and water flow in channels is essential for physically based models at the catchments scale and for the associated parameters for model simulations second the morphometric and scaling properties of a river network drainage density length of drainage paths etc are influenced by the location of channel heads information about the drainage patterns and the topographic features can be extracted from digital elevation models dems for which a common procedure consists of dem processing to obtain flow directions flow accumulation and the drainage network thanks to the increasing availability and use of dem data the development of distributed hydrological models and the introduction of simulation techniques at the catchment scale grew quickly paniconi and putti 2015 singh 2018 most of the processes of the hydrological cycle can be described in a distributed way by representing the catchment itself in as many computational cells as necessary in this way each computational element forming the discrete mesh works as a water and sediment control volume in which a lot of processes rainfall input infiltration losses variation of bed levels due to erosion deposition can be taken into account fernández pato et al 2020 in this context the application of two dimensional shallow water models 2d swes for the description of hydrodynamic based surface runoff computations in rainfall runoff simulations at the catchment scale is a reference approach as testified by the plethora of studies which appeared in the related literature in the last 10 years cea et al 2010 2014 costabile et al 2012 2013 caviedes voullième et al 2012 2020 simons et al 2014 liang et al 2015 huang et al 2015 cea and bladé 2015 fernández pato and garcia navarro 2016 fernández pato et al 2016 2018 bellos and tsakiris 2016 xia et al 2017 bout et al 2018 hou et al 2018a bellos et al 2020 ni et al 2020 this approach sometimes referred to as the direct rainfall method yu and harbor 2019 jamali et al 2019 consists in the application of rainfall to each cell of the two dimensional domain the consequent runoff is then routed by the 2d hydrodynamic model this approach seems to be attractive for modelers and scientists because it significantly reduces the need for hydrologic modelling for the runoff estimation and consequently the number of models for generation and propagation of surface runoff at a basin scale hall 2015 for this reason the application of 2 d software packages using a direct rainfall method such as hec ras starts to be considered in the literature david and schmalz 2020 costabile et al 2020a the use of 2 d hydrodynamic based rainfall runoff simulations at the catchment scale may represent an innovative approach for the analysis of basin drainage networks from geomorphological and hydrological perspectives in particular the traditional tree like fluvial structure represented by a skeleton composed of a set of lines following the properties of the quantitative fluvial geomorphology strahler 1975 are replaced by a collection of points discretizing the 2 d geometry of the river structure itself so that the drainage network width is implicitly described in a high resolution scale closer to reality this view has been introduced recently by costabile et al 2019 who introduced novel scaling properties related to the hydraulic characterization of river networks and a very promising method for channel heads detection based on the flow patterns simulated by a 2d swes model the application of this line of thinking and research requires high resolution topographic data at the catchment scale the increasing use of high performance computing techniques lacasta et al 2015 juez et al 2016 xia et al 2019 aureli et al 2020 makes the running of 2d swes simulations using such high resolutions more feasible than before as proof of this real time modelling based on this approach start to be analysed in the literature ming et al 2020 however this issue remains challenging because of the high computational cost associated to the of large number of cells that is usually required to represent the topography fernández pato et al 2018 a popular option to reduce the computational times is based on grid coarsening see for example özgen et al 2015 this approach however reduces resolution and therefore the overall accuracy of the simulations depending on to what extent the selected mesh is able to capture the microtopography and the small scale hydrological processes of the terrain khosh bin ghomash et al 2019 indeed model results are strongly dependent on mesh selection because complex interactions exist between grid resolution friction and infiltration features caviedes voullième et al 2012 fernández pato et al 2016 so that the assessment of the effects induced by resolution reduction on the hydrological hydrodynamic response of a natural catchment to a rainfall input is a relevant issue in the literature related to these issues the choice of the mesh type assumes a key importance some studies concluded that there is not an optimal grid for 2d flood modelling because each element type e g triangle and quadrilateral is advantageous under different circumstances kim et al 2014 therefore some papers suggested the use of a flexible or hybrid mesh hoch et al 2018 bomers et al 2019 meaning that different geometrical shapes at various resolutions are applied to discretize the study area or adaptive grids hu et al 2018 2019a 2019b savant et al 2019 able to be adapted optimally in time and space in response to the evolving flow features other studies have focused on mesh refinement by the detection of key topographic features where the high resolution mesh is needed while the mesh in the rest of the domain remains coarse hou et al 2018b an alternative recent approach is based on the assumption that each natural catchment contains a characteristic scale that can be used for the generation of a priori computational grids that are potentially able to detect areas for which a grid refinement is needed ferraro et al 2020 however only a few studies faced these issues at the catchment scale since attention was mostly focused on urban areas i e costabile and macchione 2015 de almeida et al 2018 the purposes of this work are linked to the general framework described so far specifically the paper aims to shed new light on the research related to the use of 2d swes modelling at the catchment scale highlighting the added value that the simulated flow patterns may provide in terms of both the hydrological hydrodynamic and geomorphological analysis of river networks and flood mapping studies the focus of this work is the development of a novel framework through which to analyse geomorphic and hydrodynamic properties of the river networks expressed in greater detail the goals of this work are 1 to introduce new scaling properties related to the hydrodynamics of the flow patterns characterizing the river networks that may be useful to analyse geomorphic and hydrologic features of the catchment 2 to show the potential of these properties as a tool to assess the effects induced by the computational grid used to discretize the topography of the basins in terms of simulated discharges flooded areas flood hazard and physical structures of the river networks 3 to use some relevant features of these properties for the generation of efficient and accurate computational grids in such a way to have information about where the grid refinement process is needed and how much grid refinement is required this paper is organized as follows conceptualization and methodological issues are firstly presented section 2 together with the selected catchments analysed in this study section 3 then the results are extensively shown in section 4 in which the scaling property its geomorphological meaning and the effects of grid resolution are discussed in the same section attention will be devoted to highlight how these results may be used to develop a heuristic procedure based on the derived scaling property for the generation of non uniform grids facing the issues related to the grid refinement process and how much grid refinement is needed section 4 the limitations and the potential impacts of this research are discussed in section 5 while in section 6 the main conclusions of this study are presented 2 conceptualization and methodological issues 2 1 2 d swes according to rainfall on grid approach the core of the methodological procedure of this work is based on the use of the 2 d swes as a tool for surface runoff and river basin network analyses as is well known the swes describe the physical principles of mass and momentum conservation the conservative form of those equations can be expressed as in eq 1 1 u t f x g y s where 2 u h h u h v f hu h u 2 g h 2 2 h u v g hv h u v h v 2 g h 2 2 s r f g h s 0 x s fx g h s 0 y s fy in which t s is time x y are the horizontal coordinates h m is the water depth u v m s are the depth averaged flow velocities in x and y directions g m s2 is the gravitational acceleration r m s is the rain intensity and f m s the infiltration losses s0x s0y m m are the bed slopes in x and y directions sfx sfy are the friction slopes in x and y directions as one can note in eq 2 the source term s in the mass continuity equation is not zero both the rainfall and the infiltration losses are included here in this manner the swes have the ability to apply rain directly to a two dimensional grid leading to the so called direct rainfall method or rainfall on grid approach as mentioned in the introduction for the numerical integration of eq 1 the finite volume method fvm approach has been considered in particular the roe scheme roe 1981 first order accurate in time and space was used for the computation of the numerical fluxes moreover suitable numerical treatments of the source terms and wet dry fronts were applied costabile et al 2013 an unstructured grid based on irregular triangular elements was used to obtain the computational domains though flexible hybrid grids are expected to reduce computational times significantly we preferred the use of triangular grids because they are easy to generate and to analyse and therefore suit well to the general purpose of this work the mathematical aspects and performances in real cases were already presented in previous works costabile et al 2019 2020b 2021 and therefore are not reported here it is important to observe that this model is characterized by well balanced properties one of the several consequences of this is the use of a digital elevation model without removing topographic depressions that once filled by water easily allow the propagation of surface runoff finally it may be important to underline that the numerical code used here was parallelized using openmp and mpi directives in order to obtain a drastic reduction of the computational times 2 2 use of the swes for the river network analysis and modelling assumptions the method used here for the river networks analysis is based on the approach proposed by costabile et al 2019 in which the flow patterns are obtained from a swes simulation specifically once a specific precipitation input is assigned the numerical solution of the swes provides the spatial and temporal evaluation of the water depths h and the velocities u v throughout the basin except when specifically underlined a constant in time and uniform in space rainfall is used for the computations presented in this work in practice we assume a simple constant and uniform hyetograph in order to reach steady state conditions as regards the runoff generation mechanism this work focuses attention on the simulation of extreme events in which infiltration excess is considered to be the dominant process therefore there is the need to provide an estimation of infiltration losses f for the computation of the net rainfall s r f however considering the purpose of the work the swes model was initialized using a fictitious inflow s to route everywhere into the basin according to the mass and momentum balances in order to generate the potential flow patterns through which the water is collected in the channels stored in small depressions or flows down the hillslope a second assumption is related to the roughness values used for the computation of friction slopes that should be estimated carefully and differentiated throughout the basin beside the influence of land use and soil type roughness values for shallow flow on hillslopes are expected to be much larger than those in the channels due to the water depth that is much less than the size of the roughness elements however in this study we chose a constant manning coefficient over the whole catchment this choice implies an idealization of the case studies but considering that attention here is not focused on reconstruction of observed events we preferred to simplify the analysis of the results by reducing as much as possible the number of parameters that may further complicate the analysis of those specific aspects representing the purposes of the work and described in section 2 3 2 3 derivation of a new scaling law based on specific discharge threshold and implication for grid generation process one of the main results obtained in costabile et al 2019 is the description of the hydraulic behaviour of the flow patterns simulated by the 2 d swes by means of a bimodal scaling law that describe the relations between the water depth threshold hs used to identify the network cells and a dimensionless area a defined by the ratio between the total area of the network cells themselves and total basin area a specifically a computational cell is considered as belonging to the network cells only if the water depth computed in that cell in steady state condition for a given rainfall input is equal to or greater than hs the relevant aspect related to the a hs curve is that the points of coordinates log hs log a tend to be arranged according to two linear laws having significantly different slopes that proved to be representative of the channel network cn and hillslope plus channel network hcn flow patterns the part of the graph in which a break of the derivative is detected can be used as the area useful to define the specific value of hs associated to the channel network for further details one can refer to costabile et al 2019 but some a hs curves will be shown later on in this work for comparative purposes in this work since attention is focused on the hydrodynamic characterization of the river network we cannot use the water depth threshold used in our previous work therefore the simulation results are globally presented as a function of a threshold value in terms of specific discharge or discharge per unit of width qs hv which is the product between water depth h and the modules v of the velocity a generic cell is identified as a network cell when its specific discharge is equal to or greater than a pre fixed threshold value qs in other words a generic cell is defined as active or not depending on the satisfaction of the previous condition in order to compare the results obtained for the selected basins the variable q qs q is introduced defined as the ratio between the threshold value qs and the unit discharge related to steady state condition computed in the outlet section q the structure of the relation a q will be discussed in relation to the scaling law a hs proposed by costabile et al 2019 in order to propose an original approach for the overall hydrodynamic characterization of the flow patterns representing the river networks the main features of the a q law will be also analysed in the light of the grid element size used for the numerical solution of the 2 d swes this is a key aspect in overland flow modelling because the selected size of the computational element for the uniform grid or more generally the different resolution used inside the domain for the unstructured ones are often introduced in the computation without a real motivation and while neglecting the potential effect on the hydrodynamics of the surface runoff as already mentioned in the introduction the choice of the grid resolution is expected to have significant impacts on both the accuracy of the results and the overall computational times the methodological aspect related to this part of the work will be represented by the analysis of the modification induced on the scaling law a q considering the same rainfall input but using different uniform resolution by changing the parameter rsim defined in eq 3 3 r sim r 0 a m 2 k m 2 that is the ratio between the area of the computing cell r0 related to a uniform grid and the area of the basin a finally the analysis of rsim on the physical structure of the river network the related hydrodynamic characterization of the flow patterns and discharge hydrograph will provide key information in order to establish a procedure for grid generation using different resolutions throughout the domain in this context attention will be devoted to the development of a heuristic procedure able to provide practical indications on both where grid refinement is needed and how much refinement is needed specifically the idea followed here is based on the identification of the most important areas from a hydrodynamic point of view in other words attention is focused on those areas that greatly influence the overall dynamics of the surface runoff propagation that tend to be characterized by the most significant amount of conveyed water volume these areas are assumed to be the most important areas of the basin that require a more accurate description of the topography the remaining areas are considered to be less significant from a hydrodynamic point of view for which there is no need to use a fine grid in this way it is possible to drastically reduce the total number of the computational elements obtaining significant computational time savings without reducing the overall accuracy of the solution the original aspect presented in this work is to exploit some relevant information represented by the a q law in order to identity those specific areas and to have indications about the resolution to assign to both the most active hydrodynamic areas and the remaining parts of the basins this approach as will be shown in the next section takes advantages of some features of the simulated flow patterns that are not very much influenced by the grid resolution therefore the procedure that will be discussed later on in this work aimed at the generation of efficient and accurate grids is based on two steps 1 simulation using a uniform grid having a coarse resolution r 0 in order to find out the most active hydrodynamic areas of the basin according to the indications provided by the a q law 2 grid refinement process in the areas detected in the previous step defining criteria to compute the ratio between the maximum and minimum resolutions rmax rmin all the details related to the reasoning followed to select rmin and rmax as well as the choice of the more proper specific discharge threshold for the identification of the most active hydrodynamic areas will be provided in the next section in the light of the obtained results 3 analysed basins available data and description of the numerical tests three actual catchments and one idealized basin were analysed in this work see fig 1 each of them was selected for specific reasons 3 1 actual basins two small basins namely ap and er see fig 1a b were used for the analysis related to the understanding of the basic features of the a q curve that in turn inspired that heuristic procedure for non uniform grid generation the ap basin is not new in the literature see for example perron et al 2012 de bartolo et al 2016 costabile et al 2019 it is located in the allegheny plateau region pennsylvania usa the basin area is equal to 3 91 km2 whereas the mean slope is approximately equal to 11 the er basin already used in costabile et al 2019 belongs to the south fork of the eel river in mendocino county california usa its basin area is 2 33 km2 and the mean slope is 18 further details on these basins can be found in references cited above the reason why we intentionally chose these two basins is the significantly different structure of their drainage patterns as will be highlighted later on in this paper this is essential for the purposes of this study that is devoted to the hydrodynamic characterization of the simulated flow patterns throughout the river basins by understanding the a q scaling property in significantly different situations for these two basins ideal simulations were carried out using a constant in time and uniform in space net rainfall s equal to 30 mm h having a duration greater than the concentration time of the basins so as to generate steady flow conditions as explained before in order to focus attention only on the grid resolution effects and thus to reduce as much as possible the total number of the variables a constant value of the manning coefficient was arbitrarily set 0 05 s m 1 3 due to the ideal features of our simulations finally another basin ar fig 1c one order of magnitude greater than the previous ones was considered to test the usefulness and easy of application of the proposed procedure for the generation of a computational grid based on the property of the a q law the ar basin belonging to the ardivestra catchment in the north of italy has an extent approximately equal to 43 km2 a mean altitude of 423 m above sea level a s l and length of the main river equal to 22 4 km for this basin two tests will be carried out the first one used relates to a constant in time and uniform in space net rainfall having a duration greater than the concentration time of the basins the second one uses a chicago hyetograph obtained by the available rainfall duration curve corresponding to a return period of 200 years in order to assess the validity of the procedure using rainfall input closer to reality for all the three basins lidar bare ground data are available from which 1 m dems were extracted 3 2 idealized basin an idealized basin fig 1d used as a test case in the literature for validating surface runoff models see for example di giammarco et al 1996 shu et al 2020 and for which an analytical solution is available stephenson and meadows 1986 was used to strengthen the geomorphological interpretation provided for the a q law it is a v shaped catchment having a single slope on both the plane s p 0 05 and the channel s c 0 02 the depth of the channel varies from 1 m at the upstream end to 20 m at the downstream end the intensity of the rainfall input is 10 8 mm h and a duration of 1 5 h the precipitation does not affect the channel interesting only the valley side the assigned values of the manning s coefficients are 0 05 s m 1 3 for the valley side and 0 15 s m 1 3 for the channel 4 results using a uniform grid composed by triangular elements with resolution of 1 m2 the a q curves obtained for the ap and er basins are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively highlighting also the physical structure of the flow patterns for different values of the threshold q the identification of the hydrodynamically active areas of the basin active cells can be carried out using a level of details depending on the value of the selected threshold q it should be recalled that the hydrodynamically active areas of the basin are intended here as that set of network cells having specific discharges greater to or equal than the threshold q section 2 3 and as consequence are a function of this quantity q as a parameter is able to describe different features of the hydrodynamically active areas of the basin due to the fact that higher values of q detect more channelized flow patterns whereas the lowers ones include also overland flow patterns so as can be observed in both the figures the network cells areas decrease for increasing values of q providing fluvial network structures in which the lower orders stream progressively vanish as already observed for the a hs curve costabile et al 2019 the points of coordinates log a log q tend to be arranged according to two linear laws having different slopes as highlighted by the black dot lines in figs 2 and 3 as for the a hs curve it is quite easy to identify a range of q values highlighted in the green boxes of figs 2 and 3 in which the break of the derivative occurs for higher values of q the aggregation of the points describes only channelized flow patterns whereas for lower values overland flow patterns on hillslopes are also visualized moreover it can be observed that for very low values of q the points tend to cover the whole basin see for example the network associated to q l in figs 2 and 3 whereas for the higher ones a structured channel network cannot be detectable easily because only the main course of the river seems to be described see for example the network associated to q r in figs 2 and 3 these two situations are somewhat highlighted by the behaviour of the a q relation that diverges from the two straight black dot lines for values lower than q 1 and higher than q 2 for these reasons the differentiation between cn and hcn flow patterns introduced by costabile et al 2019 for the a hs curve can be applied also to the a q relation therefore q 1 can be seen as the threshold value that identifies the flow patterns of the fully developed channel network including the low discharges contributions flowing in the most peripheral parts of the basin conversely q 2 detects only those areas in which the most significant values of the specific discharges occur typically the most channelized part of the main courses the two straight lines can be described by a bimodal scaling law the analytical formulation of which can be expressed as in eq 4 4 a a q b in which a and b are two parameters the scale parameters b for the simulations related to figs 2 and 3 are equal to 0 35 cn and 1 10 hcn for the ap basin while for the er basin are equal to 0 52 cn and 1 hcn 4 1 geomorphological and hydrodynamic interpretation of the a q curve the meaning of the scale parameter b of the cn part of the curve can be provided looking at fig 4 in which the quantities used for its computation were highlighted in particular da may be seen as a measure of the increase of the areas covered by lower discharges of the channel network which are progressively described for a decreasing value of q in respect to the higher ones flowing in the most channelized part of the main courses only in this sense it might also be interpreted as an indicator of the amount of the total channel network area covered by the minor hydrographic network being related to the expansion of the hydrodynamically active areas when moving from the higher to the lower specific discharges dq is an indicator of the variability of the specific discharges throughout the channel network and therefore may be considered as a measure of the hydrodynamic heterogeneity since the scale coefficient of the cn part of the curve is b da dq it is the expansion of the hydrodynamically active areas in relation to hydrodynamic heterogeneity of the flow patterns throughout the channel network therefore for a given value of dq a lower value of b means a lower values of da so that the hydrodynamic variability inside the channel network is essentially confined in the main courses conversely a higher values of b means a higher value of da so that the hydrodynamic heterogeneity involves significantly the minor hydrographic network as regards the scale parameter b that characterizes the hcn part of the a q curve it should be recalled that the hcn flow patterns take into account also the runoff over hillslopes therefore they describe a kind of sum of effects related to channelized and overland flow and so the value of b should not be considered in itself but in relation to the value of the scale exponent b of the cn part in general the b value of hcn structures is expected to be significantly greater than the homologous of the cn ones due to the nature of overland flow processes specifically for a given increase of the hydrodynamic heterogeneity beyond the cn part of the curve a significant increase of the hydrodynamically active areas is expected because no significant channelization occurs and therefore the absence of important flow confinements leads to a sudden increase of the hydrodynamically active areas a measure of this process may be given by the ratio between the scale exponents characterizing the hcn and the cn structures hereafter identified as tb the value of which is expected to be very high as the drainage patterns over hillslopes have no kind of topographic constraints that would confine the flow a very strong break of the derivative of the a q curve that means a high value of tb can occur when the overland flow on hillslopes is similar to what can happen on a plane that is an ideal case limit for which the topography has no differentiated flow patterns and therefore it plays essentially the role of water flux transfer without channelization or storage capacity the idealized v shaped basin shown in section 3 2 is particularly useful to check the validity of the interpretations given so far for this situation the scale parameter b of the cn part is expected to assume a very low value because all the hydrodynamic variability can only be limited to the main course and so the increase of the hydrodynamically active areas is likely to be very low moreover a very high value of tb is expected since the idealized hillslopes cannot have heterogenous flow patterns induced by topographic constraints the validity of our simulation is testified by the numerical discharge computed at the outlet of the channel depicted in fig 5 a that highlights a very good agreement with the analytical solution available for this test as regards both the rising limb of the hydrograph and the time to peak though this case has some different features in respect to other simulations shown before variable roughness and direct rainfall only on the two planes the a q curve shows the classic bimodal behaviour fig 5b however as can be seen from fig 5b the cn part of the curve shows a substantial horizontal behaviour in which the scale parameter b tends to zero 0 09 the value of b related to the hcn part of the curve is practically 2 so that the ratio tb between the two values is more than 20 therefore as expected a very strong discontinuity occurs for this test case confirming the interpretation of the a q curve provided before in the light of the considerations made so far the numerical values of the scale exponents of the two parts of the a q curve allows one to derive specific information useful to assess the different properties of the simulated flow patterns in actual basins the scale parameter b of the cn part of the a q curve for the ap basin is lower than the homologous one related to the er catchment this means that for the ap basin the hydrodynamic variability throughout the channel network is mostly limited in the main courses whereas in the er catchment it significantly involves also the minor hydrographic network so that the importance of the areas covered by lower order streams in respect to those of the main courses is higher for the er basin moreover the value of tb is approximately equal to 4 and 2 for the ap and er respectively this suggests that the flow patterns over hillslopes for the er basin show a tendency to be more structured than the homologous ones of the ap basin this means that the overall hydrodynamic behaviour of these two basins is significantly different finally it may be important to provide evidence about the agreement between the channel networks simulated by the hydraulic scaling law a hs proposed in costabile et al 2019 and the hydrodynamic one a q discussed in this work for example fig 6 shows that comparison for er basin using the thresholds highlighted by the black arrows in figs 6a b highlighting only some little differences between the networks shown in figs 6c 6d so considering the uncertainties in the precise localization of the threshold limits the flow patterns obtained by the a q curve can be considered very similar to those derived by the a hs curve 4 2 influence of grid resolution the influence of grid resolution has a major importance for this work the results shown here will be the basis for the development of a heuristic procedure for the generation of efficient non uniform grids the performance of which will be discussed later on in this paper as explained in section 2 3 attention is firstly focused on triangular grids having almost uniform size and on their influences on the hydrodynamic characterization of the river network made so far for this reason simulations were performed using the following values of the parameter rsim defined in eq 3 0 5 5 10 m2 km2 for the ap basin this means the generation of grids having the following uniform resolution r 0 1 95 m2 19 5 m2 and 39 m2 as regards the er basin the grid elements area r 0 is 1 15 m2 11 5 m2 and 23 m2 4 2 1 influence of mesh resolution on both the scaling laws and the river network structures the effects of the grid coarsening on the physical structure of the river networks seen as their plan developments are shown in figs 7 and 8 that show a comparison between the channel networks obtained by using the criterion based on the a q curve related to finer rsim 0 5 m2 km2 and coarser rsim 10 m2 km2 grid resolutions in particular they highlight that some lowest order streams are not described due to the coarsening of the grid but the rest of the network seems to be substantially unaltered so that the overall plan development of the river network is not significantly affected by the grid resolution however the coarsening of the grid is expected to have consequences on the hydrodynamic behaviour of the simulated flow patterns involving variation in the distribution of water depths and velocities throughout the basins and consequently in the prediction of river widths in particular comparing figs 7a and 7b and figs 8a and 8b a generalized lowering of the specific discharges in the most channelized part of the main courses can be observed when moving from rsim 0 5 m2 km2 to rsim 10 m2 km2 and are further made evident by fig 7c and 8c in these two last figures the profile of the interpolated surface of the simulated non dimensional unit discharges in the points obtained by the intersection between the grid and cross sections highlighted in figs 7a b and 8a b are shown in particular the grid coarsening leads to a redistribution of the water fluxes from the most channelized part of the section to neighbouring areas on the right fig 7c the consequences of this are further amplified in more complex sections characterized by the presence of two main channels fig 8c in which the smoothing process induced by the the grid coarsening leads to a significant alteration of the hydrodynamic behaviour across the section itself the behaviour observed for these cross sections is quite generalized throughout the basins as the a q curves related to the considered rsim values immediately detects fig 9 specifically figs 9a b highlight that the influence of the grid coarsening on the a q curve is significant and in general seems not to be reflected similarly in the two basins the first observation relates to the increase of the river network area related to all the threshold values belonging to the cn and hcn parts of the a q profiles this also means a generalized overestimation of the flooded areas associated to a given hazard condition q that increases as the grid size increases on the other hand for higher values of q beyond the right end of the cn flow patterns typically characterizing just the more channelized part of the main river course as shown in figs 2 and 3 a significant steepening of the curve occurs that leads to a significant decrease of the river network areas associated to a given threshold value q from a practical point of view this means a reduction of the higher values of specific discharges that in turn artificially generates minor water fluxes in neighbouring areas fig 7c and significant alteration of the hydrodynamic behaviour across the sections fig 8c this smoothing process explains the increase of the active cell areas for a given threshold in the cn and hcn parts of the curve induced by grid coarsening and confirms what has been previously observed in the analysis of figs 7c and 8c however this effect has a different behaviour for the ap and er basin as can be observed in fig 9c d in which the straight dotted black lines represent the cn part of the a q relations for the finer and coarser grid for the ap basin the smoothing process induced by grid coarsening does not alter the scale coefficient b fig 9c conversely for the er basin fig 9d the variation of the scale coefficient b is more pronounced about 15 this means an alteration of the behaviour of the river network for which the hydrodynamic variability is associated to an expansion of the hydrodynamically active areas greater than those simulated for the finer grid therefore the spatial weight of the lower specific discharges in respect to those related to the higher ones falling in the cn part of the graphs is artificially increased by the increase of the grid size finally a last consideration can be made about the overall influence of the grid resolution on the hydrodynamically active areas that characterize both the hcn and cn parts of the a q curve in particular our interest here is to evaluate how much the grid coarsening impact on both the area of the channel network a c1 and the expansions of the hydrodynamically active areas of the cn and hcn side of the a q curve measured as the ratio β between a h1 a h2 and a c1 a c2 highlighted in fig 10 by evaluating these two quantities we have another element to understand that the grid coarsening has different effects on the two selected basins specifically both the channel network area and β increase by the same factor practically equal to 1 5 for the ap basin when moving from rsim 10 m2 km2 to rsim 0 5 m2 km2 conversely the dimensionless channel network area a c1 and the ratio β between the areal expansions of the hcn and cn flow patterns related to the er basin increase by a factor equal to 2 5 and 2 7 respectively when moving from rsim 10 m2 km2 to rsim 0 5 m2 km2 so that it can be considered substantially constant also for this basin it may be important to observe that this scale factor seems to be related to the value of scale parameter b of the cn part of the a q curve since it increases as b increases too 4 2 2 influence on the discharges at the outlet the grid resolution effects on the hydrodynamic behaviour of the flow patterns discussed before are expected to induce also some differences on the simulated discharges time to peak and front wave arrival times fig 11 shows the influence of grid resolution on the simulated discharges computed at the outlets of the two basins at first sight the overall profile of the simulated discharges seems to be not so different this is somewhat expected due to the very small extent of the two basins considered here however some significant details can be highlighted even in these cases the influence of grid coarsening on both the front arrival times and time to peak is different in the two basins as regards the ap basin fig 11a the increase of the grid size does not have a uniform impact on the simulated discharges specifically during the initial part of the rising limb slower waves seem to be generated but later on the opposite occurs so that the time to peak is anticipated by about 10 in respect to the simulation related to the finer grid this behaviour is not observed for the er basin fig 11b for which the increase of the grid size causes a slower flood wave so that the time to peak is delayed by about 15 the understanding of the reasons why the two basins have different hydrologic responses in relation to the grid size is not immediate and requires also detailed analyses of other case studies that cannot be addressed in this work however a possible motivation for this may be found in the modification of the features of the a q curve due to the grid resolution discussed previously as already underlined before the grid size increase has a different impact on the two basins in particular for the er basin the increase of the scale parameter means the increase of the areas covered by the lower specific discharges in respect to those relative to the main courses this might be an indication about the increase of the storage effect within the basin as the grid size increases leading to slower waves and delays of the time to peak this effect has not been observed in the ap basin for which b is practically constant furthermore some relevant features of the a q curve are modified differently by the grid resolution specifically the dimensionless channel network area a c1 and the ratio β between the expansions of the hcn and cn flow patterns areas assume different values as detected by the scale factor discussed in the section 4 2 1 approximately equal to 1 5 and 2 5 for the ap and er basins respectively so the different effects on the discharge hydrographs induced by grid resolution might be interpreted in the light of the different impacts observed in the behaviour of the a q curve of the two catchments even though a deeper analysis is needed to realize the potential effective link between these two elements 4 3 heuristic procedure based on the a q curve for the generation of non uniform grids the results shown in the previous section highlighted that the physical structure of the river network is not significantly influenced by the grid resolution except for some very low order streams that are not described however the a q curves show more significant differences in terms of hydrodynamic behaviour of the flow patterns due to grid resolution effects that reflect in part on simulated discharge at the basin outlet specifically some influences were observed in terms of time to peak and overall propagation times but compared to the expected significant saving of computational times the use of coarser grids seems not to be justified if attention is focused not so much on hazard conditions but on discharge computation however it should be born in mind that limited variations on discharge values are somewhat expected considering the small extent of the considered basins and by the low complexity of the numerical test considered here therefore most significant variations are likely to occur in bigger catchments as will be shown later in which there is the need to balance the computational times and the grid accuracy requirements as recalled before the identification of areas for which grid refinement should be provided in order to avoid significant worsening of the overall solution is generally ignored in the literature so what is discussed now is an approach aimed at the identification of the most hydrodynamically active parts of the domain in which to provide a grid refinement process thinning the resolution in the rest of the areas that are not so significant for the overall surface runoff at the same time the procedure should provide practical indications about the ratio between the maximum and minimum resolution to set in the generation of the grid the approach followed here aims at exploiting all the information related to the a q curve according to the two step procedure explained in section 2 3 in particular considering that the scale parameters characterizing the a q curve are not greatly influenced by the grid resolution as shown before the first step of the procedure is based on a uniform grid simulation having a coarse resolution r 0 this first simulation allows one to obtain a very fast solution of the a q curve that is assumed to be a rough approximation of that associated to a very detailed description of the basin this approximated curve is the basis for the identification of some relevant hydrodynamically active areas for which the resolution rmax is used and for a rough estimation of the ratio between rmin and rmax step 2 therefore the procedure requires 1 the choice of the threshold q in order to detect the most hydrodynamically active areas of the basin and 2 the definition of rmin and rmax in other words the first point is related to where the grid refinement is needed whereas the second point is associated to how much refinement is required 4 3 1 where the grid refinement is needed as regards the first problem attention should be focused on the cn part of the a q curve since the goal of this task is to reduce as much as possible the total number of computational elements different choices were explored as regards the most proper value of the threshold q to use for the delimitation of the most hydrodynamically active part of the basin to explore better this issue we considered three options 1 initial point 2 midpoint and 3 ending point of the cn part of the a q curve it is important to observe that the precise location of the initial point of the cn part from a graphical point of view is subject to some uncertainty an accurate evaluation of this can be performed only using a geomorphic descriptor obtained on a multifractal basis costabile et al 2019 that were not used here in order to simplify the proposed procedure as much as possible therefore in the framework of this work it seems better to talk not so much about specific initial mid ending points but of a range of values for which those points should be located for these reasons in figs 12 a and 13 a the areas in which we selected the initial mid ending points for the ap and er basins are represented using coloured boxes namely area 1 area 2 and area 3 the associated contours delimitating the areas for which rmax should be used are highlighted in figs 12b c d and 13b c d for the ap and er basin respectively in order to evaluate the differences in terms of areal extent among the three options considered in the fig 12a and 13a the red contour related to area 1 is reported in the figs 12f g and 13f g the grids related to area 1 area 2 and area 3 shown in figs 12 and 13 will be identified as grid a1 grid a2 and grid a3 respectively 4 3 2 how much refinement is needed estimation of rmin and rmax concerning this aspect one of the best choices is represented by the use of an a priori method as the one proposed by ferraro et al 2020 based on the 2 d power spectrum of the dem however the use of that approach is not of interest in this paper which is mainly based on the use of specific features of the a q curve for grid generation therefore in order to simplify the approach the choice of rmin and rmax may be left to the user however in order to provide useful indications to the users a heuristic procedure is proposed here on the basis of specific assumptions the basic idea of this procedure is to provide a link between the non uniform grid resolutions rmin and rmax and some information related to the extent of some relevant hydrodynamically active areas extracted by the a q curve a first assumption introduced is oriented to provide an estimation of rmax on the basis of the dimensionless channel network area a c1 identified on the a q curve near the break of the derivative see fig 10 which is what has been previously identified inside the red boxes of figs 12 and 13 in particular we compute rmax assuming that the simulation ratio rsim previously set by the user for the computation of the first attempt at uniform grid resolution r 0 has the same value when referred to both the whole basin area a and the network area as reported in eq 5 5 r sim r 0 a r max a c 1 a therefore eq 5 implies that rmax r 0 a c1 or rmax rsim a a c1 as regards rmin two options are suggested here both of them based on the assumption that the density of the computational cells should be constant in specific reference areas deduced by the a q curve specifically in the first option the density of the computational cells is the same inside the channel network area a a c1 and in the rest of the basin 1 a c1 a so that it is based on the same assumption used for rmax in eq 5 but referred to the complement to unity of the dimensionless channel network area 1 a c1 as specified in eq 6 6 r max a c 1 a r min 1 a c 1 a that leads to eq 7 7 r max r min 1 a c 1 1 α in the second option for the computation of rmin the two references areas are identified by the expansion of the hydrodynamically active areas observed in the cn and hcn parts of the a q curve and delimited by the green and blue dotted lines in fig 10 keeping the density of the computational cells constant eq 8 can be introduced 8 r max a c 1 a c 2 a r min a h 1 a h 2 a that leads to eq 9 9 r min r max a h 1 a h 2 a c 1 a c 2 β in which β has the same meaning of the parameter discussed in section 4 2 1 in the context of the scale factor the final step is to provide a scale correction recalling what has been stated in section 4 2 1 the ratio between the channel network area as simulated using rsim 10 m2 km2 and rsim 0 5 m2 km2 varies by a factor ranging from 1 5 to 2 5 therefore the rmax value computed from 5 related to a coarse resolution may be corrected considering that the a c1 value should be reduced using that factor to take into account the expected situation associated to the use of a finer grid considering that β increases substantially by the same factor and also the parameter α performs in the same way no correction is needed for rmin in order to reproduce the same ratios α and β that one could have for rsim 0 5 m2 km2 so the scale correction means the modification of the rmax value only reducing its value by a factor ranging between 1 5 and 2 5 it might be reasonable to assume 1 5 for lower values of the scale parameter b more or less 0 3 and 2 5 for the higher ones approximately 0 6 since the scale correction factor varies according to the scale parameter b in conclusion the rmax value is firstly predicted using relation 5 and then corrected and in particular reduced applying the scale correction factor this approach may provide an additional meaning to the parameter rsim it can be seen as information set by the user to compute a kind of upper limit related to the grid resolution to set in the channel network area 4 3 3 performances of the heuristic procedure for grid generation in this section the results obtained using the heuristic procedure based on information extracted by the a q curve related to a very coarse uniform grid are presented specifically using rsim 10 m2 km2 the relevant parameters for the application of the heuristic procedure are presented in table 1 considering the very low value assumed by rmax we did not apply the scale correction factor for these cases the main features of both the computational grids obtained by the heuristic procedures and the uniform ones are reported in table 2 the influence of where grid refinement is located is firstly discussed and then the effects of the proposed different ratios proposed in eqs 7 and 9 are analysed the results shown in fig 14 highlight the performance of grid a1 grid a2 and grid a3 that differ for the extent of the areas considered for the grid refinement process in which rmax is used outside these areas rmin has been set for these simulations we used the maximum values obtained for rmax which is related to the ratio β defined in eq 9 see table 1 for this reason the non uniform grids will be named as grid a1 β grid a2 β and grid a3 β the results were compared with reference to the benchmark solution that here is represented by the finest grid rsim 0 5 m2 km2 the comparative parameters are related to both simulated discharges at the basins outlets and hydrodynamic behaviour throughout the basins represented synthetically by the flooded areas extent a associated to a given hazard condition q moreover the computational time savings are considered as well specifically the performance indexes reported in eq 10 have been computed 10 e p i 1 n p p c i p r i p r i n p in which p d fa refers respectively to the simulated discharges d or the flooded areas extent fa obtained by the cn part of the a q curve the subscripts c and r refer to results obtained using the generic grid and the reference grid respectively n p are the number of data represented respectively by the number of instants of time in which the simulated discharge were computed and by the number of q values for which a is evaluated in the cn part of the a q curve in other words e d and e fa represent the mean absolute errors in terms of simulated discharges and flooded areas these latter ones related to each value of hazard condition q that characterizes the cn part of the a q moreover the mean error related only to the channel network area efa cn has been also computed see tables 2 and 3 as regards the ap basin it should be observed that the rmin value computed by the heuristic procedure approximately 36 m2 is similar to the value r 0 39 m2 related to rsim 10 m2 km2 and therefore is double the r 0 19 5 m2 related to rsim 5 m2 km2 despite that all the three grids provide results much closer to the reference simulation r sim 0 5 m2 km2 than those obtained by the uniform grids see fig 11 in particular the ed value associated to the a 1 β grid is three times lower than the homologous one related to the uniform grids moreover it is interesting to note that even the a 2 β and a 3 β grids provide better results in terms of simulated discharges than the grid related to rsim 5 m2 km2 despite the mean size rmean of the computational elements being greater see table 2 the performances of the grids generated using the heuristic procedure can be further appreciated looking at flooded areas related to specific hydrodynamic condition q in particular the efa value simulated by the a 1 β grid is one order of magnitude smaller than those computed by the uniform grids moreover efa values associated to a 2 β and a 3 β grids are practically half that of the homologous one related to rsim 5 m2 km2 if attention is focused on the channel network area particularly interesting is the performance of the a 2 β grid that gives the efa cn value very close to that related to the a 1 β grid the performance of the a 3 β grid is not as good as the other two the ed value is only a little bit lower than those of the uniform grids moreover though significantly better results are achieved in terms of efa the associated value is practically half of that related to rsim 5 m2 km2 the error in terms of channel network area efa cn is not so different finally it is important to highlight that the time savings obtained by all the grids are comparable though some little differences exist as expected however what is important to note here is the performances of the grids related to the heuristic procedure in respect to the uniform ones these allow one to obtain better results in comparable computational times the analysis of the simulations related to the er basin substantially confirms the previous considerations even though some significant difference exists also in this case the rmin value computed by the heuristic procedure approximately 20 m2 is similar to r 0 23 m2 computed for rsim 10 m2 km2 and thus double that related to rsim 5 m2 km2 11 5 m2 the results obtained by the grid a1 β are significantly better than those related to the uniform grids in particular the ed value is about four times lower than that related to simulation rsim 5 m2 km2 which has a comparable mean resolution value moreover looking at the flooded area values the efa value is significantly lower 3 5 against 19 5 and the mean absolute error in respect to the channel network area is drastically reduced 1 4 against 36 2 the results obtained by the other two grids generated by the heuristic procedure are not as good as those related to the grid a1 β in particular the results associated to the grid a2 β are less satisfying than those obtained for the ap basin specifically only the mean absolute error in terms of flooded areas value efa shows a significant benefit resulting not so different from those obtained using the grid a1 β the ed and efa cn values are respectively higher and lower than those related to rsim 5 m2 km2 even though they may be considered as comparable the grid a3 β results have the same features of those related to grid a2 β showing lower values in terms of efa and efa cn but a higher value of ed than those associated to rsim 5 m2 km2 finally all the grids allow one to obtain significant and comparable time savings in respect to the reference simulation rsim 0 5 m2 km2 but as for the ap basin this time only grid a1 β seems to be really useful the results obtained for the two basins allow us to highlight some common features in terms of where the grid refinement is needed one of the main common aspects is based on the observation that what is important is not so much the mean grid resolution but the distribution of the resolutions throughout the basin refining the grid only where it is really required this means that the overall hydrodynamic behaviour is influenced mostly by the resolution used for the channel network and only minimally by that related to the hillslope as in part expected for both the basins the performances of the grid a1 β are particularly good providing results very close to those obtained using the reference simulations despite the use of the mean resolution one order of magnitude lower in both the basins the performances of the grid a3 β highlight benefits limited essentially on the flooded areas estimation since the positive effects on the simulated discharges are not so significant the performances of the grid a2 β are somewhat contrasting for the ap basin it substantially provides results as accurate as those related to the grid a1 β the same consideration does not hold for the er basin this result is not surprising and can be explained using the geomorphologic interpretation of the a q provided in section 4 1 recalling that the overall hydrodynamic behaviour of these two basins is different in particular the analysis of the scale coefficient values b of the cn part of the curve highlighted that for ap basin the hydrodynamic variability throughout the channel network is mostly limited to the main courses whereas in the er catchment it involves significantly also the minor hydrographic network so that the importance of the areas covered by lower order streams in respect to those of the main course is higher for the er basin this means that for the er basin the grid refinement process should be more related to the location identified as area 1 which is substantially the channel network area than that named area 2 see fig 13 using the same reasoning for the ap basin the low value of the scale coefficient b is a strong indication about the fact that the grid refinement associated to the area 1 is probably useless so it is possible to achieve similar results using a reduced number of computational elements finally it may be important to underline that no significant differences were observed between the simulations in which rmin is computed using the ratio α or β see tables 2 and 3 so considering that β α for the analysed basins we preferred to show the hydrographs only for those simulations for which the worst results are expected due to the coarser grid used 4 3 4 application of the heuristic procedure generation to a bigger basin the ap and er basins were useful to understand both the main properties of the a q curve and their implications for the development of the heuristic procedure for grid generation which proved to be accurate and efficient the significance of the results is somewhat limited by the extent of these basins as they are smaller than 4 km2 therefore the last application shown in this work tries to overcome in part this limitation showing its potential and ease of application to the ar basin shown in section 3 which is of one order of magnitude greater than those considered up to now about 43 km2 furthermore beside the steps of the procedure the analysis of this basin allows us to discuss the role of the scale correction coefficient that was avoided previously the overall procedural steps are presented in fig 15 also in this case we set rsim 10 m2 km2 for the generation of the coarse grid for the estimation of the a q curve fig 15a in particular the value of r 0 is equal to 430 m2 the values of the scale coefficients are approximately equal to 0 3 and 0 6 for the cn and hcn parts respectively so that tb 2 the low value of the scale coefficient of the cn part of the a q curve suggests the choice of area 2 as the reference value for the grid refinement process from which we have the river network highlighted in green in fig 15b then reading on the a axis the quantities a h1 a h2 a c1 and a c2 we computed the values of the parameters α and β equal to 7 1 and 8 1 respectively and rmax equal to 47 m2 see fig 15 next we obtained the two values for minimum resolution that are equal to rmin α 336 m2 rmin β 383 m2 the final values of rmin and rmax are fixed according to the following consideration the value of tb induced us to consider the minimum value between rmin α and rmin β so that rmin was set to 336 m2 moreover according to the value assumed by the coefficient b of the cn part of the a q curve we assumed the scale correction factor at around 2 so that the rmax value can be considered equal to 23 m2 fig 15c shows the comparison between the simulated discharge performed using the heuristic procedure in which the scale correction factor is considered grid a2 s c and other simulated ones related to different grids obtained assuming a uniform resolution throughout the basin setting the grid size equal to 20 m2 that approximately corresponds to rsim 0 5 m2 km2 that is the reference solution and 200 m2 that approximately corresponds to rsim 5 m2 km2 b grid a2 in which no scale correction factor is provided c rsim 10 m2 km2 which is the coarse grid generated at the beginning of the procedure the details of the grids the errors ed efa efa cn and the time savings in respect to the reference solutions are reported in table 4 the results shown in fig 15c and in table 4 confirm what was already observed for the ap and er basins in particular it is interesting to note that the grid a2 has practically the same mean resolution of that related to rsim 5 m2 km2 but the overall results are significantly different specifically the error on the simulated discharge ed is halved whereas those related to the flooded areas efa and channel networks area efa cn are reduced by a factor of 4 a further significant improvement is obtained using the scale correction see grid a2 s c for which the errors efa and efa cn are one order of magnitude lower than those related to grid a2 and the error ed is halved finally the last simulation carried out here is focused on the analysis of the results for a variable in time rainfall specifically a chicago hyetograph obtained from the available rainfall duration curve of the basin and related to a return period of 200 years was considered to analyse the performance of the grids generated before related to a constant rainfall fig 16 shows the comparison between the simulations related to use of the grid a2 with scale correction and the reference grid rsim 0 5 m2 km2 in terms of discharge at the outlet and maximum unit discharges the simulated discharges are very close together fig 16a some discrepancies can be observed looking at the first peak but the overall phenomenon is reproduced similarly by the two simulations in terms of times to peak arrival times and shape of the flood wave fig 16b highlights that the flood hazard maps in terms of the product between water depth and velocity are substantially similar even though some little differences can be observed specifically the lowest order streams are not always rightly detected by the simulation related to the grid a1 s c but the overall extent and the values of the unit discharges are practically the same for example fig 16c shows the comparison between the simulated unit discharge across the section s 1 highligted in fig 16b contrarily to what was previously observed for figs 7 and 8 no significant differences can be observed between the two simulations the time saving for this simulation is up to 75 5 discussion 5 1 limitations of the work and need of further analyses the generalization of the results obtained in this work is somewhat limited by three main issues the small size of the considered basins and their natural features the assumption of a constant roughness value throughout the basins and the role of infiltration that was not been considered here as regards the first aspect it is evident that the effectiveness of the heuristic procedure proposed here was tested only for basins having an area less than 50 km2 for bigger basins several elements should be carefully analysed for example the value of the simulation ratio rsim could give uniform grid which is too coarse that might not describe several low order streams moreover the range of scale correction factor is expected to be different in relation to basin size both these elements therefore require a much deeper evaluation than those performed here finally our study intrinsically refers to natural basin so at this stage of the development and analysis we cannot say anything about the reliability of the procedure in systems highly influenced by human interventions with flood defences specific applications and analyses are needed to realize how this procedure should be adapted in order to take into account the presence of man made structures the assumption of constant roughness value is a further signification limitation of this work in this context more analyses are needed to understand the effects of variable friction throughout the basin in terms of values assumed by the scaling coefficients of the cn and hcn parts of the a q curve and therefore on the assessment of the performance of the heuristic procedure for grid generation what it is expected is a behaviour similar to that already observed for the a hs curve see costabile et al 2019 for which decreasing values of the strickler coefficient assumed for the hillslope induced reductions of the steepening of hcn part of the scaling laws so the modifications of the ratio between rmin and rmax are likely to occur but the overall findings of this study are not influenced by a differentiation of the roughness values throughout the catchment as a potential proof of this it might be useful to recall that the bimodal behaviour of the a q curve was already observed when assuming different values of the manning strickler coefficient between the channel networks and the hillslope see fig 5b regardless of the differentiation of the manning coefficients it should be observed that a suitable evaluation of the effects of surface roughness on flow resistance in overland flow simulation is very challenging and several efforts are still needed to establish proper criteria to deal with this phenomenon using the swes kirstetter et al 2016 taccone et al 2020 crompton et al 2020 finally this work does not consider any infiltration rate since we prefer to initialize the 2 d swes using net rainfall the results of this research should be further analysed in the light of the infiltration losses considering the interrelation to the roughness values and grid resolution fernández pato et al 2016 ni et al 2020 5 2 potential impact of the research despite the limitations described in the previous section this paper may have several impacts on different fields of research that can be summarized as follows 5 2 1 flood mapping studies and rainfall runoff simulations one of the primary interests of this research is for flood mapping studies in natural basins and rainfall runoff simulations using 2 d physically based models mesh properties are major factors that can influence the results caviedes voullième et al 2012 affecting for example hydrologic connectivity and maximum depression storage yu and harbor 2019 and peak discharge habtezion et al 2016 in practice mesh resolution is subject to the modeller s practical experience and the reason why a specific mesh or the grid refinement to assign to a specific area is rarely discussed or evaluated using specific criteria just to provide some examples nguyen et al 2016 used a fine 10 m and coarse 200 m resolution considering the distance from the river network cea and bladé 2015 used a coarse grid for the hillslope 30 m and a finer one in the channel network 10 m but no particular explanation about this choice was introduced hu and song 2018 set the element side variable in the range 35 m 100 m without any motivation for this differentiation the heuristic procedure presented here can avoid the subjective choice of the modellers by giving practical criteria based on the geomorphic and hydrodynamic meaning of the a q curve for evaluating where the grid refinement is needed and how much refinement is needed this can lead to important time savings without significant reduction of accuracy moreover though not explored in this work the time savings can be further increased using a local time stepping methods see for example dazzi et al 2018 hu et al 2019a 2019b yang et al 2020 bout and jetten 2020 that can be easily implemented using non uniform grids similar to those discussed here or linking the information related to the ratio between rmax and rmin to strategies based on flexible hybrid grid hoch et al 2018 bomers et al 2019 the findings reported in this study could have other impacts for risk assessment both the hydraulic a hs and hydrodynamic a q curves can be considered as synthetic descriptors of the flood hazard throughout the basin since they provide information about the extent of the areas associated to given hydrodynamic conditions represented by water levels or specific discharges equal to or greater than a specific threshold however the a q has an important added value for risk assessment beside its usefulness for the identification of the most important areas in terms of water volume fluxes at the catchment scale the scaling properties introduced here are a key element for local flood hazard assessment and therefore for the differentiation of the hazard classification in the areas belonging to the basin as is well known a suitable combination of velocity and flow depth and thus the specific discharge through properly devised vulnerability curves represents the potential effects of the flow on a target such as the assessment of damage to structures and buildings bermúdez and zischg 2018 milanesi et al 2018 people xia et al 2014 arrighi et al 2017 and vehicles martínez gomariz et al 2018 the results shown here highlight that the extent of the areas characterized by a given threshold value in terms of flood hazard assessment decreases as the threshold itself increases according to the power law relation for a significant range of values 5 2 1 1 channel heads detection an important implication of this study relates to channel heads detection as a key factor of drainage networks precise channel heads recognition is of great importance for drainage network extraction first physically based hydrologic and soil erosion models must distinguish between overland runoff on hillslopes and water flow in channels and use accurate channel heads to depict real scale hillslope channel units and corresponding parameters for model simulation see for example julien et al 1995 lin et al 2018 second the location of channel heads has a high impact on the morphometric and scaling properties of a drainage network gangodagamage et al 2011 such as drainage density length of drainage paths and horton s ratios in this field of research several methods were traditionally proposed to extract channel networks from dem see e g tarboton 1997 orlandini and moretti 2009 and further developments were provided thanks to the modern lidar techniques e g hooshyar et al 2016 sangireddy et al 2016 some reviews on this topic can be found in tarolli 2014 and wohl 2018 but an effective and efficient channel heads detection is still recognized as a challenging problem in drainage network extraction wu et al 2019 li et al 2020 a significant part of this study is based on the criterion used to separate the flow patterns related only to channel network from those ones that characterize hillslope plus channel network we showed that the a q curve exhibits a break of the derivative similar to those already observed in costabile et al 2019 in terms of water depths threshold the corresponding river network and thus the channel head location are very similar this observation leads to the conclusions that the criteria based on hydrodynamic characterization of the river networks proved to be a reliable alternative approach to perform this task 5 2 1 2 scaling relationship related to stream discharge and active drainage network our findings may have implications on the research field related to the analysis of active drainage network and associated stream discharge it is well known that stream discharge and network extent and their variability in time impact on several environmental issues e g allen and pavelsky 2018 ward et al 2018 van meerveld et al 2019 the question related to how drainage density of the actively flowing network varies in seasonal and event time scales is particularly important from hydrological ecological and biogeochemical points of view in this context godsey and kirchner 2014 observed a power law scaling between wetted channel lengths and the discharge at the catchment outlet highlighting that flowing stream network extends and retracts both seasonally and in response to individual precipitation events barefoot et al 2019 examined how the width and surface area of headwater streams changed across a range of runoff conditions noting that the total stream surface area also varied as a power law function of runoff measured at the outlet in particular they considered inundated stream surface area as a rectangle having an area equal to network length times mean width the tendency of stream networks to extend and retract can be predicted from down valley changes in topographic attributes since topography determines where water accumulates within valley networks modulating flow partitioning between the surface and subsurface prancevic and kirchner 2019 the flow patterns simulated by the 2d swes might be used to predict or reproduce the power law relations mentioned above describing the variability of flowing streams networks to precipitations determining their width surface area and length so that they are potentially strictly connected to the observations made by godsey and kirchner 2014 furthermore it is intuitive that the scaling laws proposed in this work might be used in relation to the previous ones since they refer to conceptually similar variables for example the relation between surface areas of the streams and runoff at the outlet observed by barefoot et al 2019 can be extracted by our approach focusing on the cn part of the a q curve moreover once a high resolution dem is available the accurate description of surface runoff made using the basic principles of mass and momentum conservation allows one to analyse and to differentiate flow patterns channelized in both the main river and in all the tributaries flowing down the hillslopes or stored in small depressions therefore this approach may interact with observations and field data to develop a new tool of analyses and new approaches to analyse the tendency of stream networks to extend and retract at least to the event time scale 6 conclusions this paper aimed at providing an original framework based on the use of 2d swes in which to analyse river network properties in order to contribute to the understanding of environmental processes dependent on them and more specifically to derive practical indications for rainfall runoff simulations at the basin scale therefore the new knowledge that we can extract by the rigorous analysis of the different drainage structures represented by flow patterns simulated by the 2 d swes represented the focus and core of this work the main conclusions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the flow patterns simulated by the 2 d swes can be characterized from a hydrodynamic point of view by introducing a scaling law that describes the relation between a non dimensional unit discharge threshold used to identify the active network cells and a dimensionless area defined by the ratio between the total area of the network cells themselves and the total basin area in particular the bimodal scale behaviour is useful to separate channel network flow patterns from the channel plus hillslope network ones the area in which the break of the derivative is located can be used to select that specific configuration of active network cells that are useful to locate the extent of the channel network area 2 the scale coefficient b of the cn part of the a q was interpreted as the expansion of the hydrodynamically active areas in relation to hydrodynamic heterogeneity of the flow patterns throughout the channel network therefore it provides information related to how much the expansion of the hydrodynamically active areas is associated to an increase of the hydrodynamic variability or vice versa how much the hydrodynamic heterogeneity in the channel network is related to an increase on the hydrodynamically active areas so it can be considered as a morpho hydrodynamic feature of natural basins 3 based on some relevant parameters of the a q curve a heuristic procedure for a non uniform grid generation process was developed in particular it gives practical indications related to where grid refinement process makes sense and how much refinement is needed despite the limitations of this work and the early stage of development the results obtained using this procedure seem to be very promising in terms of accuracy of simulated discharges hydrodynamic behaviour of the river network and flooded areas reducing significantly the computational times in respect to the use of uniform fine grids credit authorship

4452,the application of two dimensional shallow water equations models 2d swes for the description of hydrodynamic based surface runoff computations is becoming a reference approach in rainfall runoff simulations at the catchment scale due to their ability in generation of flow patterns throughout the basin they can be used not only as an advanced method for flood mapping studies and hazard assessment but also as an innovative tool for the analysis of river drainage networks opening new perspectives for several environmental processes in particular in this work we put the river networks in a 2d swes framework meaning that the traditional tree like fluvial structure represented by a skeleton composed of a set of lines is replaced by a collection of points discretizing the 2 d geometry of the river structure itself for which the values of the hydrodynamic values are provided by the numerical simulations this approach is used here to derive a new scaling property that relates the specific discharge threshold used to identify the river network cells to the total areas of the network cells themselves the hydrodynamic and geomorphological interpretation of this power law function and the influence of grid resolution on some relevant parameters of this curve have inspired the development of a heuristic procedure for non uniform grid generation able to detect the most hydrodynamically active areas of the basins for which the grid refinement process makes sense moreover information related to how much grid refinement is needed is provided as well the performances of this procedure are very promising in terms of accuracy of simulated discharges hydrodynamic behaviour of the river network and flooded areas reducing significantly the computational times in respect to the use of fine uniform grids keywords 2d shallow water equations surface runoff river networks non uniform grids channel heads scaling laws 1 introduction river drainage networks have been studied for several decades from a range of geomorphological and hydrological perspectives since they represent pathways to transport environmental fluxes such as water intended as resource and hazard counts nutrient and sediment rodríguez iturbe et al 2009 therefore several environmental processes need their structure and dynamics to be understood and quantified in order to provide an effective management and prediction of various phenomena in hydrology hazard assessment sediment transport and ecology see for example benda et al 2004 zaliapin et al 2010 czuba and foufoula georgiou 2015 pilotti et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 river networks have been shown to exhibit various properties such as self similarity and scaling laws across a range of scales rodríguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 specifically they were studied from a physical geometrical and hydraulic point of view introducing specific scaling laws that represent within a given river basin the relationships of scale invariance between topological variables dodds rothman 1999 gangodagamage et al 2011 le and kumar 2014 mantilla et al 2012 or between channel characteristics such as mean depth water surface width mean velocity length of active wet channels and discharge see for example godsey and kirchner 2014 hooshyar et al 2015 lawrence 2007 nardi et al 2006 stewardson 2005 due to the importance for geomorphologic analyses environmental assessments and hydrologic simulations it is evident that the accuracy of drainage networks is a key factor for the reliability and validity of related research in this context one of the main relevant aspects is represented by the precise detection of channel heads which plays a fundamental role for drainage network extraction for a couple of reasons li et al 2020 first the differentiation between overland runoff on hillslopes and water flow in channels is essential for physically based models at the catchments scale and for the associated parameters for model simulations second the morphometric and scaling properties of a river network drainage density length of drainage paths etc are influenced by the location of channel heads information about the drainage patterns and the topographic features can be extracted from digital elevation models dems for which a common procedure consists of dem processing to obtain flow directions flow accumulation and the drainage network thanks to the increasing availability and use of dem data the development of distributed hydrological models and the introduction of simulation techniques at the catchment scale grew quickly paniconi and putti 2015 singh 2018 most of the processes of the hydrological cycle can be described in a distributed way by representing the catchment itself in as many computational cells as necessary in this way each computational element forming the discrete mesh works as a water and sediment control volume in which a lot of processes rainfall input infiltration losses variation of bed levels due to erosion deposition can be taken into account fernández pato et al 2020 in this context the application of two dimensional shallow water models 2d swes for the description of hydrodynamic based surface runoff computations in rainfall runoff simulations at the catchment scale is a reference approach as testified by the plethora of studies which appeared in the related literature in the last 10 years cea et al 2010 2014 costabile et al 2012 2013 caviedes voullième et al 2012 2020 simons et al 2014 liang et al 2015 huang et al 2015 cea and bladé 2015 fernández pato and garcia navarro 2016 fernández pato et al 2016 2018 bellos and tsakiris 2016 xia et al 2017 bout et al 2018 hou et al 2018a bellos et al 2020 ni et al 2020 this approach sometimes referred to as the direct rainfall method yu and harbor 2019 jamali et al 2019 consists in the application of rainfall to each cell of the two dimensional domain the consequent runoff is then routed by the 2d hydrodynamic model this approach seems to be attractive for modelers and scientists because it significantly reduces the need for hydrologic modelling for the runoff estimation and consequently the number of models for generation and propagation of surface runoff at a basin scale hall 2015 for this reason the application of 2 d software packages using a direct rainfall method such as hec ras starts to be considered in the literature david and schmalz 2020 costabile et al 2020a the use of 2 d hydrodynamic based rainfall runoff simulations at the catchment scale may represent an innovative approach for the analysis of basin drainage networks from geomorphological and hydrological perspectives in particular the traditional tree like fluvial structure represented by a skeleton composed of a set of lines following the properties of the quantitative fluvial geomorphology strahler 1975 are replaced by a collection of points discretizing the 2 d geometry of the river structure itself so that the drainage network width is implicitly described in a high resolution scale closer to reality this view has been introduced recently by costabile et al 2019 who introduced novel scaling properties related to the hydraulic characterization of river networks and a very promising method for channel heads detection based on the flow patterns simulated by a 2d swes model the application of this line of thinking and research requires high resolution topographic data at the catchment scale the increasing use of high performance computing techniques lacasta et al 2015 juez et al 2016 xia et al 2019 aureli et al 2020 makes the running of 2d swes simulations using such high resolutions more feasible than before as proof of this real time modelling based on this approach start to be analysed in the literature ming et al 2020 however this issue remains challenging because of the high computational cost associated to the of large number of cells that is usually required to represent the topography fernández pato et al 2018 a popular option to reduce the computational times is based on grid coarsening see for example özgen et al 2015 this approach however reduces resolution and therefore the overall accuracy of the simulations depending on to what extent the selected mesh is able to capture the microtopography and the small scale hydrological processes of the terrain khosh bin ghomash et al 2019 indeed model results are strongly dependent on mesh selection because complex interactions exist between grid resolution friction and infiltration features caviedes voullième et al 2012 fernández pato et al 2016 so that the assessment of the effects induced by resolution reduction on the hydrological hydrodynamic response of a natural catchment to a rainfall input is a relevant issue in the literature related to these issues the choice of the mesh type assumes a key importance some studies concluded that there is not an optimal grid for 2d flood modelling because each element type e g triangle and quadrilateral is advantageous under different circumstances kim et al 2014 therefore some papers suggested the use of a flexible or hybrid mesh hoch et al 2018 bomers et al 2019 meaning that different geometrical shapes at various resolutions are applied to discretize the study area or adaptive grids hu et al 2018 2019a 2019b savant et al 2019 able to be adapted optimally in time and space in response to the evolving flow features other studies have focused on mesh refinement by the detection of key topographic features where the high resolution mesh is needed while the mesh in the rest of the domain remains coarse hou et al 2018b an alternative recent approach is based on the assumption that each natural catchment contains a characteristic scale that can be used for the generation of a priori computational grids that are potentially able to detect areas for which a grid refinement is needed ferraro et al 2020 however only a few studies faced these issues at the catchment scale since attention was mostly focused on urban areas i e costabile and macchione 2015 de almeida et al 2018 the purposes of this work are linked to the general framework described so far specifically the paper aims to shed new light on the research related to the use of 2d swes modelling at the catchment scale highlighting the added value that the simulated flow patterns may provide in terms of both the hydrological hydrodynamic and geomorphological analysis of river networks and flood mapping studies the focus of this work is the development of a novel framework through which to analyse geomorphic and hydrodynamic properties of the river networks expressed in greater detail the goals of this work are 1 to introduce new scaling properties related to the hydrodynamics of the flow patterns characterizing the river networks that may be useful to analyse geomorphic and hydrologic features of the catchment 2 to show the potential of these properties as a tool to assess the effects induced by the computational grid used to discretize the topography of the basins in terms of simulated discharges flooded areas flood hazard and physical structures of the river networks 3 to use some relevant features of these properties for the generation of efficient and accurate computational grids in such a way to have information about where the grid refinement process is needed and how much grid refinement is required this paper is organized as follows conceptualization and methodological issues are firstly presented section 2 together with the selected catchments analysed in this study section 3 then the results are extensively shown in section 4 in which the scaling property its geomorphological meaning and the effects of grid resolution are discussed in the same section attention will be devoted to highlight how these results may be used to develop a heuristic procedure based on the derived scaling property for the generation of non uniform grids facing the issues related to the grid refinement process and how much grid refinement is needed section 4 the limitations and the potential impacts of this research are discussed in section 5 while in section 6 the main conclusions of this study are presented 2 conceptualization and methodological issues 2 1 2 d swes according to rainfall on grid approach the core of the methodological procedure of this work is based on the use of the 2 d swes as a tool for surface runoff and river basin network analyses as is well known the swes describe the physical principles of mass and momentum conservation the conservative form of those equations can be expressed as in eq 1 1 u t f x g y s where 2 u h h u h v f hu h u 2 g h 2 2 h u v g hv h u v h v 2 g h 2 2 s r f g h s 0 x s fx g h s 0 y s fy in which t s is time x y are the horizontal coordinates h m is the water depth u v m s are the depth averaged flow velocities in x and y directions g m s2 is the gravitational acceleration r m s is the rain intensity and f m s the infiltration losses s0x s0y m m are the bed slopes in x and y directions sfx sfy are the friction slopes in x and y directions as one can note in eq 2 the source term s in the mass continuity equation is not zero both the rainfall and the infiltration losses are included here in this manner the swes have the ability to apply rain directly to a two dimensional grid leading to the so called direct rainfall method or rainfall on grid approach as mentioned in the introduction for the numerical integration of eq 1 the finite volume method fvm approach has been considered in particular the roe scheme roe 1981 first order accurate in time and space was used for the computation of the numerical fluxes moreover suitable numerical treatments of the source terms and wet dry fronts were applied costabile et al 2013 an unstructured grid based on irregular triangular elements was used to obtain the computational domains though flexible hybrid grids are expected to reduce computational times significantly we preferred the use of triangular grids because they are easy to generate and to analyse and therefore suit well to the general purpose of this work the mathematical aspects and performances in real cases were already presented in previous works costabile et al 2019 2020b 2021 and therefore are not reported here it is important to observe that this model is characterized by well balanced properties one of the several consequences of this is the use of a digital elevation model without removing topographic depressions that once filled by water easily allow the propagation of surface runoff finally it may be important to underline that the numerical code used here was parallelized using openmp and mpi directives in order to obtain a drastic reduction of the computational times 2 2 use of the swes for the river network analysis and modelling assumptions the method used here for the river networks analysis is based on the approach proposed by costabile et al 2019 in which the flow patterns are obtained from a swes simulation specifically once a specific precipitation input is assigned the numerical solution of the swes provides the spatial and temporal evaluation of the water depths h and the velocities u v throughout the basin except when specifically underlined a constant in time and uniform in space rainfall is used for the computations presented in this work in practice we assume a simple constant and uniform hyetograph in order to reach steady state conditions as regards the runoff generation mechanism this work focuses attention on the simulation of extreme events in which infiltration excess is considered to be the dominant process therefore there is the need to provide an estimation of infiltration losses f for the computation of the net rainfall s r f however considering the purpose of the work the swes model was initialized using a fictitious inflow s to route everywhere into the basin according to the mass and momentum balances in order to generate the potential flow patterns through which the water is collected in the channels stored in small depressions or flows down the hillslope a second assumption is related to the roughness values used for the computation of friction slopes that should be estimated carefully and differentiated throughout the basin beside the influence of land use and soil type roughness values for shallow flow on hillslopes are expected to be much larger than those in the channels due to the water depth that is much less than the size of the roughness elements however in this study we chose a constant manning coefficient over the whole catchment this choice implies an idealization of the case studies but considering that attention here is not focused on reconstruction of observed events we preferred to simplify the analysis of the results by reducing as much as possible the number of parameters that may further complicate the analysis of those specific aspects representing the purposes of the work and described in section 2 3 2 3 derivation of a new scaling law based on specific discharge threshold and implication for grid generation process one of the main results obtained in costabile et al 2019 is the description of the hydraulic behaviour of the flow patterns simulated by the 2 d swes by means of a bimodal scaling law that describe the relations between the water depth threshold hs used to identify the network cells and a dimensionless area a defined by the ratio between the total area of the network cells themselves and total basin area a specifically a computational cell is considered as belonging to the network cells only if the water depth computed in that cell in steady state condition for a given rainfall input is equal to or greater than hs the relevant aspect related to the a hs curve is that the points of coordinates log hs log a tend to be arranged according to two linear laws having significantly different slopes that proved to be representative of the channel network cn and hillslope plus channel network hcn flow patterns the part of the graph in which a break of the derivative is detected can be used as the area useful to define the specific value of hs associated to the channel network for further details one can refer to costabile et al 2019 but some a hs curves will be shown later on in this work for comparative purposes in this work since attention is focused on the hydrodynamic characterization of the river network we cannot use the water depth threshold used in our previous work therefore the simulation results are globally presented as a function of a threshold value in terms of specific discharge or discharge per unit of width qs hv which is the product between water depth h and the modules v of the velocity a generic cell is identified as a network cell when its specific discharge is equal to or greater than a pre fixed threshold value qs in other words a generic cell is defined as active or not depending on the satisfaction of the previous condition in order to compare the results obtained for the selected basins the variable q qs q is introduced defined as the ratio between the threshold value qs and the unit discharge related to steady state condition computed in the outlet section q the structure of the relation a q will be discussed in relation to the scaling law a hs proposed by costabile et al 2019 in order to propose an original approach for the overall hydrodynamic characterization of the flow patterns representing the river networks the main features of the a q law will be also analysed in the light of the grid element size used for the numerical solution of the 2 d swes this is a key aspect in overland flow modelling because the selected size of the computational element for the uniform grid or more generally the different resolution used inside the domain for the unstructured ones are often introduced in the computation without a real motivation and while neglecting the potential effect on the hydrodynamics of the surface runoff as already mentioned in the introduction the choice of the grid resolution is expected to have significant impacts on both the accuracy of the results and the overall computational times the methodological aspect related to this part of the work will be represented by the analysis of the modification induced on the scaling law a q considering the same rainfall input but using different uniform resolution by changing the parameter rsim defined in eq 3 3 r sim r 0 a m 2 k m 2 that is the ratio between the area of the computing cell r0 related to a uniform grid and the area of the basin a finally the analysis of rsim on the physical structure of the river network the related hydrodynamic characterization of the flow patterns and discharge hydrograph will provide key information in order to establish a procedure for grid generation using different resolutions throughout the domain in this context attention will be devoted to the development of a heuristic procedure able to provide practical indications on both where grid refinement is needed and how much refinement is needed specifically the idea followed here is based on the identification of the most important areas from a hydrodynamic point of view in other words attention is focused on those areas that greatly influence the overall dynamics of the surface runoff propagation that tend to be characterized by the most significant amount of conveyed water volume these areas are assumed to be the most important areas of the basin that require a more accurate description of the topography the remaining areas are considered to be less significant from a hydrodynamic point of view for which there is no need to use a fine grid in this way it is possible to drastically reduce the total number of the computational elements obtaining significant computational time savings without reducing the overall accuracy of the solution the original aspect presented in this work is to exploit some relevant information represented by the a q law in order to identity those specific areas and to have indications about the resolution to assign to both the most active hydrodynamic areas and the remaining parts of the basins this approach as will be shown in the next section takes advantages of some features of the simulated flow patterns that are not very much influenced by the grid resolution therefore the procedure that will be discussed later on in this work aimed at the generation of efficient and accurate grids is based on two steps 1 simulation using a uniform grid having a coarse resolution r 0 in order to find out the most active hydrodynamic areas of the basin according to the indications provided by the a q law 2 grid refinement process in the areas detected in the previous step defining criteria to compute the ratio between the maximum and minimum resolutions rmax rmin all the details related to the reasoning followed to select rmin and rmax as well as the choice of the more proper specific discharge threshold for the identification of the most active hydrodynamic areas will be provided in the next section in the light of the obtained results 3 analysed basins available data and description of the numerical tests three actual catchments and one idealized basin were analysed in this work see fig 1 each of them was selected for specific reasons 3 1 actual basins two small basins namely ap and er see fig 1a b were used for the analysis related to the understanding of the basic features of the a q curve that in turn inspired that heuristic procedure for non uniform grid generation the ap basin is not new in the literature see for example perron et al 2012 de bartolo et al 2016 costabile et al 2019 it is located in the allegheny plateau region pennsylvania usa the basin area is equal to 3 91 km2 whereas the mean slope is approximately equal to 11 the er basin already used in costabile et al 2019 belongs to the south fork of the eel river in mendocino county california usa its basin area is 2 33 km2 and the mean slope is 18 further details on these basins can be found in references cited above the reason why we intentionally chose these two basins is the significantly different structure of their drainage patterns as will be highlighted later on in this paper this is essential for the purposes of this study that is devoted to the hydrodynamic characterization of the simulated flow patterns throughout the river basins by understanding the a q scaling property in significantly different situations for these two basins ideal simulations were carried out using a constant in time and uniform in space net rainfall s equal to 30 mm h having a duration greater than the concentration time of the basins so as to generate steady flow conditions as explained before in order to focus attention only on the grid resolution effects and thus to reduce as much as possible the total number of the variables a constant value of the manning coefficient was arbitrarily set 0 05 s m 1 3 due to the ideal features of our simulations finally another basin ar fig 1c one order of magnitude greater than the previous ones was considered to test the usefulness and easy of application of the proposed procedure for the generation of a computational grid based on the property of the a q law the ar basin belonging to the ardivestra catchment in the north of italy has an extent approximately equal to 43 km2 a mean altitude of 423 m above sea level a s l and length of the main river equal to 22 4 km for this basin two tests will be carried out the first one used relates to a constant in time and uniform in space net rainfall having a duration greater than the concentration time of the basins the second one uses a chicago hyetograph obtained by the available rainfall duration curve corresponding to a return period of 200 years in order to assess the validity of the procedure using rainfall input closer to reality for all the three basins lidar bare ground data are available from which 1 m dems were extracted 3 2 idealized basin an idealized basin fig 1d used as a test case in the literature for validating surface runoff models see for example di giammarco et al 1996 shu et al 2020 and for which an analytical solution is available stephenson and meadows 1986 was used to strengthen the geomorphological interpretation provided for the a q law it is a v shaped catchment having a single slope on both the plane s p 0 05 and the channel s c 0 02 the depth of the channel varies from 1 m at the upstream end to 20 m at the downstream end the intensity of the rainfall input is 10 8 mm h and a duration of 1 5 h the precipitation does not affect the channel interesting only the valley side the assigned values of the manning s coefficients are 0 05 s m 1 3 for the valley side and 0 15 s m 1 3 for the channel 4 results using a uniform grid composed by triangular elements with resolution of 1 m2 the a q curves obtained for the ap and er basins are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively highlighting also the physical structure of the flow patterns for different values of the threshold q the identification of the hydrodynamically active areas of the basin active cells can be carried out using a level of details depending on the value of the selected threshold q it should be recalled that the hydrodynamically active areas of the basin are intended here as that set of network cells having specific discharges greater to or equal than the threshold q section 2 3 and as consequence are a function of this quantity q as a parameter is able to describe different features of the hydrodynamically active areas of the basin due to the fact that higher values of q detect more channelized flow patterns whereas the lowers ones include also overland flow patterns so as can be observed in both the figures the network cells areas decrease for increasing values of q providing fluvial network structures in which the lower orders stream progressively vanish as already observed for the a hs curve costabile et al 2019 the points of coordinates log a log q tend to be arranged according to two linear laws having different slopes as highlighted by the black dot lines in figs 2 and 3 as for the a hs curve it is quite easy to identify a range of q values highlighted in the green boxes of figs 2 and 3 in which the break of the derivative occurs for higher values of q the aggregation of the points describes only channelized flow patterns whereas for lower values overland flow patterns on hillslopes are also visualized moreover it can be observed that for very low values of q the points tend to cover the whole basin see for example the network associated to q l in figs 2 and 3 whereas for the higher ones a structured channel network cannot be detectable easily because only the main course of the river seems to be described see for example the network associated to q r in figs 2 and 3 these two situations are somewhat highlighted by the behaviour of the a q relation that diverges from the two straight black dot lines for values lower than q 1 and higher than q 2 for these reasons the differentiation between cn and hcn flow patterns introduced by costabile et al 2019 for the a hs curve can be applied also to the a q relation therefore q 1 can be seen as the threshold value that identifies the flow patterns of the fully developed channel network including the low discharges contributions flowing in the most peripheral parts of the basin conversely q 2 detects only those areas in which the most significant values of the specific discharges occur typically the most channelized part of the main courses the two straight lines can be described by a bimodal scaling law the analytical formulation of which can be expressed as in eq 4 4 a a q b in which a and b are two parameters the scale parameters b for the simulations related to figs 2 and 3 are equal to 0 35 cn and 1 10 hcn for the ap basin while for the er basin are equal to 0 52 cn and 1 hcn 4 1 geomorphological and hydrodynamic interpretation of the a q curve the meaning of the scale parameter b of the cn part of the curve can be provided looking at fig 4 in which the quantities used for its computation were highlighted in particular da may be seen as a measure of the increase of the areas covered by lower discharges of the channel network which are progressively described for a decreasing value of q in respect to the higher ones flowing in the most channelized part of the main courses only in this sense it might also be interpreted as an indicator of the amount of the total channel network area covered by the minor hydrographic network being related to the expansion of the hydrodynamically active areas when moving from the higher to the lower specific discharges dq is an indicator of the variability of the specific discharges throughout the channel network and therefore may be considered as a measure of the hydrodynamic heterogeneity since the scale coefficient of the cn part of the curve is b da dq it is the expansion of the hydrodynamically active areas in relation to hydrodynamic heterogeneity of the flow patterns throughout the channel network therefore for a given value of dq a lower value of b means a lower values of da so that the hydrodynamic variability inside the channel network is essentially confined in the main courses conversely a higher values of b means a higher value of da so that the hydrodynamic heterogeneity involves significantly the minor hydrographic network as regards the scale parameter b that characterizes the hcn part of the a q curve it should be recalled that the hcn flow patterns take into account also the runoff over hillslopes therefore they describe a kind of sum of effects related to channelized and overland flow and so the value of b should not be considered in itself but in relation to the value of the scale exponent b of the cn part in general the b value of hcn structures is expected to be significantly greater than the homologous of the cn ones due to the nature of overland flow processes specifically for a given increase of the hydrodynamic heterogeneity beyond the cn part of the curve a significant increase of the hydrodynamically active areas is expected because no significant channelization occurs and therefore the absence of important flow confinements leads to a sudden increase of the hydrodynamically active areas a measure of this process may be given by the ratio between the scale exponents characterizing the hcn and the cn structures hereafter identified as tb the value of which is expected to be very high as the drainage patterns over hillslopes have no kind of topographic constraints that would confine the flow a very strong break of the derivative of the a q curve that means a high value of tb can occur when the overland flow on hillslopes is similar to what can happen on a plane that is an ideal case limit for which the topography has no differentiated flow patterns and therefore it plays essentially the role of water flux transfer without channelization or storage capacity the idealized v shaped basin shown in section 3 2 is particularly useful to check the validity of the interpretations given so far for this situation the scale parameter b of the cn part is expected to assume a very low value because all the hydrodynamic variability can only be limited to the main course and so the increase of the hydrodynamically active areas is likely to be very low moreover a very high value of tb is expected since the idealized hillslopes cannot have heterogenous flow patterns induced by topographic constraints the validity of our simulation is testified by the numerical discharge computed at the outlet of the channel depicted in fig 5 a that highlights a very good agreement with the analytical solution available for this test as regards both the rising limb of the hydrograph and the time to peak though this case has some different features in respect to other simulations shown before variable roughness and direct rainfall only on the two planes the a q curve shows the classic bimodal behaviour fig 5b however as can be seen from fig 5b the cn part of the curve shows a substantial horizontal behaviour in which the scale parameter b tends to zero 0 09 the value of b related to the hcn part of the curve is practically 2 so that the ratio tb between the two values is more than 20 therefore as expected a very strong discontinuity occurs for this test case confirming the interpretation of the a q curve provided before in the light of the considerations made so far the numerical values of the scale exponents of the two parts of the a q curve allows one to derive specific information useful to assess the different properties of the simulated flow patterns in actual basins the scale parameter b of the cn part of the a q curve for the ap basin is lower than the homologous one related to the er catchment this means that for the ap basin the hydrodynamic variability throughout the channel network is mostly limited in the main courses whereas in the er catchment it significantly involves also the minor hydrographic network so that the importance of the areas covered by lower order streams in respect to those of the main courses is higher for the er basin moreover the value of tb is approximately equal to 4 and 2 for the ap and er respectively this suggests that the flow patterns over hillslopes for the er basin show a tendency to be more structured than the homologous ones of the ap basin this means that the overall hydrodynamic behaviour of these two basins is significantly different finally it may be important to provide evidence about the agreement between the channel networks simulated by the hydraulic scaling law a hs proposed in costabile et al 2019 and the hydrodynamic one a q discussed in this work for example fig 6 shows that comparison for er basin using the thresholds highlighted by the black arrows in figs 6a b highlighting only some little differences between the networks shown in figs 6c 6d so considering the uncertainties in the precise localization of the threshold limits the flow patterns obtained by the a q curve can be considered very similar to those derived by the a hs curve 4 2 influence of grid resolution the influence of grid resolution has a major importance for this work the results shown here will be the basis for the development of a heuristic procedure for the generation of efficient non uniform grids the performance of which will be discussed later on in this paper as explained in section 2 3 attention is firstly focused on triangular grids having almost uniform size and on their influences on the hydrodynamic characterization of the river network made so far for this reason simulations were performed using the following values of the parameter rsim defined in eq 3 0 5 5 10 m2 km2 for the ap basin this means the generation of grids having the following uniform resolution r 0 1 95 m2 19 5 m2 and 39 m2 as regards the er basin the grid elements area r 0 is 1 15 m2 11 5 m2 and 23 m2 4 2 1 influence of mesh resolution on both the scaling laws and the river network structures the effects of the grid coarsening on the physical structure of the river networks seen as their plan developments are shown in figs 7 and 8 that show a comparison between the channel networks obtained by using the criterion based on the a q curve related to finer rsim 0 5 m2 km2 and coarser rsim 10 m2 km2 grid resolutions in particular they highlight that some lowest order streams are not described due to the coarsening of the grid but the rest of the network seems to be substantially unaltered so that the overall plan development of the river network is not significantly affected by the grid resolution however the coarsening of the grid is expected to have consequences on the hydrodynamic behaviour of the simulated flow patterns involving variation in the distribution of water depths and velocities throughout the basins and consequently in the prediction of river widths in particular comparing figs 7a and 7b and figs 8a and 8b a generalized lowering of the specific discharges in the most channelized part of the main courses can be observed when moving from rsim 0 5 m2 km2 to rsim 10 m2 km2 and are further made evident by fig 7c and 8c in these two last figures the profile of the interpolated surface of the simulated non dimensional unit discharges in the points obtained by the intersection between the grid and cross sections highlighted in figs 7a b and 8a b are shown in particular the grid coarsening leads to a redistribution of the water fluxes from the most channelized part of the section to neighbouring areas on the right fig 7c the consequences of this are further amplified in more complex sections characterized by the presence of two main channels fig 8c in which the smoothing process induced by the the grid coarsening leads to a significant alteration of the hydrodynamic behaviour across the section itself the behaviour observed for these cross sections is quite generalized throughout the basins as the a q curves related to the considered rsim values immediately detects fig 9 specifically figs 9a b highlight that the influence of the grid coarsening on the a q curve is significant and in general seems not to be reflected similarly in the two basins the first observation relates to the increase of the river network area related to all the threshold values belonging to the cn and hcn parts of the a q profiles this also means a generalized overestimation of the flooded areas associated to a given hazard condition q that increases as the grid size increases on the other hand for higher values of q beyond the right end of the cn flow patterns typically characterizing just the more channelized part of the main river course as shown in figs 2 and 3 a significant steepening of the curve occurs that leads to a significant decrease of the river network areas associated to a given threshold value q from a practical point of view this means a reduction of the higher values of specific discharges that in turn artificially generates minor water fluxes in neighbouring areas fig 7c and significant alteration of the hydrodynamic behaviour across the sections fig 8c this smoothing process explains the increase of the active cell areas for a given threshold in the cn and hcn parts of the curve induced by grid coarsening and confirms what has been previously observed in the analysis of figs 7c and 8c however this effect has a different behaviour for the ap and er basin as can be observed in fig 9c d in which the straight dotted black lines represent the cn part of the a q relations for the finer and coarser grid for the ap basin the smoothing process induced by grid coarsening does not alter the scale coefficient b fig 9c conversely for the er basin fig 9d the variation of the scale coefficient b is more pronounced about 15 this means an alteration of the behaviour of the river network for which the hydrodynamic variability is associated to an expansion of the hydrodynamically active areas greater than those simulated for the finer grid therefore the spatial weight of the lower specific discharges in respect to those related to the higher ones falling in the cn part of the graphs is artificially increased by the increase of the grid size finally a last consideration can be made about the overall influence of the grid resolution on the hydrodynamically active areas that characterize both the hcn and cn parts of the a q curve in particular our interest here is to evaluate how much the grid coarsening impact on both the area of the channel network a c1 and the expansions of the hydrodynamically active areas of the cn and hcn side of the a q curve measured as the ratio β between a h1 a h2 and a c1 a c2 highlighted in fig 10 by evaluating these two quantities we have another element to understand that the grid coarsening has different effects on the two selected basins specifically both the channel network area and β increase by the same factor practically equal to 1 5 for the ap basin when moving from rsim 10 m2 km2 to rsim 0 5 m2 km2 conversely the dimensionless channel network area a c1 and the ratio β between the areal expansions of the hcn and cn flow patterns related to the er basin increase by a factor equal to 2 5 and 2 7 respectively when moving from rsim 10 m2 km2 to rsim 0 5 m2 km2 so that it can be considered substantially constant also for this basin it may be important to observe that this scale factor seems to be related to the value of scale parameter b of the cn part of the a q curve since it increases as b increases too 4 2 2 influence on the discharges at the outlet the grid resolution effects on the hydrodynamic behaviour of the flow patterns discussed before are expected to induce also some differences on the simulated discharges time to peak and front wave arrival times fig 11 shows the influence of grid resolution on the simulated discharges computed at the outlets of the two basins at first sight the overall profile of the simulated discharges seems to be not so different this is somewhat expected due to the very small extent of the two basins considered here however some significant details can be highlighted even in these cases the influence of grid coarsening on both the front arrival times and time to peak is different in the two basins as regards the ap basin fig 11a the increase of the grid size does not have a uniform impact on the simulated discharges specifically during the initial part of the rising limb slower waves seem to be generated but later on the opposite occurs so that the time to peak is anticipated by about 10 in respect to the simulation related to the finer grid this behaviour is not observed for the er basin fig 11b for which the increase of the grid size causes a slower flood wave so that the time to peak is delayed by about 15 the understanding of the reasons why the two basins have different hydrologic responses in relation to the grid size is not immediate and requires also detailed analyses of other case studies that cannot be addressed in this work however a possible motivation for this may be found in the modification of the features of the a q curve due to the grid resolution discussed previously as already underlined before the grid size increase has a different impact on the two basins in particular for the er basin the increase of the scale parameter means the increase of the areas covered by the lower specific discharges in respect to those relative to the main courses this might be an indication about the increase of the storage effect within the basin as the grid size increases leading to slower waves and delays of the time to peak this effect has not been observed in the ap basin for which b is practically constant furthermore some relevant features of the a q curve are modified differently by the grid resolution specifically the dimensionless channel network area a c1 and the ratio β between the expansions of the hcn and cn flow patterns areas assume different values as detected by the scale factor discussed in the section 4 2 1 approximately equal to 1 5 and 2 5 for the ap and er basins respectively so the different effects on the discharge hydrographs induced by grid resolution might be interpreted in the light of the different impacts observed in the behaviour of the a q curve of the two catchments even though a deeper analysis is needed to realize the potential effective link between these two elements 4 3 heuristic procedure based on the a q curve for the generation of non uniform grids the results shown in the previous section highlighted that the physical structure of the river network is not significantly influenced by the grid resolution except for some very low order streams that are not described however the a q curves show more significant differences in terms of hydrodynamic behaviour of the flow patterns due to grid resolution effects that reflect in part on simulated discharge at the basin outlet specifically some influences were observed in terms of time to peak and overall propagation times but compared to the expected significant saving of computational times the use of coarser grids seems not to be justified if attention is focused not so much on hazard conditions but on discharge computation however it should be born in mind that limited variations on discharge values are somewhat expected considering the small extent of the considered basins and by the low complexity of the numerical test considered here therefore most significant variations are likely to occur in bigger catchments as will be shown later in which there is the need to balance the computational times and the grid accuracy requirements as recalled before the identification of areas for which grid refinement should be provided in order to avoid significant worsening of the overall solution is generally ignored in the literature so what is discussed now is an approach aimed at the identification of the most hydrodynamically active parts of the domain in which to provide a grid refinement process thinning the resolution in the rest of the areas that are not so significant for the overall surface runoff at the same time the procedure should provide practical indications about the ratio between the maximum and minimum resolution to set in the generation of the grid the approach followed here aims at exploiting all the information related to the a q curve according to the two step procedure explained in section 2 3 in particular considering that the scale parameters characterizing the a q curve are not greatly influenced by the grid resolution as shown before the first step of the procedure is based on a uniform grid simulation having a coarse resolution r 0 this first simulation allows one to obtain a very fast solution of the a q curve that is assumed to be a rough approximation of that associated to a very detailed description of the basin this approximated curve is the basis for the identification of some relevant hydrodynamically active areas for which the resolution rmax is used and for a rough estimation of the ratio between rmin and rmax step 2 therefore the procedure requires 1 the choice of the threshold q in order to detect the most hydrodynamically active areas of the basin and 2 the definition of rmin and rmax in other words the first point is related to where the grid refinement is needed whereas the second point is associated to how much refinement is required 4 3 1 where the grid refinement is needed as regards the first problem attention should be focused on the cn part of the a q curve since the goal of this task is to reduce as much as possible the total number of computational elements different choices were explored as regards the most proper value of the threshold q to use for the delimitation of the most hydrodynamically active part of the basin to explore better this issue we considered three options 1 initial point 2 midpoint and 3 ending point of the cn part of the a q curve it is important to observe that the precise location of the initial point of the cn part from a graphical point of view is subject to some uncertainty an accurate evaluation of this can be performed only using a geomorphic descriptor obtained on a multifractal basis costabile et al 2019 that were not used here in order to simplify the proposed procedure as much as possible therefore in the framework of this work it seems better to talk not so much about specific initial mid ending points but of a range of values for which those points should be located for these reasons in figs 12 a and 13 a the areas in which we selected the initial mid ending points for the ap and er basins are represented using coloured boxes namely area 1 area 2 and area 3 the associated contours delimitating the areas for which rmax should be used are highlighted in figs 12b c d and 13b c d for the ap and er basin respectively in order to evaluate the differences in terms of areal extent among the three options considered in the fig 12a and 13a the red contour related to area 1 is reported in the figs 12f g and 13f g the grids related to area 1 area 2 and area 3 shown in figs 12 and 13 will be identified as grid a1 grid a2 and grid a3 respectively 4 3 2 how much refinement is needed estimation of rmin and rmax concerning this aspect one of the best choices is represented by the use of an a priori method as the one proposed by ferraro et al 2020 based on the 2 d power spectrum of the dem however the use of that approach is not of interest in this paper which is mainly based on the use of specific features of the a q curve for grid generation therefore in order to simplify the approach the choice of rmin and rmax may be left to the user however in order to provide useful indications to the users a heuristic procedure is proposed here on the basis of specific assumptions the basic idea of this procedure is to provide a link between the non uniform grid resolutions rmin and rmax and some information related to the extent of some relevant hydrodynamically active areas extracted by the a q curve a first assumption introduced is oriented to provide an estimation of rmax on the basis of the dimensionless channel network area a c1 identified on the a q curve near the break of the derivative see fig 10 which is what has been previously identified inside the red boxes of figs 12 and 13 in particular we compute rmax assuming that the simulation ratio rsim previously set by the user for the computation of the first attempt at uniform grid resolution r 0 has the same value when referred to both the whole basin area a and the network area as reported in eq 5 5 r sim r 0 a r max a c 1 a therefore eq 5 implies that rmax r 0 a c1 or rmax rsim a a c1 as regards rmin two options are suggested here both of them based on the assumption that the density of the computational cells should be constant in specific reference areas deduced by the a q curve specifically in the first option the density of the computational cells is the same inside the channel network area a a c1 and in the rest of the basin 1 a c1 a so that it is based on the same assumption used for rmax in eq 5 but referred to the complement to unity of the dimensionless channel network area 1 a c1 as specified in eq 6 6 r max a c 1 a r min 1 a c 1 a that leads to eq 7 7 r max r min 1 a c 1 1 α in the second option for the computation of rmin the two references areas are identified by the expansion of the hydrodynamically active areas observed in the cn and hcn parts of the a q curve and delimited by the green and blue dotted lines in fig 10 keeping the density of the computational cells constant eq 8 can be introduced 8 r max a c 1 a c 2 a r min a h 1 a h 2 a that leads to eq 9 9 r min r max a h 1 a h 2 a c 1 a c 2 β in which β has the same meaning of the parameter discussed in section 4 2 1 in the context of the scale factor the final step is to provide a scale correction recalling what has been stated in section 4 2 1 the ratio between the channel network area as simulated using rsim 10 m2 km2 and rsim 0 5 m2 km2 varies by a factor ranging from 1 5 to 2 5 therefore the rmax value computed from 5 related to a coarse resolution may be corrected considering that the a c1 value should be reduced using that factor to take into account the expected situation associated to the use of a finer grid considering that β increases substantially by the same factor and also the parameter α performs in the same way no correction is needed for rmin in order to reproduce the same ratios α and β that one could have for rsim 0 5 m2 km2 so the scale correction means the modification of the rmax value only reducing its value by a factor ranging between 1 5 and 2 5 it might be reasonable to assume 1 5 for lower values of the scale parameter b more or less 0 3 and 2 5 for the higher ones approximately 0 6 since the scale correction factor varies according to the scale parameter b in conclusion the rmax value is firstly predicted using relation 5 and then corrected and in particular reduced applying the scale correction factor this approach may provide an additional meaning to the parameter rsim it can be seen as information set by the user to compute a kind of upper limit related to the grid resolution to set in the channel network area 4 3 3 performances of the heuristic procedure for grid generation in this section the results obtained using the heuristic procedure based on information extracted by the a q curve related to a very coarse uniform grid are presented specifically using rsim 10 m2 km2 the relevant parameters for the application of the heuristic procedure are presented in table 1 considering the very low value assumed by rmax we did not apply the scale correction factor for these cases the main features of both the computational grids obtained by the heuristic procedures and the uniform ones are reported in table 2 the influence of where grid refinement is located is firstly discussed and then the effects of the proposed different ratios proposed in eqs 7 and 9 are analysed the results shown in fig 14 highlight the performance of grid a1 grid a2 and grid a3 that differ for the extent of the areas considered for the grid refinement process in which rmax is used outside these areas rmin has been set for these simulations we used the maximum values obtained for rmax which is related to the ratio β defined in eq 9 see table 1 for this reason the non uniform grids will be named as grid a1 β grid a2 β and grid a3 β the results were compared with reference to the benchmark solution that here is represented by the finest grid rsim 0 5 m2 km2 the comparative parameters are related to both simulated discharges at the basins outlets and hydrodynamic behaviour throughout the basins represented synthetically by the flooded areas extent a associated to a given hazard condition q moreover the computational time savings are considered as well specifically the performance indexes reported in eq 10 have been computed 10 e p i 1 n p p c i p r i p r i n p in which p d fa refers respectively to the simulated discharges d or the flooded areas extent fa obtained by the cn part of the a q curve the subscripts c and r refer to results obtained using the generic grid and the reference grid respectively n p are the number of data represented respectively by the number of instants of time in which the simulated discharge were computed and by the number of q values for which a is evaluated in the cn part of the a q curve in other words e d and e fa represent the mean absolute errors in terms of simulated discharges and flooded areas these latter ones related to each value of hazard condition q that characterizes the cn part of the a q moreover the mean error related only to the channel network area efa cn has been also computed see tables 2 and 3 as regards the ap basin it should be observed that the rmin value computed by the heuristic procedure approximately 36 m2 is similar to the value r 0 39 m2 related to rsim 10 m2 km2 and therefore is double the r 0 19 5 m2 related to rsim 5 m2 km2 despite that all the three grids provide results much closer to the reference simulation r sim 0 5 m2 km2 than those obtained by the uniform grids see fig 11 in particular the ed value associated to the a 1 β grid is three times lower than the homologous one related to the uniform grids moreover it is interesting to note that even the a 2 β and a 3 β grids provide better results in terms of simulated discharges than the grid related to rsim 5 m2 km2 despite the mean size rmean of the computational elements being greater see table 2 the performances of the grids generated using the heuristic procedure can be further appreciated looking at flooded areas related to specific hydrodynamic condition q in particular the efa value simulated by the a 1 β grid is one order of magnitude smaller than those computed by the uniform grids moreover efa values associated to a 2 β and a 3 β grids are practically half that of the homologous one related to rsim 5 m2 km2 if attention is focused on the channel network area particularly interesting is the performance of the a 2 β grid that gives the efa cn value very close to that related to the a 1 β grid the performance of the a 3 β grid is not as good as the other two the ed value is only a little bit lower than those of the uniform grids moreover though significantly better results are achieved in terms of efa the associated value is practically half of that related to rsim 5 m2 km2 the error in terms of channel network area efa cn is not so different finally it is important to highlight that the time savings obtained by all the grids are comparable though some little differences exist as expected however what is important to note here is the performances of the grids related to the heuristic procedure in respect to the uniform ones these allow one to obtain better results in comparable computational times the analysis of the simulations related to the er basin substantially confirms the previous considerations even though some significant difference exists also in this case the rmin value computed by the heuristic procedure approximately 20 m2 is similar to r 0 23 m2 computed for rsim 10 m2 km2 and thus double that related to rsim 5 m2 km2 11 5 m2 the results obtained by the grid a1 β are significantly better than those related to the uniform grids in particular the ed value is about four times lower than that related to simulation rsim 5 m2 km2 which has a comparable mean resolution value moreover looking at the flooded area values the efa value is significantly lower 3 5 against 19 5 and the mean absolute error in respect to the channel network area is drastically reduced 1 4 against 36 2 the results obtained by the other two grids generated by the heuristic procedure are not as good as those related to the grid a1 β in particular the results associated to the grid a2 β are less satisfying than those obtained for the ap basin specifically only the mean absolute error in terms of flooded areas value efa shows a significant benefit resulting not so different from those obtained using the grid a1 β the ed and efa cn values are respectively higher and lower than those related to rsim 5 m2 km2 even though they may be considered as comparable the grid a3 β results have the same features of those related to grid a2 β showing lower values in terms of efa and efa cn but a higher value of ed than those associated to rsim 5 m2 km2 finally all the grids allow one to obtain significant and comparable time savings in respect to the reference simulation rsim 0 5 m2 km2 but as for the ap basin this time only grid a1 β seems to be really useful the results obtained for the two basins allow us to highlight some common features in terms of where the grid refinement is needed one of the main common aspects is based on the observation that what is important is not so much the mean grid resolution but the distribution of the resolutions throughout the basin refining the grid only where it is really required this means that the overall hydrodynamic behaviour is influenced mostly by the resolution used for the channel network and only minimally by that related to the hillslope as in part expected for both the basins the performances of the grid a1 β are particularly good providing results very close to those obtained using the reference simulations despite the use of the mean resolution one order of magnitude lower in both the basins the performances of the grid a3 β highlight benefits limited essentially on the flooded areas estimation since the positive effects on the simulated discharges are not so significant the performances of the grid a2 β are somewhat contrasting for the ap basin it substantially provides results as accurate as those related to the grid a1 β the same consideration does not hold for the er basin this result is not surprising and can be explained using the geomorphologic interpretation of the a q provided in section 4 1 recalling that the overall hydrodynamic behaviour of these two basins is different in particular the analysis of the scale coefficient values b of the cn part of the curve highlighted that for ap basin the hydrodynamic variability throughout the channel network is mostly limited to the main courses whereas in the er catchment it involves significantly also the minor hydrographic network so that the importance of the areas covered by lower order streams in respect to those of the main course is higher for the er basin this means that for the er basin the grid refinement process should be more related to the location identified as area 1 which is substantially the channel network area than that named area 2 see fig 13 using the same reasoning for the ap basin the low value of the scale coefficient b is a strong indication about the fact that the grid refinement associated to the area 1 is probably useless so it is possible to achieve similar results using a reduced number of computational elements finally it may be important to underline that no significant differences were observed between the simulations in which rmin is computed using the ratio α or β see tables 2 and 3 so considering that β α for the analysed basins we preferred to show the hydrographs only for those simulations for which the worst results are expected due to the coarser grid used 4 3 4 application of the heuristic procedure generation to a bigger basin the ap and er basins were useful to understand both the main properties of the a q curve and their implications for the development of the heuristic procedure for grid generation which proved to be accurate and efficient the significance of the results is somewhat limited by the extent of these basins as they are smaller than 4 km2 therefore the last application shown in this work tries to overcome in part this limitation showing its potential and ease of application to the ar basin shown in section 3 which is of one order of magnitude greater than those considered up to now about 43 km2 furthermore beside the steps of the procedure the analysis of this basin allows us to discuss the role of the scale correction coefficient that was avoided previously the overall procedural steps are presented in fig 15 also in this case we set rsim 10 m2 km2 for the generation of the coarse grid for the estimation of the a q curve fig 15a in particular the value of r 0 is equal to 430 m2 the values of the scale coefficients are approximately equal to 0 3 and 0 6 for the cn and hcn parts respectively so that tb 2 the low value of the scale coefficient of the cn part of the a q curve suggests the choice of area 2 as the reference value for the grid refinement process from which we have the river network highlighted in green in fig 15b then reading on the a axis the quantities a h1 a h2 a c1 and a c2 we computed the values of the parameters α and β equal to 7 1 and 8 1 respectively and rmax equal to 47 m2 see fig 15 next we obtained the two values for minimum resolution that are equal to rmin α 336 m2 rmin β 383 m2 the final values of rmin and rmax are fixed according to the following consideration the value of tb induced us to consider the minimum value between rmin α and rmin β so that rmin was set to 336 m2 moreover according to the value assumed by the coefficient b of the cn part of the a q curve we assumed the scale correction factor at around 2 so that the rmax value can be considered equal to 23 m2 fig 15c shows the comparison between the simulated discharge performed using the heuristic procedure in which the scale correction factor is considered grid a2 s c and other simulated ones related to different grids obtained assuming a uniform resolution throughout the basin setting the grid size equal to 20 m2 that approximately corresponds to rsim 0 5 m2 km2 that is the reference solution and 200 m2 that approximately corresponds to rsim 5 m2 km2 b grid a2 in which no scale correction factor is provided c rsim 10 m2 km2 which is the coarse grid generated at the beginning of the procedure the details of the grids the errors ed efa efa cn and the time savings in respect to the reference solutions are reported in table 4 the results shown in fig 15c and in table 4 confirm what was already observed for the ap and er basins in particular it is interesting to note that the grid a2 has practically the same mean resolution of that related to rsim 5 m2 km2 but the overall results are significantly different specifically the error on the simulated discharge ed is halved whereas those related to the flooded areas efa and channel networks area efa cn are reduced by a factor of 4 a further significant improvement is obtained using the scale correction see grid a2 s c for which the errors efa and efa cn are one order of magnitude lower than those related to grid a2 and the error ed is halved finally the last simulation carried out here is focused on the analysis of the results for a variable in time rainfall specifically a chicago hyetograph obtained from the available rainfall duration curve of the basin and related to a return period of 200 years was considered to analyse the performance of the grids generated before related to a constant rainfall fig 16 shows the comparison between the simulations related to use of the grid a2 with scale correction and the reference grid rsim 0 5 m2 km2 in terms of discharge at the outlet and maximum unit discharges the simulated discharges are very close together fig 16a some discrepancies can be observed looking at the first peak but the overall phenomenon is reproduced similarly by the two simulations in terms of times to peak arrival times and shape of the flood wave fig 16b highlights that the flood hazard maps in terms of the product between water depth and velocity are substantially similar even though some little differences can be observed specifically the lowest order streams are not always rightly detected by the simulation related to the grid a1 s c but the overall extent and the values of the unit discharges are practically the same for example fig 16c shows the comparison between the simulated unit discharge across the section s 1 highligted in fig 16b contrarily to what was previously observed for figs 7 and 8 no significant differences can be observed between the two simulations the time saving for this simulation is up to 75 5 discussion 5 1 limitations of the work and need of further analyses the generalization of the results obtained in this work is somewhat limited by three main issues the small size of the considered basins and their natural features the assumption of a constant roughness value throughout the basins and the role of infiltration that was not been considered here as regards the first aspect it is evident that the effectiveness of the heuristic procedure proposed here was tested only for basins having an area less than 50 km2 for bigger basins several elements should be carefully analysed for example the value of the simulation ratio rsim could give uniform grid which is too coarse that might not describe several low order streams moreover the range of scale correction factor is expected to be different in relation to basin size both these elements therefore require a much deeper evaluation than those performed here finally our study intrinsically refers to natural basin so at this stage of the development and analysis we cannot say anything about the reliability of the procedure in systems highly influenced by human interventions with flood defences specific applications and analyses are needed to realize how this procedure should be adapted in order to take into account the presence of man made structures the assumption of constant roughness value is a further signification limitation of this work in this context more analyses are needed to understand the effects of variable friction throughout the basin in terms of values assumed by the scaling coefficients of the cn and hcn parts of the a q curve and therefore on the assessment of the performance of the heuristic procedure for grid generation what it is expected is a behaviour similar to that already observed for the a hs curve see costabile et al 2019 for which decreasing values of the strickler coefficient assumed for the hillslope induced reductions of the steepening of hcn part of the scaling laws so the modifications of the ratio between rmin and rmax are likely to occur but the overall findings of this study are not influenced by a differentiation of the roughness values throughout the catchment as a potential proof of this it might be useful to recall that the bimodal behaviour of the a q curve was already observed when assuming different values of the manning strickler coefficient between the channel networks and the hillslope see fig 5b regardless of the differentiation of the manning coefficients it should be observed that a suitable evaluation of the effects of surface roughness on flow resistance in overland flow simulation is very challenging and several efforts are still needed to establish proper criteria to deal with this phenomenon using the swes kirstetter et al 2016 taccone et al 2020 crompton et al 2020 finally this work does not consider any infiltration rate since we prefer to initialize the 2 d swes using net rainfall the results of this research should be further analysed in the light of the infiltration losses considering the interrelation to the roughness values and grid resolution fernández pato et al 2016 ni et al 2020 5 2 potential impact of the research despite the limitations described in the previous section this paper may have several impacts on different fields of research that can be summarized as follows 5 2 1 flood mapping studies and rainfall runoff simulations one of the primary interests of this research is for flood mapping studies in natural basins and rainfall runoff simulations using 2 d physically based models mesh properties are major factors that can influence the results caviedes voullième et al 2012 affecting for example hydrologic connectivity and maximum depression storage yu and harbor 2019 and peak discharge habtezion et al 2016 in practice mesh resolution is subject to the modeller s practical experience and the reason why a specific mesh or the grid refinement to assign to a specific area is rarely discussed or evaluated using specific criteria just to provide some examples nguyen et al 2016 used a fine 10 m and coarse 200 m resolution considering the distance from the river network cea and bladé 2015 used a coarse grid for the hillslope 30 m and a finer one in the channel network 10 m but no particular explanation about this choice was introduced hu and song 2018 set the element side variable in the range 35 m 100 m without any motivation for this differentiation the heuristic procedure presented here can avoid the subjective choice of the modellers by giving practical criteria based on the geomorphic and hydrodynamic meaning of the a q curve for evaluating where the grid refinement is needed and how much refinement is needed this can lead to important time savings without significant reduction of accuracy moreover though not explored in this work the time savings can be further increased using a local time stepping methods see for example dazzi et al 2018 hu et al 2019a 2019b yang et al 2020 bout and jetten 2020 that can be easily implemented using non uniform grids similar to those discussed here or linking the information related to the ratio between rmax and rmin to strategies based on flexible hybrid grid hoch et al 2018 bomers et al 2019 the findings reported in this study could have other impacts for risk assessment both the hydraulic a hs and hydrodynamic a q curves can be considered as synthetic descriptors of the flood hazard throughout the basin since they provide information about the extent of the areas associated to given hydrodynamic conditions represented by water levels or specific discharges equal to or greater than a specific threshold however the a q has an important added value for risk assessment beside its usefulness for the identification of the most important areas in terms of water volume fluxes at the catchment scale the scaling properties introduced here are a key element for local flood hazard assessment and therefore for the differentiation of the hazard classification in the areas belonging to the basin as is well known a suitable combination of velocity and flow depth and thus the specific discharge through properly devised vulnerability curves represents the potential effects of the flow on a target such as the assessment of damage to structures and buildings bermúdez and zischg 2018 milanesi et al 2018 people xia et al 2014 arrighi et al 2017 and vehicles martínez gomariz et al 2018 the results shown here highlight that the extent of the areas characterized by a given threshold value in terms of flood hazard assessment decreases as the threshold itself increases according to the power law relation for a significant range of values 5 2 1 1 channel heads detection an important implication of this study relates to channel heads detection as a key factor of drainage networks precise channel heads recognition is of great importance for drainage network extraction first physically based hydrologic and soil erosion models must distinguish between overland runoff on hillslopes and water flow in channels and use accurate channel heads to depict real scale hillslope channel units and corresponding parameters for model simulation see for example julien et al 1995 lin et al 2018 second the location of channel heads has a high impact on the morphometric and scaling properties of a drainage network gangodagamage et al 2011 such as drainage density length of drainage paths and horton s ratios in this field of research several methods were traditionally proposed to extract channel networks from dem see e g tarboton 1997 orlandini and moretti 2009 and further developments were provided thanks to the modern lidar techniques e g hooshyar et al 2016 sangireddy et al 2016 some reviews on this topic can be found in tarolli 2014 and wohl 2018 but an effective and efficient channel heads detection is still recognized as a challenging problem in drainage network extraction wu et al 2019 li et al 2020 a significant part of this study is based on the criterion used to separate the flow patterns related only to channel network from those ones that characterize hillslope plus channel network we showed that the a q curve exhibits a break of the derivative similar to those already observed in costabile et al 2019 in terms of water depths threshold the corresponding river network and thus the channel head location are very similar this observation leads to the conclusions that the criteria based on hydrodynamic characterization of the river networks proved to be a reliable alternative approach to perform this task 5 2 1 2 scaling relationship related to stream discharge and active drainage network our findings may have implications on the research field related to the analysis of active drainage network and associated stream discharge it is well known that stream discharge and network extent and their variability in time impact on several environmental issues e g allen and pavelsky 2018 ward et al 2018 van meerveld et al 2019 the question related to how drainage density of the actively flowing network varies in seasonal and event time scales is particularly important from hydrological ecological and biogeochemical points of view in this context godsey and kirchner 2014 observed a power law scaling between wetted channel lengths and the discharge at the catchment outlet highlighting that flowing stream network extends and retracts both seasonally and in response to individual precipitation events barefoot et al 2019 examined how the width and surface area of headwater streams changed across a range of runoff conditions noting that the total stream surface area also varied as a power law function of runoff measured at the outlet in particular they considered inundated stream surface area as a rectangle having an area equal to network length times mean width the tendency of stream networks to extend and retract can be predicted from down valley changes in topographic attributes since topography determines where water accumulates within valley networks modulating flow partitioning between the surface and subsurface prancevic and kirchner 2019 the flow patterns simulated by the 2d swes might be used to predict or reproduce the power law relations mentioned above describing the variability of flowing streams networks to precipitations determining their width surface area and length so that they are potentially strictly connected to the observations made by godsey and kirchner 2014 furthermore it is intuitive that the scaling laws proposed in this work might be used in relation to the previous ones since they refer to conceptually similar variables for example the relation between surface areas of the streams and runoff at the outlet observed by barefoot et al 2019 can be extracted by our approach focusing on the cn part of the a q curve moreover once a high resolution dem is available the accurate description of surface runoff made using the basic principles of mass and momentum conservation allows one to analyse and to differentiate flow patterns channelized in both the main river and in all the tributaries flowing down the hillslopes or stored in small depressions therefore this approach may interact with observations and field data to develop a new tool of analyses and new approaches to analyse the tendency of stream networks to extend and retract at least to the event time scale 6 conclusions this paper aimed at providing an original framework based on the use of 2d swes in which to analyse river network properties in order to contribute to the understanding of environmental processes dependent on them and more specifically to derive practical indications for rainfall runoff simulations at the basin scale therefore the new knowledge that we can extract by the rigorous analysis of the different drainage structures represented by flow patterns simulated by the 2 d swes represented the focus and core of this work the main conclusions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the flow patterns simulated by the 2 d swes can be characterized from a hydrodynamic point of view by introducing a scaling law that describes the relation between a non dimensional unit discharge threshold used to identify the active network cells and a dimensionless area defined by the ratio between the total area of the network cells themselves and the total basin area in particular the bimodal scale behaviour is useful to separate channel network flow patterns from the channel plus hillslope network ones the area in which the break of the derivative is located can be used to select that specific configuration of active network cells that are useful to locate the extent of the channel network area 2 the scale coefficient b of the cn part of the a q was interpreted as the expansion of the hydrodynamically active areas in relation to hydrodynamic heterogeneity of the flow patterns throughout the channel network therefore it provides information related to how much the expansion of the hydrodynamically active areas is associated to an increase of the hydrodynamic variability or vice versa how much the hydrodynamic heterogeneity in the channel network is related to an increase on the hydrodynamically active areas so it can be considered as a morpho hydrodynamic feature of natural basins 3 based on some relevant parameters of the a q curve a heuristic procedure for a non uniform grid generation process was developed in particular it gives practical indications related to where grid refinement process makes sense and how much refinement is needed despite the limitations of this work and the early stage of development the results obtained using this procedure seem to be very promising in terms of accuracy of simulated discharges hydrodynamic behaviour of the river network and flooded areas reducing significantly the computational times in respect to the use of uniform fine grids credit authorship

4453,earthquake related hydrogeochemical changes are considered a possible means of identifying earthquake precursors this work investigated the time series of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes at three hot springs in kangding with different temperatures namely the erdaoqiao longtougou and guanding hot springs located in the xianshuihe fault zone one of the most active seismic fault zones in china the hot springs were observed with a sampling frequency of 3 or 4 days for one year the results showed that the three hot springs were recharged by meteoric water and there was a slight water rock interaction at the longtougou hot spring the different isotopic compositions of the three hot springs were related to the recharge and groundwater circulation environment temporal anomalies in the stable isotope values at the three hot springs occurred synchronously these anomalies were closely related to the 2019 mw 5 8 changning earthquake indicating possible earthquake related changes moreover the amplitudes of stable isotope variations at the three hot springs were closely related to the seismic energy density and the background isotopic changes were related to the water temperature and flow these findings reflect the hydrological cycle processes of geothermal water in the kangding geothermal area on the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau simultaneously observed temporal variations in hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes among multiple hot springs may have relevance for distinguishing earthquake precursors keywords hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes isotopic temporal variations hot springs kangding geothermal area earthquake 1 introduction earthquake related hydrological changes such as variations in the water level roeloffs 1998 shi et al 2014 water temperature ma et al 2018 sun et al 2018 groundwater flow chen and wang 2009 manga 2001 and hydrochemical composition barberio et al 2017 boschetti et al 2019 claesson et al 2004 shi et al 2020 tsunogai and wakita 1995 wang et al 2018 woith et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 have been extensively reported similarly changes in the water stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen δ2h and δ18o respectively in groundwater have been observed before and after earthquakes chen et al 2014 claesson et al 2004 onda et al 2018 δ2h and δ18o are the most effective diagnostic tools to research water sources and hydrological cycle processes craig 1961 gat 1996 pang et al 2017 the mechanisms responsible for earthquake related hydrological changes can be identified using the variations in δ2h and δ18o claesson et al 2007 hosono et al 2020 o neil and king 1981 wang et al 2005 earthquake related isotopic changes can be summarized as follows 1 the δ18o and δ2h values change shortly after the target earthquakes indicating the rapid mixing of water in different aquifers and possibly fault sealing and healing claesson et al 2004 2007 skelton et al 2019 the durations and amplitudes of the isotopic changes are related to the hydrogeology in response to dynamic stresses claesson et al 2004 2 together with hydrochemical compositions the δ18o and δ2h values change several months before the target earthquakes further indicating the slow mixing of different groundwater which are due to reactions with wall rocks caused by the accumulation of stress before the earthquakes skelton et al 2014 2019 using a rock crushing experiment onda et al 2018 showed that coseismic δ18o changes were related to variations in volumetric strain other explanations involving earthquake caused permeability changes in aquifers have also been reported such as a decrease in permeability before an earthquake zhang et al 2020 and enhanced permeability after an earthquake hosono et al 2020 groundwater can act as sensitive strain meters in confined well aquifer systems bodvarsson 1970 the pressure head variations of the confined subsurface reservoirs before earthquakes are most easily explained by crustal strain roeloffs 1988 recent studies have shown that the hydrogeochemical changes before earthquakes are related to the deep fluid pressure variations which are proportional to the stress and volumetric strain martinelli 2020 martinelli and dadomo 2017 the mechanisms of hydrogeochemical changes are closely related to crustal stresses associated with crustal deformation montgomery and manga 2003 which result in the closure of aquifers and changes in the equilibrium conditions of recharge and circulation the key to ascertaining the relationship between stable isotopes and earthquakes is the sufficient acquisition of data that can exclude changes unrelated to seismic activity ingebritsen and manga 2014 indicated that the signals caused by earthquakes must be evaluated based on long term observation data adequate isotopic data are very important for studying hydrological processes during earthquakes because meaningful research can be conducted on earthquake precursors and postseismic fault healing by identifying the relationship between hydrological changes and earthquakes claesson et al 2007 wästeby et al 2014 recently several studies have revealed the relationship between groundwater and earthquakes in detail based on abundant data skelton et al 2014 and skelton et al 2019 used long term groundwater chemistry na and ca2 etc and isotopic data δ2h and δ18o to predict earthquake related hydrochemical changes before and after earthquakes hosono et al 2020 showed enhanced permeability after the 2016 mw 7 0 kumamoto earthquake based on a large stable isotope dataset however such reports are rare because it is difficult to collect an adequate number of measurements to characterize these temporal and spatial variations mainly due to the scarcity of sensitive observation points and the needs for continuous sampling testing and funding zhang et al 2020 it is also especially beneficial to record continuous isotopic observations at multiple groundwater sites within a region the use of data from multiple groundwater sites can better reveal the characteristics of earthquake related isotopic changes than the use of data from a single site and it is easier to identify seismic anomalies and exclude nonseismic anomalies in the former case during the 2008 mw 7 9 wenchuan earthquake 2013 mw 6 6 lushan earthquake and 2014 mw 5 9 kangding earthquake the hydrochemical compositions and stable isotope ratios at the erdaoqiao edq 41 c longtougou ltg 72 c and guanding gd 78 c hot springs in the kangding geothermal area western china experienced obvious changes chen et al 2014 li et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 long term observations at the edq and ltg hot springs revealed significant increases in water temperature before major earthquakes in the vicinity of these hot springs e g an abnormal amplitude of 1 c in response to the 2013 mw 6 6 lushan earthquake yan et al 2015 these three hot springs which are all located in the southern segment of the active xianshuihe fault zone are sensitive to seismic activity and thus provide a natural opportunity to experimentally investigate the relationship between groundwater changes and earthquakes however the long term temporal variations in hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes and the dynamic characteristics of groundwater circulation in these areas are unknown clarifying the hydrological compositions of these hot springs by continuous isotopic observations would provide meaningful information for assessing earthquake precursors and for managing water resources in this geothermal area for the present study continuous observations of δ2h and δ18o were acquired for one year with a high sampling frequency at the edq ltg and gd hot springs the aims of this study were 1 to investigate the variation characteristics of δ2h and δ18o 2 to reveal the dynamic features of the groundwater hydrological processes in the kangding geothermal area and 3 to understand the simultaneously observed isotopic changes related to earthquakes at these three hot springs 2 study area the study area is located in the town of kangding western sichuan province china fig 1 kangding is nestled within a valley surrounded by mountains along the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau and is approximately 50 km from mount gongga in the south the main water supply in kangding consists of the yulin river yala river and zheduo river which are tributaries of the kangding river the monthly mean temperature is 7 6 c with a range from 5 c in january to 21 c in july and august from 2009 to 2018 fig 1s in the supplementary material the monthly mean precipitation is 74 mm with a range from 5 mm in january and december to 179 mm in june fig 2s the climate of kangding shows the characteristic of high precipitation and temperature over the same period tectonically the edq ltg and gd hot springs are distributed along the xianshuihe fault zone fig 1 the xianshuihe fault is one of the most active faults in china and connects the longmenshan fault in the east to the anninghe fault in the south zhang 2013 the xianshuihe fault is a highly active fault zone with left lateral strike slip deformation of 10 11 mm yr shen et al 2005 three earthquakes with magnitudes 7 have occurred within the xianshuihe fault zone in the last hundred years the most recent ms 7 6 occurred in 1973 wen et al 2008 the largest earthquake to strike this zone in the past decade was the 2014 mw 5 9 kangding earthquake several major earthquakes also occurred surrounding in recent years fig 1 the xianshuihe fault is a deep fault that extends through the crust into the mantle and acts as a pathway for geothermal fluids in the kangding geothermal system li et al 2018 tang et al 2017 the springs are mainly located in the erdaoqiao yulinggong hydrothermal area in the kangding geothermal system and cover an approximate distance of 15 km from north to south deep faults transport the hot water upward to the surface in kangding and serve as channels for heat generated at depths of 15 30 km liu et al 2019 tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the heating sources of the geothermal fluids are derived mainly from mantle derived heat fluxes radioactive heat from granites and fault friction tang et al 2017 the edq ltg and gd hot springs belong to the erdaoqiao yulingong hydrothermal area in kangding the edq hot spring is located on the west bank of the yala river and controlled by the yalagou fault this hot spring is exposed within paleozoic limestone and mesozoic sandstone and phyllite and its mouth is covered by quaternary deposits the ltg and gd hot springs rise through granites and are exposed in small concave pools these hot springs are controlled by the daxueshan nonggeshan fault the gd hot spring is located on the east bank of the yulin river liu et al 2000 have given the hydrogeological cross sections of the three hot springs and their features are not described repeatedly in this paper more detailed descriptions of the geological setting hydrogeological cross sections and river characteristics of the three hot springs can be found in liu et al 2000 and li et al 2019 the edq ltg and gd hot springs are characterized by hydrochemical types of ca na hco3 na hco3 cl and na hco3 cl respectively li et al 2019 the edq ltg and gd hot springs have ph ranges of 7 8 8 3 8 1 8 3 and 8 4 8 6 respectively and total dissolved solids tds contents of 843 4 1094 1 mg l 2025 9 2130 5 mg l and 1273 6 1453 6 mg l chen et al 2015 the reservoir temperatures at the edq ltg and gd hot springs are in the range of 210 230 c as determined using multicomponent mineral equilibrium wang et al 2020 the flow rates at edq and ltg are approximately 40 l s and 0 4 l s respectively yan et al 2015 the hot springs comprise mixtures of both hot and cold water 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analysis continuous samples were collected from may 2019 to may 2020 a previous study employed a weekly continuous sampling frequency of stable isotopes to research groundwater anomalies related to earthquakes skelton et al 2019 while another used a monthly sampling frequency onda et al 2018 the shorter the sampling interval is the more earthquake information is captured for this study the sampling interval was approximately 3 or 4 days and the sampling date was fixed for each month table 1s in the supplementary material no samples were taken from the hot springs in february 2020 furthermore due to decreased water flow samples were not available from february to may 2020 at ltg in total 92 69 and 93 samples were taken from the edq ltg and gd hot springs respectively in addition water samples were collected in may 2019 from nearby river and mount gongga table 1 all samples were acquired below the water surface and stored in clean full 30 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles all samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane before measurement a digital thermometer was used to measure the water temperature during field sampling the δ2h and δ18o values were measured with an lwia 912 0008 liquid water isotope analyzer from los gatos research at the key laboratory of crustal dynamics china earthquake administration three certified reference materials crms no gbw04458 gbw04459 and gbw04460 from the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology chinese academy of geological sciences were used to calibrate the isotopes zhang et al 2013 the sample results are presented as δ values relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow in units of the precision was 0 30 for δ2h and 0 08 for δ18o calculated from the mean standard deviation 1σ of all the measured samples the instrument accuracy was characterized by comparing the measurement of crms between different instruments refer to zhang et al 2020 3 2 earthquake data collection stable isotopic changes can be affected by local and distant earthquakes onda et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 earthquake catalog data were used to assess the impacts of earthquakes on temporal variations in stable isotope compositions previous reports on changes in chemical compositions before and after earthquakes at the edq ltg and gd hot springs focused on three major earthquakes i e the 2008 mw 7 9 wenchuan earthquake the 2013 mw 6 6 lushan earthquake and the 2014 mw 5 9 kangding earthquake chen et al 2014 2015 li et al 2019 this study was able to investigate the characteristics of isotopic changes that occurred in response to both major and minor earthquakes in greater detail due to the higher sampling frequency data from global earthquakes with magnitudes 5 and earthquakes with magnitudes 3 at epicentral distances 500 km were collected the earthquake catalog was obtained from the united states geological survey usgs https earthquake usgs gov furthermore the seismic energy density e j m3 log r 0 48 m 0 33 log e 1 4 where m is the earthquake magnitude and r is the epicentral distance in km wang 2007 was used to select earthquakes that may cause hydrological changes a threshold of 10 4 j m3 was used as a metric to select hydrological responses to earthquakes wang and manga 2010 one earthquake e 10 4 j m3 the 17 june 2019 changning mw 5 8 earthquake 104 93 e 28 40 n in sichuan province china from the earthquake catalog met the threshold this earthquake was the largest to strike sichuan province during the observation period the epicentral distances to the edq ltg and gd hot springs were 344 km 337 km and 336 km respectively and the corresponding seismic energy densities were 3 21 10 4 j m3 3 41 10 4 j m3 and 3 47 10 4 j m3 4 results and discussion 4 1 stable isotope compositions and recharge sources of hot springs the δ2h and δ18o values at the edq hot spring varied from 113 10 to 111 19 and from 15 53 to 14 95 respectively with mean values of 112 12 0 35 and 15 18 0 12 n 92 σ the δ2h and δ18o values at the gd hot spring varied from 117 51 to 114 73 and from 15 97 to 15 10 respectively with mean values of 116 47 0 50 and 15 57 0 16 n 93 σ furthermore the measured δ2h and δ18o values at the ltg hot spring ranged from 130 63 to 127 24 and from 16 79 to 16 27 respectively with mean values of 128 83 0 71 and 16 51 0 12 n 69 σ the results are depicted in fig 2 and table 1s overall the isotopic compositions of the edq and gd hot springs were close to each other and they were richer in heavy isotopes than the ltg hot spring moreover the stable isotope values showed small ranges in the three hot springs indicating that the recharge and water residence processes were relatively stable groundwater origins and hydrological processes can be determined by comparing the stable isotope compositions with the meteoric water line craig 1961 pang et al 2017 the global meteoric water line gmwl together with the local meteoric water line lmwl are the most commonly used parameters the gmwl equation is δ2h 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 the equation for the lmwl on the tibetan plateau was selected to be δ2h 8 41δ18o 16 72 lmwl 1 kong et al 2019 another lmwl δ2h 8 10δ18o 12 56 lmwl 2 at mount gongga station was also used for comparative analysis liu et al 2014 mount gongga station 102 e 29 58 n altitude of 2950 m is a member of chinese network of isotopes in precipitation chnip with the distance to the study area of approximately 50 km liu et al 2014 fig 2 shows that the isotope values are distributed around the gmwl and lmwls indicating that the recharge sources of the three hot springs originated from meteoric water a δ18o shift indicates that heavier oxygen isotope is enriched due to water rock interaction in the geothermal system due to the exchange of 18o between geothermal water and oxygen bearing minerals claesson et al 2007 pang et al 2017 the oxygen isotopes at the ltg hot spring shifted to the right of the gmwl and lmwl showing a slight water rock interaction fig 2 however the oxygen isotopes at the edq and gd hot springs were distributed closely to the right of the lmwl indicating the absence of water rock interaction fig 2 these weak or absent water rock interactions may be related to rapid geothermal water circulation and a short aquifer residence time which prevent stronger water rock interactions from being triggered guo et al 2017 also found that remarkable δ18o shifts were not observed in kangding geothermal waters and revealed a short groundwater residence time another study showed that the residence time of the thermal water on the tibetan plateau was short the values of tritium in geothermal water on the tibetan plateau were 2 72 20 tu indicating that modern meteoric sources were responsible and the residence time was less than a dozen years tan et al 2014 the three hot springs are characterized by immature water according to the triangular diagram of na k mg giggenbach 1988 indicating weak water rock equilibrium and fast geothermal water circulation in addition the relations between na k cl and ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 of the three hot springs slope 1 1 r2 0 89 indicated cation exchange reaction with the release of na and adsorption of ca2 and ltg was stronger than edq and gd the above hydrochemical data are from li et al 2019 the distinct water rock interactions among the three hot springs reflect distinct geothermal water circulation pathways and the differences in the isotopic compositions among the three hot springs may also indicate various water recharge sources increasing altitude causes the stable isotope values of water to decrease this altitude effect is useful for distinguishing the recharge elevation blasch and bryson 2007 the stable isotopes of the meteoric water in mount gongga showed δ2h and δ18o lapse rates of 2 41 100 m and 0 30 100 m respectively song et al 2015 the elevation of the edq hot spring is lower than the elevations of the ltg and gd hot springs table 1 the variation in δ18o was in accordance with the altitude effect between edq and ltg however the variations in δ2h and δ18o between the edq and gd hot springs did not agree with the altitude effect furthermore the aquifer lithology and conditions e g temperature are not the main causes of the isotopic variations among the three hot springs because the ltg and gd hot springs have the same aquifer lithology and hydrochemical types and similar temperatures but distinct isotope values whereas the edq and gd hot springs have different lithologies hydrochemical types and temperatures but similar isotopic values fig 2 moreover previous studies have shown that the fault zone architecture controls permeability and fluid flow caine et al 1996 faulkner et al 2010 the edq ltg and gd hot springs are located in different secondary faults of the xianshuihe fault zone these different fracture structures control different aspects of the hydrologic cycle different isotopic values of geothermal water in kangding were also reported by guo et al 2017 and were related to the mixing ratios of natural water sources more attention should be paid to the recharge sources in different fault systems fig 3 illustrates the isotope relationships among the hot springs and various types of water in the study region first the deep geothermal waters with borehole mouth temperatures ranging from 104 c to 178 c n 4 in kangding are mixtures comprising approximately one quarter magmatic water and three quarters snowmelt water and the granite reservoir temperatures range from 250 c to 280 c fig 3 table 2s guo et al 2017 the main geothermal heat source in this area is in the middle and lower crust at depths from 15 km to 30 km zhang et al 2017 second the isotopic compositions of the surface water e g river and mount gongga are similar table 1 indicating that the source of river water is from mount gongga however the isotopic compositions of the surface water are different from those of the meteoric water from mount gongga station and yushu station on the eastern tibetan plateau table 2s which may be related to their mixing with other recharge sources fig 3 demonstrates that the recharge sources of the edq ltg and gd hot springs are likely attributable to the mixing of different waters probably including end members consisting of meteoric water surface water and snowmelt water due to their location on the meteoric water line on the whole the dominant recharges of the three hot springs are provided by meteoric water sources from river and mount gongga however the ltg hot spring has a component of deeply circulating geothermal water these isotopic results are consistent with a previous report showing that the hot springs in the kangding geothermal area may originate from the mixture of shallow groundwater based on a multivariate statistical analysis of hydrogeochemical parameters shi et al 2017 meteoric water is transported into the active and deep xianshuihe fault with strong strike slip movements and then returns to the surface as hot spring water with excess heat tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 4 2 temporal isotopic variations in the hot springs the ranges of the variations in δ2h at the edq ltg and gd hot springs from may 2019 to may 2020 were 1 91 3 39 and 2 78 respectively and those in δ18o were 0 58 0 52 and 0 87 table 1s a previous study also showed small isotopic variations in δ2h 2 49 and δ18o 0 52 in an 82 c hot spring in yunnan province china with four years of observations zhang et al 2020 in a shallow groundwater system the variations in stable isotopes exhibit seasonality that is depletion in winter and enrichment in summer and show a very clear response to strong precipitation tan et al 2016 for example the isotopic compositions of groundwater were influenced by precipitation and land cover conditions with a variation range for δ18o of 2 76 to 4 35 in karst catchments zhao et al 2018 the seasonal variations in stable isotopes decrease with increasing aquifer depth and seasonal variations disappear in deep confined aquifers especially the deep circulating hot springs zhang et al 2020 the isotopic variations show a lack of obvious seasonality and reflect a weak influence of direct precipitation recharge fig 4 in addition for a hot spring such as the ltg hot spring the background changes in water temperature are very steady and the temperature exhibits no seasonality the small temporal isotopic variations are directly related to deep circulation in the active xianshuihe fault zone and stable hydrological processes the data of δ18o and δ2h were normal distribution p 0 05 using the shapiro wilk normality test except δ18o of edq and δ2h of ltg δ18o of edq and δ2h of ltg were normal distribution by eliminating the data beyond mean 2σ the values within mean 2σ which calculated from the normally distributed data are defined as the background the data beyond 2σ are considered anomalies this method has been used to identify groundwater radon anomalies caused by earthquakes igarashi and wakita 1990 there was a period in the δ18o and δ2h time series when the isotope values deviated from the background between may and july 2019 that is before and after the mw 5 8 earthquake and this deviation occurred in all three hot springs fig 4 the changes in the isotope values at the three hot springs showed gradual decreasing trends before the earthquake and then gradual increasing trends afterward and finally recovered to the background levels in july 2019 which was approximately one month after the earthquake the ranges of the variations in δ2h at the edq ltg and gd hot springs from may 2019 to july 2019 before and after the mw 5 8 earthquake were 1 91 1 81 and 2 09 respectively and those in δ18o were 0 40 0 50 and 0 77 table 1s these variations in isotopes were greater than could be accounted for by instrumental precision error previous researches showed that the variations of δ18o anomalies associated with earthquakes were around 1 in iceland claesson et al 2004 skelton et al 2014 2019 it is also reported that this anomaly variations range from 0 2 to 1 onda et al 2018 o neil and king 1981 zhang et al 2020 the δ18o anomalies in this study were also consistent with the above features statistical analysis was performed for δ2h which exhibited larger variations the δ2h data at the three hot springs from may 2019 to july 2019 showed a normal distribution p 0 05 according to the shapiro wilk normality test and the ltg hot springs showed significant difference p 0 01 according to the one sample t test the abnormal variation trends of edq and ltg were similar before and after the earthquake there was no statistically significant difference in δ2h data in gd p 0 05 which may be associated with fewer outliers deviating from the mean value changes in δ2h before earthquake in gd are considered anomalous because several data are different from the values after the earthquake fig 4 h the deviations of isotopes from the meteoric water line are also used to evaluate isotopic earthquake related changes skelton et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 the deviations of δ18o from gmwl values dev gmwl in edq ltg and gd ranged from 0 19 to 0 31 0 55 to 1 06 and 0 04 to 0 59 respectively with a mean of 0 09 0 10 n 92 σ 0 84 0 13 n 69 σ and 0 23 0 14 n 93 σ the dev gmwl values of the edq and ltg hot springs decreased before the earthquake whereas that of the gd hot spring increased fig 5 the change trends in dev gmwl of the three hot springs before and after the mw 5 8 earthquake in fig 5 are consistent with those in fig 4 illustrating the shift in δ18o values and the different groundwater recharge sources before the earthquake since the observations in the current work began only one month may 2019 before the earthquake june 2019 it remains unclear whether the abnormal isotopic changes occurred one or several months before the earthquake the groundwater changes triggered by the earthquake are considered to be regional rather than local the greatest distance between the three hot springs is approximately 15 km therefore it is inferred that the isotopic changes in the three hot springs before an earthquake should be similar in time according to the variation trend of δ18o at the gd hot spring the first few observation data points in may 2019 represented the background characteristics fig 4 g from dev gmwl fig 5 the background and tendencies of increasing or decreasing before the earthquake were obvious the abnormal changes in the isotope values at the edq ltg and gd hot springs are inferred to have occurred within one month before the earthquake because inadequate data are available prior to may 2019 the detailed dynamic processes involved in the isotopic changes before the 2019 earthquake cannot be evaluated in detail nevertheless based on time series major earthquake do impact isotopic changes the groundwater variations under different e values are distinct showing a larger e with larger variations previously observed isotopic variations were larger than those reported in this paper under the influence of higher e values such as those generated by the 2008 mw 7 9 wenchuan earthquake and the 2014 mw 5 9 kangding earthquake fig 1 with e 100 j m3 and e 10 1 j m3 respectively at the observed hot springs chen et al 2014 li et al 2019 the small variation ranges of δ18o in this study together with the stable isotopes deviated from the background slightly greater than or near 2σ threshold fig 4 are speculated to have been related to e at the level of 10 4 j m3 no significant changes in water temperature before and after the 2019 mw 5 8 earthquake were observed in this paper and there was only a small rise in temperature at the edq hot spring fig 4 c f i significant temperature changes were not observed at the ltg and gd hot springs during the mw 5 8 earthquake which may be related to the low e 10 4 j m3 that is temperature changes are bounded by e 10 2 j m3 in the hot springs fig 4f i wang and manga 2010 earthquake related groundwater anomalies occur in areas with crustal deformation montgomery and manga 2003 the mw 5 8 earthquake caused geophysical anomalies within the epicentral distance of 400 km that occurred within a month before the earthquake including geoelectric field and geomagnetic anomalies aisa et al 2020 xi et al 2020 the geoelectric field anomaly was due to the rapid release of fluid during the rock microfracture process xi et al 2020 the geophysical abnormal occurrence times and epicentral distances were close to those of the three hot springs it is possible that regional crustal deformation and stress build up occurred before the earthquake several long term bedrock temperature observations in the xianshuihe fault zone showed that the permeability was enhanced due to the dynamic stress resulting in the increasing upward movement of deep fluids due to moderately distant earthquakes liu et al 2020 the isotopic changes before the 2019 mw 5 8 earthquake may have been more closely related to aquifer recharge changes caused by permeability changes due to the pre earthquake accumulation of stress which affected the chemical reactions and recharge environments at the hot springs such preseismic changes in isotopes and mechanism have also been confirmed by continuous isotopic observations of other geothermal waters skelton et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 in addition to the effects of the mw 5 8 earthquake on the observed isotopic changes some isotopic changes were observed in the time series fig 4 1 flow rate changed there was a significant decrease in water temperature followed by a decrease in δ2h after january 2020 at ltg fig 4 e f in january 2020 there was a significant decrease in flow subsequently the flow was cut off after which samples could not be collected this change was related to the sinter deposit identified through field survey this deposition may result in the following processes 1 clogging of the flow path which changes fault permeability and affects temperature and or 2 changes in the water pressure that drives the geothermal water circulation system gottardi et al 2013 grasby et al 2019 2 water temperature changed the water temperature dropped in may 2020 followed by decreasing trends in the δ2h and δ18o values at edq fig 4a b the water temperature sharply dropped in october and december 2019 followed by another sharp drop in april 2020 at gd as the temperature changed the δ2h and or δ18o values changed fig 4 g h i these isotopes changes appeared to be around 2σ threshold the deviation of dev gmwl most were decreasing changes showed the recharges of cold water fig 5 it is speculated that two factors may be responsible for this change 1 it may be related to regional tectonic activity that induced groundwater isotopic changes without earthquake occurrence groundwater anomalies may occur under the influence of local stress changes but this does not necessarily mean that an earthquake followed igarashi and wakita 1990 a variety of tectonically induced groundwater anomalies without earthquakes have been reported such as rises in water level springs drying up and artesian pressure or gushing in deep wells in the xichang area of the anninghe fault zone which lies to the south of the xianshuihe fault zone shi et al 2018 2 the changes in temperature showed that the recharge ratios between deep geothermal water and cold water with distinct water rock interactions in the hot springs had changed causing the isotopic changes the mw 5 8 earthquake caused the synchronous isotopic changes in the three hot springs but the isotopic changes discussed above did not occur synchronically it is speculated that isotopic changes could be related to the local recharge environment such as meteorological variations and or stress the variations of oxygen isotope at edq in the end of august 2019 were beyond 2σ fig 4a it is speculated that this period may be related to post seismic effect and recovery the hydrogen isotope anomaly in may 2020 was more likely a lagged effect of this water temperature increase fig 4 h i or it could be a random effect 4 3 stable isotopes and earthquake observation the isotopic variation characteristics were obtained for the first time by collecting one year of continuous observations from the xianshuihe fault zone the background variations in the stable isotopes were stable indicating that the recharge and cycling of the hot springs were relatively balanced the three hot springs considered herein are located in a deep and large active fault zone and are sensitive to seismicity specifically variations in the values of the isotopes at all of the observed hot springs reflect changes in the water recharge sources and the hydrological environment which indicate underground tectonic activity obvious isotopic anomalies such as those observed before and after the 2019 mw 5 8 changning earthquake showed the same change trend and occurrence time moreover the three hot springs exhibited synchronous anomalies before the earthquake supporting a possible relationship with the target earthquake in previous continuous isotopic observations of other geothermal waters such as those in northern iceland and yunnan province china isotopic anomalies sudden or gradual changes occurred several months before major earthquakes and the changes were seismically generated skelton et al 2014 2019 zhang et al 2020 these changes show that deeply circulated geothermal water is sensitive to crustal stress and tectonic activity the isotopic observation method is based on the premise that earthquakes can cause changes in hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes in aquifers such as under the influence of new recharge entering the aquifer and or water rock interactions it has also been confirmed that isotopic changes related to e 10 3 j m3 have larger isotopic anomalies and longer durations than those related to e 10 4 j m3 skelton et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 furthermore the variation ranges of isotopes may indicate the influences of the earthquake magnitude and epicentral distance the advantage of this approach is that stable isotope changes can be leveraged to trace hydrogeological processes such as changes in permeability groundwater mixing and water rock interactions claesson et al 2007 hosono et al 2020 and these processes are closely related to the stress changes caused by earthquakes various environmental interference factors such as precipitation and surface water recharge can also be identified by comparing different recharge sources in this paper the observation frequency of isotopes reached 3 or 4 days per sample which is sufficiently detailed to describe the changes in the stable isotopes before and after earthquakes and isotopes can be employed to describe the fracturing and healing of aquifers therefore it is believed that long term observations with high density sampling are highly valuable for studying earthquake precursors ingebritsen and manga 2014 in this paper synchronous isotopic responses are used to illustrate earthquake related changes some physicochemical parameters of groundwater such as temperature conductivity ph dissolved oxygen and flow rate which may distinguish groundwater recharges and sources from deep and or shallow flow components can also differ before and after earthquakes barberio et al 2017 kaown et al 2019 ma et al 2018 woith et al 2013 therefore in the future it will be helpful to identify the sources of water recharges and abnormal change processes with continuous observation of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes together with other groundwater physical and chemical indicators 5 conclusions the temporal variations in the δ18o and δ2h values at the edq ltg and gd hot springs in the kangding geothermal area on the eastern tibetan plateau geothermal belt were investigated the stable isotopes revealed the recharge sources of meteoric water in the hot springs the meteoric water that circulates downward along the fault zone is heated by heat sources at depth and then ascends as hot water to the surface the differences in the stable isotopes among the three hot springs reflect distinct groundwater recharge and circulation processes consistent stable isotope anomalies were observed before and after the 2019 changning mw 5 8 earthquake at the edq ltg and gd hot springs and a possible earthquake precursor was observed the amplitudes of anomalous variations in the stable isotopes at the edq ltg and gd hot springs were related to the earthquake energy density these results suggest that simultaneous isotopic variations among multiple hot springs

4453,earthquake related hydrogeochemical changes are considered a possible means of identifying earthquake precursors this work investigated the time series of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes at three hot springs in kangding with different temperatures namely the erdaoqiao longtougou and guanding hot springs located in the xianshuihe fault zone one of the most active seismic fault zones in china the hot springs were observed with a sampling frequency of 3 or 4 days for one year the results showed that the three hot springs were recharged by meteoric water and there was a slight water rock interaction at the longtougou hot spring the different isotopic compositions of the three hot springs were related to the recharge and groundwater circulation environment temporal anomalies in the stable isotope values at the three hot springs occurred synchronously these anomalies were closely related to the 2019 mw 5 8 changning earthquake indicating possible earthquake related changes moreover the amplitudes of stable isotope variations at the three hot springs were closely related to the seismic energy density and the background isotopic changes were related to the water temperature and flow these findings reflect the hydrological cycle processes of geothermal water in the kangding geothermal area on the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau simultaneously observed temporal variations in hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes among multiple hot springs may have relevance for distinguishing earthquake precursors keywords hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes isotopic temporal variations hot springs kangding geothermal area earthquake 1 introduction earthquake related hydrological changes such as variations in the water level roeloffs 1998 shi et al 2014 water temperature ma et al 2018 sun et al 2018 groundwater flow chen and wang 2009 manga 2001 and hydrochemical composition barberio et al 2017 boschetti et al 2019 claesson et al 2004 shi et al 2020 tsunogai and wakita 1995 wang et al 2018 woith et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 have been extensively reported similarly changes in the water stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen δ2h and δ18o respectively in groundwater have been observed before and after earthquakes chen et al 2014 claesson et al 2004 onda et al 2018 δ2h and δ18o are the most effective diagnostic tools to research water sources and hydrological cycle processes craig 1961 gat 1996 pang et al 2017 the mechanisms responsible for earthquake related hydrological changes can be identified using the variations in δ2h and δ18o claesson et al 2007 hosono et al 2020 o neil and king 1981 wang et al 2005 earthquake related isotopic changes can be summarized as follows 1 the δ18o and δ2h values change shortly after the target earthquakes indicating the rapid mixing of water in different aquifers and possibly fault sealing and healing claesson et al 2004 2007 skelton et al 2019 the durations and amplitudes of the isotopic changes are related to the hydrogeology in response to dynamic stresses claesson et al 2004 2 together with hydrochemical compositions the δ18o and δ2h values change several months before the target earthquakes further indicating the slow mixing of different groundwater which are due to reactions with wall rocks caused by the accumulation of stress before the earthquakes skelton et al 2014 2019 using a rock crushing experiment onda et al 2018 showed that coseismic δ18o changes were related to variations in volumetric strain other explanations involving earthquake caused permeability changes in aquifers have also been reported such as a decrease in permeability before an earthquake zhang et al 2020 and enhanced permeability after an earthquake hosono et al 2020 groundwater can act as sensitive strain meters in confined well aquifer systems bodvarsson 1970 the pressure head variations of the confined subsurface reservoirs before earthquakes are most easily explained by crustal strain roeloffs 1988 recent studies have shown that the hydrogeochemical changes before earthquakes are related to the deep fluid pressure variations which are proportional to the stress and volumetric strain martinelli 2020 martinelli and dadomo 2017 the mechanisms of hydrogeochemical changes are closely related to crustal stresses associated with crustal deformation montgomery and manga 2003 which result in the closure of aquifers and changes in the equilibrium conditions of recharge and circulation the key to ascertaining the relationship between stable isotopes and earthquakes is the sufficient acquisition of data that can exclude changes unrelated to seismic activity ingebritsen and manga 2014 indicated that the signals caused by earthquakes must be evaluated based on long term observation data adequate isotopic data are very important for studying hydrological processes during earthquakes because meaningful research can be conducted on earthquake precursors and postseismic fault healing by identifying the relationship between hydrological changes and earthquakes claesson et al 2007 wästeby et al 2014 recently several studies have revealed the relationship between groundwater and earthquakes in detail based on abundant data skelton et al 2014 and skelton et al 2019 used long term groundwater chemistry na and ca2 etc and isotopic data δ2h and δ18o to predict earthquake related hydrochemical changes before and after earthquakes hosono et al 2020 showed enhanced permeability after the 2016 mw 7 0 kumamoto earthquake based on a large stable isotope dataset however such reports are rare because it is difficult to collect an adequate number of measurements to characterize these temporal and spatial variations mainly due to the scarcity of sensitive observation points and the needs for continuous sampling testing and funding zhang et al 2020 it is also especially beneficial to record continuous isotopic observations at multiple groundwater sites within a region the use of data from multiple groundwater sites can better reveal the characteristics of earthquake related isotopic changes than the use of data from a single site and it is easier to identify seismic anomalies and exclude nonseismic anomalies in the former case during the 2008 mw 7 9 wenchuan earthquake 2013 mw 6 6 lushan earthquake and 2014 mw 5 9 kangding earthquake the hydrochemical compositions and stable isotope ratios at the erdaoqiao edq 41 c longtougou ltg 72 c and guanding gd 78 c hot springs in the kangding geothermal area western china experienced obvious changes chen et al 2014 li et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 long term observations at the edq and ltg hot springs revealed significant increases in water temperature before major earthquakes in the vicinity of these hot springs e g an abnormal amplitude of 1 c in response to the 2013 mw 6 6 lushan earthquake yan et al 2015 these three hot springs which are all located in the southern segment of the active xianshuihe fault zone are sensitive to seismic activity and thus provide a natural opportunity to experimentally investigate the relationship between groundwater changes and earthquakes however the long term temporal variations in hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes and the dynamic characteristics of groundwater circulation in these areas are unknown clarifying the hydrological compositions of these hot springs by continuous isotopic observations would provide meaningful information for assessing earthquake precursors and for managing water resources in this geothermal area for the present study continuous observations of δ2h and δ18o were acquired for one year with a high sampling frequency at the edq ltg and gd hot springs the aims of this study were 1 to investigate the variation characteristics of δ2h and δ18o 2 to reveal the dynamic features of the groundwater hydrological processes in the kangding geothermal area and 3 to understand the simultaneously observed isotopic changes related to earthquakes at these three hot springs 2 study area the study area is located in the town of kangding western sichuan province china fig 1 kangding is nestled within a valley surrounded by mountains along the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau and is approximately 50 km from mount gongga in the south the main water supply in kangding consists of the yulin river yala river and zheduo river which are tributaries of the kangding river the monthly mean temperature is 7 6 c with a range from 5 c in january to 21 c in july and august from 2009 to 2018 fig 1s in the supplementary material the monthly mean precipitation is 74 mm with a range from 5 mm in january and december to 179 mm in june fig 2s the climate of kangding shows the characteristic of high precipitation and temperature over the same period tectonically the edq ltg and gd hot springs are distributed along the xianshuihe fault zone fig 1 the xianshuihe fault is one of the most active faults in china and connects the longmenshan fault in the east to the anninghe fault in the south zhang 2013 the xianshuihe fault is a highly active fault zone with left lateral strike slip deformation of 10 11 mm yr shen et al 2005 three earthquakes with magnitudes 7 have occurred within the xianshuihe fault zone in the last hundred years the most recent ms 7 6 occurred in 1973 wen et al 2008 the largest earthquake to strike this zone in the past decade was the 2014 mw 5 9 kangding earthquake several major earthquakes also occurred surrounding in recent years fig 1 the xianshuihe fault is a deep fault that extends through the crust into the mantle and acts as a pathway for geothermal fluids in the kangding geothermal system li et al 2018 tang et al 2017 the springs are mainly located in the erdaoqiao yulinggong hydrothermal area in the kangding geothermal system and cover an approximate distance of 15 km from north to south deep faults transport the hot water upward to the surface in kangding and serve as channels for heat generated at depths of 15 30 km liu et al 2019 tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the heating sources of the geothermal fluids are derived mainly from mantle derived heat fluxes radioactive heat from granites and fault friction tang et al 2017 the edq ltg and gd hot springs belong to the erdaoqiao yulingong hydrothermal area in kangding the edq hot spring is located on the west bank of the yala river and controlled by the yalagou fault this hot spring is exposed within paleozoic limestone and mesozoic sandstone and phyllite and its mouth is covered by quaternary deposits the ltg and gd hot springs rise through granites and are exposed in small concave pools these hot springs are controlled by the daxueshan nonggeshan fault the gd hot spring is located on the east bank of the yulin river liu et al 2000 have given the hydrogeological cross sections of the three hot springs and their features are not described repeatedly in this paper more detailed descriptions of the geological setting hydrogeological cross sections and river characteristics of the three hot springs can be found in liu et al 2000 and li et al 2019 the edq ltg and gd hot springs are characterized by hydrochemical types of ca na hco3 na hco3 cl and na hco3 cl respectively li et al 2019 the edq ltg and gd hot springs have ph ranges of 7 8 8 3 8 1 8 3 and 8 4 8 6 respectively and total dissolved solids tds contents of 843 4 1094 1 mg l 2025 9 2130 5 mg l and 1273 6 1453 6 mg l chen et al 2015 the reservoir temperatures at the edq ltg and gd hot springs are in the range of 210 230 c as determined using multicomponent mineral equilibrium wang et al 2020 the flow rates at edq and ltg are approximately 40 l s and 0 4 l s respectively yan et al 2015 the hot springs comprise mixtures of both hot and cold water 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analysis continuous samples were collected from may 2019 to may 2020 a previous study employed a weekly continuous sampling frequency of stable isotopes to research groundwater anomalies related to earthquakes skelton et al 2019 while another used a monthly sampling frequency onda et al 2018 the shorter the sampling interval is the more earthquake information is captured for this study the sampling interval was approximately 3 or 4 days and the sampling date was fixed for each month table 1s in the supplementary material no samples were taken from the hot springs in february 2020 furthermore due to decreased water flow samples were not available from february to may 2020 at ltg in total 92 69 and 93 samples were taken from the edq ltg and gd hot springs respectively in addition water samples were collected in may 2019 from nearby river and mount gongga table 1 all samples were acquired below the water surface and stored in clean full 30 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles all samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane before measurement a digital thermometer was used to measure the water temperature during field sampling the δ2h and δ18o values were measured with an lwia 912 0008 liquid water isotope analyzer from los gatos research at the key laboratory of crustal dynamics china earthquake administration three certified reference materials crms no gbw04458 gbw04459 and gbw04460 from the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology chinese academy of geological sciences were used to calibrate the isotopes zhang et al 2013 the sample results are presented as δ values relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow in units of the precision was 0 30 for δ2h and 0 08 for δ18o calculated from the mean standard deviation 1σ of all the measured samples the instrument accuracy was characterized by comparing the measurement of crms between different instruments refer to zhang et al 2020 3 2 earthquake data collection stable isotopic changes can be affected by local and distant earthquakes onda et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 earthquake catalog data were used to assess the impacts of earthquakes on temporal variations in stable isotope compositions previous reports on changes in chemical compositions before and after earthquakes at the edq ltg and gd hot springs focused on three major earthquakes i e the 2008 mw 7 9 wenchuan earthquake the 2013 mw 6 6 lushan earthquake and the 2014 mw 5 9 kangding earthquake chen et al 2014 2015 li et al 2019 this study was able to investigate the characteristics of isotopic changes that occurred in response to both major and minor earthquakes in greater detail due to the higher sampling frequency data from global earthquakes with magnitudes 5 and earthquakes with magnitudes 3 at epicentral distances 500 km were collected the earthquake catalog was obtained

epicentral distance in km wang 2007 was used to select earthquakes that may cause hydrological changes a threshold of 10 4 j m3 was used as a metric to select hydrological responses to earthquakes wang and manga 2010 one earthquake e 10 4 j m3 the 17 june 2019 changning mw 5 8 earthquake 104 93 e 28 40 n in sichuan province china from the earthquake catalog met the threshold this earthquake was the largest to strike sichuan province during the observation period the epicentral distances to the edq ltg and gd hot springs were 344 km 337 km and 336 km respectively and the corresponding seismic energy densities were 3 21 10 4 j m3 3 41 10 4 j m3 and 3 47 10 4 j m3 4 results and discussion 4 1 stable isotope compositions and recharge sources of hot springs the δ2h and δ18o values at the edq hot spring varied from 113 10 to 111 19 and from 15 53 to 14 95 respectively with mean values of 112 12 0 35 and 15 18 0 12 n 92 σ the δ2h and δ18o values at the gd hot spring varied from 117 51 to 114 73 and from 15 97 to 15 10 respectively with mean values of 116 47 0 50 and 15 57 0 16 n 93 σ furthermore the measured δ2h and δ18o values at the ltg hot spring ranged from 130 63 to 127 24 and from 16 79 to 16 27 respectively with mean values of 128 83 0 71 and 16 51 0 12 n 69 σ the results are depicted in fig 2 and table 1s overall the isotopic compositions of the edq and gd hot springs were close to each other and they were richer in heavy isotopes than the ltg hot spring moreover the stable isotope values showed small ranges in the three hot springs indicating that the recharge and water residence processes were relatively stable groundwater origins and hydrological processes can be determined by comparing the stable isotope compositions with the meteoric water line craig 1961 pang et al 2017 the global meteoric water line gmwl together with the local meteoric water line lmwl are the most commonly used parameters the gmwl equation is δ2h 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 the equation for the lmwl on the tibetan plateau was selected to be δ2h 8 41δ18o 16 72 lmwl 1 kong et al 2019 another lmwl δ2h 8 10δ18o 12 56 lmwl 2 at mount gongga station was also used for comparative analysis liu et al 2014 mount gongga station 102 e 29 58 n altitude of 2950 m is a member of chinese network of isotopes in precipitation chnip with the distance to the study area of approximately 50 km liu et al 2014 fig 2 shows that the isotope values are distributed around the gmwl and lmwls indicating that the recharge sources of the three hot springs originated from meteoric water a δ18o shift indicates that heavier oxygen isotope is enriched due to water rock interaction in the geothermal system due to the exchange of 18o between geothermal water and oxygen bearing minerals claesson et al 2007 pang et al 2017 the oxygen isotopes at the ltg hot spring shifted to the right of the gmwl and lmwl showing a slight water rock interaction fig 2 however the oxygen isotopes at the edq and gd hot springs were distributed closely to the right of the lmwl indicating the absence of water rock interaction fig 2 these weak or absent water rock interactions may be related to rapid geothermal water circulation and a short aquifer residence time which prevent stronger water rock interactions from being triggered guo et al 2017 also found that remarkable δ18o shifts were not observed in kangding geothermal waters and revealed a short groundwater residence time another study showed that the residence time of the thermal water on the tibetan plateau was short the values of tritium in geothermal water on the tibetan plateau were 2 72 20 tu indicating that modern meteoric sources were responsible and the residence time was less than a dozen years tan et al 2014 the three hot springs are characterized by immature water according to the triangular diagram of na k mg giggenbach 1988 indicating weak water rock equilibrium and fast geothermal water circulation in addition the relations between na k cl and ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 of the three hot springs slope 1 1 r2 0 89 indicated cation exchange reaction with the release of na and adsorption of ca2 and ltg was stronger than edq and gd the above hydrochemical data are from li et al 2019 the distinct water rock interactions among the three hot springs reflect distinct geothermal water circulation pathways and the differences in the isotopic compositions among the three hot springs may also indicate various water recharge sources increasing altitude causes the stable isotope values of water to decrease this altitude effect is useful for distinguishing the recharge elevation blasch and bryson 2007 the stable isotopes of the meteoric water in mount gongga showed δ2h and δ18o lapse rates of 2 41 100 m and 0 30 100 m respectively song et al 2015 the elevation of the edq hot spring is lower than the elevations of the ltg and gd hot springs table 1 the variation in δ18o was in accordance with the altitude effect between edq and ltg however the variations in δ2h and δ18o between the edq and gd hot springs did not agree with the altitude effect furthermore the aquifer lithology and conditions e g temperature are not the main causes of the isotopic variations among the three hot springs because the ltg and gd hot springs have the same aquifer lithology and hydrochemical types and similar temperatures but distinct isotope values whereas the edq and gd hot springs have different lithologies hydrochemical types and temperatures but similar isotopic values fig 2 moreover previous studies have shown that the fault zone architecture controls permeability and fluid flow caine et al 1996 faulkner et al 2010 the edq ltg and gd hot springs are located in different secondary faults of the xianshuihe fault zone these different fracture structures control different aspects of the hydrologic cycle different isotopic values of geothermal water in kangding were also reported by guo et al 2017 and were related to the mixing ratios of natural water sources more attention should be paid to the recharge sources in different fault systems fig 3 illustrates the isotope relationships among the hot springs and various types of water in the study region first the deep geothermal waters with borehole mouth temperatures ranging from 104 c to 178 c n 4 in kangding are mixtures comprising approximately one quarter magmatic water and three quarters snowmelt water and the granite reservoir temperatures range from 250 c to 280 c fig 3 table 2s guo et al 2017 the main geothermal heat source in this area is in the middle and lower crust at depths from 15 km to 30 km zhang et al 2017 second the isotopic compositions of the surface water e g river and mount gongga are similar table 1 indicating that the source of river water is from mount gongga however the isotopic compositions of the surface water are different from those of the meteoric water from mount gongga station and yushu station on the eastern tibetan plateau table 2s which may be related to their mixing with other recharge sources fig 3 demonstrates that the recharge sources of the edq ltg and gd hot springs are likely attributable to the mixing of different waters probably including end members consisting of meteoric water surface water and snowmelt water due to their location on the meteoric water line on the whole the dominant recharges of the three hot springs are provided by meteoric water sources from river and mount gongga however the ltg hot spring has a component of deeply circulating geothermal water these isotopic results are consistent with a previous report showing that the hot springs in the kangding geothermal area may originate from the mixture of shallow groundwater based on a multivariate statistical analysis of hydrogeochemical parameters shi et al 2017 meteoric water is transported into the active and deep xianshuihe fault with strong strike slip movements and then returns to the surface as hot spring water with excess heat tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 4 2 temporal isotopic variations in the hot springs the ranges of the variations in δ2h at the edq ltg and gd hot springs from may 2019 to may 2020 were 1 91 3 39 and 2 78 respectively and those in δ18o were 0 58 0 52 and 0 87 table 1s a previous study also showed small isotopic variations in δ2h 2 49 and δ18o 0 52 in an 82 c hot spring in yunnan province china with four years of observations zhang et al 2020 in a shallow groundwater system the variations in stable isotopes exhibit seasonality that is depletion in winter and enrichment in summer and show a very clear response to strong precipitation tan et al 2016 for example the isotopic compositions of groundwater were influenced by precipitation and land cover conditions with a variation range for δ18o of 2 76 to 4 35 in karst catchments zhao et al 2018 the seasonal variations in stable isotopes decrease with increasing aquifer depth and seasonal variations disappear in deep confined aquifers especially the deep circulating hot springs zhang et al 2020 the isotopic variations show a lack of obvious seasonality and reflect a weak influence of direct precipitation recharge fig 4 in addition for a hot spring such as the ltg hot spring the background changes in water temperature are very steady and the temperature exhibits no seasonality the small temporal isotopic variations are directly related to deep circulation in the active xianshuihe fault zone and stable hydrological processes the data of δ18o and δ2h were normal distribution p 0 05 using the shapiro wilk normality test except δ18o of edq and δ2h of ltg δ18o of edq and δ2h of ltg were normal distribution by eliminating the data beyond mean 2σ the values within mean 2σ which calculated from the normally distributed data are defined as the background the data beyond 2σ are considered anomalies this method has been used to identify groundwater radon anomalies caused by earthquakes igarashi and wakita 1990 there was a period in the δ18o and δ2h time series when the isotope values deviated from the background between may and july 2019 that is before and after the mw 5 8 earthquake and this deviation occurred in all three hot springs fig 4 the changes in the isotope values at the three hot springs showed gradual decreasing trends before the earthquake and then gradual increasing trends afterward and finally recovered to the background levels in july 2019 which was approximately one month after the earthquake the ranges of the variations in δ2h at the edq ltg and gd hot springs from may 2019 to july 2019 before and after the mw 5 8 earthquake were 1 91 1 81 and 2 09 respectively and those in δ18o were 0 40 0 50 and 0 77 table 1s these variations in isotopes were greater than could be accounted for by instrumental precision error previous researches showed that the variations of δ18o anomalies associated with earthquakes were around 1 in iceland claesson et al 2004 skelton et al 2014 2019 it is also reported that this anomaly variations range from 0 2 to 1 onda et al 2018 o neil and king 1981 zhang et al 2020 the δ18o anomalies in this study were also consistent with the above features statistical analysis was performed for δ2h which exhibited larger variations the δ2h data at the three hot springs from may 2019 to july 2019 showed a normal distribution p 0 05 according to the shapiro wilk normality test and the ltg hot springs showed significant difference p 0 01 according to the one sample t test the abnormal variation trends of edq and ltg were similar before and after the earthquake there was no statistically significant difference in δ2h data in gd p 0 05 which may be associated with fewer outliers deviating from the mean value changes in δ2h before earthquake in gd are considered anomalous because several data are different from the values after the earthquake fig 4 h the deviations of isotopes from the meteoric water line are also used to evaluate isotopic earthquake related changes skelton et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 the deviations of δ18o from gmwl values dev gmwl in edq ltg and gd ranged from 0 19 to 0 31 0 55 to 1 06 and 0 04 to 0 59 respectively with a mean of 0 09 0 10 n 92 σ 0 84 0 13 n 69 σ and 0 23 0 14 n 93 σ the dev gmwl values of the edq and ltg hot springs decreased before the earthquake whereas that of the gd hot spring increased fig 5 the change trends in dev gmwl of the three hot springs before and after the mw 5 8 earthquake in fig 5 are consistent with those in fig 4 illustrating the shift in δ18o values and the different groundwater recharge sources before the earthquake since the observations in the current work began only one month may 2019 before the earthquake june 2019 it remains unclear whether the abnormal isotopic changes occurred one or several months before the earthquake the groundwater changes triggered by the earthquake are considered to be regional rather than local the greatest distance between the three hot springs is approximately 15 km therefore it is inferred that the isotopic changes in the three hot springs before an earthquake should be similar in time according to the variation trend of δ18o at the gd hot spring the first few observation data points in may 2019 represented the background characteristics fig 4 g from dev gmwl fig 5 the background and tendencies of increasing or decreasing before the earthquake were obvious the abnormal changes in the isotope values at the edq ltg and gd hot springs are inferred to have occurred within one month before the earthquake because inadequate data are available prior to may 2019 the detailed dynamic processes involved in the isotopic changes before the 2019 earthquake cannot be evaluated in detail nevertheless based on time series major earthquake do impact isotopic changes the groundwater variations under different e values are distinct showing a larger e with larger variations previously observed isotopic variations were larger than those reported in this paper under the influence of higher e values such as those generated by the 2008 mw 7 9 wenchuan earthquake and the 2014 mw 5 9 kangding earthquake fig 1 with e 100 j m3 and e 10 1 j m3 respectively at the observed hot springs chen et al 2014 li et al 2019 the small variation ranges of δ18o in this study together with the stable isotopes deviated from the background slightly greater than or near 2σ threshold fig 4 are speculated to have been related to e at the level of 10 4 j m3 no significant changes in water temperature before and after the 2019 mw 5 8 earthquake were observed in this paper and there was only a small rise in temperature at the edq hot spring fig 4 c f i significant temperature changes were not observed at the ltg and gd hot springs during the mw 5 8 earthquake which may be related to the low e 10 4 j m3 that is temperature changes are bounded by e 10 2 j m3 in the hot springs fig 4f i wang and manga 2010 earthquake related groundwater anomalies occur in areas with crustal deformation montgomery and manga 2003 the mw 5 8 earthquake caused geophysical anomalies within the epicentral distance of 400 km that occurred within a month before the earthquake including geoelectric field and geomagnetic anomalies aisa et al 2020 xi et al 2020 the geoelectric field anomaly was due to the rapid release of fluid during the rock microfracture process xi et al 2020 the geophysical abnormal occurrence times and epicentral distances were close to those of the three hot springs it is possible that regional crustal deformation and stress build up occurred before the earthquake several long term bedrock temperature observations in the xianshuihe fault zone showed that the permeability was enhanced due to the dynamic stress resulting in the increasing upward movement of deep fluids due to moderately distant earthquakes liu et al 2020 the isotopic changes before the 2019 mw 5 8 earthquake may have been more closely related to aquifer recharge changes caused by permeability changes due to the pre earthquake accumulation of stress which affected the chemical reactions and recharge environments at the hot springs such preseismic changes in isotopes and mechanism have also been confirmed by continuous isotopic observations of other geothermal waters skelton et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 in addition to the effects of the mw 5 8 earthquake on the observed isotopic changes some isotopic changes were observed in the time series fig 4 1 flow rate changed there was a significant decrease in water temperature followed by a decrease in δ2h after january 2020 at ltg fig 4 e f in january 2020 there was a significant decrease in flow subsequently the flow was cut off after which samples could not be collected this change was related to the sinter deposit identified through field survey this deposition may result in the following processes 1 clogging of the flow path which changes fault permeability and affects temperature and or 2 changes in the water pressure that drives the geothermal water circulation system gottardi et al 2013 grasby et al 2019 2 water temperature changed the water temperature dropped in may 2020 followed by decreasing trends in the δ2h and δ18o values at edq fig 4a b the water temperature sharply dropped in october and december 2019 followed by another sharp drop in april 2020 at gd as the temperature changed the δ2h and or δ18o values changed fig 4 g h i these isotopes changes appeared to be around 2σ threshold the deviation of dev gmwl most were decreasing changes showed the recharges of cold water fig 5 it is speculated that two factors may be responsible for this change 1 it may be related to regional tectonic activity that induced groundwater isotopic changes without earthquake occurrence groundwater anomalies may occur under the influence of local stress changes but this does not necessarily mean that an earthquake followed igarashi and wakita 1990 a variety of tectonically induced groundwater anomalies without earthquakes have been reported such as rises in water level springs drying up and artesian pressure or gushing in deep wells in the xichang area of the anninghe fault zone which lies to the south of the xianshuihe fault zone shi et al 2018 2 the changes in temperature showed that the recharge ratios between deep geothermal water and cold water with distinct water rock interactions in the hot springs had changed causing the isotopic changes the mw 5 8 earthquake caused the synchronous isotopic changes in the three hot springs but the isotopic changes discussed above did not occur synchronically it is speculated that isotopic changes could be related to the local recharge environment such as meteorological variations and or stress the variations of oxygen isotope at edq in the end of august 2019 were beyond 2σ fig 4a it is speculated that this period may be related to post seismic effect and recovery the hydrogen isotope anomaly in may 2020 was more likely a lagged effect of this water temperature increase fig 4 h i or it could be a random effect 4 3 stable isotopes and earthquake observation the isotopic variation characteristics were obtained for the first time by collecting one year of continuous observations from the xianshuihe fault zone the background variations in the stable isotopes were stable indicating that the recharge and cycling of the hot springs were relatively balanced the three hot springs considered herein are located in a deep and large active fault zone and are sensitive to seismicity specifically variations in the values of the isotopes at all of the observed hot springs reflect changes in the water recharge sources and the hydrological environment which indicate underground tectonic activity obvious isotopic anomalies such as those observed before and after the 2019 mw 5 8 changning earthquake showed the same change trend and occurrence time moreover the three hot springs exhibited synchronous anomalies before the earthquake supporting a possible relationship with the target earthquake in previous continuous isotopic observations of other geothermal waters such as those in northern iceland and yunnan province china isotopic anomalies sudden or gradual changes occurred several months before major earthquakes and the changes were seismically generated skelton et al 2014 2019 zhang et al 2020 these changes show that deeply circulated geothermal water is sensitive to crustal stress and tectonic activity the isotopic observation method is based on the premise that earthquakes can cause changes in hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes in aquifers such as under the influence of new recharge entering the aquifer and or water rock interactions it has also been confirmed that isotopic changes related to e 10 3 j m3 have larger isotopic anomalies and longer durations than those related to e 10 4 j m3 skelton et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 furthermore the variation ranges of isotopes may indicate the influences of the earthquake magnitude and epicentral distance the advantage of this approach is that stable isotope changes can be leveraged to trace hydrogeological processes such as changes in permeability groundwater mixing and water rock interactions claesson et al 2007 hosono et al 2020 and these processes are closely related to the stress changes caused by earthquakes various environmental interference factors such as precipitation and surface water recharge can also be identified by comparing different recharge sources in this paper the observation frequency of isotopes reached 3 or 4 days per sample which is sufficiently detailed to describe the changes in the stable isotopes before and after earthquakes and isotopes can be employed to describe the fracturing and healing of aquifers therefore it is believed that long term observations with high density sampling are highly valuable for studying earthquake precursors ingebritsen and manga 2014 in this paper synchronous isotopic responses are used to illustrate earthquake related changes some physicochemical parameters of groundwater such as temperature conductivity ph dissolved oxygen and flow rate which may distinguish groundwater recharges and sources from deep and or shallow flow components can also differ before and after earthquakes barberio et al 2017 kaown et al 2019 ma et al 2018 woith et al 2013 therefore in the future it will be helpful to identify the sources of water recharges and abnormal change processes with continuous observation of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes together with other groundwater physical and chemical indicators 5 conclusions the temporal variations in the δ18o and δ2h values at the edq ltg and gd hot springs in the kangding geothermal area on the eastern tibetan plateau geothermal belt were investigated the stable isotopes revealed the recharge sources of meteoric water in the hot springs the meteoric water that circulates downward along the fault zone is heated by heat sources at depth and then ascends as hot water to the surface the differences in the stable isotopes among the three hot springs reflect distinct groundwater recharge and circulation processes consistent stable isotope anomalies were observed before and after the 2019 changning mw 5 8 earthquake at the edq ltg and gd hot springs and a possible earthquake precursor was observed the amplitudes of anomalous variations in the stable isotopes at the edq ltg and gd hot springs were related to the earthquake energy density these results suggest that simultaneous isotopic variations among multiple hot springs

4454,quantifying hydrological processes that control the upper critical zone water balance and contaminant transport in drained landscapes is needed especially as precipitation patterns driving water balance dynamics continue to shift due to climate change here hydrometric data are integrated with stable isotope signatures to quantify water storage mixing and fluxes to subsurface tile drainage at an agricultural field located in indiana usa over a 2 yr period precipitation soil water sampled with suction lysimeters 10 80 cm depth groundwater below tile depth 1 m and subsurface tile discharge were sampled 97 times results showed that isotopic variability in near surface soil water 10 20 cm reflected the seasonality of the precipitation input signal while groundwater values were relatively consistent indicating that water stored below tile drain depth was recharged during winter soil water between 20 and 80 cm depth was a mixture of near surface water and groundwater that varied seasonally depending upon groundwater hydrodynamics mean transit time of water ranged from 12 to 20 d for 10 cm soil water to 225 334 d for groundwater with tile drainage exhibiting a mean transit time of 245 d both two and three component hydrograph separation indicated that groundwater was the primary source of water to the tile drain followed by soil water tile drain hydrograph response i e celerity was largely controlled by antecedent wetness comparison of tile drain celerities and velocities revealed however varying mechanisms controlling hydrograph response across a range of environmental conditions data sets of both water and tracer flux were thus useful to track the spatiotemporal variability of water fluxes within and from the critical zone such data provide valuable information to improve the representation of critical zone processes in these landscapes within spatially distributed hydrological models keywords subsurface drainage hydrograph separation tracer soil water groundwater agriculture 1 introduction improved or artificial drainage has been implemented on approximately 13 of cropped agricultural land globally mainly in north america europe and the middle east to increase productivity of poorly drained or salinized soils nijland and croon 2005 in humid regions including the u s midwest the primary goal of agricultural drainage is to remove excess water and improve trafficability during crop planting and harvesting fausey 2003 this is often accomplished through the installation of pipe or tile drainage in the subsurface that lowers seasonally or perennially high water tables blann et al 2009 king et al 2015 installation of subsurface drainage substantially modifies catchment hydrology macrae et al 2007 eastman et al 2010 kennedy et al 2012 schilling et al 2012 boland brien et al 2014 king et al 2014 and when coupled with decades of nutrient additions to maximize crop yield can result in transport limited nutrient export basu et al 2010 guan et al 2011 williams et al 2018 physical understanding of hydrological processes that control the water balance of the upper critical zone is therefore critical for the sustainability of artificially drained agroecosystems kleinman et al 2018 especially as precipitation patterns driving water balance dynamics continue to shift due to climate change e g groisman et al 2012 williams and king 2020 predictions of water balance changes in the upper critical zone resulting from either agricultural intensification or hydroclimatic variability are usually based on hydrologic models

by different mechanisms beven 2010 mcdonnell and beven 2014 scaini et al 2017 van verseveld et al 2017 celerity is controlled by the storage deficit that must be satisfied or remain as the saturated zone rises and falls while velocity is controlled by the characteristics of the filled water storage mcdonnell and beven 2014 celerity and velocity converge to similar values only in preferential flow domains hrachowitz et al 2016 thus focusing solely on hydrograph response is only half of the story in understanding how water moves through the upper critical zone tracers such as stable water isotopes δ2h and δ18o can be valuable for providing insight into the velocity of water and transport processes enabling estimation of water sources flow paths and residence times sprenger et al 2016 accounting for flow velocities in the upper critical zone is also invaluable for understanding contaminant transport e g williams et al 2016a macrae et al 2019 combining mass flux measurements of water with tracer flux measurements is needed as conceptualizing hydrologic processes in a physically realistic way is necessary to get the right results for the right reasons when testing models as hypotheses kirchner 2006 clark et al 2016 examination of hydrograph characteristics across natural and drained catchments suggests that subsurface tile drains may homogenize landscape response that is tile drains allow for the bypassing of the structural complexity of catchments boland brien et al 2014 development of more parsimonious hydrologic models may therefore be feasible for drained regions basu et al 2010 while the celerity of drained landscapes may be easier to simulate compared to naturally draining landscapes accurate prediction of contaminant transport especially strongly sorbing contaminants commonly applied to agricultural lands such as phosphorus and pesticides remains difficult because hydrologic processes e g preferential flow that account for differences in flow velocities among drained fields and conditions are not often included in hydrologic models radcliffe et al 2015 ford et al 2017 inclusion of flow velocity data would require more complex models with more parameters to be identified and data sets with both water and tracer flux measurements are sparse in drained agricultural landscapes klaus and mcdonnell 2013 when data sets are available they typically encompass a few storm events during the spring season granger et al 2010 vidon and cuadra 2010 williams et al 2016a zajicek et al 2016 further tracer based hydrograph separations in drained landscapes often work on the assumption that the isotopic signatures of soil water are similar to that of groundwater and tile drain baseflow describes the composition of the pre event water end member it is likely however that soil water differs isotopically from groundwater and varies with depth in the profile klaus et al 2013 sprenger et al 2016 potentially leading to large uncertainties in hydrograph separation results klaus and mcdonnell 2013 quantifying the interplay of shallow and deep soil water and how the spatiotemporal variability in soil water influences the resulting groundwater signature is imperative to understanding the mixing of water sources and the blend of tile drain stormflow components here we examine the spatial and temporal variability in stable water isotopic signatures within an intensively drained agricultural field in northeastern indiana usa to better understand water storage mixing and fluxes weekly sampling of precipitation soil water 10 80 cm groundwater and tile drain discharge were completed within the study field along with hydrometric measurements rainfall amount and intensity soil moisture groundwater depth tile discharge over a two year study period study objectives were to i quantify spatial and temporal variability in isotopic signatures of precipitation soil water groundwater and tile drain discharge and estimate mean transit times ii employ two and three component hydrograph separation techniques to evaluate water sources and flow pathways to tile drains and iii examine differences in the celerity and velocity of tile drain discharge 2 methods 2 1 site description an agricultural field 22 7 ha located in the st joseph river watershed in northeastern indiana usa 41 32 01 n 84 48 38 w was monitored as part of the current study fig 1 the field was cropped in a three year rotation of corn zea mays l soybean glycine max l merr and wheat avena sativa l with a cover crop mixture planted during the non growing season conservation tillage i e soil mixing depth 10 cm occurred prior to corn planting during the study period the surface topography of the field was flat slopes ranging from 0 to 2 fig 1 and soils were classified as either blount silt loam fine illitic mesic aeric epiaqualfs somewhat poorly drained or pewamo silty clay fine mixed active mesic typic argiaquolls very poorly drained which were found at higher and lower elevations within the field respectively organic matter content in surface soils 0 5 cm was between 5 6 and 7 9 and decreased with depth while clay content 0 5 cm 24 to 32 60

subsurface tile laterals 10 cm dia are connected to a tile main 20 cm dia which was monitored at the edge of field where it discharged into a drainage ditch field hydrology is largely controlled by the subsurface drainage system like many drained agricultural fields e g pease et al 2018 williams et al 2018 during the study period june 2017 through august 2019 only 5 overland flow events occurred compared to 57 subsurface tile flow events with subsurface tile drain discharge accounting for 90 of the total water flux from the field 2 2 precipitation soil moisture soil water and groundwater monitoring two sampling sites kcl 1 and kcl 2 were established within the study field for monitoring of precipitation soil moisture soil water and groundwater fig 1 both sites were located approximately 35 m from the field edge to minimize the impact of research activities on farming operations site selection was also determined based on field topography and dominant soil type where kcl 1 and kcl 2 were located at higher blount soil series and lower pewamo soil series elevations respectively each site was equipped with a rain gauge to facilitate the collection of precipitation rainfall and snow for analysis whereby precipitation collected in the gauge was funneled into a sample bottle four moisture sensors ech2o ec 5 meter group inc pullman wa were installed at each site depths of 20 40 60 and 80 cm to measure soil volumetric water content vwc a groundwater well 2 m deep screened depth 1 0 to 2 0 m was also installed at each site and a depth sensor hydros 21 meter group inc pullman wa was used to record water level within the well both soil vwc and water depth in the wells were recorded hourly throughout the duration of the study equipment error resulted in two gaps 17 d and 79 d in soil vwc and groundwater depth data fig 2 during these periods three rainfall runoff events occurred and were not included in subsequent analyses evaluating the effect of antecedent conditions on subsurface tile flow generation ceramic soil solution samplers were installed at depths of 10 20 40 60 and 80 cm at both kcl 1 and kcl 2 a continuous vacuum of 12 kpa was maintained in each sampler by means of a hanging water column as described by riekerk and morris 1983 thus samples collected in the ceramic samplers represented the mobile fraction of soil water water samples from the rain gauges groundwater wells and soil solution samplers were collected every 4 to 21 d mean 8 3 d from june 2017 through august 2019 for a total of 97 sampling intervals of the 97 sampling intervals 92 occurred 10 d apart with longer sampling intervals occurring during periods with no precipitation or during the winter when evaporation potential was low all water samples were analyzed for electrical conductivity ec and stable water isotopes δ18o and δ2h stable water isotope ratios were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer lwia 45 ep los gatos research san jose ca against reference values calibrated to vienna standard mean ocean water instrument precision for δ18o and δ2h was 0 11 and 0 5 respectively 2 3 weather and subsurface tile discharge a weather station lufft ws600 lufft usa inc carpinteria ca was located near the field edge to measure rainfall amount and intensity air temperature wind speed humidity and solar radiation at a 10 min interval fig 1 subsurface tile discharge q was also measured at the field edge as described by williams et al 2016b briefly the subsurface tile drain outlet was equipped with a compound weir insert thel mar brevard nc where the original outlet draining the field was cut and fitted with a 30 cm diameter pipe that facilitated the installation of the weir insert water level was recorded at a 10 min interval using an isco signature flow meter teledyne isco lincoln ne and an area velocity sensor isco 2150 teledyne isco lincoln ne was also used in the development of stage discharge relationships when the subsurface tile became submerged water samples were collected daily from the subsurface tile drain using an automated water sampler isco 6712 teledyne isco lincoln ne daily water samples were composited to match the sampling interval for rainfall soil water and groundwater subsurface tile drain water samples were also analyzed for ec and stable water isotopes 2 4 data analysis to evaluate spatial and temporal dynamics in soil water and groundwater δ2h line conditioned excess lc excess soil vwc and water table depth were compared by site depth and season precipitation isotopic signatures n 85 were used to determine the local meteoric water line lmwl for the study site using precipitation weighted least squares regression as outlined in crawford et al 2014 for each water sample lc excess was calculated as a function of the slope a 7 33 0 15 and the intercept b 7 02 1 22 of the lmwl as suggested by landwehr and coplen 2006 1 l c e x c e s s δ 2 h a δ 18 o b the lc excess describes the deviation of the sample s δ2h value from the lmwl in the dual isotope space and indicates non equilibrium fractionation processes due to evaporation after rainfall sprenger et al 2017 found lc excess was advantageous over deuterium excess or single isotope approaches for inferring evaporation fractionation because the lc excess of rainfall is approximately 0 and has minimal seasonal fluctuation statistical analyses for the soil water isotopes and soil vwc for individual sites depths and seasons were done with non parametric tests since the null hypothesis that the data were drawn from a normal distribution was rejected using the shapiro wilk test for normality differences between sites i e kcl 1 vs kcl 2 were assessed using the mann whitney wilcoxon test differences among depths and seasons were evaluated with the kruskal wallis test when significant differences were present a post hoc dunn test with bonferroni adjustment was used to determine which sampling depths or seasons were significantly different seasons were defined as winter january february march spring april may june summer july august september and fall october november december analyses were completed in r statistical software r core team 2014 mean transit time t or the mean age of water leaving the system for soil water groundwater and subsurface tile drain water were estimated using a simple steady state well mixed model as described in dewalle et al 1997 periodic regression analysis was used to fit a seasonal sine wave model to δ18o fluctuations of inputs i e rainfall and outputs i e soil water groundwater and subsurface tile drain water as 2 δ 18 o x a cos c t θ where δ18o is the predicted oxygen 18 value x is the annual mean δ18o a is the δ18o annual amplitude c is the radial frequency of annual fluctuations rad d 1 t is time in days after june 1 2018 and θ is the phase lag or time of annual peak δ18o rad assuming an exponential distribution of transit times mean transit time in days was computed as 3 t c 1 a z 2 a z 1 2 1 0 5 where az 2 and az 1 are the amplitude at depth z2 and z1 respectively here precipitation represents the surface or z1 0 values only data from the second half of the study period after june 1 2018 were used to estimate t due to the potential lag between rainfall inputs and soil water shallow groundwater and subsurface tile drain water response for rainfall events 6 mm that occurred with a 6 h period separated by 6 h from additional rainfall king et al 2016 subsurface tile drain hydrograph characteristics including time to flow initiation time to peak average flow peak flow cumulative flow and runoff coefficient were computed to determine dominant controls on water flux previous research in tile drained landscapes have observed that a combination of antecedent conditions and precipitation control subsurface tile drain flow vidon and cuadra 2010 lam et al 2016 williams et al 2019 thus rainfall characteristics amount and intensity and antecedent conditions soil moisture deficit and water table depth were compared to subsurface tile drain runoff coefficients soil moisture deficit smd was calculated as 4 sm d t v w c max v w c t 100 s t where vwcmax was the maximum observed soil moisture content and assumed to represent saturated conditions vwct was the measured soil moisture at time t and st is soil thickness mm geris et al 2015 smd was calculated for each soil layer and summed together to estimate dynamic storage for the entire soil profile immediately prior to the rainfall event linear and segmented regression were used to assess relationships between subsurface tile drain runoff coefficient and either rainfall or antecedent condition variables to infer sources of subsurface tile drain water both two and three component hydrograph separation were utilized genereux 1998 hydrograph separation was completed for each sampling interval using ec and stable water isotope tracers when both subsurface tile drain values and end member rainfall soil water depths groundwater values were available several combinations of tracer and end members were used based upon spatial and temporal dynamics in end member tracer values mixing fractions of subsurface tile q for each sampling interval i e event water qe q pre event water qpe q determined with two component hydrograph separation δ18o as a tracer rainfall and groundwater as end members were also multiplied by runoff coefficient to determine qe p and qpe p as described by von freyberg et al 2018 5 q e p q p q e q 6 q pe p 1 q e p while qe q quantifies the fraction of total storm discharge that comes from rainfall qe p quantifies the fraction of total rainfall that will be discharged during the same event similarly qpe q quantifies the fraction of total discharge that comes from storage while qpe p quantifies how much pre event water is mobilized by not contained in a unit volume of precipitation both qe p and qpe p were compared to rainfall characteristics and antecedent conditions to examine how sources of subsurface tile drain water varied with hydroclimatic dynamics for sampling intervals with more than one rainfall event 6 mm average runoff coefficient was used 3 results 3 1 hydroclimatic dynamics precipitation at the field site over the study ranged from 1059 mm yr 1 2018 to 1118 mm yr 1 2019 with average monthly precipitation of 87 3 45 3 mm mean standard deviation fig 2 spring tended to have the most precipitation 125 6 40 7 mm month 1 while summer had the least precipitation 58 4 23 5 mm month 1 most rainfall events 6 mm occurred during the spring but average rainfall intensity was greatest in the summer table 1 during the study 15 snowfall events occurred during winter with snow accumulation averaging 53 23 mm per event snow accumulation remained on the soil surface for 4 4 4 3 d prior to melting five day storm trajectories computed with the hysplit trajectory model stein et al 2015 showed that summer rainfall was predominantly sourced from warm moist maritime tropical air masses traveling north from the gulf of mexico into the study region fig 3 these summer events were generally convective storms producing rainfall with greater intensity and shorter duration in contrast during fall and winter stratiform rainfall was derived from either maritime polar or continental polar air masses which produced lower intensity longer duration events fig 3 seasonal differences in rainfall source resulted in variability in the average seasonal isotopic signature of precipitation measured at the field site table 1 annual potential evapotranspiration pet estimated using the penman monteith equation and site meteorological data ranged from 922 mm 2018 to 960 mm 2017 pet showed a strong seasonal variation with average pet rates of 0 6 to 1 9 mm d 1 from november through march i e non growing season and 2 8 to 5 2 mm d 1 from april through october i e growing season fig 2 maximum pet rates however were between 4 6 and 9 3 mm d 1 between april and october monthly sums of subsurface tile discharge q were positively correlated with monthly precipitation ρ 0 55 p 0 005 but were not correlated with monthly pet ρ 0 12 p 0 554 discharge was recorded from the subsurface tile drain during 83 of the study period 634 of 761 d greater q was generally observed during the non growing season 51 6 30 3 mm month 1 compared to the growing season 26 8 24 4 mm month 1 fig 2 on 81 and 50 of the days q was 1 0 mm d 1 and 0 1 mm d 1 respectively however during rainfall events the field site responded quickly and flow rates increased within a few hours time to flow initiation 6 3 4 4 h time to peak 11 3 6 9 h average flow rate during storm events was 0 23 0 14 mm h 1 and peak flow rate was 0 49 0 29 mm h 1 fig 2 3 2 spatiotemporal patterns in isotopic signatures soil moisture and water table depth 3 2 1 site differences kcl 1 vs kcl 2 located on the flatter lower landscape position kcl 2 had greater median soil vwc compared to kcl 1 especially at depths 0 4 m fig 4 soil vwc was also less variable at kcl 2 interquartile range 0 02 to 0 05 m3 m 3 relative to kcl 1 interquartile range 0 07 to 0 14 m3 m 3 at these depths throughout the study groundwater remained closer to the soil surface at kcl 2 than kcl 1 fig 4 with maximum groundwater level at kcl 1 and kcl 2 reaching 0 33 m and 0 24 m respectively fig 2 on 30 and 56 of the days groundwater level was within 1 0 m of the soil surface at kcl 1 and kcl 2 respectively precipitation isotopic signature often varied between field sites despite only being located 125 m apart mean absolute difference in precipitation δ18o and δ2h between sites was 0 44 0 64 and 2 5 4 2 respectively differences in δ18o and δ2h between sites however were not consistent among sampling intervals mean difference between kcl 1 and kcl 2 0 13 0 77 and 0 1 4 9 respectively fig 4 mobile soil water exhibited greater variability in δ2h and δ18o not shown in near surface soil layers compared to deeper in the soil profile at both sites median soil water δ2h values were greater at depths of 0 4 m and 0 8 m as well as in groundwater for kcl 1 compared to kcl 2 fig 4 while lc excess was similar throughout the soil profile between sites except at a depth of 0 2 m 3 2 2 seasonal differences consistent with seasonal precipitation amounts and pet rates soil vwc was lower during the summer across all depths 0 2 m to 0 8 m compared to other seasons fig 5 groundwater level was also deeper during the summer compared to other seasons fig 5 during winter spring and fall seasons median groundwater level was closer to the soil surface median depth 1 08 m 0 96 m and 1 24 m respectively compared to the summer median depth 1 87 m seasonal precipitation isotopic signatures δ18o δ2h and lc excess table 1 were reflected in soil water isotopic values fig 5 soil water δ2h signatures tended to be lower in winter than summer while soil water lc excess tended to be greater in winter than summer spring and fall soil water isotope signatures fell within winter and summer values resulting from a mixture of precipitation sources fig 3 precipitation isotope signatures were dampened with depth in the soil profile the largest differences in seasonal soil water δ2h and lc excess occurred at shallow soil depths 0 1 m and 0 2 m although differences were also noted at deeper depths 0 8 m and in groundwater fig 5 median lc excess for all seasons and depths 0 2 m including groundwater were 0 0 soil water and groundwater isotopic signatures plotted along the lmwl fig 6 except for a few instances in shallow soil depths during summer median groundwater lc excess did not vary seasonally and was between 2 1 and 3 6 which was consistent with winter precipitation table 1 fig 5 3 2 3 differences with depth in the soil profile stable water isotope signatures varied with depth in the soil profile throughout most of the study period fig 7 in general near surface soil water δ2h values 10 cm and 20 cm tended to differ from deep soil water 80 cm and groundwater δ2h values groundwater δ2h remained relatively consistent across sampling intervals median 52 8 thus variation in isotope signature with depth was largely controlled by precipitation inputs fig 7 variation of isotopic signature was therefore not consistent during similar seasons among years fig 7 for example there were minimal differences observed in δ2h values with depth in the soil profile during winter 2018 due to precipitation δ2h inputs similar to groundwater δ2h values difference 1 1 in contrast during fall 2018 precipitation δ2h values were 29 4 less than groundwater δ2h values resulting in large variation in isotopic signature with depth during fall 2018 and winter 2019 middle depths i e 40 cm and 60 cm reflected a mixture of both groundwater and precipitation near surface soil water δ2h values as isotopic signatures at these depths were often similar to both shallow and deep water sources fig 7 during periods when the groundwater table was closer to the surface and frequently interacted with 40 cm and 60 cm depths the isotopic signatures exhibited δ2h values similar to groundwater e g spring 2019 whereas when the groundwater table remained deeper in the profile isotopic signatures were more similar to near surface values e g summer 2017 median lc excess values were relatively consistent throughout the soil profile except during summer sampling when 10 cm lc excess differed from groundwater lc excess fig 7 while soil vwc was not measured at a depth of 10 cm soil vwc tended to be less at 20 cm compared to other depths in the soil profile fig 7 greater pet rates during summer may therefore have resulted in lower lc excess at 10 cm compared to other depths 3 3 estimating mean transit time sine wave regression models fit to the data at kcl 1 and kcl 2 indicated a damping and lagging of the δ18o signal from precipitation to soil water to groundwater table 2 precipitation δ18o signature was variable among sampling intervals but seasonal patterns were able to be described by a sine wave cycle r2 0 39 in soil water and groundwater the δ18o seasonal cycle was damped and smoothed thus they were generally better described by a sine wave kcl 1 r2 0 36 to 0 84 kcl 2 r2 0 52 to 0 83 soil water δ18o amplitude at 40 cm depth was reduced by 50 to 54 relative to precipitation and the peak δ18o occurred 45 d to 58 d after the precipitation peak at kcl 2 and kcl 1 respectively table 2 similarly groundwater δ18o amplitude was decreased by 83 and 75 relative to precipitation at kcl 2 and kcl 1 respectively with peak δ18o occurring 58 d and 52 d after the precipitation peak table 2 mean transit time was computed for soil water groundwater and subsurface tile q using a well mixed model equation 3 table 2 the mean transit time for soil water ranged from 12 d to 20 d 0 03 yr to 0 05 yr at a depth of 10 cm and from 139 d to 168 d 0 38 yr to 0 46 yr at a depth of 80 cm groundwater mean transit time was 225 d and 334 d 0 62 yr and 0 92 yr at kcl 1 and kcl 2 respectively mean transit time of subsurface tile q measured at the field edge was 245 d 0 67 yr table 2 3 4 two and three component hydrograph separation using δ18o as a tracer and several combinations of event water and pre event water end members the event water fraction of subsurface tile q qe q was computed for each sampling interval fig 8 and summarized seasonally table 3 selection of groundwater from kcl 1 as the pre event end member consistently produced unrealistic component mixtures i e qpe q 100 data not shown thus groundwater from kcl 2 was used in all subsequent two component hydrograph separations comparing precipitation from kcl 1 and kcl 2 as the event water end member showed that during individual sampling intervals subsurface tile q was comprised of 1 to 93 mean 25 26 event water when precipitation from kcl 1 was used fig 8 and 1 to 90 mean 23 26 event water when precipitation from kcl 2 was used seasonally the largest difference in qe q when using precipitation from either kcl 1 or kcl 2 occurred during the winter table 3 regardless of whether precipitation from kcl 1 or kcl 2 were used qe q tended to be greater in the winter and summer compared to the spring and fall table 3 event water fraction of subsurface tile q was also computed using soil water δ18o from either 10 cm or 10 cm and 20 cm average of both sites and or depths as the event water end member soil water δ18o from a depth of 10 cm resulted in similar estimates of annual qe q mean 24 19 but exhibited increased spring qe q and decreased summer qe q relative to precipitation table 3 using soil water δ18o from depths of 10 cm and 20 cm resulted in additional increases in spring qe q compared to both precipitation and only soil water from 10 cm which resulted in greater annual estimates of subsurface tile qe q mean 30 24 table 3 the addition of a second tracer ec for three component hydrograph separation was not ideal as seasonal precipitation soil water and groundwater data plotted on a linear line within the δ18o ec mixing space fig 9 plotting data within the δ18o ec mixing space did however reveal that subsurface tile q values generally fell within soil water and groundwater sources during all seasons with subsurface tile q similar to groundwater from kcl 2 during all seasons except summer when it was more similar to soil water fig 9 using precipitation average soil water all depths kcl 2 and groundwater kcl 2 in the three component hydrograph separation soil water comprised 25 16 26 and 98 of subsurface tile q during the fall winter spring and summer respectively while groundwater comprised the remainder if average soil water from kcl 1 was used in the three component hydrograph separation then soil water comprised 30 17 31 and 89 of subsurface tile q during the fall winter spring and summer respectively with groundwater comprising of the remainder except during summer when precipitation accounted for the remining water 3 5 celerities and velocities of subsurface tile discharge discharge to precipitation ratio q p for subsurface tile drainage was used to describe hydrologic response or celerity subsurface tile q p during storm events 6 mm exhibited a weak linear relationship with rainfall amount p 0 05 r2 0 18 data not shown where q was observed across the entire range of event rainfall amount other rainfall characteristics including average intensity and maximum intensity were also compared to subsurface tile q p but were not related p 0 05 r2 0 02 soil moisture deficit smd determined for the entire soil profile at both kcl 1 and kcl 2 immediately preceding a rainfall event was non linearly related to subsurface tile q p data not shown the number of rainfall events that produced q increased as smd increased i e wetness increased often with no flow occurring if smd 60 mm or 40 mm at kcl 1 and kcl 2 respectively although the relationship between q p and smd was non linear visual identification of a clear threshold above which subsurface q was generated was not possible given that rainfall events with and without flow generally occurred over a range of smd values between 40 mm and 0 mm when smd and rainfall amount were summed smd rainfall and compared with subsurface tile q p however a clear threshold pattern was evident fig 10 threshold values determined with segmented regression were 20 mm and 16 mm for kcl 1 and kcl 2 respectively below the threshold value the relationship between smd rainfall and q p was poorly related but above the threshold value a positive linear relationship was observed fig 10 maximum groundwater depth measured during a rainfall event was also compared to subsurface tile q p fig 10 similar to the relationship between smd rainfall and q p a threshold relationship was observed between maximum groundwater depth and q p when groundwater depth remained below subsurface tile depth subsurface tile q was unlikely to occur however if groundwater depth exceeded tile depth then subsurface tile q was generated comparison of subsurface tile hydrograph characteristics to groundwater response to rainfall revealed that subsurface tile q was on average initiated with the onset of groundwater rise and that maximum groundwater depth during a rainfall event lagged behind peak subsurface tile q by 2 5 h to 4 1 h fig 10 to compare subsurface tile celerity and velocity the event water fraction of subsurface tile discharge qe q calculated with two component hydrograph separation using rainfall and groundwater as end members was multiplied by q p to determine qe p i e von freyberg et al 2018 comparing the relationship of q p and qe p to smd rainfall revealed differences in celerity and velocity with the magnitude of difference varying depending on the degree to which precipitation exceeded smd when smd rainfall 0 mm values of q p and qe p tended to be similar fig 10 as smd rainfall approached 0 mm there was considerable variability in the relationship between q p and qe p with differences in q p and qe p becoming greater as smd rainfall increased 4 discussion 4 1 mixing of precipitation input and the upper critical zone water storage collection of water samples during 97 sampling intervals over 2 years revealed the isotopic response of soil water and groundwater to variable precipitation inputs strong seasonal gradients observed in precipitation isotopic signature resulting from differences in dominant air mass were reflected in surficial soil water 10 20 cm while temporal variation in isotopic values of these near surface soils were substantial minimal spatial differences i e between sites were detected uniform agricultural management in combination with the relatively flat topography and similar soil types likely precluded spatial differences in soil water isotopic signature in near surface soils of the study field in drained geomorphological landforms such as closed depressions which are common throughout glaciated areas of north america or among drained fields soil properties e g organic matter and as a result near surface soil water isotopic signatures could exhibit a greater degree of spatial variability for instance sprenger et al 2017 found spatial differences in topsoil organic matter content impacted the mixing of precipitation and soil water except for a few occasions near surface soil water as well as deeper soil water and groundwater plotted along the lmwl indicating negligible evaporation fractionation study results therefore confirm previous work showing that soil water sampled with suction lysimeters was relatively young mobile water that percolated without experiencing pronounced water loss due to soil evaporation geris et al 2015 sprenger et al 2018 while sampling bulk soil water with direct equilibrium methods include more tightly bound water that integrates older water sprenger et al 2018 precipitation and mobile fractions of soil water are often associated with contaminant transport to subsurface tile drains klaus et al 2014 williams et al 2016a groundwater 1 m deep below subsurface tile depth in contrast to near surface soil water remained relatively consistent across sampling intervals and seasons groundwater lc excess indicated that water stored below subsurface tile drain depth was largely recharged during winter months cool air temperatures fallow fields and typically wet conditions during winter months facilitate this groundwater recharge thus during most of the year water above subsurface tile drain depth either precipitation or near surface soil water does not infiltrate below the subsurface tile drains in large quantities previous work examining nitrogen loss to groundwater among diverse agricultural landscapes has also found that fields with subsurface tile drains are less susceptible to nitrogen loss to groundwater i e below tile depth puckett et al 2011 woo and kumar 2019 providing further evidence of minimal water movement from above subsurface tile drains to deeper depths during most of the year examination of isotopic signatures across the entire soil profile highlighted both the mixing of precipitation inputs with water stored in the critical zone and the importance of groundwater table dynamics on regulating soil water isotopic values in tile drained landscapes while near surface soil water signatures resembled recent precipitation and groundwater signatures were determined by winter recharge soil water in between i e 20 cm 80 cm was a mixture of both sources with the dominant component and isotopic signature varying based on groundwater table dynamics drier warmer summer months were characterized by soil water isotopic signatures at these depths that were more similar to precipitation inputs and near surface soil water signatures as the groundwater table remainder deeper in the profile in contrast during wetter cooler spring months soil water isotopic signatures in the middle profile were more similar to groundwater as the water table frequently rose into this zone this finding is somewhat counterintuitive as more precipitation would seem to imply that mobile water above the subsurface tile drain depth would also reflect precipitation inputs laboratory and field scale experiments however have shown that only small fractions of applied rainfall infiltrate beyond near surface soils for instance using 30 cm deep undisturbed soil monoliths williams et al 2020 found on average that only one third of total discharge from the bottom of the monolith during a 33 mm rainfall simulation was irrigation water i e qe q similarly soil water isotope data in conjunction with a compartmental mixing cell model showed that 0 to 37 mean 19 of soil water at 40 cm to 50 cm depths was from a 41 mm irrigation event klaus et al 2013 groundwater at the current study site therefore functioned as an isostat whereby larger volumes of water stored deeper in the soil profile that were mobilized during a rainfall event buffered the isotopic signature of smaller contributions of precipitation and or near surface soil water this functioning is akin to stream riparian areas with large stores of water controlling stream isotopic signatures by regulating smaller contributions of water from hillslopes tetzlaff et al 2014 the effect of groundwater table fluctuations on soil water and groundwater isotopic signatures is evident in both seasonal and site differences i e drier higher elevation kcl 1 vs wetter lower elevation kcl 2 4 2 mean transit times and sources of subsurface tile drainage mean transit time for soil water groundwater and subsurface tile drainage was 1 year and ranged from 12 to 20 d for 10 cm soil water to 225 334 d for groundwater short mean transit time i e 6 months to 1 year for subsurface tile discharge has been observed across studies buzek et al 2009 woo and kumar 2019 dimitrova petrova et al 2020 and is a reflection of the short flow pathways subsurface tile drains are engineered to facilitate travel time distributions are non stationary and vary with hydroclimatological conditions segura et al 2012 peralta tapia et al 2016 thus calculated water ages reflect conditions at the study site including a dry summer and early fall 2018 with minimal subsurface tile flow followed by a wet winter and spring 2019 with numerous flow events differences in soil hydraulic characteristics and the influence of agricultural practices on these characteristics dimitrova petrova et al 2020 and drainage intensity schilling et al 2012 additionally influence transit times it is also important to note that the sampling resolution used in the current study 8 3 d was relatively coarse and as a result could underrepresent important short term processes especially as mean transit times were 1 year while tracer data have been successfully used in natural catchments to improve understanding for water ages such applications are uncommon in agricultural landscapes klaus and mcdonnell 2013 further quantification of water ages in drained agricultural landscapes that include high frequency tracer measurements i e daily to sub daily are needed especially given the challenges associated with managing hydrological extremes and contaminant transport williams and king 2020 hanrahan et al 2021 identifying sources and flow pathways to subsurface tile drains is often estimated using two component hydrograph separation e g vidon and cuadra 2010 williams et al 2016a while it is widely recognized that the underlying assumptions namely that the isotopic signature of pre event water is constant in space and time and that the contributions from the vadose zone must be negligible or the isotopic signature of soil water must be similar to that of groundwater are often invalid see review by klaus and mcdonnell 2013 drained agricultural fields are typically viewed as an exception due to monoculture vegetation flat topography and altered hydrology results from the current study however show that even in drained agricultural fields the isotopic signature of soil water varies with time and space and can be different than the groundwater signature similarly klaus et al 2013 also showed that soil water can substantially contribute to subsurface tile discharge the choice of end member therefore greatly influences the calculated event pre event water fractions as evidenced by differences in water fractions when using either kcl 1 or kcl 2 groundwater as the pre event end member utilizing two component hydrograph separation with precipitation and groundwater as event and pre event end members respectively results from the current study and others granger et al 2010 vidon and cuadra 2010 williams et al 2016a zajicek et al 2016 have found that event water typically comprises between 20 and 30 of subsurface tile drain discharge but can range from 0 to 90 event water fractions in subsurface tile discharge are often equated with preferential flow and have been used to imply that precipitation bypasses the soil matrix similarities in isotopic signature and therefore hydrograph separation between precipitation and near surface soil water in the current study indicate that event water fractions determined with a two component approach could however be precipitation mobilized near surface soil water i e near surface pre event water or a mixture of both inclusion of soil water isotopic signature averaged over the entire profile 10 80 cm and ec as a second tracer in a three component hydrograph separation suggested that direct precipitation contributions to subsurface tile drainage were negligible as subsurface tile discharge was comprised of soil water and groundwater while the frequency of sample collection undoubtedly influenced the ability to detect such contributions of precipitation as noted previously dye tracer studies have shown considerable mixing and or matrix flow within the topsoil e g ali et al 2018 infiltrating precipitation that mixed with and mobilized pre event near surface soil water which subsequently bypassed lower soil layers as preferential flow serves as one potential hypothesis to explain observed findings e g matrix derived preferential flow differences in soil texture would therefore be expected to influence the mixing depth the degree of mixing between precipitation and soil water and ultimately the amount of precipitation directly delivered to the subsurface tile drain grant et al 2019 macrae et al 2019 pluer et al 2020 findings from the current and previous studies underscore the need to better understand the sources and flow paths to subsurface tile drains especially given how differences in hydrology can impact contaminant transport in these intensively managed agricultural landscapes 4 3 comparing subsurface tile drain celerity and velocity subsurface tile hydrograph response q p celerity exhibited a threshold behavior with precipitation amount and dynamic soil water storage during a precipitation event increased soil saturation led to the rise in the groundwater table which ultimately facilitated subsurface tile flow these findings compliment hydrograph separation and highlight that soil water and groundwater are important components of subsurface tile flow results from the current study also agree with previous work showing that antecedent conditions are an important factor controlling subsurface tile drain hydrograph response lam et al 2016 williams et al 2019 for example lam et al 2016 found that subsurface tile drain flow was not initiated until soil moisture exceeded a saturation threshold examining controls of subsurface tile discharge across multiple fields hanrahan et al 2021 also noted the importance of previous 7 d precipitation precipitation characteristics including amount and intensity in the current study and others were only weakly or not related to subsurface tile drain celerity in tile drained fields celerity therefore does not seem to be affected by storm characteristics but rather metrics of antecedent wetness conditions indicating that wetter conditions enhance the efficiency with which precipitation inputs trigger increases in subsurface tile flow clarifying the mechanisms by which precipitation inputs trigger increases in subsurface tile drain flow requires both hydrometric measurements and tracers that track water flow paths comparison of subsurface tile celerity q p to the quick flow component of tile velocity qe p reveals potential differences in the processes that led to tile flow generation when soils were dry qe p approximated q p indicating the dominance of preferential flow hrachowitz et al 2016 most of these events occurred during the summer or early fall when elevated pet rates enhance desiccation cracking on the soil surface especially in the fine textured soils at the study site the groundwater table was well below subsurface tile depth and greater precipitation intensity was observed combined these factors are more likely to generate preferential flow of precipitation or near surface soil water to the subsurface tile drain as soil antecedent wetness increased qe p also increased but to a much lesser extent than q p von freyberg et al 2018 showed that qe p was a function of storm characteristics rather than antecedent conditions and that transmitted event water increases more than proportionally with storm size and intensity under both wet and dry conditions that is the large amount of variability between qe p and q p as smd approached zero was likely due to differences in storm characteristics with for example more intense precipitation resulting in more similar values of qe p and q p compared to less intense precipitation during the wettest conditions however the mobilization of stored pre event water consistently dominated water delivery to subsurface tile drains as the volume of stored water within the field greatly exceeds that of precipitation inputs irrespective of storm characteristics the mobilization of pre event water can occur in rapid flow pathways during storm events as noted by klaus et al 2013 who observed both event and pre event water transport in preferential flow paths to subsurface tile drains accurate prediction of subsurface tile drain celerity can be made using relatively easy to measure hydrometric variables e g soil moisture groundwater depth as shown in the current study and others basu et al 2010 boland brien et al 2014 saadat et al 2018 while water volume exerts a

ford et al 2017 askar et al 2020 most velocity estimates included in models are derived from simple assumptions e g x of precipitation or overland flow is directly delivered to subsurface tile drains minimal interaction between slow and fast flow components that may only be applicable under a very specific set of antecedent conditions and storm characteristics data sets with both water and tracer flux measurements are greatly needed to not only improve estimates of transit times and flow pathways of water but also to understand how the interaction between hydrology soil chemistry and agricultural management practices translate into contaminant transport and loading 5 conclusion the current study provides a unique insight into the storage mixing and fluxes of water using stable water isotopes in a subsurface drained agricultural field intensively managed drained and disturbed landscapes comprise a large fraction of land area within the u s midwest and globally yet few studies have explored the hydrological processes that control the upper critical zone water balance and often contaminant transport results showed that the isotopic signature of water within drained agricultural fields can vary spatially and temporally and highlighted the important role of groundwater both on the mixing of water within the soil profile and as a source of water to subsurface tile drains findings also reveal the importance of soil water contributions to subsurface tile drains current conceptual models of water transport in tile drained fields are largely based on two component hydrograph separation whereby a sizable fraction typically 20 30 of total tile discharge is attributed to preferential flow of event water i e precipitation the current study observed minimal contributions of precipitation to subsurface tile drains with higher frequency sampling sub daily to daily combined with a three component approach needed to further understand sources and flow pathways in these landscapes the presented soil water and groundwater isotope data covering the seasonal dynamics within an agricultural field six sampling depths at two locations will allow for testing efficiencies of soil physical models in simulating water flow and transport in the critical zone the combined hydrometric and tracer data sets highlight differences in subsurface tile drain celerities and velocities results corroborate the importance of antecedent wetness condition on subsurface tile drain hydrograph response and that hydrometric data such as soil moisture and groundwater table depth can be used to predict flow generation velocities however were found to vary with environmental conditions e g antecedent wetness and storm characteristics and differ from celerities except under dry conditions likely leading to greater preferential flow which will require tracer data and more complex models to accurately predict the data presented herein therefore provide a basis to benchmark hydrological models for a more realistic representation of the celerities and velocities when simulating water fluxes and their ages within drained agricultural fields

4454,quantifying hydrological processes that control the upper critical zone water balance and contaminant transport in drained landscapes is needed especially as precipitation patterns driving water balance dynamics continue to shift due to climate change here hydrometric data are integrated with stable isotope signatures to quantify water storage mixing and fluxes to subsurface tile drainage at an agricultural field located in indiana usa over a 2 yr period precipitation soil water sampled with suction lysimeters 10 80 cm depth groundwater below tile depth 1 m and subsurface tile discharge were sampled 97 times results showed that isotopic variability in near surface soil water 10 20 cm reflected the seasonality of the precipitation input signal while groundwater values were relatively consistent indicating that water stored below tile drain depth was recharged during winter soil water between 20 and 80 cm depth was a mixture of near surface water and groundwater that varied seasonally depending upon groundwater hydrodynamics mean transit time of water ranged from 12 to 20 d for 10 cm soil water to 225 334 d for groundwater with tile drainage exhibiting a mean transit time of 245 d both two and three component hydrograph separation indicated that groundwater was the primary source of water to the tile drain followed by soil water tile drain hydrograph response i e celerity was largely controlled by antecedent wetness comparison of tile drain celerities and velocities revealed however varying mechanisms controlling hydrograph response across a range of environmental conditions data sets of both water and tracer flux were thus useful to track the spatiotemporal variability of water fluxes within and from the critical zone such data provide valuable information to improve the representation of critical zone processes in these landscapes within spatially distributed hydrological models keywords subsurface drainage hydrograph separation tracer soil water groundwater agriculture 1 introduction improved or artificial drainage has been implemented on approximately 13 of cropped agricultural land globally mainly in north america europe and the middle east to increase productivity of poorly drained or salinized soils nijland and croon 2005 in humid regions including the u s midwest the primary goal of agricultural drainage is to remove excess water and improve trafficability during crop planting and harvesting fausey 2003 this is often accomplished through the installation of pipe or tile drainage in the subsurface that lowers seasonally or perennially high water tables blann et al 2009 king et al 2015 installation of subsurface drainage substantially modifies catchment hydrology macrae et al 2007 eastman et al 2010 kennedy et al 2012 schilling et al 2012 boland brien et al 2014 king et al 2014 and when coupled with decades of nutrient additions to maximize crop yield can result in transport limited nutrient export basu et al 2010 guan et al 2011 williams et al 2018 physical understanding of hydrological processes that control the water balance of the upper critical zone is therefore critical for the sustainability of artificially drained agroecosystems kleinman et al 2018 especially as precipitation patterns driving water balance dynamics continue to shift due to climate change e g groisman et al 2012 williams and king 2020 predictions of water balance changes in the upper critical zone resulting from either agricultural intensification or hydroclimatic variability are usually based on hydrologic models rainfall runoff models strive for acceptable simulation of the hydrologic response to precipitation i e the hydrograph celerity or speed with which perturbations are transmitted through parameter identification and optimization but often do not adequately test the spatiotemporal processing of water i e flow velocities mcdonnell and beven 2014 celerity and velocity distributions are controlled by different mechanisms beven 2010 mcdonnell and beven 2014 scaini et al 2017 van verseveld et al 2017 celerity is controlled by the storage deficit that must be satisfied or remain as the saturated zone rises and falls while velocity is controlled by the characteristics of the filled water storage mcdonnell and beven 2014 celerity and velocity converge to similar values only in preferential flow domains hrachowitz et al 2016 thus focusing solely on hydrograph response is only half of the story in understanding how water moves through the upper critical zone tracers such as stable water isotopes δ2h and δ18o can be valuable for providing insight into the velocity of water and transport processes enabling estimation of water sources flow paths and residence times sprenger et al 2016 accounting for flow velocities in the upper critical zone is also invaluable for understanding contaminant transport e g williams et al 2016a macrae et al 2019 combining mass flux measurements of water with tracer flux measurements is needed as conceptualizing hydrologic processes in a physically realistic way is necessary to get the right results for the right reasons when testing models as hypotheses kirchner 2006 clark et al 2016 examination of hydrograph characteristics across natural and drained catchments suggests that subsurface tile drains may homogenize landscape response that is tile drains allow for the bypassing of the structural complexity of catchments boland brien et al 2014 development of more parsimonious hydrologic models may therefore be feasible for drained regions basu et al 2010 while the celerity of drained landscapes may be easier to simulate compared to naturally draining landscapes accurate prediction of contaminant transport especially strongly sorbing contaminants commonly applied to agricultural lands such as phosphorus and pesticides remains difficult because hydrologic processes e g preferential flow that account for differences in flow velocities among drained fields and conditions are not often included in hydrologic models radcliffe et al 2015 ford et al 2017 inclusion of flow velocity data would require more complex models with more parameters to be identified and data sets with both water and tracer flux measurements are sparse in drained agricultural landscapes klaus and mcdonnell 2013 when data sets are available they typically encompass a few storm events during the spring season granger et al 2010 vidon and cuadra 2010 williams et al 2016a zajicek et al 2016 further tracer based hydrograph separations in drained landscapes often work on the assumption that the isotopic signatures of soil water are similar to that of groundwater and tile drain baseflow describes the composition of the pre event water end member it is likely however that soil water differs isotopically from groundwater and varies with depth in the profile klaus et al 2013 sprenger et al 2016 potentially leading to large uncertainties in hydrograph separation results klaus and mcdonnell 2013 quantifying the interplay of shallow and deep soil water and how the spatiotemporal variability in soil water influences the resulting groundwater signature is imperative to understanding the mixing of water sources and the blend of tile drain stormflow components here we examine the spatial and temporal variability in stable water isotopic signatures within an intensively drained agricultural field in northeastern indiana usa to better understand water storage mixing and fluxes weekly sampling of precipitation soil water 10 80 cm groundwater and tile drain discharge were completed within the study field along with hydrometric measurements rainfall amount and intensity soil moisture groundwater depth tile discharge over a two year study period study objectives were to i quantify spatial and temporal variability in isotopic signatures of precipitation soil water groundwater and tile drain discharge and estimate mean transit times ii employ two and three component hydrograph separation techniques to evaluate water sources and flow pathways to tile drains and iii examine differences in the celerity and velocity of tile drain discharge 2 methods 2 1 site description an agricultural field 22 7 ha located in the st joseph river watershed in northeastern indiana usa 41 32 01 n 84 48 38 w was monitored as part of the current study fig 1 the field was cropped in a three year rotation of corn zea mays l soybean glycine max l merr and wheat avena sativa l with a cover crop mixture planted during the non growing season conservation tillage i e soil mixing depth 10 cm occurred prior to corn planting during the study period the surface topography of the field was flat slopes ranging from 0 to 2 fig 1 and soils were classified as either blount silt loam fine illitic mesic aeric epiaqualfs somewhat poorly drained or pewamo silty clay fine mixed active mesic typic argiaquolls very poorly drained which were found at higher and lower elevations within the field respectively organic matter content in surface soils 0 5 cm was between 5 6 and 7 9 and decreased with depth while clay content 0 5 cm 24 to 32 60 90 cm 37 to 39 and bulk density 0 5 cm 1 45 g cm 3 60 90 cm 1 75 g cm 3 increased with depth plach et al 2018 soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ranged from 9 2 μm s 1 in surficial soils 0 10 cm to 1 4 μm s 1 in subsurface soils 10 cm long term average annual temperature at the study field is 10 c with february 8 c and july 29 c as the coldest and warmest months respectively annual rainfall across the study region varies from 833 to 1 135 mm williams and king 2020 in 2015 subsurface tile drainage was installed in the field depth 0 8 m spacing 9 1 m to improve trafficability fig 1 subsurface tile laterals 10 cm dia are connected to a tile main 20 cm dia which was monitored at the edge of field where it discharged into a drainage ditch field hydrology is largely controlled by the subsurface drainage system like many drained agricultural fields e g pease et al 2018 williams et al 2018 during the study period june 2017 through august 2019 only 5 overland flow events occurred compared to 57 subsurface tile flow events with subsurface tile drain discharge accounting for 90 of the total water flux from the field 2 2 precipitation soil moisture soil water and groundwater monitoring two sampling sites kcl 1 and kcl 2 were established within the study field for monitoring of precipitation soil moisture soil water and groundwater fig 1 both sites were located approximately 35 m from the field edge to minimize the impact of research activities on farming operations site selection was also determined based on field topography and dominant soil type where kcl 1 and kcl 2 were located at higher blount soil series and lower pewamo soil series elevations respectively each site was equipped with a rain gauge to facilitate the collection of precipitation rainfall and snow for analysis whereby precipitation collected in the gauge was funneled into a sample bottle four moisture sensors ech2o ec 5 meter group inc pullman wa were installed at each site depths of 20 40 60 and 80 cm to measure soil volumetric water content vwc a groundwater well 2 m deep screened depth 1 0 to 2 0 m was also installed at each site and a depth sensor hydros 21 meter group inc pullman wa was used to record water level within the well both soil vwc and water depth in the wells were recorded hourly throughout the duration of the study equipment error resulted in two gaps 17 d and 79 d in soil vwc and groundwater depth data fig 2 during these periods three rainfall runoff events occurred and were not included in subsequent analyses evaluating the effect of antecedent conditions on subsurface tile flow generation ceramic soil solution samplers were installed at depths of 10 20 40 60 and 80 cm at both kcl 1 and kcl 2 a continuous vacuum of 12 kpa was maintained in each sampler by means of a hanging water column as described by riekerk and morris 1983 thus samples collected in the ceramic samplers represented the mobile fraction of soil water water samples from the rain gauges groundwater wells and soil solution samplers were collected every 4 to 21 d mean 8 3 d from june 2017 through august 2019 for a total of 97 sampling intervals of the 97 sampling intervals 92 occurred 10 d apart with longer sampling intervals occurring during periods with no precipitation or during the winter when evaporation potential was low all water samples were analyzed for electrical conductivity ec and stable water isotopes δ18o and δ2h stable water isotope ratios were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer lwia 45 ep los gatos research san jose ca against reference values calibrated to vienna standard mean ocean water instrument precision for δ18o and δ2h was 0 11 and 0 5 respectively 2 3 weather and subsurface tile discharge a weather station lufft ws600 lufft usa inc carpinteria ca was located near the field edge to measure rainfall amount and intensity air temperature wind speed humidity and solar radiation at a 10 min interval fig 1 subsurface tile discharge q was also measured at the field edge as described by williams et al 2016b briefly the subsurface tile drain outlet was equipped with a compound weir insert thel mar brevard nc where the original outlet draining the field was cut and fitted with a 30 cm diameter pipe that facilitated the installation of the weir insert water level was recorded at a 10 min interval using an isco signature flow meter teledyne isco lincoln ne and an area velocity sensor isco 2150 teledyne isco lincoln ne was also used in the development of stage discharge relationships when the subsurface tile became submerged water samples were collected daily from the subsurface tile drain using an automated water sampler isco 6712 teledyne isco lincoln ne daily water samples were composited to match the sampling interval for rainfall soil water and groundwater subsurface tile drain water samples were also analyzed for ec and stable water isotopes 2 4 data analysis to evaluate spatial and temporal dynamics in soil water and groundwater δ2h line conditioned excess lc excess soil vwc and water table depth were compared by site depth and season precipitation isotopic signatures n 85 were used to determine the local meteoric water line lmwl for the study site using precipitation weighted least squares regression as outlined in crawford et al 2014 for each water sample lc excess was calculated as a function of the slope a 7 33 0 15 and the intercept b 7 02 1 22 of the lmwl as suggested by landwehr and coplen 2006 1 l c e x c e s s δ 2 h a δ 18 o b the lc excess describes the deviation of the sample s δ2h value from the lmwl in the dual isotope space and indicates non equilibrium fractionation processes due to evaporation after rainfall sprenger et al 2017 found lc excess was advantageous over deuterium excess or single isotope approaches for inferring evaporation fractionation because the lc excess of rainfall is approximately 0 and has minimal seasonal fluctuation statistical analyses for the soil water isotopes and soil vwc for individual sites depths and seasons were done with non parametric tests since the null hypothesis that the data were drawn from a normal distribution was rejected using the shapiro wilk test for normality differences between sites i e kcl 1 vs kcl 2 were assessed using the mann whitney wilcoxon test differences among depths and seasons were evaluated with the kruskal wallis test when significant differences were present a post hoc dunn test with bonferroni adjustment was used to determine which sampling depths or seasons were significantly different seasons were defined as winter january february march spring april may june summer july august september and fall october november december analyses were completed in r statistical software r core team 2014 mean transit time t or the mean age of water leaving the system for soil water groundwater and subsurface tile drain water were estimated using a simple steady state well mixed model as described in dewalle et al 1997 periodic regression analysis was used to fit a seasonal sine wave model to δ18o fluctuations of inputs i e rainfall and outputs i e soil water groundwater and subsurface tile drain water as 2 δ 18 o x a cos c t θ where δ18o is the predicted oxygen 18 value x is the annual mean δ18o a is the δ18o annual amplitude c is the radial frequency of annual fluctuations rad d 1 t is time in days after june 1 2018 and θ is the phase lag or time of annual peak δ18o rad assuming an exponential distribution of transit times mean transit time in days was computed as 3 t c 1 a z 2 a z 1 2 1 0 5 where az 2 and az 1 are the amplitude at depth z2 and z1 respectively here precipitation represents the surface or z1 0 values only data from the second half of the study period after june 1 2018 were used to estimate t due to the potential lag between rainfall inputs and soil water shallow groundwater and subsurface tile drain water response for rainfall events 6 mm that occurred with a 6 h period separated by 6 h from additional rainfall king et al 2016 subsurface tile drain hydrograph characteristics including time to flow initiation time to peak average flow peak flow cumulative flow and runoff coefficient were computed to determine dominant controls on water flux previous research in tile drained landscapes have observed that a combination of antecedent conditions and precipitation control subsurface tile drain flow vidon and cuadra 2010 lam et al 2016 williams et al 2019 thus rainfall characteristics amount and intensity and antecedent conditions soil moisture deficit and water table depth were compared to subsurface tile drain runoff coefficients soil moisture deficit smd was calculated as 4 sm d t v w c max v w c t 100 s t where vwcmax was the maximum observed soil moisture content and assumed to represent saturated conditions vwct was the measured soil moisture at time t and st is soil thickness mm geris et al 2015 smd was calculated for each soil layer and summed together to estimate dynamic storage for the entire soil profile immediately prior to the rainfall event linear and segmented regression were used to assess relationships between subsurface tile drain runoff coefficient and either rainfall or antecedent condition variables to infer sources of subsurface tile drain water both two and three component hydrograph separation were utilized genereux 1998 hydrograph separation was completed for each sampling interval using ec and stable water isotope tracers when both subsurface tile drain values and end member rainfall soil water depths groundwater values were available several combinations of tracer and end members were used based upon spatial and temporal dynamics in end member tracer values mixing fractions of subsurface tile q for each sampling interval i e event water qe q pre event water qpe q determined with two component hydrograph separation δ18o as a tracer rainfall and groundwater as end members were also multiplied by runoff coefficient to determine qe p and qpe p as described by von freyberg et al 2018 5 q e p q p q e q 6 q pe p 1 q e p while qe q quantifies the fraction of total storm discharge that comes from rainfall qe p quantifies the fraction of total rainfall that will be discharged during the same event similarly qpe q quantifies the fraction of total discharge that comes from storage while qpe p quantifies how much pre event water is mobilized by not contained in a unit volume of precipitation both qe p and qpe p were compared to rainfall characteristics and antecedent conditions to examine how sources of subsurface tile drain water varied with hydroclimatic dynamics for sampling intervals with more than one rainfall event 6 mm average runoff coefficient was used 3 results 3 1 hydroclimatic dynamics precipitation at the field site over the study ranged from 1059 mm yr 1 2018 to 1118 mm yr 1 2019 with average monthly precipitation of 87 3 45 3 mm mean standard deviation fig 2 spring tended to have the most precipitation 125 6 40 7 mm month 1 while summer had the least precipitation 58 4 23 5 mm month 1 most rainfall events 6 mm occurred during the spring but average rainfall intensity was greatest in the summer table 1 during the study 15 snowfall events occurred during winter with snow accumulation averaging 53 23 mm per event snow accumulation remained on the soil surface for 4 4 4 3 d prior to melting five day storm trajectories computed with the hysplit trajectory model stein et al 2015 showed that summer rainfall was predominantly sourced from warm moist maritime tropical air masses traveling north from the gulf of mexico into the study region fig 3 these summer events were generally convective storms producing rainfall with greater intensity and shorter duration in contrast during fall and winter stratiform rainfall was derived from either maritime polar or continental polar air masses which produced lower intensity longer duration events fig 3 seasonal differences in rainfall source resulted in variability in the average seasonal isotopic signature of precipitation measured at the field site table 1 annual potential evapotranspiration pet estimated using the penman monteith equation and site meteorological data ranged from 922 mm 2018 to 960 mm 2017 pet showed a strong seasonal variation with average pet rates of 0 6 to 1 9 mm d 1 from november through march i e non growing season and 2 8 to 5 2 mm d 1 from april through october i e growing season fig 2 maximum pet rates however were between 4 6 and 9 3 mm d 1 between april and october monthly sums of subsurface tile discharge q were positively correlated with monthly precipitation ρ 0 55 p 0 005 but were not correlated with monthly pet ρ 0 12 p 0 554 discharge was recorded from the subsurface tile drain during 83 of the study period 634 of 761 d greater q was generally observed during the non growing season 51 6 30 3 mm month 1 compared to the growing season 26 8 24 4 mm month 1 fig 2 on 81 and 50 of the days q was 1 0 mm d 1 and 0 1 mm d 1 respectively however during rainfall events the field site responded quickly and flow rates increased within a few hours time to flow initiation 6 3 4 4 h time to peak 11 3 6 9 h average flow rate during storm events was 0 23 0 14 mm h 1 and peak flow rate was 0 49 0 29 mm h 1 fig 2 3 2 spatiotemporal patterns in isotopic signatures soil moisture and water table depth 3 2 1 site differences kcl 1 vs kcl 2 located on the flatter lower landscape position kcl 2 had greater median soil vwc compared to kcl 1 especially at depths 0 4 m fig 4 soil vwc was also less variable at kcl 2 interquartile range 0 02 to 0 05 m3 m 3 relative to kcl 1 interquartile range 0 07 to 0 14 m3 m 3 at these depths throughout the study groundwater remained closer to the soil surface at kcl 2 than kcl 1 fig 4 with maximum groundwater level at kcl 1 and kcl 2 reaching 0 33 m and 0 24 m respectively fig 2 on 30 and 56 of the days groundwater level was within 1 0 m of the soil surface at kcl 1 and kcl 2 respectively precipitation isotopic signature often varied between field sites despite only being located 125 m apart mean absolute difference in precipitation δ18o and δ2h between sites was 0 44 0 64 and 2 5 4 2 respectively differences in δ18o and δ2h between sites however were not consistent among sampling intervals mean difference between kcl 1 and kcl 2 0 13 0 77 and 0 1 4 9 respectively fig 4 mobile soil water exhibited greater variability in δ2h and δ18o not shown in near surface soil layers compared to deeper in the soil profile at both sites median soil water δ2h values were greater at depths of 0 4 m and 0 8 m as well as in groundwater for kcl 1 compared to kcl 2 fig 4 while lc excess was similar throughout the soil profile between sites except at a depth of 0 2 m 3 2 2 seasonal differences consistent with seasonal precipitation amounts and pet rates soil vwc was lower during the summer across all depths 0 2 m to 0 8 m compared to other seasons fig 5 groundwater level was also deeper during the summer compared to other seasons fig 5 during winter spring and fall seasons median groundwater level was closer to the soil surface median depth 1 08 m 0 96 m and 1 24 m respectively compared to the summer median depth 1 87 m seasonal precipitation isotopic signatures δ18o δ2h and lc excess table 1 were reflected in soil water isotopic values fig 5 soil water δ2h signatures tended to be lower in winter than summer while soil water lc excess tended to be greater in winter than summer spring and fall soil water isotope signatures fell within winter and summer values resulting from a mixture of precipitation sources fig 3 precipitation isotope signatures were dampened with depth in the soil profile the largest differences in seasonal soil water δ2h and lc excess occurred at shallow soil depths 0 1 m and 0 2 m although differences were also noted at deeper depths 0 8 m and in groundwater fig 5 median lc excess for all seasons and depths 0 2 m including groundwater were 0 0 soil water and groundwater isotopic signatures plotted along the lmwl fig 6 except for a few instances in shallow soil depths during summer median groundwater lc excess did not vary seasonally and was between 2 1 and 3 6 which was consistent with winter precipitation table 1 fig 5 3 2 3 differences with depth in the soil profile stable water isotope signatures varied with depth in the soil profile throughout most of the study period fig 7 in general near surface soil water δ2h values 10 cm and 20 cm tended to differ from deep soil water 80 cm and groundwater δ2h values groundwater δ2h remained relatively consistent across sampling intervals median 52 8 thus variation in isotope signature with depth was largely controlled by precipitation inputs fig 7 variation of isotopic signature was therefore not consistent during similar seasons among years fig 7 for example there were minimal differences observed in δ2h values with depth in the soil profile during winter 2018 due to precipitation δ2h inputs similar to groundwater δ2h values difference 1 1 in contrast during fall 2018 precipitation δ2h values were 29 4 less than groundwater δ2h values resulting in large variation in isotopic signature with depth during fall 2018 and winter 2019 middle depths i e 40 cm and 60 cm reflected a mixture of both groundwater and precipitation near surface soil water δ2h values as isotopic signatures at these depths were often similar to both shallow and deep water sources fig 7 during periods when the groundwater table was closer to the surface and frequently interacted with 40 cm and 60 cm depths the isotopic signatures exhibited δ2h values similar to groundwater e g spring 2019 whereas when the groundwater table remained deeper in the profile isotopic signatures were more similar to near surface values e g summer 2017 median lc excess values were relatively consistent throughout the soil profile except during summer sampling when 10 cm lc excess differed from groundwater lc excess fig 7 while soil vwc was not measured at a depth of 10 cm soil vwc tended to be less at 20 cm compared to other depths in the soil profile fig 7 greater pet rates during summer may therefore have resulted in lower lc excess at 10 cm compared to other depths 3 3 estimating mean transit time sine wave regression models fit to the data at kcl 1 and kcl 2 indicated a damping and lagging of the δ18o signal from precipitation to soil water to groundwater table 2 precipitation δ18o signature was variable among sampling intervals but seasonal patterns were able to be described by a sine wave cycle r2 0 39 in soil water and groundwater the δ18o seasonal cycle was damped and smoothed thus they were generally better described by a sine wave kcl 1 r2 0 36 to 0 84 kcl 2 r2 0 52 to 0 83 soil water δ18o amplitude at 40 cm depth was reduced by 50 to 54 relative to precipitation and the peak δ18o occurred 45 d to 58 d after the precipitation peak at kcl 2 and kcl 1 respectively table 2 similarly groundwater δ18o amplitude was decreased by 83 and 75 relative to precipitation at kcl 2 and kcl 1 respectively with peak δ18o occurring 58 d and 52 d after the precipitation peak table 2 mean transit time was computed for soil water groundwater and subsurface tile q using a well mixed model equation 3 table 2 the mean transit time for soil water ranged from 12 d to 20 d 0 03 yr to 0 05 yr at a depth of 10 cm and from 139 d to 168 d 0 38 yr to 0 46 yr at a depth of 80 cm groundwater mean transit time was 225 d and 334 d 0 62 yr and 0 92 yr at kcl 1 and kcl 2 respectively mean transit time of subsurface tile q measured at the field edge was 245 d 0 67 yr table 2 3 4 two and three component hydrograph separation using δ18o as a tracer and several combinations of event water and pre event water end members the event water fraction of subsurface tile q qe q was computed for each sampling interval fig 8 and summarized seasonally table 3 selection of groundwater from kcl 1 as the pre event end member consistently produced unrealistic component mixtures i e qpe q 100 data not shown thus groundwater from kcl 2 was used in all subsequent two component hydrograph separations comparing precipitation from kcl 1 and kcl 2 as the event water end member showed that during individual sampling intervals subsurface tile q was comprised of 1 to 93 mean 25 26 event water when precipitation from kcl 1 was used fig 8 and 1 to 90 mean 23 26 event water when precipitation from kcl 2 was used seasonally the largest difference in qe q when using precipitation from either kcl 1 or kcl 2 occurred during the winter table 3 regardless of whether precipitation from kcl 1 or kcl 2 were used qe q tended to be greater in the winter and summer compared to the spring and fall table 3 event water fraction of subsurface tile q was also computed using soil water δ18o from either 10 cm or 10 cm and 20 cm average of both sites and or depths as the event water end member soil water δ18o from a depth of 10 cm resulted in similar estimates of annual qe q mean 24 19 but exhibited increased spring qe q and decreased summer qe q relative to precipitation table 3 using soil water δ18o from depths of 10 cm and 20 cm resulted in additional increases in spring qe q compared to both precipitation and only soil water from 10 cm which resulted in greater annual estimates of subsurface tile qe q mean 30 24 table 3 the addition of a second tracer ec for three component hydrograph separation was not ideal as seasonal precipitation soil water and groundwater data plotted on a linear line within the δ18o ec mixing space fig 9 plotting data within the δ18o ec mixing space did however reveal that subsurface tile q values generally fell within soil water and groundwater sources during all seasons with subsurface tile q similar to groundwater from kcl 2 during all seasons except summer when it was more similar to soil water fig 9 using precipitation average soil water all depths kcl 2 and groundwater kcl 2 in the three component hydrograph separation soil water comprised 25 16 26 and 98 of subsurface tile q during the fall winter spring and summer respectively while groundwater comprised the remainder if average soil water from kcl 1 was used in the three component hydrograph separation then soil water comprised 30 17 31 and 89 of subsurface tile q during the fall winter spring and summer respectively with groundwater comprising of the remainder except during summer when precipitation accounted for the remining water 3 5 celerities and velocities of subsurface tile discharge discharge to precipitation ratio q p for subsurface tile drainage was used to describe hydrologic response or celerity subsurface tile q p during storm events 6 mm exhibited a weak linear relationship with rainfall amount p 0 05 r2 0 18 data not shown where q was observed across the entire range of event rainfall amount other rainfall characteristics including average intensity and maximum intensity were also compared to subsurface tile q p but were not related p 0 05 r2 0 02 soil moisture deficit smd determined for the entire soil profile at both kcl 1 and kcl 2 immediately preceding a rainfall event was non linearly related to subsurface tile q p data not shown the number of rainfall events that produced q increased as smd increased i e wetness increased often with no flow occurring if smd 60 mm or 40 mm at kcl 1 and kcl 2 respectively although the relationship between q p and smd was non linear visual identification of a clear threshold above which subsurface q was generated was not possible given that rainfall events with and without flow generally occurred over a range of smd values between 40 mm and 0 mm when smd and rainfall amount were summed smd rainfall and compared with subsurface tile q p however a clear threshold pattern was evident fig 10 threshold values determined with segmented regression were 20 mm and 16 mm for kcl 1 and kcl 2 respectively below the threshold value the relationship between smd rainfall and q p was poorly related but above the threshold value a positive linear relationship was observed fig 10 maximum groundwater depth measured during a rainfall event was also compared to subsurface tile q p fig 10 similar to the relationship between smd rainfall and q p a threshold relationship was observed between maximum groundwater depth and q p when groundwater depth remained below subsurface tile depth subsurface tile q was unlikely to occur however if groundwater depth exceeded tile depth then subsurface tile q was generated comparison of subsurface tile hydrograph characteristics to groundwater response to rainfall revealed that subsurface tile q was on average initiated with the onset of groundwater rise and that maximum groundwater depth during a rainfall event lagged behind peak subsurface tile q by 2 5 h to 4 1 h fig 10 to compare subsurface tile celerity and velocity the event water fraction of subsurface tile discharge qe q calculated with two component hydrograph separation using rainfall and groundwater as end members was multiplied by q p to determine qe p i e von freyberg et al 2018 comparing the relationship of q p and qe p to smd rainfall revealed differences in celerity and velocity with the magnitude of difference varying depending on the degree to which precipitation exceeded smd when smd rainfall 0 mm values of q p and qe p tended to be similar fig 10 as smd rainfall approached 0 mm there was considerable variability in the relationship between q p and qe p with differences in q p and qe p becoming greater as smd rainfall increased 4 discussion 4 1 mixing of precipitation input and the upper critical zone water storage collection of water samples during 97 sampling intervals over 2 years revealed the isotopic response of soil water and groundwater to variable precipitation inputs strong seasonal gradients observed in precipitation isotopic signature resulting from differences in dominant air mass were reflected in surficial soil water 10 20 cm while temporal variation in isotopic values of these near surface soils were substantial minimal spatial differences i e between sites were detected uniform agricultural management in combination with the relatively flat topography and similar soil types likely precluded spatial differences in soil water isotopic signature in near surface soils of the study field in drained geomorphological landforms such as closed depressions which are common throughout glaciated areas of north america or among drained fields soil properties e g organic matter and as a result near surface soil water isotopic signatures could exhibit a greater degree of spatial variability for instance sprenger et al 2017 found spatial differences in topsoil organic matter content impacted the mixing of precipitation and soil water except for a few occasions near surface soil water as well as deeper soil water and groundwater plotted along the lmwl indicating negligible evaporation fractionation study results therefore confirm previous work showing that soil water sampled with suction lysimeters was relatively young mobile water that percolated without experiencing pronounced water loss due to soil evaporation geris et al 2015 sprenger et al 2018 while sampling bulk soil water with direct equilibrium methods include more tightly bound water that integrates older water sprenger et al 2018 precipitation and mobile fractions of soil water are often associated with contaminant transport to subsurface tile drains klaus et al 2014 williams et al 2016a groundwater 1 m deep below subsurface tile depth in contrast to near surface soil water remained relatively consistent across sampling intervals and seasons groundwater lc excess indicated that water stored below subsurface tile drain depth was largely recharged during winter months cool air temperatures fallow fields and typically wet conditions during winter months facilitate this groundwater recharge thus during most of the year water above subsurface tile drain depth either precipitation or near surface soil water does not infiltrate below the subsurface tile drains in large quantities previous work examining nitrogen loss to groundwater among diverse agricultural landscapes has also found that fields with subsurface tile drains are less susceptible to nitrogen loss to groundwater i e below tile depth puckett et al 2011 woo and kumar 2019 providing further evidence of minimal water movement from above subsurface tile drains to deeper depths during most of the year examination of isotopic signatures across the entire soil profile highlighted both the mixing of precipitation inputs with water stored in the critical zone and the importance of groundwater table dynamics on regulating soil water isotopic values in tile drained landscapes while near surface soil water signatures resembled recent precipitation and groundwater signatures were determined by winter recharge soil water in between i e 20 cm 80 cm was a mixture of both sources with the dominant component and isotopic signature varying based on groundwater table dynamics drier warmer summer months were characterized by soil water isotopic signatures at these depths that were more similar to precipitation inputs and near surface soil water signatures as the groundwater table remainder deeper in the profile in contrast during wetter cooler spring months soil water isotopic signatures in the middle profile were more similar to groundwater as the water table frequently rose into this zone this finding is somewhat counterintuitive as more precipitation would seem to imply that mobile water above the subsurface tile drain depth would also reflect precipitation inputs laboratory and field scale experiments however have shown that only small fractions of applied rainfall infiltrate beyond near surface soils for instance using 30 cm deep undisturbed soil monoliths williams et al 2020 found on average that only one third of total discharge from the bottom of the monolith during a 33 mm rainfall simulation was irrigation water i e qe q similarly soil water isotope data in conjunction with a compartmental mixing cell model showed that 0 to 37 mean 19 of soil water at 40 cm to 50 cm depths was from a 41 mm irrigation event klaus et al 2013 groundwater at the current study site therefore functioned as an isostat whereby larger volumes of water stored deeper in the soil profile that were mobilized during a rainfall event buffered the isotopic signature of smaller contributions of precipitation and or near surface soil water this functioning is akin to stream riparian areas with large stores of water controlling stream isotopic signatures by regulating smaller contributions of water from hillslopes tetzlaff et al 2014 the effect of groundwater table fluctuations on soil water and groundwater isotopic signatures is evident in both seasonal and site differences i e drier higher elevation kcl 1 vs wetter lower elevation kcl 2 4 2 mean transit times and sources of subsurface tile drainage mean transit time for soil water groundwater and subsurface tile drainage was 1 year and ranged from 12 to 20 d for 10 cm soil water to 225 334 d for groundwater short mean transit time i e 6 months to 1 year for subsurface tile discharge has been observed across studies buzek et al 2009 woo and kumar 2019 dimitrova petrova et al 2020 and is a reflection of the short flow pathways subsurface tile drains are engineered to facilitate travel time distributions are non stationary and vary with hydroclimatological conditions segura et al 2012 peralta tapia et al 2016 thus calculated water ages reflect conditions at the study site including a dry summer and early fall 2018 with minimal subsurface tile flow followed by a wet winter and spring 2019 with numerous flow events differences in soil hydraulic characteristics and the influence of agricultural practices on these characteristics dimitrova petrova et al 2020 and drainage intensity schilling et al 2012 additionally influence transit times it is also important to note that the sampling resolution used in the current study 8 3 d was relatively coarse and as a result could underrepresent important short term processes especially as mean transit times were 1 year while tracer data have been successfully used in natural catchments to improve understanding for water ages such applications are uncommon in agricultural landscapes klaus and mcdonnell 2013 further quantification of water ages in drained agricultural landscapes that include high frequency tracer measurements i e daily to sub daily are needed especially given the challenges associated with managing hydrological extremes and contaminant transport williams and king 2020 hanrahan et al 2021 identifying sources and flow pathways to subsurface tile drains is often estimated using two component hydrograph separation e g vidon and cuadra 2010 williams et al 2016a while it is widely recognized that the underlying assumptions namely that the isotopic signature of pre event water is constant in space and time and that the contributions from the vadose zone must be negligible or the isotopic signature of soil water must be similar to that of groundwater are often invalid see review by klaus and mcdonnell 2013 drained agricultural fields are typically viewed as an exception due to monoculture vegetation flat topography and altered hydrology results from the current study however show that even in drained agricultural fields the isotopic signature of soil water varies with time and space and can be different than the groundwater signature similarly klaus et al 2013 also showed that soil water can substantially contribute to subsurface tile discharge the choice of end member therefore greatly influences the calculated event pre event water fractions as evidenced by differences in water fractions when using either kcl 1 or kcl 2 groundwater as the pre event end member utilizing two component hydrograph separation with precipitation and groundwater as event and pre event end members respectively results from the current study and others granger et al 2010 vidon and cuadra 2010 williams et al 2016a zajicek et al 2016 have found that event water typically comprises between 20 and 30 of subsurface tile drain discharge but can range from 0 to 90 event water fractions in subsurface tile discharge are often equated with preferential flow and have been used to imply that precipitation bypasses the soil matrix similarities in isotopic signature and therefore hydrograph separation between precipitation and near surface soil water in the current study indicate that event water fractions determined with a two component approach could however be precipitation mobilized near surface soil water i e near surface pre event water or a mixture of both inclusion of soil water isotopic signature averaged over the entire profile 10 80 cm and ec as a second tracer in a three component hydrograph separation suggested that direct precipitation contributions to subsurface tile drainage were negligible as subsurface tile discharge was comprised of soil water and groundwater while the frequency of sample collection undoubtedly influenced the ability to detect such contributions of precipitation as noted previously dye tracer studies have shown considerable mixing and or matrix flow within the topsoil e g ali et al 2018 infiltrating precipitation that mixed with and mobilized pre event near surface soil water which subsequently bypassed lower soil layers as preferential flow serves as one potential hypothesis to explain observed findings e g matrix derived preferential flow differences in soil texture would therefore be expected to influence the mixing depth the degree of mixing between precipitation and soil water and ultimately the amount of precipitation directly delivered to the subsurface tile drain grant et al 2019 macrae et al 2019 pluer et al 2020 findings from the current and previous studies underscore the need to better understand the sources and flow paths to subsurface tile drains especially given how differences in hydrology can impact contaminant transport in these intensively managed agricultural landscapes 4 3 comparing subsurface tile drain celerity and velocity subsurface tile hydrograph response q p celerity exhibited a threshold behavior with precipitation amount and dynamic soil water storage during a precipitation event increased soil saturation led to the rise in the groundwater table which ultimately facilitated subsurface tile flow these findings compliment hydrograph separation and highlight that soil water and groundwater are important components of subsurface tile flow results from the current study also agree with previous work showing that antecedent conditions are an important factor controlling subsurface tile drain hydrograph response lam et al 2016 williams et al 2019 for example lam et al 2016 found that subsurface tile drain flow was not initiated until soil moisture exceeded a saturation threshold examining controls of subsurface tile discharge across multiple fields hanrahan et al 2021 also noted the importance of previous 7 d precipitation precipitation characteristics including amount and intensity in the current study and others were only weakly or not related to subsurface tile drain celerity in tile drained fields celerity therefore does not seem to be affected by storm characteristics but rather metrics of antecedent wetness conditions indicating that wetter conditions enhance the efficiency with which precipitation inputs trigger increases in subsurface tile flow clarifying the mechanisms by which precipitation inputs trigger increases in subsurface tile drain flow requires both hydrometric measurements and tracers that track water flow paths comparison of subsurface tile celerity q p to the quick flow component of tile velocity qe p reveals potential differences in the processes that led to tile flow generation when soils were dry qe p approximated q p indicating the dominance of preferential flow hrachowitz et al 2016 most of these events occurred during the summer or early fall when elevated pet rates enhance desiccation cracking on the soil surface especially in the fine textured soils at the study site the groundwater table was well below subsurface tile depth and greater precipitation intensity was observed combined these factors are more likely to generate preferential flow of precipitation or near surface soil water to the subsurface tile drain as soil antecedent wetness increased qe p also increased but to a much lesser extent than q p von freyberg et al 2018 showed that qe p was a function of storm characteristics rather than antecedent conditions and that transmitted event water increases more than proportionally with storm size and intensity under both wet and dry conditions that is the large amount of variability between qe p and q p as smd approached zero was likely due to differences in storm characteristics with for example more intense precipitation resulting in more similar values of qe p and q p compared to less intense precipitation during the wettest conditions however the mobilization of stored pre event water consistently dominated water delivery to subsurface tile drains as the volume of stored water within the field greatly exceeds that of precipitation inputs irrespective of storm characteristics the mobilization of pre event water can occur in rapid flow pathways during storm events as noted by klaus et al 2013 who observed both event and pre event water transport in preferential flow paths to subsurface tile drains accurate prediction of subsurface tile drain celerity can be made using relatively easy to measure hydrometric variables e g soil moisture groundwater depth as shown in the current study and others basu et al 2010 boland brien et al 2014 saadat et al 2018 while water volume exerts a large influence on contaminant loads from drained agricultural landscapes e g williams et al 2016a 2018 including estimates of water velocity in numerical models generally improves load predictions ford et al 2017 askar et al 2020 most velocity estimates included in models are derived from simple assumptions e g x of precipitation or overland flow is directly delivered to subsurface tile drains minimal interaction between slow and fast flow components that may only be applicable under a very specific set of antecedent conditions and storm characteristics data sets with both water and tracer flux measurements are greatly needed to not only improve estimates of transit times and flow pathways of water but also to understand how the interaction between hydrology soil chemistry and agricultural management practices translate into contaminant transport and loading 5 conclusion the current study provides a unique insight into the storage mixing and fluxes of water using stable water isotopes in a subsurface drained agricultural field intensively managed drained and disturbed landscapes comprise a large fraction of land area within the u s midwest and globally yet few studies have explored the hydrological processes that control the upper critical zone water balance and often contaminant transport results showed that the isotopic signature of water within drained agricultural fields can vary spatially and temporally and highlighted the important role of groundwater both on the mixing of water within the soil profile and as a source of water to subsurface tile drains findings also reveal the importance of soil water contributions to subsurface tile drains current conceptual models of water transport in tile drained fields are largely based on two component hydrograph separation whereby a sizable fraction typically 20 30 of total tile discharge is attributed to preferential flow of event water i e precipitation the current study observed minimal contributions of precipitation to subsurface tile drains with higher frequency sampling sub daily to daily combined with a three component approach needed to further understand sources and flow pathways in these landscapes the presented soil water and groundwater isotope data covering the seasonal dynamics within an agricultural field six sampling depths at two locations will allow for testing efficiencies of soil physical models in simulating water flow and transport in the critical zone the combined hydrometric and tracer data sets highlight differences in subsurface tile drain celerities and velocities results corroborate the importance of antecedent wetness condition on subsurface tile drain hydrograph response and that hydrometric data such as soil moisture and groundwater table depth can be used to predict flow generation velocities however were found to vary with environmental conditions e g antecedent wetness and storm characteristics and differ from celerities except under dry conditions likely leading to greater preferential flow which will require tracer data and more complex models to accurately predict the data presented herein therefore provide a basis to benchmark hydrological models for a more realistic representation of the celerities and velocities when simulating water fluxes and their ages within drained agricultural fields additional water and tracer data sets are needed across agricultural fields with different management practices e g subsurface tile spacing depth soil types e g fine textured vs coarse textured and climates to better quantify water fate and transport these data are critical for understanding contaminant losses from intensively managed agroecosystems credit authorship contribution statement mark
