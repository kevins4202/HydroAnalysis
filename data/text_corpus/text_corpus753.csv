3765,over abstraction for agricultural production and droughts in the bakhtegan basin in southwest iran has led to decreased lake volumes and has even dried in some years these problems have occurred in the basin as a result of neglecting the roles that humans have played in lake desiccation this study developed a socio hydrological model to understand such dynamic interactions between the economy and community s sensitivity to the environment in the period of 1999 to 2013 the weap model was used to simulate the hydrological system that is bi directionally coupled to a society model simulating community sensitivity a multi objective optimization algorithm was used to estimate the parameters of the coupled model the results of the model calibration and validation in estimating the simulated discharges show good performance of the model in simulating observed streamflows r2 and nse ranging between 0 73 and 0 99 and 0 31 to 0 99 respectively agriculture water supplied r2 and nse ranging between 0 00 and 0 69 and 7 08 to 0 58 respectively migration and population r2 and nse for migration 0 29 and 0 63 the results of the integrated model on community response showed that attention to environmental conditions such as lake levels was heightened right after the drought events of 2000 2001 and 2008 2010 the effect of the latter event was even accentuated by several human interventions such as operationalization of sivand and mollasadra dams and transfer of pristine lands to agriculture this led to major contraction of the lake the model interprets that heightened community sensitivity as a result led to public policy dialogue and change water was taken away from agriculture and given to the environment leading to temporary lake revival this was also confirmed by reviewing government decisions in 2011 further validating the value of socio hydrological models in interpreting feedbacks between community sensitivity and environmental flows keywords sociohydrological modeling weap bakhtegan basin community sensitivity 1 introduction humans have adversely affected water resources around the world as a result of increasing population technological development and economic growth in the era of the anthropocene savenije et al 2014 sivapalan 2015 humans are changing their environment and adapting themselves to those changes palmer smith 2014 human actions have a multitude of impacts on the hydrological dynamics at the scale of the catchments changes in land use changes in crop patterns construction of dams and hydraulic structures alter river flow regimes over harvest groundwater resources and reduce recharge to groundwater hedayat et al 2017 deteriorate of water quality due to pollution of water resources as well as numerous other impacts on biogeochemical cycles and riverine and lake ecology montanari et al 2013 human awareness of sustained environment degradation can also lead to changes in the way water is managed elshafei et al 2014 van emmerik et al 2014 a future with sustainable water development can therefore be a consequence of feedbacks from past human actions and accurate forecasting of long term environmental damage recent evidence suggests that the relationship between humans and water resources is at such a level of complexity that humans should be considered as an active agent capable of bringing change to its environment thompson et al 2013 this has motivated several socio hydrological models blair buytaert 2016 levy et al 2016 troy et al 2015 that integrate hydrological and social processes by conceptualizing dynamic one way or two way feedbacks between society and its water environment montanari et al 2013 sivapalan et al 2012 several socio hydrological studies have highlighted that social processes are influenced by economic development kandasamy et al 2014 roobavannan et al 2017b which often depends on agricultural growth agriculture provides around 60 of all jobs in developing countries rieu clarke et al 2015 roobavannan et al 2017a on the other hand agriculture is one of the most water consumptive economic sectors relying on water to grow agricultural biomass the excessive use and degradation of the quality of water resources makes it scarce this scarcity effect also makes water economically more valuable in monetary terms and therefore may lead to conflicts between agriculture and the environment not surprisingly there is a rising concern that agricultural growth would lead to reduced delivery of environmental water and subsequent ecosystem degradation mahabadi et al 2018 sajedipour et al 2017 tabouzadeh et al 2016 however human actions such as the expansion of irrigated areas to increase economic benefits also lead to changes in social aspects such as behavioral norms and social memory kinzig et al 2013 behavioral norms towards and social memory of past degradation events sensitizes communities to ongoing degradation elshafei et al 2015 this in turn sensitizes societies about impending undesirable events social memory therefore is a fundamental mechanism that connects hydrological change to societal response gober wheater 2015 one of the areas affected by adverse human actions is the bakhtegan lake basin blb in southwest iran the bakhtegan lake of the basin was dry in the summer of 2007 and has also been dry in recent years sajedipour et al 2017 only recently has the lake s extent recovered and stabilized after witnessing desiccation and interrupted recoveries in the early 2010s due to over abstraction bakhtegan wetland s water intake up by 900 tehran times 2020 construction of dams and over appropriation of water for agricultural purposes as a result of the expansion of irrigation areas in upstream parts of the basin are the main causes of drying downstream of bakhtegan lake which has been a valuable habitat for migratory birds mahabadi et al 2018 tabouzadeh et al 2016 rafii et al 2011 the loss of forest cover around the lake the dispersion of dust and salt particles from the dry bed of the lake and the death of some animal species are adverse effects that follow the drying of the lake this basin includes 46 species of mammals 218 species of birds 36 species of reptiles and 23 species of fish that are valuable attraction for tourists and researchers loss of such biodiversity would be a terrible environmental tragedy and hence the dynamics of lake recovery deserves careful investigation tangestani et al 2013 pendulum swing has been described by kandasamy et al 2014 to show a turn around from agricultural development and food production to the community inspired reallocation of water back to the environment roobavannan et al 2017a the key underlying mechanism is community sensitivity and response mediated competition for water between agriculture and the environment the phenomenon has been observed and modeled in several basins kandasamy et al 2014 demonstrated the emergence of the phenomenon in murrumbidgee river basin in eastern australia where the degradation of wetlands at the downstream end led to decreased water use in irrigated areas so that more water could be released for improving environmental health toolbin lake basin in western australia elshafei et al 2014 2015 the tarim river basin in western china liu et al 2014 and the kissimmee river basin in florida in the united states chen et al 2016 are other basins where a pendulum swing has been reported and interpreted through data analysis and socihydrological modeling this study aims to investigate the phenomenon in the blb and understand the possible influence of community response to partially recover and stabilize the lake in the early 2010s the intention is not to investigate whether the pendulum swing which implies sustained environmental development occurred in the basin instead the paper investigates how community responds to economic growth and environmental degradation and delivers improved ecosystem services under good economic conditions for the first time a detailed conceptual hydrological model is embedded within the sociohydrological model of roobavannan et al 2018 and operationalized in order to better understand the dessication and recovery even though temporary of an endorheic lake and the role that community sensitivity played in shaping societal response to that effect few previous studies have investigated the dynamic feedbacks between the community and its environment in the basin e g in terms of social learning benhangi et al 2017 2018 2020 although mahabadi et al 2018 provided a social ecological system model to understand the economic impacts of climate change in the basin this paper evaluates the co evolution of societal response with changing economic growth and environmental degradation for the first time this study therefore serves as a modeling template for more realistic socio hydrological predictions and efficient water management that endogenizes human values and norms roobavannan et al 2017a 2018 2 data and methods 2 1 study area blb is an endorheic basin located in southwest iran the kor and sivand rivers are the major rivers in the basin the kor river is the longest and most important river that caters to agriculture water demands in the basin also this river supplies drinking water to cities within marvdasht and shiraz provinces the bakhtegan and tashk lakes are located at the downstream end of the basin and are recognized as important places for breeding birds important bird area iba by bird life international sajedipour et al 2017 the area of bahtegan lake is about 750 km2 approximately 77 km in length about 10 km in average width and it is also the second largest lake in iran during the wet seasons the maximum depth of the lake is 3 m and the average depth of the lake is between 0 3 and 0 5 m river discharge at the junction of kor and sivand rivers have decreased in the last decade due to the rising demand for agricultural water that led to drying lakes sajedipour et al 2017 benhangi et al 2018 in persian provide a comprehensive overview of the major anthropogenic pressures that have profoundly altered the blb over time see fig 1 in particular some key events are discussed here the agricultural expansion in the agricultural growth poles law was legislated in 1975 that led to increased irrigation area in marvdasht city located in the blb in order to make marvdasht the largest agricultural pole in fars province the dorrodzan dam and irrigation pumping systems were built around the same time more than 200 thousand hectares of national lands were transferred to applicants by the government as a result which led to significant increase in the area under cultivation and subsequently led to increased pressure on the province s water resources during the time that the government transferred the lands other areas were illegally seized by the farmers by the end of 2005 more than 35 thousand hectares were unauthorized acquisitions benhangi et al 2018 about five thousand of those unauthorized acquisition lands were legally transferred to farmers in 2006 benhangi et al 2018 in order to cater to such an increase in agricultural demand the mollasadra dam with a capacity of 411 mcm was constructed and operationalized in 2007 and the sivand dam with a capacity of 142 mcm was operationalized in 2009 on the rivers feeding the lake kor and sivand rivers respectively see figs 2 and 4 a large part of lake bakhtegan had dried up in august 2007 and as a result 2 000 flamingo chicks that had not yet been able to fly had died in its dry salty bed the extent of bakhtegan lake was significantly lower in the following two years bagheri et al 2016 towards 2011 excessive water withdrawals from illegal wells and over appropriation of water resources for expanded agriculture caused evident environmental degradation including a reduction in the extent of the bakhtegan lake and thus endangering plant and animal species rafiee et al 2010 this led to communal agitation in response to which the environmental protection agency and the ministry of energy of iran took necessary measures to curb violators and increase environmental flows in 2011 nasim news 2012 also below we present two examples of local representatives requesting the president to force his cabinet to supply the environmental demand of bakhtegan lake nasim news 2012 tasnimnews 2013 these we believe must have emerged from intense dialogues between local population and their representatives to the extent that the representatives felt obliged to formally request the national government for a change in water management practices the ministry of energy also responsible for supplying environmental flows released bakhtegan lake s demand for environmental flows from dorrodzan dam as a result in 2011 fig 5 2 2 sub basins of blb blb is subdivided into five regions see fig 2 based on societal development processes and hydrological and hydrogeological boundaries benhangi et al 2017 in persian region 1 upstream of mollasadra dam up mollasadra is a region where farming lands are divided into smaller areas especially orchards in upstream areas and rice in downstream areas building mollasadra dam has led farmers to expand farming lands by using dam storage via pumping increased withdrawals in upstream areas has also led to excessive use of groundwater in this region region 2 the area upstream of sivand dam up sivand is mountainous and has limited water resources similar to up mollasadra water consumption is higher in upstream areas than downstream where farmers use modern irrigation systems for orchards region 3 the mollsadra doroodzan region is located between dorrodzan dam and pole khan agriculture expansion in this region was facilitated by the dorrodzan dam and government policies upstream in order to sustain agricultural profits during droughts the farmers in this region have switched to groundwater instead of decreasing irrigation area as a result the groundwater level declined and became unusable leading farmers to grow almond olives and saffron the expansion of irrigation networks further increased water scarcity in the region because additional availability of water led to further increase in the farming area from 46 thousand hectares to 72 thousand hectares region 4 the doroodzan hasanabad area from pole khan to bakhtegan lake has witnessed most of the adverse impacts of activities in upstream regions region 1 3 unofficial institutions coordinate farmers to deal with these impacts by changing cropping patterns and irrigation systems groundwater being saline due to over extraction is unusable for farming as a result many of the farmers changed their occupation or emigrated to other areas for farming desolated rural areas shows the aftermath of migration in this region region 5 the hasanabad bakhtegan lake area has been used for dry farming the pattern of community behavior in this area is similar to doroodzan hasanabad area rainfed figs have been planted in most of the region 2 3 model set up and parameterization following roobavannan et al 2018 the presented sociohydrological model fig 3 dynamically couples the basin s hydrology with a society model the model is linked to an optimization scheme to calibrate the parameters of the model the model couples a water demand and balance based weap water evaluation and planning model with community sensitivity equations of the model by roobavannan et al 2017b the advantages of using the weap model rather than the water mass balance in the roobavannan et al 2017b are that the entire basin is more realistically modeled utilizing available observations to a fuller extent and considering both surface and groundwater resources the elitist non dominated sorting genetic nsga ii algorithm deb et al 2002 is used to calibrate the coupled model parameters based on observed annual streamflow at two gauges and unemployment statistics within the basin the presented sociohydrological model is a coupled water society model weap is the water system model that estimates available water in the basin this is an input to the society model at each simulation time step in the society model the community sensitivity which is a function of economic conditions of the society and the state of the environment influences community response to allocate water for agricultural and environmental needs the amount of agricultural water allocation determines the unemployment rate based on how many are employed in the agriculture sector that is limited by agriculture water availability outmigration is interpreted and modeled as a function of agriculture unemployment and partially influences the population of the basin in the next simulation period this population is used to calculate the need for drinking water as well as the unemployment rate for the next time step the agricultural expansion reflecting the limitations of water and land resources and labor in each period has a two way relationship with the unemployment rate and has a direct impact on the community response this is in addition to the impact of community sensitivity on community response which when exceeds a certain threshold leads to a change in allocation of water between agriculture and the environment 2 3 1 hydrological model weap weap is semi theoretical semi distributed and deterministic model abrishamchi et al 2007 it integrates water balance components such as evapotranspiration runoff baseflow etc with man made interventions such as dams through watershed scale hydrologic processes and can be used in urban or agricultural hydrological systems weap has been used to evaluate water allocation and management across a range of climatic hydrological and socio economic conditions e g bhave et al 2020 karlberg et al 2015 mehta et al 2013 in this case study fig 4 the components of weap that have been implemented at an annual scale consist of 1 rivers two main rivers 2 reservoirs three dams 3 demand sites drinking water and agriculture demands 4 groundwater 5 transmission links 6 return flows and 7 environmental flow requirements fig 3 shows that water storage is calculated by weap and used as an input to the society model evapotranspiration runoff infiltration and irrigation supply are five key processes modeled in weap based on the decision context stakeholders requirements and balancing model complexity with data availability sieber 1990 using weap as the water system model the sociohydrological model has the ability to consider different scenarios of e g climate and crop patterns the model was calibrated based on past observed climate and cropping patterns in the basin nonetheless it would be useful for future research to investigate different climate change scenarios and changes in crop patterns as inputs in the sociohydrological model for forecasting future conditions and how communities respond to it irrigation demands were calculated by ghafarijoo et al 2016 in persian for each region in blb based on the cropping pattern and crop water demands data from ghafarijoo et al 2016 in persian such as of kor and sivand rivers headflows the reservoirs net evaporation evaporation minus precipitation on the reservoirs surface observed reservoir volumes and streamflow data are used to develop the weap model for blb the model does not include return flow to recharge the groundwater but return flows to the rivers are considered according to the available information total consumption excluding the doroodzan dam outlet in the catchment areas of tashk bakhtegan and maharloo lakes is 5 51 billion cubic meters excluding 0 29 billion cubic meters of sewage from springs and aqueducts without or without consumption 40 year long term water balance 1967 2007 it is estimated that 27 59 percent of this consumption is uncertain 1 52 billion cubic meters of surface water is supplied total groundwater consumption wells and aqueducts is 3 99 billion cubic meters and about 72 41 percent of the total catchment area groundwater resources report of jamab consulting engineers company 2013 based on weap s ability to consider the withdrawal ratio of surface and groundwater in blb we assumed that groundwater would supply 75 percent of demand furthermore the first priority of withdrawal from groundwater resources as shown in fig 3 transmission links has been considered reservoirs water mass balance equations are presented in the following table 1 2 3 2 society model 2 3 2 1 population and migration births b deaths d and economic migration m are factors that determine changes in population a change in population p is calculated by 1 p p b d m where p dp dt and birth and death rates and economic migration are fluxes at an annual scale number year migration is assumed to be solely linked with the economy even though migration could also be induced by climate change politics or other issues following roobavannan et al 2017b and lyu et al 2019 who have found migration to be a function of the unemployment gradient in the murrumbidgee river basin in australia and jiangsu province china given that the unemployment rate is one of the most important migration factors in iran esfandiari and nabieian 2018 ghader 2018 migration is assumed to be proportional to the difference between unemployment rates in the basin and the rest of iran 2 m υ u i u b where ui is the unemployment rate of iran ub is the unemployment rate in the blb and υ is a constant the unemployment rate is determined by 3 u b m a x 0 p φ d a p φ 100 where φ is the labor participation rate of the population and da is the labor demand of the agriculture sector this equation assumes that agriculture dominates the basin s economy ghafarijoo et al 2016 following efficiency conditions provided by roobavannan et al 2017a b change in labor demand in agriculture is assumed to depend on the change in the irrigated area l a l a which is contingent on water irrigation supply the growth rate of the total factor of productivity tfp in agriculture γ a the wage growth rate γ w and the productivity share of land in agricultural output α 4 d a d a l a l a γ a α γ w α on the other hand population size determines the drinking water demand as shown in table 1 where wp is domestic water use per capita 2 3 2 2 ecosystem services es ecosystem services are defined as the conditions and processes by which natural ecosystems and its inhabiting species sustain and fulfill human life daily 1997 the delivery of ecosystem services e s as part of the society model affects community sensitivity towards environmental health and degradation it is calculated by a seven year moving average of the fish species richness fsr index yoshikawa et al 2014 given by 5 e s β 0 q b β 1 where q b is the observed discharge into the bakhtegan lake fig 4 β 0 and β 1 are parameters with values obtained from yoshikawa et al 2014 2 3 2 3 community sensitivity it is expected that wide participation is required to bring about a change in social behavior and change in associated water use and management mdba 2017 community sensitivity plays a vital role in that regard elshafei et al 2014 proposed an equation based on vulnerability and resilience theories roobavannan et al 2017a and conceptualized community sensitivity by comparing economic conditions with delivery of ecosystem services although society is heterogeneous in terms of income education and politics which all impact its collective behavior and action magnani 2001 the community is assumed to be homogenous in blb this community is similar in terms of religion and the main occupation of agriculture rural areas in most areas and so on although we assumed that the community is homogeneous we used the weap model to consider the five different areas in the bakhtegan basin to incorporate agrohydrological heterogeneities so that the results are of the required quality 6 v γ v e s i c v where v dv dt is community sensitivity s change γ v is a timescale parameter determined by social economic and political factors elshafei et al 2014 roobavannan et al 2017a e s is the change in the delivery of ecosystem services of the basin and i c is the change in income per capita for the population in the basin given by 7 e s δ e s e s i c δ i c i c where e s is the average ecosystem services over the past five years and i c is the average income per capita over past five years roobavannan et al 2017a 2 3 2 4 community response according to the concept of community response presented by roobavannan et al 2017a a community that is highly sensitive to environmental degradation is further sensitized by adverse environmental conditions such heightened sentiments override the inducement for agricultural expansion de trigger management actions to divert water away from agriculture and reallocate it to the environment this trigger is modeled through a response function x water reallocation to the environment occurs when x is positive and exceeds a certain critical sensitivity threshold vc during the simulation period the community response is therefore updated every year as a function as conceptualized by roobavannan et al 2017a to exemplify this further excessive drying of lakes over time can lead to sensitivity heightened beyond a tolerable threshold resulting in responses to increase environmental flows to the lakes the response function x shown below determines the change in community behavior and their response to an increasingly degrading environment resulting in more water being released to the baktegan lake community sensitivity depends on the social and environmental values of the community local actions lobbies and the like as a result a change in the environment leads to a change in community sensitivity that eventually leads to a shift in water management behavior and decisions elshafei et al 2014 see equation 6 the allocation of water and the release of more environmental flows are examples of actions resulting from increased community sensitivity that affects the feed backs to the economy through e g reduced water for agriculture lower agricultural production and higher agriculture unemployment roobavannan et al 2017a 8 x k d d e f v v c f v k d d e f v v c where kd is a scaling factor de is inducement for agricultural expansion v c is the critical community sensitivity and f v is normalized sensitivity given by 9 f v v v m v where v m is an arbitrary constant reflecting the maximum sensitivity of the particular community elshafei et al 2014 kindly note from equations 6 8 and 9 that a change in community sensitivity is proportional to a change in community response hence the model assumes no lag between the two community sensitivity and community response are filtered processes which depend on the past sensitivities and responses with certain lags as encapsulated by γ in equation 6 for example nonetheless there should be some slight delay between the two that depends on the characteristics of the community and the temporal scale of the analysis the inducement of agricultural expansion de exhibits society s incentive to grow using land to increase production 10 d e p p u b 1 l a l m 1 r e s c available labor is influenced by population growth and the unemployment rate additional water and farming land available are other restrictions on agricultural expansion r e is the total predicted water supply that may be extracted for instance for irrigation and town water supply s c includes all water resources that can be utilized for expansion la is the irrigated land area lm is the maximum land available for agriculture and the corresponding factor 1 l a l m indicates fraction of land available for further expansion the response function affects water management and changes allocation between agriculture and the environment roobavannan et al 2017b suggested an equation based on elshafei et al 2014 on how water allocation for agriculture may change when x changes sign 11 q a η e s s q a x 0 η a x η e s s q a x 0 where q a is the change in the amount of water delivered to agriculture s is the water storage s ds dt and η a η e are parameters that are calibrated 2 3 3 optimization routine nsga ii nsga ii presented by deb et al 2002 is a tool to calibrate model parameters nsga ii is a multi objective optimization algorithm that simultaneously optimizes multiple objectives without being dominated by any other solution and presents optimal parameter sets as a pareto front in the multi objective space yusoff et al 2011 the main steps of the nsga ii method can be found in amirkhani et al 2017 the parameter setting of nsga ii method used for calibration is shown in table 2 three objective functions are defined and minimized in the optimization algorithm the first two objectives f1 and f2 are sums of squared differences between observed discharge and discharge estimated by the coupled model at gauge numbers 4 linked to agriculture demand and 6 linked to environmental demand see fig 4 respectively the third objective f3 is the sum of the squared difference between observed and predicted unemployment rates in blb the calibration period is 1999 2013 2 3 3 1 calibration parameters parameters that are calibrated see table 3 include γ v time factor parameters of community sensitivity six parameters of the community response function and the parameter v of the migration equation 3 results and data analysis first the multiobjective calibration results of the socio hydrological model are shown including an investigation of the obtained parameter pareto optimal non dominated sets in three dimensional space of the objective functions the non dominated sets obtained are then used to simulate socio hydrological responses and to validate against observed river discharge at gauges not used in calibration simulated agricultural water use is also validated against observed agricultural water demanded and used finally the simulated community sensitivity and response function are discussed and contrasted with observed bakhtegan lake extents to discuss the robustness of model calibration and realism of community sensitivity in effectuating changes in lake extents in response to the degrading environment 3 1 calibration results previous research has indicated that the nature of societal parameters used for instance of community sensitivity makes it challenging to validate the realism of calibrated socio hydrological models kandasamy et al 2014 pande sivapalan 2017 troy et al 2015 using the three non commensurable objectives of simulating the agricultural water use environmental water release and the basin unemployment rate the nsga ii optimization model provides a pareto optimal non dominated set of parameters that simulate the three fluxes with mutually constrained accuracies that is no one pareto optimal parameter based simulation can perform better in representing the observed than the simulations of all other pareto optimal parameters sets in all the three objectives of accurately simulating agricultural water use environmental release and basin unemployment rates the results obtained from the optimization of calibration parameters are summarized in table 3 figure 6 a compares the annual time series of observed discharge with maximum and minimum discharge simulated for gauge number 4 in the calibration period due to strategic location of the doroodzan dam gauge number 4 that is located downstream of this dam has been chosen to calibrate the coupled model fig 6b shows the annual time series of observed discharge of hassanabad kharame gauge number 6 that is the last gauging station before the river enters the bakhtegan lake 3 2 interpreting the inherent sociohydrological dynamics 3 2 1 agricultural demands and discharges agricultural demands corresponding to the five regions of blb in fig 4 that were supplied were used for the socio hydrological model s validation the observed data used in this paper were provided by ghafarijoo et al 2016 the observation data irrigation water requirements for each demand site were determined by considering effective rainfall evapotranspiration and the type of crop cultivated the corresponding observed and simulated annual agricultural water supplies of the five regions are presented in fig 7 the difference between observed and simulated annual agricultural water supplies can be caused by uncertainty in ghafarijoo et al 2016 as well as due to model and parameter uncertainty although the crop patterns were changed in blb corresponding average irrigation water requirements were kept constant and that could have affected the simulated results it is also assumed that agricultural water demand is always met similarly six streamflow gauges not used in calibration were used to assess modeled streamflow in the basin figure 8 shows validation results based on a comparison between observed and simulated discharges at six gauge locations in blb see fig 4 the correlation coefficient r2 between recorded and simulated annual discharges are between 0 99 and 0 73 while the nash sutcliffe efficiency scores are between 0 95 and 0 31 this shows that the coupled model can estimate discharge reasonably well in blb 3 2 2 the unemployment rate migration and population the unemployment rate and population are two other variables that were determined by the coupled model fig 9 a and b show a comparison of simulated basin populations and unemployment rates in the basin respectively the observed values are bracketed by the uncertainty bounds of the simulations corresponding to the pareto optimal parameter sets while the correlation between observed and mean simulated basin employment is low a reasonably high nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 6 indicates that simulated basin unemployment is able to represent variability in the observed unemployment rate well population figures were available only for three years to compare with the simulated results since the population census is conducted every five years nonetheless the observed populations are found to be within the uncertainty bounds of the simulated results as shown in fig 9a due to a lack of unemployment rate data in the blb the unemployment rate of fars province blb is located in this province is used as a proxy this and model uncertainties can be the reason for the discrepancy between the simulated and observed values of the unemployment rate in fig 9b however the variation of the simulated unemployment rate is similar to the observed unemployment rate of iran with nse of 0 6 and r2 of 0 3 the variation in unemployment rate within and outside the basin also reflects in the basin outmigration figure 10 shows the mean simulated migration from 2000 to 2013 the average annual migration from blb to the outside is between two to four thousand which gradually declined for the most part except towards the end of the simulation period the peaks around 2004 and 2013 i e more out migration are noteworthy and correspond to minor revivals of baktegan lake when water was taken away from agriculture and given back to the environment the simulated migration suggests that farmers partly adapted to it by migrating out of the basin 3 2 3 community sensitivity and response the variations in the areal extent of the baktegan lake were processed in gee google earth engine using high resolution landsat 5 7 and 8 images and used to compare with the changes in simulated community response sajedipour et al 2017 also compiled a table shown below table 4 that includes the lake extents as observed by other studies this data is also utilized to validate areal extent computations tabouzadeh et al 2016 utilized a standardized precipitation index for the analysis of drought characteristics in blb and found that droughts occurred during 1999 2001 and 2008 in addition dehghanipour et al 2019 show that according to observed annual precipitation from 1992 to 2013 precipitation in 1999 2000 2001 and 2008 were 40 lower than the average during 2002 2013 in the urmia lake basin gee results show lake extents shrinking around similar times in blb different columns of shaded areas indicate major events in operational water management from left to right 1 drought in 2000 2001 2 community response to revive the lake in 2002 3 transference of national lands to agricultural projects and non agricultural projects from 2005 to 2013 4 mollasadra dam operationalized in 2007 another drought started in 2008 and the sivand dam operationalized in 2009 5 the community responded yet again to revive the lake that was otherwise desiccating as a result of dry conditions and operationalization of the two upstream dams upstream from 2011 to 2012 additionally the years 2003 to 2007 and 2012 to 2013 were non drought periods that witnessed no community response fig 11 shows that after each dry duration in the basin and heightened agricultural water demand see also fig 7 e g 2008 to 2010 the community responded by reducing agricultural water demand and increasing the release of water to the lake equation 6 assumes that a change in community sensitivity is proportional with an opposite sign to a change in the sum of income per capita and ecosystem services relative to the average of past five years hence a significant response towards environmental protection is expected when income per capita in the past five years has remained stable but perhaps at the cost of ecosystem services have severely degraded this can be seen in fig 11 at 2002 and 2011 the community sensitivity begins to dissipate when ecosystem services significantly improves relative to past five years even when income falls this is because ecosystem services degrade to really low levels unlike income per capita before community responds and improvements are made the beliefs and norms of the community as possible drivers of community sensitivity and response change at time scales of generations under ordinary circumstances the period that has been simulated also witnessed some important land use changes and lake desiccations see e g fig 10 based on the calibrated results the model suggests that construction of dams and expansion of agriculture perhaps compounded with droughts led to heightened sensitivity this may have risen faster than under ordinary circumstances leading to responses within the 15 year simulation period also note that community sensitivity equation has a time scale parameter γ v that is calibrated on data this encapsulates whether community sensitivity changes at a faster pace for a given case study calibration shows that the range lies between 7 and 17 years this is within the data length of 15 years meaning that community sensitivity can change within the period mentioned and close to intergenerational time intervals of 20 25 years often considered for changes in norms over generations to further investigate the interpretation of this model with the events and the societal response news from reputable domestic news agencies was examined regarding changes in local water policy the most significant of which appeared on october 26 2011 where the head of the environmental protection agency stated that due to the unauthorized withdrawals and wells that were dug there illegally the environmental protection agency and the ministry of energy followed up and took the necessary measures in this regard he added it was also decided with the follow up of the environmental protection organization that the water required for this lake will be provided through the ministry of energy through dorrodzan dam and it seems that the problem of the second largest salty lake of iran bakhtegan will be resolved head of the environmental protection agency also stated that almost 40 million cubic meters of new water had been released from dorrodzan dam in 2011 to improve the condition of bakhtegan lake he also pointed out that more water should be considered for bakhtegan lake water rights environmental protection organization 2011 this corroborates the interpretation of the sociohydrological model that the community responds to improve environmental quality when faced with extreme degradation and demonstrates the strength of sociohydrological conceptualization provided by roobavannan et al 2017b it can be noted that the annual rainfall in most of the meteorological stations in the bakhtegan basin after the 2008 drought returned back to normal before the drought figure a2 in the supplementary materials although the amount of rainfall observed in 2011 is less than the amount of rainfall reported in most of the stations in 2010 and 2012 satellite images show that the lake area was bigger fig 11 the reason for this is the release of 40 million cubic meters of the doroodzan dam which had been approved by the government and partly shows the impact of water management decisions nasim news 2012 the increased flow in 2011 is also been simulated by the model shown in fig 11 as mentioned earlier kor and sivand rivers have a major role to play in providing water to lake bakhtegan see figs 1 and 3 and the existence of dams on these two rivers indicates that even if rainfall increases decision makers can stop releasing water to the environment and store water in the reservoirs especially after the drought the reservoirs have the capacity to save water figure 1 plots the flow difference between gauge 4 and 6 first drought started in 1999 and lasted till mid 2001 while the second drought occured in 2008 in the first drought the lake level recovery coincided with the recovery of the lake the lake recovery around the second drought period happened with lower than normal water being allocated to agriculture to the downstream agriculture demand centers the doroodzan hasanabad region and near zero water allocated to the agriculture in hasanabad bakhtegan lake region this is indicated by the flow difference from 2009 to 2012 humans particularly governments played an important role in meeting environmental needs by regulating agricultural water and the river flows indeed community response is closely linked to ecosystem services and also lake levels as fig 11 shows however after slight revival the community response went below 0 this is because sustained continued response also depends on the economy of the country which deteriorated after 2012 nonetheless note that the new dams were operationalized in 2007 and 2009 before the spike in community sensitivity in 2011 not after the spike may have also been due to concurrent drought but note that while rainfall recovered to normal levels in 2009 onwards agriculture water demand met remained lower than before 2008 this is shown in the fig 1 the evidence of community response due to heightened community sensitivity in 2011 is that the director general of environmental protection of fars province confirmed that 40 million cubic meters were released from the doroodzan dam and also he said that another 40 million cubic meters were approved and were allocated as environmental water requirements however field visits and local research as well as the model show that the latter allocation was not entirely implemented in the coming years due to weakening of the economy after 2012 tasnimnews 2013 this also corroborates the findings of roobavannan et al 2020 roobavannan et al 2019 that changes in water policy to divert water away from agriculture and to the environment depends on how diversified the economy is critical community sensitivity is a parameter that can be compared to other studies such as elshafei et al 2014 and roobavannan et al 2017a calibrated critical community sensitivity in blb is more than murrumbidgee river basin mrb this means that in blb improving society s economic condition takes priority over improving the environmental condition the time scale of the community sensitivity parameter in blb is shorter than in mrb indicating that communities in blb change their attitudes toward the environment more rapidly since the time scale could be influenced by outside social economic and political factors elshafei et al 2014 accelerated changes in attitude toward the environment in blb could have probably been caused by less stable political factors when compared to mrb in australia furthermore the factor for migration in blb is greater than the mrb indicating that the economy and unemployment rate have a higher impact on migration in blb 4 conclusions this paper focused on interpreting community behavior and its response under changing sociohydrological conditions such as droughts building of dams and the transfer of lands to agriculture in blb in south western iran results interpret that the community responded to the effects of drought and operationalization of dams on the lake by taking water away from agriculture and releasing it to the lake and by controlling the proliferation of unauthorized wells the sociohydrological model presented here provided one interpretation of change in policy that it was due to heightened community sensitivity as a result poor delivery of ecosystem services with a strong economy to support such a decision sociohydrological modeling was used to interpret changes in agriculture water supply unemployment migration and population as the community adapted to changing environmental conditions calibration and validation results showed that the model was successfully able to simulate and interpret such past observations suggesting that it can reliably predict future trajectories of system behavior under changing socio economic conditions although the model developed in this study is well adapted to the blb there were some limitations such as a lack of reliable information and modeling of groundwater resources and changes in crop patterns these limitations can be ameliorated in the future through more observations and additional modeling of the groundwater within the presented socio hydrological model this increase in complexity is necessary to improve the realism of the model and is left to future research in the developed model changing cropping patterns of the past are considered within the corresponding agricultural water demand calculations however there are currently no feedbacks from community sensitivity to crop diversification the only feedback is to how water available is divided between water for agriculture and for environment one way to incorporate the feedback to crop diversification can be to identify a crop mix that maximizes income for farmers for a given allocation of water and available technologies we leave this for future research it should be noted that the model presented is useful for future decision making because all possible solutions such as crop substitution shift to more water efficient technologies and practices migration of farmers other factors that reduce water intake have an impact on the economy of the bakhtegan basin and none of these factors can be considered in isolation and do not necessarily improve environmental conditions on its own for example we can refer to the law on the replacement of rice cultivation by other agricultural products the lack of attention to the price of rice and alternative crops and their impact on people s incomes resulted in the legislation not being implemented using weap as the hydrological model that has the ability to consider different scenarios as well as the ability to consider changing cropping patterns it would be useful for future research to investigate different scenarios of climate change and cropping patterns as inputs developed model can either estimate how much the government should spend on environmental water supply to permanently restore the lake consideration of the climate change scenarios and economic conditions to run the sociohydrological model can give decision makers more accurate results this however was beyond the scope of current

3765,over abstraction for agricultural production and droughts in the bakhtegan basin in southwest iran has led to decreased lake volumes and has even dried in some years these problems have occurred in the basin as a result of neglecting the roles that humans have played in lake desiccation this study developed a socio hydrological model to understand such dynamic interactions between the economy and community s sensitivity to the environment in the period of 1999 to 2013 the weap model was used to simulate the hydrological system that is bi directionally coupled to a society model simulating community sensitivity a multi objective optimization algorithm was used to estimate the parameters of the coupled model the results of the model calibration and validation in estimating the simulated discharges show good performance of the model in simulating observed streamflows r2 and nse ranging between 0 73 and 0 99 and 0 31 to 0 99 respectively agriculture water supplied r2 and nse ranging between 0 00 and 0 69 and 7 08 to 0 58 respectively migration and population r2 and nse for migration 0 29 and 0 63 the results of the integrated model on community response showed that attention to environmental conditions such as lake levels was heightened right after the drought events of 2000 2001 and 2008 2010 the effect of the latter event was even accentuated by several human interventions such as operationalization of sivand and mollasadra dams and transfer of pristine lands to agriculture this led to major contraction of the lake the model interprets that heightened community sensitivity as a result led to public policy dialogue and change water was taken away from agriculture and given to the environment leading to temporary lake revival this was also confirmed by reviewing government decisions in 2011 further validating the value of socio hydrological models in interpreting feedbacks between community sensitivity and environmental flows keywords sociohydrological modeling weap bakhtegan basin community sensitivity 1 introduction humans have adversely affected water resources around the world as a result of increasing population technological development and economic growth in the era of the anthropocene savenije et al 2014 sivapalan 2015 humans are changing their environment and adapting themselves to those changes palmer smith 2014 human actions have a multitude of impacts on the hydrological dynamics at the scale of the catchments changes in land use changes in crop patterns construction of dams and hydraulic structures alter river flow regimes over harvest groundwater resources and reduce recharge to groundwater hedayat et al 2017 deteriorate of water quality due to pollution of water resources as well as numerous other impacts on biogeochemical cycles and riverine and lake ecology montanari et al 2013 human awareness of sustained environment degradation can also lead to changes in the way water is managed elshafei et al 2014 van emmerik et al 2014 a future with sustainable water development can therefore be a consequence of feedbacks from past human actions and accurate forecasting of long term environmental damage recent evidence suggests that the relationship between humans and water resources is at such a level of complexity that humans should be considered as an active agent capable of bringing change to its environment thompson et al 2013 this has motivated several socio hydrological models blair buytaert 2016 levy et al 2016 troy et al 2015 that integrate hydrological and social processes by conceptualizing dynamic one way or two way feedbacks between society and its water environment montanari et al 2013 sivapalan et al 2012 several socio hydrological studies have highlighted that social processes are influenced by economic development kandasamy et al 2014 roobavannan et al 2017b which often depends on agricultural growth agriculture provides around 60 of all jobs in developing countries rieu clarke et al 2015 roobavannan et al 2017a on the other hand agriculture is one of the most water consumptive economic sectors relying on water to grow agricultural biomass the excessive use and degradation of the quality of water resources makes it scarce this scarcity effect also makes water economically more valuable in monetary terms and therefore may lead to conflicts between agriculture and the environment not surprisingly there is a rising concern that agricultural growth would lead to reduced delivery of environmental water and subsequent ecosystem degradation mahabadi et al 2018 sajedipour et al 2017 tabouzadeh et al 2016 however human actions such as the expansion of irrigated areas to increase economic benefits also lead to changes in social aspects such as behavioral norms and social memory kinzig et al 2013 behavioral norms towards and social memory of past degradation events sensitizes communities to ongoing degradation elshafei et al 2015 this in turn sensitizes societies about impending undesirable events social memory therefore is a fundamental mechanism that connects hydrological change to societal response gober wheater 2015 one of the areas affected by adverse human actions is the bakhtegan lake basin blb in southwest iran the bakhtegan lake of the basin was dry in the summer of 2007 and has also been dry in recent years sajedipour et al 2017 only recently has the lake s extent recovered and stabilized after witnessing desiccation and interrupted recoveries in the early 2010s due to over abstraction bakhtegan wetland s water intake up by 900 tehran times 2020 construction of dams and over appropriation of water for agricultural purposes as a result of the expansion of irrigation areas in upstream parts of the basin are the main causes of drying downstream of bakhtegan lake which has been a valuable habitat for migratory birds mahabadi et al 2018 tabouzadeh et al 2016 rafii et al 2011 the loss of forest cover around the lake the dispersion of dust and salt particles from the dry bed of the lake and the death of some animal species are adverse effects that follow the drying of the lake this basin includes 46 species of mammals 218 species of birds 36 species of reptiles and 23 species of fish that are valuable attraction for tourists and researchers loss of such biodiversity would be a terrible environmental tragedy and hence the dynamics of lake recovery deserves careful investigation tangestani et al 2013 pendulum swing has been described by kandasamy et al 2014 to show a turn around from agricultural development and food production to the community inspired reallocation of water back to the environment roobavannan et al 2017a the key underlying mechanism is community sensitivity and response mediated competition for water between agriculture and the environment the phenomenon has been observed and modeled in several basins kandasamy et al 2014 demonstrated the emergence of the phenomenon in murrumbidgee river basin in eastern australia where the degradation of wetlands at the downstream end led to decreased water use in irrigated areas so that more water could be released for improving environmental health toolbin lake basin in western australia elshafei et al 2014 2015 the tarim river basin in western china liu et al 2014 and the kissimmee river basin in florida in the united states chen et al 2016 are other basins where a pendulum swing has been reported and interpreted through data analysis and socihydrological modeling this study aims to investigate the phenomenon in the blb and understand the possible influence of community response to partially recover and stabilize the lake in the early 2010s the intention is not to investigate whether the pendulum swing which implies sustained environmental development occurred in the basin instead the paper investigates how community responds to economic growth and environmental degradation and delivers improved ecosystem services under good economic conditions for the first time a detailed conceptual hydrological model is embedded within the sociohydrological model of roobavannan et al 2018 and operationalized in order to better understand the dessication and recovery even though temporary of an endorheic lake and the role that community sensitivity played in shaping societal response to that effect few previous studies have investigated the dynamic feedbacks between the community and its environment in the basin e g in terms of social learning benhangi et al 2017 2018 2020 although mahabadi et al 2018 provided a social ecological system model to understand the economic impacts of climate change in the basin this paper evaluates the co evolution of societal response with changing economic growth and environmental degradation for the first time this study therefore serves as a modeling template for more realistic socio hydrological predictions and efficient water management that endogenizes human values and norms roobavannan et al 2017a 2018 2 data and methods 2 1 study area blb is an endorheic basin located in southwest iran the kor and sivand rivers are the major rivers in the basin the kor river is the longest and most important river that caters to agriculture water demands in the basin also this river supplies drinking water to cities within marvdasht and shiraz provinces the bakhtegan and tashk lakes are located at the downstream end of the basin and are recognized as important places for breeding birds important bird area iba by bird life international sajedipour et al 2017 the area of bahtegan lake is about 750 km2 approximately 77 km in length about 10 km in average width and it is also the second largest lake in iran during the wet seasons the maximum depth of the lake is 3 m and the average depth of the lake is between 0 3 and 0 5 m river discharge at the junction of kor and sivand rivers have decreased in the last decade due to the rising demand for agricultural water that led to drying lakes sajedipour et al 2017 benhangi et al 2018 in persian provide a comprehensive overview of the major anthropogenic pressures that have profoundly altered the blb over time see fig 1 in particular some key events are discussed here the agricultural expansion in the agricultural growth poles law was legislated in 1975 that led to increased irrigation area in marvdasht city located in the blb in order to make marvdasht the largest agricultural pole in fars province the dorrodzan dam and irrigation pumping systems were built around the same time more than 200 thousand hectares of national lands were transferred to applicants by the government as a result which led to significant increase in the area under cultivation and subsequently led to increased pressure on the province s water resources during the time that the government transferred the lands other areas were illegally seized by the farmers by the end of 2005 more than 35 thousand hectares were unauthorized acquisitions benhangi et al 2018 about five thousand of those unauthorized acquisition lands were legally transferred to farmers in 2006 benhangi et al 2018 in order to cater to such an increase in agricultural demand the mollasadra dam with a capacity of 411 mcm was constructed and operationalized in 2007 and the sivand dam with a capacity of 142 mcm was operationalized in 2009 on the rivers feeding the lake kor and sivand rivers respectively see figs 2 and 4 a large part of lake bakhtegan had dried up in august 2007 and as a result 2 000 flamingo chicks that had not yet been able to fly had died in its dry salty bed the extent of bakhtegan lake was significantly lower in the following two years bagheri et al 2016 towards 2011 excessive water withdrawals from illegal wells and over appropriation of water resources for expanded agriculture caused evident environmental degradation including a reduction in the extent of the bakhtegan lake and thus endangering plant and animal species rafiee et al 2010 this led to communal agitation in response to which the environmental protection agency and the ministry of energy of iran took necessary measures to curb violators and increase environmental flows in 2011 nasim news 2012 also below we present two examples of local representatives requesting the president to force his cabinet to supply the environmental demand of bakhtegan lake nasim news 2012 tasnimnews 2013 these we believe must have emerged from intense dialogues between local population and their representatives to the extent that the representatives felt obliged to formally request the national government for a change in water management practices the ministry of energy also responsible for supplying environmental flows released bakhtegan lake s demand for environmental flows from dorrodzan dam as a result in 2011 fig 5 2 2 sub basins of blb blb is subdivided into five regions see fig 2 based on societal development processes and hydrological and hydrogeological boundaries benhangi et al 2017 in persian region 1 upstream of mollasadra dam up mollasadra is a region where farming lands are divided into smaller areas especially orchards in upstream areas and rice in downstream areas building mollasadra dam has led farmers to expand farming lands by using dam storage via pumping increased withdrawals in upstream areas has also led to excessive use of groundwater in this region region 2 the area upstream of sivand dam up sivand is mountainous and has limited water resources similar to up mollasadra water consumption is higher in upstream areas than downstream where farmers use modern irrigation systems for orchards region 3 the mollsadra doroodzan region is located between dorrodzan dam and pole khan agriculture expansion in this region was facilitated by the dorrodzan dam and government policies upstream in order to sustain agricultural profits during droughts the farmers in this region have switched to groundwater instead of decreasing irrigation area as a result the groundwater level declined and became unusable leading farmers to grow almond olives and saffron the expansion of irrigation networks further increased water scarcity in the region because additional availability of water led to further increase in the farming area from 46 thousand hectares to 72 thousand hectares region 4 the doroodzan hasanabad area from pole khan to bakhtegan lake has witnessed most of the adverse impacts of activities in upstream regions region 1 3 unofficial institutions coordinate farmers to deal with these impacts by changing cropping patterns and irrigation systems groundwater being saline due to over extraction is unusable for farming as a result many of the farmers changed their occupation or emigrated to other areas for farming desolated rural areas shows the aftermath of migration in this region region 5 the hasanabad bakhtegan lake area has been used for dry farming the pattern of community behavior in this area is similar to doroodzan hasanabad area rainfed figs have been planted in most of the region 2 3 model set up and parameterization following roobavannan et al 2018 the presented sociohydrological model fig 3 dynamically couples the basin s hydrology with a society model the model is linked to an optimization scheme to calibrate the parameters of the model the model couples a water demand and balance based weap water evaluation and planning model with community sensitivity equations of the model by roobavannan et al 2017b the advantages of using the weap model rather than the water mass balance in the roobavannan et al 2017b are that the entire basin is more realistically modeled utilizing available observations to a fuller extent and considering both surface and groundwater resources the elitist non dominated sorting genetic nsga ii algorithm deb et al 2002 is used to calibrate the coupled model parameters based on observed annual streamflow at two gauges and unemployment statistics within the basin the presented sociohydrological model is a coupled water society model weap is the water system model that estimates available water in the basin this is an input to the society model at each simulation time step in the society model the community sensitivity which is a function of economic conditions of the society and the state of the environment influences community response to allocate water for agricultural and environmental needs the amount of agricultural water allocation determines the unemployment rate based on how many are employed in the agriculture sector that is limited by agriculture water availability outmigration is interpreted and modeled as a function of agriculture unemployment and partially influences the population of the basin in the next simulation period this population is used to calculate the need for drinking water as well as the unemployment rate for the next time step the agricultural expansion reflecting the limitations of water and land resources and labor in each period has a two way relationship with the unemployment rate and has a direct impact on the community response this is in addition to the impact of community sensitivity on community response which when exceeds a certain threshold leads to a change in allocation of water between agriculture and the environment 2 3 1 hydrological model weap weap is semi theoretical semi distributed and deterministic model abrishamchi et al 2007 it integrates water balance components such as evapotranspiration runoff baseflow etc with man made interventions such as dams through watershed scale hydrologic processes and can be used in urban or agricultural hydrological systems weap has been used to evaluate water allocation and management across a range of climatic hydrological and socio economic conditions e g bhave et al 2020 karlberg et al 2015 mehta et al 2013 in this case study fig 4 the components of weap that have been implemented at an annual scale consist of 1 rivers two main rivers 2 reservoirs three dams 3 demand sites drinking water and agriculture demands 4 groundwater 5 transmission links 6 return flows and 7 environmental flow requirements fig 3 shows that water storage is calculated by weap and used as an input to the society model evapotranspiration runoff infiltration and irrigation supply are five key processes modeled in weap based on the decision context stakeholders requirements and balancing model complexity with data availability sieber 1990 using weap as the water system model the sociohydrological model has the ability to consider different scenarios of e g climate and crop patterns the model was calibrated based on past observed climate and cropping patterns in the basin nonetheless it would be useful for future research to investigate different climate change scenarios and changes in crop patterns as inputs in the sociohydrological model for forecasting future conditions and how communities respond to it irrigation demands were calculated by ghafarijoo et al 2016 in persian for each region in blb based on the cropping pattern and crop water demands data from ghafarijoo et al 2016 in persian such as of kor and sivand rivers headflows the reservoirs net evaporation evaporation minus precipitation on the reservoirs surface observed reservoir volumes and streamflow data are used to develop the weap model for blb the model does not include return flow to recharge the groundwater but return flows to the rivers are considered according to the available information total consumption excluding the doroodzan dam outlet in the catchment areas of tashk bakhtegan and maharloo lakes is 5 51 billion cubic meters excluding 0 29 billion cubic meters of sewage from springs and aqueducts without or without consumption 40 year long term water balance 1967 2007 it is estimated that 27 59 percent of this consumption is uncertain 1 52 billion cubic meters of surface water is supplied total groundwater consumption wells and aqueducts is 3 99 billion cubic meters and about 72 41 percent of the total catchment area groundwater resources report of jamab consulting engineers company 2013 based on weap s ability to consider the withdrawal ratio of surface and groundwater in blb we assumed that groundwater would supply 75 percent of demand furthermore the first priority of withdrawal from groundwater resources as shown in fig 3 transmission links has been considered reservoirs water mass balance equations are presented in the following table 1 2 3 2 society model 2 3 2 1 population and migration births b deaths d and economic migration m are factors that determine changes in population a change in population p is calculated by 1 p p b d m where p dp dt and birth and death rates and economic migration are fluxes at an annual scale number year migration is assumed to be solely linked with the economy even though migration could also be induced by climate change politics or other issues following roobavannan et al 2017b and lyu et al 2019 who have found migration to be a function of the unemployment gradient in the murrumbidgee river basin in australia and jiangsu province china given that the unemployment rate is one of the most important migration factors in iran esfandiari and nabieian 2018 ghader 2018 migration is assumed to be proportional to the difference between unemployment rates in the basin and the rest of iran 2 m υ u i u b where ui is the unemployment rate of iran ub is the unemployment rate in the blb and υ is a constant the unemployment rate is determined by 3 u b m a x 0 p φ d a p φ 100 where φ is the labor participation rate of the population and da is the labor demand of the agriculture sector this equation assumes that agriculture dominates the basin s economy ghafarijoo et al 2016 following efficiency conditions provided by roobavannan et al 2017a b change in labor demand in agriculture is assumed to depend on the change in the irrigated area l a l a which is contingent on water irrigation supply the growth rate of the total factor of productivity tfp in agriculture γ a the wage growth rate γ w and the productivity share of land in agricultural output α 4 d a d a l a l a γ a α γ w α on the other hand population size determines the drinking water demand as shown in table 1 where wp is domestic water use per capita 2 3 2 2 ecosystem services es ecosystem services are defined as the conditions and processes by which natural ecosystems and its inhabiting species sustain and fulfill human life daily 1997 the delivery of ecosystem services e s as part of the society model affects community sensitivity towards environmental health and degradation it is calculated by a seven year moving average of the fish species richness fsr index yoshikawa et al 2014 given by 5 e s β 0 q b β 1 where q b is the observed discharge into the bakhtegan lake fig 4 β 0 and β 1 are parameters with values obtained from yoshikawa et al 2014 2 3 2 3 community sensitivity it is expected that wide participation is required to bring about a change in social behavior and change in associated water use and management mdba 2017 community sensitivity plays a vital role in that regard elshafei et al 2014 proposed an equation based on vulnerability and resilience theories roobavannan et al 2017a and conceptualized community sensitivity by comparing economic conditions with delivery of ecosystem services although society is heterogeneous in terms of income education and politics which all impact its collective behavior and action magnani 2001 the community is assumed to be homogenous in blb this community is similar in terms of religion and the main occupation of agriculture rural areas in most areas and so on although we assumed that the community is homogeneous we used the weap model to consider the five different areas in the bakhtegan basin to incorporate agrohydrological heterogeneities so that the results are of the required quality 6 v γ v e s i c v where v dv dt is community sensitivity s change γ v is a timescale parameter determined by social economic and political factors elshafei et al 2014 roobavannan et al 2017a e s is the change in the delivery of ecosystem services of the basin and i c is the change in income per capita for the population in the basin given by 7 e s δ e s e s i c δ i c i c where e s is the average ecosystem services over the past five years and i c is the average income per capita over past five years roobavannan et al 2017a 2 3 2 4 community response according to the concept of community response presented by roobavannan et al 2017a a community that is highly sensitive to environmental degradation is further sensitized by adverse environmental conditions such heightened sentiments override the inducement for agricultural expansion de trigger management actions to divert water away from agriculture and reallocate it to the environment this trigger is modeled through a response function x water reallocation to the environment occurs when x is positive and exceeds a certain critical sensitivity threshold vc during the simulation period the community response is therefore updated every year as a function as conceptualized by roobavannan et al 2017a to exemplify this further excessive drying of lakes over time can lead to sensitivity heightened beyond a tolerable threshold resulting in responses to increase environmental flows to the lakes the response function x shown below determines the change in community behavior and their response to an increasingly degrading environment resulting in more water being released to the baktegan lake community sensitivity depends on the social and environmental values of the community local actions lobbies and the like as a result a change in the environment leads to a change in community sensitivity that eventually leads to a shift in water management behavior and decisions elshafei et al 2014 see equation 6 the allocation of water and the release of more environmental flows are examples of actions resulting from increased community sensitivity that affects the feed backs to the economy through e g reduced water for agriculture lower agricultural production and higher agriculture unemployment roobavannan et al 2017a 8 x k d d e f v v c f v k d d e f v v c where kd is a scaling factor de is inducement for agricultural expansion v c is the critical community sensitivity and f v is normalized sensitivity given by 9 f v v v m v where v m is an arbitrary constant reflecting the maximum sensitivity of the particular community elshafei et al 2014 kindly note from equations 6 8 and 9 that a change in community sensitivity is proportional to a change in community response hence the model assumes no lag between the two community sensitivity and community response are filtered processes which depend on the past sensitivities and responses with certain lags as encapsulated by γ in equation 6 for example nonetheless there should be some slight delay between the two that depends on the characteristics of the community and the temporal scale of the analysis the inducement of agricultural expansion de exhibits society s incentive to grow using land to increase production 10 d e p p u b 1 l a l m 1 r e s c available labor is influenced by population growth and the unemployment rate additional water and farming land available are other restrictions on agricultural expansion r e is the total predicted water supply that may be extracted for instance for irrigation and town water supply s c includes all water resources that can be utilized for expansion la is the irrigated land area lm is the maximum land available for agriculture and the corresponding factor 1 l a l m indicates fraction of land available for further expansion the response function affects water management and changes allocation between agriculture and the environment roobavannan et al 2017b suggested an equation based on elshafei et al 2014 on how water allocation for agriculture may change when x changes sign 11 q a η e s s q a x 0 η a x η e s s q a x 0 where q a is the change in the amount of water delivered to agriculture s is the water storage s ds dt and η a η e are parameters that are calibrated 2 3 3 optimization routine nsga ii nsga ii presented by deb et al 2002 is a tool to calibrate model parameters nsga ii is a multi objective optimization algorithm that simultaneously optimizes multiple objectives without being dominated by any other solution and presents optimal parameter sets as a pareto front in the multi objective space yusoff et al 2011 the main steps of the nsga ii method can be found in amirkhani et al 2017 the parameter setting of nsga ii method used for calibration is shown in table 2 three objective functions are defined and minimized in the optimization algorithm the first two objectives f1 and f2 are sums of squared differences between observed discharge and discharge estimated by the coupled model at gauge numbers 4 linked to agriculture demand and 6 linked to environmental demand see fig 4 respectively the third objective f3 is the sum of the squared difference between observed and predicted unemployment rates in blb the calibration period is 1999 2013 2 3 3 1 calibration parameters parameters that are calibrated see table 3 include γ v time factor parameters of community sensitivity six parameters of the community response function and the parameter v of the migration equation 3 results and data analysis first the multiobjective calibration results of the socio hydrological model are shown including an investigation of the obtained parameter pareto optimal non dominated sets in three dimensional space of the objective functions the non dominated sets obtained are then used to simulate socio hydrological responses and to validate against observed river discharge at gauges not used in calibration simulated agricultural water use is also validated against observed agricultural water demanded and used finally the simulated community sensitivity and response function are discussed and contrasted with observed bakhtegan lake extents to discuss the robustness of model calibration and realism of community sensitivity in effectuating changes in lake extents in response to the degrading environment 3 1 calibration results previous research has indicated that the nature of societal parameters used for instance of community sensitivity makes it challenging to validate the realism of calibrated socio hydrological models kandasamy et al 2014 pande sivapalan 2017 troy et al 2015 using the three non commensurable objectives of simulating the agricultural water use environmental water release and the basin unemployment rate the nsga ii optimization model provides a pareto optimal non dominated set of parameters that simulate the three fluxes with mutually constrained accuracies that is no one pareto optimal parameter based simulation can perform better in representing the observed than the simulations of all other pareto optimal parameters sets in all the three objectives of accurately simulating agricultural water use environmental release and basin unemployment rates the results obtained from the optimization of calibration parameters are summarized in table 3 figure 6 a compares the annual time series of observed discharge with maximum and minimum discharge simulated for gauge number 4 in the calibration period due to strategic location of the doroodzan dam gauge number 4 that is located downstream of this dam has been chosen to calibrate the coupled model fig 6b shows the annual time series of observed discharge of hassanabad kharame gauge number 6 that is the last gauging station before the river enters the bakhtegan lake 3 2 interpreting the inherent sociohydrological dynamics 3 2 1 agricultural demands and discharges agricultural demands corresponding to the five regions of blb in fig 4 that were supplied were used for the socio hydrological model s validation the observed data used in this paper were provided by ghafarijoo et al 2016 the observation data irrigation water requirements for each demand site were determined by considering effective rainfall evapotranspiration and the type of crop cultivated the corresponding observed and simulated annual agricultural water supplies of the five regions are presented in fig 7 the difference between observed and simulated annual agricultural water supplies can be caused by uncertainty in ghafarijoo et al 2016 as well as due to model and parameter uncertainty although the crop patterns were changed in blb corresponding average irrigation water requirements were kept constant and that could have affected the simulated results it is also assumed that agricultural water demand is always met similarly six streamflow gauges not used in calibration were used to assess modeled streamflow in the basin figure 8 shows validation results based on a comparison between observed and simulated discharges at six gauge locations in blb see fig 4 the correlation coefficient r2 between recorded and simulated annual discharges are between 0 99 and 0 73 while the nash sutcliffe efficiency scores are between 0 95 and 0 31 this shows that the coupled model can estimate discharge reasonably well in blb 3 2 2 the unemployment rate migration and population the unemployment rate and population are two other variables that were determined by the coupled model fig 9 a and b show a comparison of simulated basin populations and unemployment rates in the basin respectively the observed values are bracketed by the uncertainty bounds of the simulations corresponding to the pareto optimal parameter sets while the correlation between observed and mean simulated basin employment is low a reasonably high nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 6 indicates that simulated basin unemployment is able to represent variability in the observed unemployment rate well population figures were available only for three years to compare with the simulated results since the population census is conducted every five years nonetheless the observed populations are found to be within the uncertainty bounds of the simulated results as shown in fig 9a due to a lack of unemployment rate data in the blb the unemployment rate of fars province blb is located in this province is used as a proxy this and model uncertainties can be the reason for the discrepancy between the simulated and observed values of the unemployment rate in fig 9b however the variation of the simulated unemployment rate is similar to the observed unemployment rate of iran with nse of 0 6 and r2 of 0 3 the variation in unemployment rate within and outside the basin also reflects in the basin outmigration figure 10 shows the mean simulated migration from 2000 to 2013 the average annual migration from blb to the outside is between two to four thousand which gradually declined for the most part except towards the end of the simulation period the peaks around 2004 and 2013 i e more out migration are noteworthy and correspond to minor revivals of baktegan lake when water was taken away from agriculture and given back to the environment the simulated migration suggests that farmers partly adapted to it by migrating out of the basin 3 2 3 community sensitivity and response the variations in the areal extent of the baktegan lake were processed in gee google earth engine using high resolution landsat 5 7 and 8 images and used to compare with the changes in simulated community response sajedipour et al 2017 also compiled a table shown below table 4 that includes the lake extents as observed by other studies this data is also utilized to validate areal extent computations tabouzadeh et al 2016 utilized a standardized precipitation index for the analysis of drought characteristics in blb and found that droughts occurred during 1999 2001 and 2008 in addition dehghanipour et al 2019 show that according to observed annual precipitation from 1992 to 2013 precipitation in 1999 2000 2001 and 2008 were 40 lower than the average during 2002 2013 in the urmia lake basin gee results show lake extents shrinking around similar times in blb different columns of shaded areas indicate major events in operational water management from left to right 1 drought in 2000 2001 2 community response to revive the lake in 2002 3 transference of national lands to agricultural projects and non agricultural projects from 2005 to 2013 4 mollasadra dam operationalized in 2007 another drought started in 2008 and the sivand dam operationalized in 2009 5 the community responded yet again to revive the lake that was otherwise desiccating as a result of dry conditions and operationalization of the two upstream dams upstream from 2011 to 2012 additionally the years 2003 to 2007 and 2012 to 2013 were non drought periods that witnessed no community response fig 11 shows that after each dry duration in the basin and heightened agricultural water demand see also fig 7 e g 2008 to 2010 the community responded by reducing agricultural water demand and increasing the release of water to the lake equation 6 assumes that a change in community sensitivity is proportional with an opposite sign to a change in the sum of income per capita and ecosystem services relative to the average of past five years hence a significant response towards environmental protection is expected when income per capita in the past five years has remained stable but perhaps at the cost of ecosystem services have severely degraded this can be seen in fig 11 at 2002 and 2011 the community sensitivity begins to dissipate when ecosystem services significantly improves relative to past five years even when income falls this is because ecosystem services degrade to really low levels unlike income per capita before community responds and improvements are made the beliefs and norms of the community as possible drivers of community sensitivity and response change at time scales of generations under ordinary circumstances the period that has been simulated also witnessed some important land use changes and lake desiccations see e g fig 10 based on the calibrated results the model suggests that construction of dams and expansion of agriculture perhaps compounded with droughts led to heightened sensitivity this may have risen faster than under ordinary circumstances leading to responses within the 15 year simulation period also note that community sensitivity equation has a time scale parameter γ v that is calibrated on data this encapsulates whether community sensitivity changes at a faster pace for a given case study calibration shows that the range lies between 7 and 17 years this is within the data length of 15 years meaning that community sensitivity can change within the period mentioned and close to intergenerational time intervals of 20 25 years often considered for changes in norms over generations to further investigate the interpretation of this model with the events and the societal response news from reputable domestic news agencies was examined regarding changes in local water policy the most significant of which appeared on october 26 2011 where the head of the environmental protection agency stated that due to the unauthorized withdrawals and wells that were dug there illegally the environmental protection agency and the ministry of energy followed up and took the necessary measures in this regard he added it was also decided with the follow up of the environmental protection organization that the water required for this lake will be provided through the ministry of energy through dorrodzan dam and it seems that the problem of the second largest salty lake of iran bakhtegan will be resolved head of the environmental protection agency also stated that almost 40 million cubic meters of new water had been released from dorrodzan dam in 2011 to improve the condition of bakhtegan lake he also pointed out that more water should be considered for bakhtegan lake water rights environmental protection organization 2011 this corroborates the interpretation of the sociohydrological model that the community responds to improve environmental quality when faced with extreme degradation and demonstrates the strength of sociohydrological conceptualization provided by roobavannan et al 2017b it can be noted that the annual rainfall in most of the meteorological stations in the bakhtegan basin after the 2008 drought returned back to normal before the drought figure a2 in the supplementary materials although the amount of rainfall observed in 2011 is less than the amount of rainfall reported in most of the stations in 2010 and 2012 satellite images show that the lake area was bigger fig 11 the reason for this is the release of 40 million cubic meters of the doroodzan dam which had been approved by the government and partly shows the impact of water management decisions nasim news 2012 the increased flow in 2011 is also been simulated by the model shown in fig 11 as mentioned earlier kor and sivand rivers have a major role to play in providing water to lake bakhtegan see figs 1 and 3 and the existence of dams on these two rivers indicates that even if rainfall increases decision makers can stop releasing water to the environment and store water in the reservoirs especially after the drought the reservoirs have the capacity to save water figure 1 plots the flow difference between gauge 4 and 6 first drought started in 1999 and lasted till mid 2001 while the second drought occured in 2008 in the first drought the lake level recovery coincided with the recovery of the lake the lake recovery around the second drought period happened with lower than normal water being allocated to agriculture to the downstream agriculture demand centers the doroodzan hasanabad region and near zero water allocated to the agriculture in hasanabad bakhtegan lake region this is indicated by the flow difference from 2009 to 2012 humans particularly governments played an important role in meeting environmental needs by regulating agricultural water and the river flows indeed community response is closely linked to ecosystem services and also lake levels as fig 11 shows however after slight revival the community response went below 0 this is because sustained continued response also depends on the economy of the country which deteriorated after 2012 nonetheless note that the new dams were operationalized in 2007 and 2009 before the spike in community sensitivity in 2011 not after the spike may have also been due to concurrent drought but note that while rainfall recovered to normal levels in 2009 onwards agriculture water demand met remained lower than before 2008 this is shown in the fig 1 the evidence of community response due to heightened community sensitivity in 2011 is that the director general of environmental protection of fars province confirmed that 40 million cubic meters were released from the doroodzan dam and also he said that another 40 million cubic meters were approved and were allocated as environmental water requirements however field visits and local research as well as the model show that the latter allocation was not entirely implemented in the coming years due to weakening of the economy after 2012 tasnimnews 2013 this also corroborates the findings of roobavannan et al 2020 roobavannan et al 2019 that changes in water policy to divert water away from agriculture and to the environment depends on how diversified the economy is critical community sensitivity is a parameter that can be compared to other studies such as elshafei et al 2014 and roobavannan et al 2017a calibrated critical community sensitivity in blb is more than murrumbidgee river basin mrb this means that in blb improving society s economic condition takes priority over improving the environmental condition the time scale of the community sensitivity parameter in blb is shorter than in mrb indicating that communities in blb change their attitudes toward the environment more rapidly since the time scale could be influenced by outside social economic and political factors elshafei et al 2014 accelerated changes in attitude toward the environment in blb could have probably been caused by less stable political factors when compared to mrb in australia furthermore the factor for migration in blb is greater than the mrb indicating that the economy and unemployment rate have a higher impact on migration in blb 4 conclusions this paper focused on interpreting community behavior and its response under changing sociohydrological conditions such as droughts building of dams and the transfer of lands to agriculture in blb in south western iran results interpret that the community responded to the effects of drought and operationalization of dams on the lake by taking water away from agriculture and releasing it to the lake and by controlling the proliferation of unauthorized wells the sociohydrological model presented here provided one interpretation of change in policy that it was due to heightened community sensitivity as a result poor delivery of ecosystem services with a strong economy to support such a decision sociohydrological modeling was used to interpret changes in agriculture water supply unemployment migration and population as the community adapted to changing environmental conditions calibration and validation results showed that the model was successfully able to simulate and interpret such past observations suggesting that it can reliably predict future trajectories of system behavior under changing socio economic conditions although the model developed in this study is well adapted to the blb there were some limitations such as a lack of reliable information and modeling of groundwater resources and changes in crop patterns these limitations can be ameliorated in the future through more observations and additional modeling of the groundwater within the presented socio hydrological model this increase in complexity is necessary to improve the realism of the model and is left to future research in the developed model changing cropping patterns of the past are considered within the corresponding agricultural water demand calculations however there are currently no feedbacks from community sensitivity to crop diversification the only feedback is to how water available is divided between water for agriculture and for environment one way to incorporate the feedback to crop diversification can be to identify a crop mix that maximizes income for farmers for a given allocation of water and available technologies we leave this for future research it should be noted that the model presented is useful for future decision making because all possible solutions such as crop substitution shift to more water efficient technologies and practices migration of farmers other factors that reduce water intake have an impact on the economy of the bakhtegan basin and none of these factors can be considered in isolation and do not necessarily improve environmental conditions on its own for example we can refer to the law on the replacement of rice cultivation by other agricultural products the lack of attention to the price of rice and alternative crops and their impact on people s incomes resulted in the legislation not being implemented using weap as the hydrological model that has the ability to consider different scenarios as well as the ability to consider changing cropping patterns it would be useful for future research to investigate different scenarios of climate change and cropping patterns as inputs developed model can either estimate how much the government should spend on environmental water supply to permanently restore the lake consideration of the climate change scenarios and economic conditions to run the sociohydrological model can give decision makers more accurate results this however was beyond the scope of current

3766,internal seepage erosion of dams is hidden from view and can cause unanticipated dam failure and calamity recognition of dam deformation associated with internal erosion may identify the occurrence of internal erosion and provide early warning to the public on the oncoming failure but quantitative analysis of dam deformation due to internal erosion is currently lacking in this study we formulate the early stage of internal erosion and dam deformation by using a numerical model that couples several aspects of the problem including groundwater flow erosion and transportation of solid particles and deformation of the solid skeleton we apply the model to the teton dam of idaho which failed in 1976 due to internal erosion our simulation shows that the early stage of internal erosion degrades the stiffness of the dam and produces recognizable ground subsidence it increases porosity and permeability and accelerates flow and internal erosion in a positive feedback process the predicted magnitude of the surface deformation of the dam during the early stage of internal erosion ranges from several cm to tens of cm that may be detectable with current land survey and space geodesy detection of such deformation during the early stage of the internal erosion of the dam should provide sufficient early warning to the oncoming failure our result suggests that continuous geodetic monitoring may be an effective measure to detect the occurrence of internal erosion together with an early warning system may help to mitigate dam failure and the loss of life and properties keywords internal seepage erosion hydro mechanical coupling groundwater flow numerical simulation 1 introduction many dam failures follow heavy rains when dams are overtopped by excess flood but some dams also failed by internal seepage erosion balloffet and scheffler 1982 foster et al 2000 foster et al 2002 that often escapes the notice before failure occurs such failure can be particularly catastrophic because it may happen with little warning compared to that during excess flood the recent flood in henan china in july 2021 which caused 302 dead 1 470 800 displaced and 14 million residents in 1616 affected towns was caused by dyke failures due to internal seepage erosion the direct economic loss amounts to 91 billion yuan internal erosion develops due to groundwater seepage which gradually wears down the solid skeleton especially the weak or weathered earth skeleton zhang et al 2013a zhang et al 2013b van beek et al 2015 liang et al 2017 yang et al 2019 thereby degrading the mechanical strength of the solid structure it has been recognized as an important mechanism for dam failure koskinas et al 2019 and is considered as one of the major causes of engineering failures in hydraulic constructions such as dams levees spillways foundations and slopes xu et al 2008 zhang et al 2013a zhang et al 2013b cho 2014 chen et al 2016 talukdar and dey 2019 hagerty 1991a hagerty 1991b marot et al 2007 rochim et al 2017 tejada et al 2017 masoodi et al 2017 masoodi et al 2018 table 1 lists some dam failures caused by seepage erosion interagency committee on dam safety icods 2015 graham 2009 internal erosion in the early stage was concealed from direct observation and when it was noticed on the surface the damage is usually so far in its late stage and proceeds so quickly to the final failure that is too late for mitigation to be implemented see fig 5 this is the main reason why the detection of dam deformation in the early stage of internal erosion is needed for mitigating the disasters related to dam failure hydro mechanical coupling between internal erosion and ground deformation has long been documented in regions that have suffered from hydraulic loading and the corresponding soil response in time bui et al 2019 rousseau et al 2020 shi et al 2020 kodieh et al 2021 quantitative research on internal erosion however has been limited in the coupled processes between fluid flow and particle transport e g hakuno and tarumi 1988 goodarzi et al 2014 cui et al 2016 tang et al 2017 as far as we know our study is the first that couples all the processes including groundwater flow erosion and transport and poroelastic deformation under gravitational load which are required to simulate the structural deformation in the early stage of internal erosion we choose to study the deformation of teten dam in this stage not only because the basic theory of hydro mechanical coupling between porous flow and poroelasticity has a solid physical foundation and is amendable to vigorous quantitative analysis biot 1941 1955 wang 2000 but also because the deformation during this stage may provide a means for early detection and forewarning in particular we show that poroelastic deformation during the early stage of internal erosion is of sufficient magnitude to be detected by surface measurements hence our result may provide the incentives to collect field data for designing early warning systems to mitigate future catastrophic dam collapses hydro poroelastic coupling is evident in the ubiquitous response of groundwater to external loadings such as solid tides and barometric loading e g love 1911 barbour et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b hence it is natural to expect poroelastic deformation of dams to occur in response to internal erosion on the other hand it has so far been neglected in previous studies of dam failure because of the small magnitude of poroelastic deformation a major effort of this work is to formulate the hydraulic and mechanical equations of the coupled processes including groundwater flow erosion and transportation of solid particles and the poroelastic deformation of the remaining solid skeleton during the early stage of internal erosion as the initial seepage flow removes fine particles from the earth structure it degrades the mechanical integrity of the soil matrix and in so doing weakens the dam and cause it to deform under its own weight bonelli et al 2006 bonelli and brivois 2008 golay et al 2011 we apply the model to simulate the early stage of internal erosion and deformation of the teton dam of idaho which collapsed in 1976 due to internal erosion our simulation shows that the poroelastic deformation of the teton dam was of sufficient magnitude to be detectable on the surface and even from space hence our study may provide an incentive for later effort to collect field data for the poroelastic deformation and to develop early warning system for dam failure induced by internal erosion in this study we first summarize the failure of the teton dam in idaho in 1976 one of the most important disasters caused by internal erosion to provide the incentive for this study we then present the major contribution of this work a coupled hydro mechanical formulation of the internal erosion processes and the deformation of the remaining solid structure finally we implement this formulation in comsol s multi physics code to simulate the time dependent evolution of the internal erosion processes of the teton dam and quantitatively examine the progress of surface deformation during the early stage of dam failure and its relation to the progress of internal seepage erosion as far as we know our study is the first one that studies the deformation of a large dam in the early stage of internal erosion our study couples all the important and multi disciplinary processes including groundwater flow erosion particle transport and poroelastic deformation which was not achieved before we hope that it may lead to better understanding of the processes of internal seepage erosion and provide the basis for developing means for early warning of the forthcoming dam failure 2 the 1976 teton dam incident and the occurrence of internal erosion a summary teton dam was constructed between 1972 and 1975 across a steep walled canyon incised by the teton river into a volcanic upland in idaho the dam was approximately 93 m high above the stream bed and about 975 m long at its crest fig 1 the dam centerline was straight over 670 m of its length and curved upstream on the right abutment for the last 230 m upstream slopes were 2 5 1 above elevation 1580 4 m and 3 5 1 below downstream slopes were 2 1 above elevation 1585 m and 3 1 below the crest width was 10 7 m the site of the dam consists primarily of layered and intensely jointed rhyolite with minor inclusions of basalt breccias and welded ash flow tuff the joints are closely spaced open and unfilled with partings commonly of 6 50 mm during construction some very wide fissures and caverns were found in the right abutment where failure eventually occurred with a group of near vertical fissures of 25 915 mm in width during the excavation of the 21 m deep cut off trench to the right of the spillway two extremely large fissures were exposed about 25 m apart the dam core was composed of local loess for the economical efficiency and to favor the use of local materials however this material was not at all suitable for a dam core a post failure investigation shows that it exhibits an incredibly low plasticity index which implies that a tiny change in the water content would have a huge effect on the mechanical properties investigations after the dam failure by both the independent panel to review cause of teton dam failure and the us department teton dam failure review group pointed to the failure started in the right cut off trench where water coming through the rhyolite fissures eroded the compacted loess smalley 1992 two cross sections of teton dam are shown in figs 2 and 3 that are respectively located at the river valley and the right abutment muhunthan and pillai 2008 the dam was filled in five main material zones interior review group 1980 zone 1 was an impervious central core consisting of clayey silts of aeolian origin with low plasticity zone 2 overlying zone 1 consists of material2 that extended downstream to control seepage through the core and the rock foundation zone 3 consists of material3 mainly to ensure the structural stability in the downstream area zone 4 consists of cofferdam fills zone 5 consists of rock fill material from a cutoff trench to protect the outer slope of the dam the canyon walls are composed of a rhyolite welded ashflow tuff near the dam site the exposed wall rocks contained prominent and abundant jointing intersecting each other at high and low angles continuous joints in the right abutment were traced for as much as 61 m most high angle joints have apertures less than 13 mm in width but many have apertures ranging from 100 to 900 mm fig 4 many joints were in filled with erodible material that would soften with reservoir water filling of the reservoir began on october 3 1975 the average rate of water level rise between may 11 and june 5 1976 was 0 9 m per day no sign of seepage of any type was noted at the upstream or downstream face of the dam before june 5 major leaks were discovered in the morning on june 5 which quickly enlarged and rapidly eroded the embankment the dam was breached and the crest of the embankment fell into the water 2 5 h later william eikenberry f et al 1977 extensive onsite investigation following the dam failure show that failure was initiated from a large leak near the right abutment of the dam about 42 m below the crest fig 5 3 modeling internal earth seepage erosion here we formulate the hydraulic and mechanical equations for several coupled processes including groundwater flow internal erosion and transport of solid particles and deformation of the remaining solid skeleton during the early stage of internal erosion and structural deformation 3 1 model description internal erosion is triggered by hydrodynamic forces due to groundwater seepage which erode the fine particles and carry them away a conceptual model is shown in fig 7 to describe the internal erosion process and the transport of fluidized particles from the soil skeleton based on mixture theory we consider the dam body to be composed of three phrases the solid skeleton the pore water and the fluidized solid particles in suspension that moves with water as illustrated in fig 6 we use the subscripts s w and c respectively to denote these phases and the superscript f to denote the mixture of pore water and the fluidized solid particles a list of the symbols used throughout this work and their designations is given in the appendix we adopt a continuum approach in formulating the coupled equations during the early stage of internal erosion and structural deformation and assume that the pore water and the fluidized particles share the same velocity i e v c v w and that this composite fluid is incompressible fig 7 shows the relative volume fractions of a typical earth element at the initial instant t 0 and at an arbitrary current time t during internal erosion some particles in the earth skeleton of the initial volume are mobilized and become part of the fluid vardoulakis et al 1996 vardoulakis et al 2001 papamichos and vardoulakis 2005 fujisawa et al 2010 with these notations we introduce the bulk porosity at the initial time and at an arbitrary current time respectively as 1 ϕ 0 d v 0 f d v 0 ϕ d v t f d v 0 2 ϕ ϕ 0 ε v ϕ er where d v 0 f d v 0 d v t f and d v t denote the initial fluid volume the initial overall volume the current fluid volume and the current overall volume element of an elementary material element respectively ϕ er d v 0 denotes the eroded volume of the earth skeleton ε v divu denotes the change of overall volume by deformation accompanied by fluid influx or outflux and u is the displacement the volume fraction of the mobilized solid particles in the fluid ψ is given by 3 ψ d v t c d v t f d v t c d v t w d v t c where d v t c represents the volume of the fluidized solid particles the apparent bulk densities of the three phases are given by 4a ρ s 1 ϕ ρ s 4b ρ w ϕ 1 ψ ρ w 4c ρ c ϕ ψ ρ s 4d ρ f ρ w ρ c ϕ 1 ψ ρ w ϕ ψ ρ s where for convenience we use the notations ρ a and ρ a to denote the apparent bulk density and the intrinsic density of the component a where a s w c respectively the solid matrix and the fluidized particles also share the same intrinsic density ρ s ρ c whereas ρ f is the apparent density of the fluid mixture internal erosion involves the mass transfer between species s and c and can be expressed in the following relations 5 m w 0 m s m c 0 6 m c m s ρ s ϕ er where m a a s c w is defined as the rate of mass increase of phase a per unit initial overall volume and ϕ er is the rate of the solid volume reduction per unit overall initial volume due to erosion 3 2 constitutive relation of internal erosion we define the erosion rate as the volume of eroded earth particles from unit overall volume of erodible region per unit time and we assume that erosion rate is linearly proportional to the excess of the shear stress τ above the critical shear stress τ c lachouette et al 2008 fujisawa et al 2010 i e 7 i ζ τ τ c where i and ζ denote respectively erosion rate and the erodibility coefficient here we build a model of internal erosion that includes the shear stress τ acting by the pore fluid on the solid skeleton following vardoulakis et al 1996 we assume a critical shear stress τ c that needs to be exceeded to initiate internal erosion once initiated the rate of internal erosion will depend on the bond strength among these solid skeleton grains and the local fluid drag forces and fluid gradient vardoulakis et al 1996 a simplified functional form was given by wang and wan 2004 8 ϕ er t λ 1 ϕ τ τ c where ϕ er t is the rate of earth skeleton reduction due to internal erosion λ is a positive erosion coefficient depending on the hydraulic sensitivity of earth skeleton the sign x is defined x x when x 0 and x 0

represents the pore diameter in the solid skeleton and κ ϕ is the intrinsic permeability of the porous earth skeleton which is a function of porosity ϕ finally we note that the internal erosion of the earth skeleton is an irreversible process i e 10 ϕ er t 0 3 3 mass conservation relation in internal erosion to develop the equation of mass conservation taking into account erosion fig 8 illustrates

flux is v 1 x 1 δ x 1 δ x 2 δ x 3 in direction x 1 in the same way the corresponding out flux in the two other directions are v 2 x 2 δ x 1 δ x 2 δ x 3 and v 3 x 3 δ x 1 δ x 2 δ x 3 respectively the volume of the eroded earth particles per unit time is given by m c ρ s δ x 1 δ x 2 δ x 3 fujisawa et al 2010 internal erosion leads to a decrease of the volume of the earth skeleton and at the same time an increase in the eroded mass note that volume and mass are proportional since we have assumed material incompressibility the relation between these volume fraction combination equation 2 can be

properties because both the independent panel to review cause of teton dam failure 1976 and the us department teton dam failure review group william eikenberry et al 1977 pointed to the failure in the right cut off trench where seepage water coming through the rhyolite fissures eroded the compacted loess smalley 1992 we select a vertical cross section of the teton dam along the right abutment fig 9 for the model configuration and examine how porosity and concentration of fluidized particles change in a continuum process of internal erosion based on the governing equations analysis of physical processes beyond the stage of initial diffused internal erosion is beyond the scope of this discussion in order to facilitate numerical simulation we simplify the geology of the numerical model to seven zones with different material properties with mat1 2 3 and 5 respectively to represent the materials in zone 1 2 3 and 5 in fig 2 mat4 to represent the material in the grout curtain mat6 to represent the material in the basement and mat7 to represent the defective zone of the part of the foundation the material within each zone is treated as homogeneous in the numerical model each assigned with a set of physical parameters in the control equations λ τ c ϕ 0 κ 0 e 0 υ 0 based on the report to u s department of the interior and state of idaho on failure of teton dam and published literature coussy 2004 fujisawa et al 2010 zhang et al 2013a zhang et al 2013b rotunno et al 2019 as listed in table 2 other constants used in the numerical computation include the intrinsic densities of the solid grains and water ρ s 2 600 kg m3 and ρ w 1 000 kg m3 respectively the gravitational acceleration g 9 8 m s2 and the viscosity of water η w 0 001 pa s according to the survey reports and former literatures list the references some defects were present in the trench and in the connection zone between dam filling and bedrock such defects made it easier for erosion to occur and may play an important role in the initiation of the internal erosion in order to characterize the influence of such defects in the initial dam we assign bigger erosion rate values in the cut trench 4 16 10 5 kpa 1s 1 and the defective zone between dam filling and bedrock 3 51 10 5 kpa 1s 1 marked by dashed lines in fig 9 the erosion rate of foundation set the value 4 86 10 11 kpa 1s 1 is far smaller than the value of dam filling consistent with the fact that the foundation is harder to erode than the filling materials due to the water pressure acting on the boundary agf fig 9 seepage mainly begins in the interface region between the foundation and the dam filling 4 2 initial and boundary conditions in our simulation the mechanical behavior of the modeled material is assumed poroelastic pore water pressure is assumed hydrostatic and fluid flow is assumed to obey darcy s flow in order to simplify numerical simulation we also assume that there was no internal erosion at the initial state i e ψ 0 0 the upper boundary abcde of the numerical model fig 9 is under the weight of the dam crest the upper and left downstream boundaries of the model abcdets are considered as a free seepage surface the base of the model opqr is assumed to be impervious and has null displacement the upstream boundary of the model agf is subject to hydrostatic pressure on the left vertical boundary go the hydrostatic pressure and soil lateral pressure are respectively 1616 y γ w and 1597 y γ sat γ w υ 1 υ where γ w and γ sat are the specific weight of water and saturated soil respectively on the right vertical boundary sr the hydrostatic pressure and soil lateral pressure are respectively 1539 5 y γ w and 1539 5 y γ sat γ w υ 1 υ 4 3 simulation and results based on the above described model and model configuration we next simulate the progress of internal erosion of the teton dam fig 9 we simplify the simulation by assuming that the water level is 1616 m at the initial stage from which the internal erosion begins the upper part of the dam is accounted for as surface surcharge acting on the boundary abcde we solve the system of governing equations 28 29 30 and 31 under the assigned boundary conditions using a well proven finite element platform comsol mutiphysics in the simulation internal erosion evolves automatically starting at t 0 given the modeled hydraulic gradient and the corresponding seepage flow section 3 2 in the process both porosity section 3 3 and permeability section 3 4 beneath the dam increase with time increasing permeability leads to greater flow velocity that in turn increases internal erosion and enlarges porosity to cause greater permeability and flow velocity the increased porosity also causes the poroelastic moduli to decrease section 3 5 which promotes ground subsidence under the prevailing gravitational load for the convenience of discussion we artificially divide the computed results into stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 with time steps of respectively 3 8 106 5 8 106 and 8 106 each time step represents one second in real time thus the three stages represent 44 67 and 92 days in real time respectively fig 10 a shows the computed porosity and groundwater flow velocity in the intial condition darker color represents smaller porosity that locates in the zone of grout curtain and core wall coinciding with the values in table 2 with the onset of internal erosion porosity enlarges especially at the downstream face due to a greater flow velocity fig 10 b c and d show the evolution of porosity at the right abutment embankment at the end of the three different stages little internal erosion occurs at the grout curtain since it cuts off the seepage flow on the other hand internal erosion significantly increases porosity in the key trench the downstream face below the elevation 1580 m and the damage zone between the dam filler and the bedrock during the process the arrows in fig 10 represent the velocity of seepage which becomes bigger with the progression of erosion the maximum velocity occurs at the location near the downstream face at elevation of 1580 m the same location where seepage was first discovered on june 5 1976 the highly eroded damage zone between the dam material and bedrock is related to the bigger erosion rate values we assumed earlier on the other hand the rapid enlargement of this eroded zone and the increase in flow velocity shown in our numerical simulation from fig 10b to 10d are the result of a positive feedback process between flow velocity porosity and permeability during the process of internal erosion some eroded solid particles are dragged into the pore water hence we may expect that the concentration of the flowing eroded particles in the seepage flow to correspondingly increase fig 11 a shows that the concentration of the eroded particles is zero at initial stage but it increases with time in fig 11b 11c and 11d especially in the vulnerable zone the results of numerical simulation show that the high concentration of the eroded particles is located in the damage zone between the dam fillings in the right abutment and that the concentration of eroded particles is consistent with the spatial distribution of the porosity shown in fig 10 since the high concentration of the eroded particles is causally related to the enlarged porosity in other words the location of the greatest concentration of the eroded fluidized particles conforms spatially with the greatest increase in porosity the change in the spatial distribution of porosity due to internal erosion will cause a change in the poroelastic modulus and produce a corresponding change in the deformation of the remaining solid structure fig 12 b c d show the progressive degeneration of the poroelastic modulus from that in the initial model fig 12a with the greatest degradation occurring in the region between the dam material and bedrock consistent with the changes of porosity in fig 10 5 discussion the independent panel of teton dam concluded that the dam failed by internal erosion of the core of the dam deep in the key trench with the eroded soil particles exited through channels in and along the interface of the dam with the highly pervious abutment rock and talus all the evidences show that internal erosion due to leakage through the key trench led to the disaster in this particular case as well as many others internal erosion played a main role in causing the dam failure the loess in zone 1 may be impermeable initially but it is prone to internal erosion this sensitive core material deformed by the stress field accentuated by the hydraulic field tends to lose its mechanical integrity as a result internal erosion steps up in the cut off trench and the connection zone between dam fillings and the bedrock our simulation shows that the leakage between the dam fillings and the grout foundation in key trench may have triggered the initial internal erosion as solid particles in the dam are removed by internal erosion the poroelastic modulus of the remaining solid structure deteriorates under the action of gravitation the remaining solid structure progressively deforms fig 13 shows the vertical subsidence of the surface in an enlarged scale along the line abcde in fig 9 at different initial stages of internal erosion it shows that the subsidence across the dam is uneven which reflects the non uniform internal compaction of the dam core under gravity with the greatest subsidence at a given time occurring where the central core of clays and silts has the greatest thickness near the position b it also shows that even in stage 1 the surface subsidence due to internal erosion may reach 20 cm and is of sufficient magnitude for surface detection further diagnosis may be made by examining the spatial and temporal evolution of this deformation pattern hence the result of our study may provide an incentive for the development of early warning system for similar dam failure by internal erosion in the future fig 14 shows the nonlinear increase of porosity and the nonlinear decrease of elastic modulus at the special point n the location where seepage outlet first appeared on the dam surface at the same elevation verified by some witnesses see fig 9 at different stages of internal erosion the red and blue lines show respectively the changes of porosity and elastic modulus with time porosity at point n increased from 0 3 to 0 6 and the elastic modulus degraded from 8 4 mpa to 3 95 mpa which is consistent with the expectation that porosity increases with continued internal erosion that removes soil partcles and reduces the bearing capacity of the remaining earth structure 6 concluding remarks in this study we carry out numerical simulation of the initial stage of hydro mechanically coupled processes in dams including groundwater flow seepage erosion transportation of the eroded particles porosity changes of the solid skeleton and deformation of the solid skeleton adequate constitutive equations are developed and implemented in comsol for the simulation of teton dam failure the results of our simulation allow us to show quantitatively how internal erosion leads to strength degradation that leads to greater deformation our simulation also shows that the surface displacement due to internal erosion during the early stage of internal erosion may be large enough for detection by surface and space technological means it may provide the incentive to develop early warning to the impending failure for the mitigation of the catastrophic damage because the initial stage of internal erosion was neglected in earlier studies we unfortunately cannot compare our results with other works our hope is that this work may generate interest for making precise measurements of surface deformation of newly constructed dams which may be used for validation of models and for the prediction and prevention of future dam failures due to internal erosion structural damage caused by internal seepage erosion is not restricted to dams but can occur beneath other structures where substantial groundwater seepage occurs due perhaps to global warming torrential rain associated with extreme weather has occurred at ever increasing frequency around the globe this may lead to increasing groundwater seepage and internal erosion hence this work may also contribute to detecting other structural damages due to internal erosion the present simulation is only the first step towards an improved understanding of the coupled processes among groundwater flow internal erosion transport and deformation the later stages of internal erosion are important for understanding dam failure we did not simulate the later stages because during these stages of internal erosion groundwater flow becomes turbulent deformation becomes nonlinear and the constitutive relations become largely uncertain such deficiencies must be alleviated before one can take the next step of quantitative simulation and would require a great deal of experimental work and analysis which are beyond the scope

3766,internal seepage erosion of dams is hidden from view and can cause unanticipated dam failure and calamity recognition of dam deformation associated with internal erosion may identify the occurrence of internal erosion and provide early warning to the public on the oncoming failure but quantitative analysis of dam deformation due to internal erosion is currently lacking in this study we formulate the early stage of internal erosion and dam deformation by using a numerical model that couples several aspects of the problem including groundwater flow erosion and transportation of solid particles and deformation of the solid skeleton we apply the model to the teton dam of idaho which failed in 1976 due to internal erosion our simulation shows that the early stage of internal erosion degrades the stiffness of the dam and produces recognizable ground subsidence it increases porosity and permeability and accelerates flow and internal erosion in a positive feedback process the predicted magnitude of the surface deformation of the dam during the early stage of internal erosion ranges from several cm to tens of cm that may be detectable with current land survey and space geodesy detection of such deformation during the early stage of the internal erosion of the dam should provide sufficient early warning to the oncoming failure our result suggests that continuous geodetic monitoring may be an effective measure to detect the occurrence of internal erosion together with an early warning system may help to mitigate dam failure and the loss of life and properties keywords internal seepage erosion hydro mechanical coupling groundwater flow numerical simulation 1 introduction many dam failures follow heavy rains when dams are overtopped by excess flood but some dams also failed by internal seepage erosion balloffet and scheffler 1982 foster et al 2000 foster et al 2002 that often escapes the notice before failure occurs such failure can be particularly catastrophic because it may happen with little warning compared to that during excess flood the recent flood in henan china in july 2021 which caused 302 dead 1 470 800 displaced and 14 million residents in 1616 affected towns was caused by dyke failures due to internal seepage erosion the direct economic loss amounts to 91 billion yuan internal erosion develops due to groundwater seepage which gradually wears down the solid skeleton especially the weak or weathered earth skeleton zhang et al 2013a zhang et al 2013b van beek et al 2015 liang et al 2017 yang et al 2019 thereby degrading the mechanical strength of the solid structure it has been recognized as an important mechanism for dam failure koskinas et al 2019 and is considered as one of the major causes of engineering failures in hydraulic constructions such as dams levees spillways foundations and slopes xu et al 2008 zhang et al 2013a zhang et al 2013b cho 2014 chen et al 2016 talukdar and dey 2019 hagerty 1991a hagerty 1991b marot et al 2007 rochim et al 2017 tejada et al 2017 masoodi et al 2017 masoodi et al 2018 table 1 lists some dam failures caused by seepage erosion interagency committee on dam safety icods 2015 graham 2009 internal erosion in the early stage was concealed from direct observation and when it was noticed on the surface the damage is usually so far in its late stage and proceeds so quickly to the final failure that is too late for mitigation to be implemented see fig 5 this is the main reason why the detection of dam deformation in the early stage of internal erosion is needed for mitigating the disasters related to dam failure hydro mechanical coupling between internal erosion and ground deformation has long been documented in regions that have suffered from hydraulic loading and the corresponding soil response in time bui et al 2019 rousseau et al 2020 shi et al 2020 kodieh et al 2021 quantitative research on internal erosion however has been limited in the coupled processes between fluid flow and particle transport e g hakuno and tarumi 1988 goodarzi et al 2014 cui et al 2016 tang et al 2017 as far as we know our study is the first that couples all the processes including groundwater flow erosion and transport and poroelastic deformation under gravitational load which are required to simulate the structural deformation in the early stage of internal erosion we choose to study the deformation of teten dam in this stage not only because the basic theory of hydro mechanical coupling between porous flow and poroelasticity has a solid physical foundation and is amendable to vigorous quantitative analysis biot 1941 1955 wang 2000 but also because the deformation during this stage may provide a means for early detection and forewarning in particular we show that poroelastic deformation during the early stage of internal erosion is of sufficient magnitude to be detected by surface measurements hence our result may provide the incentives to collect field data for designing early warning systems to mitigate future catastrophic dam collapses hydro poroelastic coupling is evident in the ubiquitous response of groundwater to external loadings such as solid tides and barometric loading e g love 1911 barbour et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b hence it is natural to expect poroelastic deformation of dams to occur in response to internal erosion on the other hand it has so far been neglected in previous studies of dam failure because of the small magnitude of poroelastic deformation a major effort of this work is to formulate the hydraulic and mechanical equations of the coupled processes including groundwater flow erosion and transportation of solid particles and the poroelastic deformation of the remaining solid skeleton during the early stage of internal erosion as the initial seepage flow removes fine particles from the earth structure it degrades the mechanical integrity of the soil matrix and in so doing weakens the dam and cause it to deform under its own weight bonelli et al 2006 bonelli and brivois 2008 golay et al 2011 we apply the model to simulate the early stage of internal erosion and deformation of the teton dam of idaho which collapsed in 1976 due to internal erosion our simulation shows that the poroelastic deformation of the teton dam was of sufficient magnitude to be detectable on the surface and even from space hence our study may provide an incentive for later effort to collect field data for the poroelastic deformation and to develop early warning system for dam failure induced by internal erosion in this study we first summarize the failure of the teton dam in idaho in 1976 one of the most important disasters caused by internal erosion to provide the incentive for this study we then present the major contribution of this work a coupled hydro mechanical formulation of the internal erosion processes and the deformation of the remaining solid structure finally we implement this formulation in comsol s multi physics code to simulate the time dependent evolution of the internal erosion processes of the teton dam and quantitatively examine the progress of surface deformation during the early stage of dam failure and its relation to the progress of internal seepage erosion as far as we know our study is the first one that studies the deformation of a large dam in the early stage of internal erosion our study couples all the important and multi disciplinary processes including groundwater flow erosion particle transport and poroelastic deformation which was not achieved before we hope that it may lead to better understanding of the processes of internal seepage erosion and provide the basis for developing means for early warning of the forthcoming dam failure 2 the 1976 teton dam incident and the occurrence of internal erosion a summary teton dam was constructed between 1972 and 1975 across a steep walled canyon incised by the teton river into a volcanic upland in idaho the dam was approximately 93 m high above the stream bed and about 975 m long at its crest fig 1 the dam centerline was straight over 670 m of its length and curved upstream on the right abutment for the last 230 m upstream slopes were 2 5 1 above elevation 1580 4 m and 3 5 1 below downstream slopes were 2 1 above elevation 1585 m and 3 1 below the crest width was 10 7 m the site of the dam consists primarily of layered and intensely jointed rhyolite with minor inclusions of basalt breccias and welded ash flow tuff the joints are closely spaced open and unfilled with partings commonly of 6 50 mm during construction some very wide fissures and caverns were found in the right abutment where failure eventually occurred with a group of near vertical fissures of 25 915 mm in width during the excavation of the 21 m deep cut off trench to the right of the spillway two extremely large fissures were exposed about 25 m apart the dam core was composed of local loess for the economical efficiency and to favor the use of local materials however this material was not at all suitable for a dam core a post failure investigation shows that it exhibits an incredibly low plasticity index which implies that a tiny change in the water content would have a huge effect on the mechanical properties investigations after the dam failure by both the independent panel to review cause of teton dam failure and the us department teton dam failure review group pointed to the failure started in the right cut off trench where water coming through the rhyolite fissures eroded the compacted loess smalley 1992 two cross sections of teton dam are shown in figs 2 and 3 that are respectively located at the river valley and the right abutment muhunthan and pillai 2008 the dam was filled in five main material zones interior review group 1980 zone 1 was an impervious central core consisting of clayey silts of aeolian origin with low plasticity zone 2 overlying zone 1 consists of material2 that extended downstream to control seepage through the core and the rock foundation zone 3 consists of material3 mainly to ensure the structural stability in the downstream area zone 4 consists of cofferdam fills zone 5 consists of rock fill material from a cutoff trench to protect the outer slope of the dam the canyon walls are composed of a rhyolite welded ashflow tuff near the dam site the exposed wall rocks contained prominent and abundant jointing intersecting each other at high and low angles continuous joints in the right abutment were traced for as much as 61 m most high angle joints have apertures less than 13 mm in width but many have apertures ranging from 100 to 900 mm fig 4 many joints were in filled with erodible material that would soften with reservoir water filling of the reservoir began on october 3 1975 the average rate of water level rise between may 11 and june 5 1976 was 0 9 m per day no sign of seepage of any type was noted at the upstream or downstream face of the dam before june 5 major leaks were discovered in the morning on june 5 which quickly enlarged and rapidly eroded the embankment the dam was breached and the crest of the embankment fell into the water 2 5 h later william eikenberry f et al 1977 extensive onsite investigation following the dam failure show that failure was initiated from a large leak near the right abutment of the dam about 42 m below the crest fig 5 3 modeling internal earth seepage erosion here we formulate the hydraulic and mechanical equations for several coupled processes including groundwater flow internal erosion and transport of solid particles and deformation of the remaining solid skeleton during the early stage of internal erosion and structural deformation 3 1 model description internal erosion is triggered by hydrodynamic forces due to groundwater seepage which erode the fine particles and carry them away a conceptual model is shown in fig 7 to describe the internal erosion process and the transport of fluidized particles from the soil skeleton based on mixture theory we consider the dam body to be composed of three phrases the solid skeleton the pore water and the fluidized solid particles in suspension that moves with water as illustrated in fig 6 we use the subscripts s w and c respectively to denote these phases and the superscript f to denote the mixture of pore water and the fluidized solid particles a list of the symbols used throughout this work and their designations is given in the appendix we adopt a continuum approach in formulating the coupled equations during the early stage of internal erosion and structural deformation and assume that the pore water and the fluidized particles share the same velocity i e v c v w and that this composite fluid is incompressible fig 7 shows the relative volume fractions of a typical earth element at the initial instant t 0 and at an arbitrary current time t during internal erosion some particles in the earth skeleton of the initial volume are mobilized and become part of the fluid vardoulakis et al 1996 vardoulakis et al 2001 papamichos and vardoulakis 2005 fujisawa et al 2010 with these notations we introduce the bulk porosity at the initial time and at an arbitrary current time respectively as 1 ϕ 0 d v 0 f d v 0 ϕ d v t f d v 0 2 ϕ ϕ 0 ε v ϕ er where d v 0 f d v 0 d v t f and d v t denote the initial fluid volume the initial overall volume the current fluid volume and the current overall volume element of an elementary material element respectively ϕ er d v 0 denotes the eroded volume of the earth skeleton ε v divu denotes the change of overall volume by deformation accompanied by fluid influx or outflux and u is the displacement the volume fraction of the mobilized solid particles in the fluid ψ is given by 3 ψ d v t c d v t f d v t c d v t w d v t c where d v t c represents the volume of the fluidized solid particles the apparent bulk densities of the three phases are given by 4a ρ s 1 ϕ ρ s 4b ρ w ϕ 1 ψ ρ w 4c ρ c ϕ ψ ρ s 4d ρ f ρ w ρ c ϕ 1 ψ ρ w ϕ ψ ρ s where for convenience we use the notations ρ a and ρ a to denote the apparent bulk density and the intrinsic density of the component a where a s w c respectively the solid matrix and the fluidized particles also share the same intrinsic density ρ s ρ c whereas ρ f is the apparent density of the fluid mixture internal erosion involves the mass transfer between species s and c and can be expressed in the following relations 5 m w 0 m s m c 0 6 m

due to erosion 3 2 constitutive relation of internal erosion we define the erosion rate as the volume of eroded earth particles from unit overall volume of erodible region per unit time and we assume that erosion rate is linearly proportional to the excess of the shear stress τ above the critical shear stress τ c lachouette et al 2008 fujisawa et al 2010 i e 7 i ζ τ τ c where i and ζ denote respectively erosion rate and the erodibility coefficient here we build a model of internal erosion that includes the shear stress τ acting by the pore fluid on the solid skeleton following vardoulakis et al 1996 we assume a critical shear stress τ c that needs to be exceeded to initiate internal erosion once initiated the rate of internal erosion will depend on the bond strength among these solid skeleton grains and the local fluid drag forces and fluid gradient vardoulakis et al 1996 a simplified functional form was given by wang and wan 2004 8 ϕ er t λ 1 ϕ τ τ c where ϕ er t is the rate of earth skeleton reduction due to internal erosion λ is a positive erosion coefficient depending on the hydraulic sensitivity of earth skeleton the sign x is defined x x when x 0 and x 0 when x 0 the shear stress τ exerting on the solid skeleton can be expressed as reddi et al 2000 9 τ ρ f g i d r 4 d r 4 2 κ ϕ ϕ where i is the normalized piezometric gradient i e p f ρ f g ρ f g d r represents the pore diameter in the solid skeleton and κ ϕ is the intrinsic permeability of the porous earth skeleton which is a function of porosity ϕ finally we note that the internal erosion of the earth skeleton is an irreversible process i e 10 ϕ er t 0 3 3 mass conservation relation in internal erosion to develop the equation of mass conservation taking into account erosion fig 8 illustrates the volumetric balance of pore fluid within an infinitesimal elementary volume δ x 1 δ x 2 δ x 3 with outer surfaces normal to the three directions x 1 x 2 and x 3 of the cartesian coordinate system v 1 v 2 and v 3 denote the corresponding components of the flow velocity of the pore fluid here we only show the analysis in the x 1 direction the analyses in the other two directions are the same the pore fluid enters and leaves the infinitesimal volume element at the rate of v 1 δ x 2 δ x 3 and v 1 δ x 2 δ x 3 v 1 x 1 δ x 1 δ x 2 δ x 3 respectively so the net rate of pore fluid volumetric out flux is v 1 x 1 δ x 1 δ x 2 δ x 3 in direction x 1 in the same way the corresponding out flux in the two other directions are v 2 x 2 δ x 1 δ x 2 δ x 3 and v 3 x 3 δ x 1 δ x 2 δ x 3 respectively the volume of the eroded earth particles per unit time is given by m c ρ s δ x 1 δ x 2 δ x 3 fujisawa et al 2010 internal erosion leads to a decrease of the volume of the earth skeleton and at the same time an increase in the eroded mass note that volume and mass are proportional since we have assumed material incompressibility the relation between these volume fraction combination equation 2 can be given 11 ϕ t ϕ er t v 12 ϕ er t m c ρ s during the process of the fluid flowing in and out the element volume the volume of eroded earth particles within the pore fluid also changes the volume of such

intrinsic permeability is a symmetric definite positive tensor for anisotropic media in our case we will assume isotropic behavior in order to simply in that case the intrinsic permeability is a

skeleton deformation may be described by the linear isotropic poroelasticity 19 σ c e ε where c e is the elastic modulus matrix 20 c e k ii ii 2 g ii 1 3 ii ii 21 ii ijkl 1 2 δ ik δ jl δ il δ jk where

simulate a sand erosion experiment appendix 1 the results show close agreement with a published simulation papamichos and vardoulakis 2005 4 numerical simulation 4 1 model configuration and material properties because both the independent panel to review cause of teton dam failure 1976 and the us department teton dam failure review group william eikenberry et al 1977 pointed to the failure in the right cut off trench where seepage water coming through the rhyolite fissures eroded the compacted loess smalley 1992 we select a vertical cross section of the teton dam along the right abutment fig 9 for the model configuration and examine how porosity and concentration of fluidized particles change in a continuum process of internal erosion based on the governing equations analysis of physical processes beyond the stage of initial diffused internal erosion is beyond the scope of this discussion in order to facilitate numerical simulation we simplify the geology of the numerical model to seven zones with different material properties with mat1 2 3 and 5 respectively to represent the materials in zone 1 2 3 and 5 in fig 2 mat4 to represent the material in the grout curtain mat6 to represent the material in the basement and mat7 to represent the defective zone of the part of the foundation the material within each zone is treated as homogeneous in the numerical model each assigned with a set of physical parameters in the control equations λ τ c ϕ 0 κ 0 e 0 υ 0 based on the report to u s department of the interior and state of idaho on failure of teton dam and published literature coussy 2004 fujisawa et al 2010 zhang et al 2013a zhang et al 2013b rotunno et al 2019 as listed in table 2 other constants used in the numerical computation include the intrinsic densities of the solid grains and water ρ s 2 600 kg m3 and ρ w 1 000 kg m3 respectively the gravitational acceleration g 9 8 m s2 and the viscosity of water η w 0 001 pa s according to the survey reports and former literatures list the references some defects were present in the trench and in the connection zone between dam filling and bedrock such defects made it easier for erosion to occur and may play an important role in the initiation of the internal erosion in order to characterize the influence of such defects in the initial dam we assign bigger erosion rate values in the cut trench 4 16 10 5 kpa 1s 1 and the defective zone between dam filling and bedrock 3 51 10 5 kpa 1s 1 marked by dashed lines in fig 9 the erosion rate of foundation set the value 4 86 10 11 kpa 1s 1 is far smaller than the value of dam filling consistent with the fact that the foundation is harder to erode than the filling materials due to the water pressure acting on the boundary agf fig 9 seepage mainly begins in the interface region between the foundation and the dam filling 4 2 initial and boundary conditions in our simulation the mechanical behavior of the modeled material is assumed poroelastic pore water pressure is assumed hydrostatic and fluid flow is assumed to obey darcy s flow in order to simplify numerical simulation we also assume that there was no internal erosion at the initial state i e ψ 0 0 the upper boundary abcde of the numerical model fig 9 is under the weight of the dam crest the upper and left downstream boundaries of the model abcdets are considered as a free seepage surface the base of the model opqr is assumed to be impervious and has null displacement the upstream boundary of the model agf is subject to hydrostatic pressure on the left vertical boundary go the hydrostatic pressure and soil lateral pressure are respectively 1616 y γ w and 1597 y γ sat γ w υ 1 υ where γ w and γ sat are the specific weight of water and saturated soil respectively on the right vertical boundary sr the hydrostatic pressure and soil lateral pressure are respectively 1539 5 y γ w and 1539 5 y γ sat γ w υ 1 υ 4 3 simulation and results based on the above described model and model configuration we next simulate the progress of internal erosion of the teton dam fig 9 we simplify the simulation by assuming that the water level is 1616 m at the initial stage from which the internal erosion begins the upper part of the dam is accounted for as surface surcharge acting on the boundary abcde we solve the system of governing equations 28 29 30 and 31 under the assigned boundary conditions using a well proven finite element platform comsol mutiphysics in the simulation internal erosion evolves automatically starting at t 0 given the modeled hydraulic gradient and the corresponding seepage flow section 3 2 in the process both porosity section 3 3 and permeability section 3 4 beneath the dam increase with time increasing permeability leads to greater flow velocity that in turn increases internal erosion and enlarges porosity to cause greater permeability and flow velocity the increased porosity also causes the poroelastic moduli to decrease section 3 5 which promotes ground subsidence under the prevailing gravitational load for the convenience of discussion we artificially divide the computed results into stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 with time steps of respectively 3 8 106 5 8 106 and 8 106 each time step represents one second in real time thus the three stages represent 44 67 and 92 days in real time respectively fig 10 a shows the computed porosity and groundwater flow velocity in the intial condition darker color represents smaller porosity that locates in the zone of grout curtain and core wall coinciding with the values in table 2 with the onset of internal erosion porosity enlarges especially at the downstream face due to a greater flow velocity fig 10 b c and d show the evolution of porosity at the right abutment embankment at the end of the three different stages little internal erosion occurs at the grout curtain since it cuts off the seepage flow on the other hand internal erosion significantly increases porosity in the key trench the downstream face below the elevation 1580 m and the damage zone between the dam filler and the bedrock during the process the arrows in fig 10 represent the velocity of seepage which becomes bigger with the progression of erosion the maximum velocity occurs at the location near the downstream face at elevation of 1580 m the same location where seepage was first discovered on june 5 1976 the highly eroded damage zone between the dam material and bedrock is related to the bigger erosion rate values we assumed earlier on the other hand the rapid enlargement of this eroded zone and the increase in flow velocity shown in our numerical simulation from fig 10b to 10d are the result of a positive feedback process between flow velocity porosity and permeability during the process of internal erosion some eroded solid particles are dragged into the pore water hence we may expect that the concentration of the flowing eroded particles in the seepage flow to correspondingly increase fig 11 a shows that the concentration of the eroded particles is zero at initial stage but it increases with time in fig 11b 11c and 11d especially in the vulnerable zone the results of numerical simulation show that the high concentration of the eroded particles is located in the damage zone between the dam fillings in the right abutment and that the concentration of eroded particles is consistent with the spatial distribution of the porosity shown in fig 10 since the high concentration of the eroded particles is causally related to the enlarged porosity in other words the location of the greatest concentration of the eroded fluidized particles conforms spatially with the greatest increase in porosity the change in the spatial distribution of porosity due to internal erosion will cause a change in the poroelastic modulus and produce a corresponding change in the deformation of the remaining solid structure fig 12 b c d show the progressive degeneration of the poroelastic modulus from that in the initial model fig 12a with the greatest degradation occurring in the region between the dam material and bedrock consistent with the changes of porosity in fig 10 5 discussion the independent panel of teton dam concluded that the dam failed by internal erosion of the core of the dam deep in the key trench with the eroded soil particles exited through channels in and along the interface of the dam with the highly pervious abutment rock and talus all the evidences show that internal erosion due to leakage through the key trench led to the disaster in this particular case as well as many others internal erosion played a main role in causing the dam failure the loess in zone 1 may be impermeable initially but it is prone to internal erosion this sensitive core material deformed by the stress field accentuated by the hydraulic field tends to lose its mechanical integrity as a result internal erosion steps up in the cut off trench and the connection zone between dam fillings and the bedrock our simulation shows that the leakage between the dam fillings and the grout foundation in key trench may have triggered the initial internal erosion as solid particles in the dam are removed by internal erosion the poroelastic modulus of the remaining solid structure deteriorates under the action of gravitation the remaining solid structure progressively deforms fig 13 shows the vertical subsidence of the surface in an enlarged scale along the line abcde in fig 9 at different initial stages of internal erosion it shows that the subsidence across the dam is uneven which reflects the non uniform internal compaction of the dam core under gravity with the greatest subsidence at a given time occurring where the central core of clays and silts has the greatest thickness near the position b it also shows that even in stage 1 the surface subsidence due to internal erosion may reach 20 cm and is of sufficient magnitude for surface detection further diagnosis may be made by examining the spatial and temporal evolution of this deformation pattern hence the result of our study may provide an incentive for the development of early warning system for similar dam failure by internal erosion in the future fig 14 shows the nonlinear increase of porosity and the nonlinear decrease of elastic modulus at the special point n the location where seepage outlet first appeared on the dam surface at the same elevation verified by some witnesses see fig 9 at different stages of internal erosion the red and blue lines show respectively the changes of porosity and elastic modulus with time porosity at point n increased from 0 3 to 0 6 and the elastic modulus degraded from 8 4 mpa to 3 95 mpa which is consistent with the expectation that porosity increases with continued internal erosion that removes soil partcles and reduces the bearing capacity of the remaining earth structure 6 concluding remarks in this study we carry out numerical simulation of the initial stage of hydro mechanically coupled processes in dams including groundwater flow seepage erosion transportation of the eroded particles porosity changes of the solid skeleton and deformation of the solid skeleton adequate constitutive equations are developed and implemented in comsol for the simulation of teton dam failure the results of our simulation allow us to show quantitatively how internal erosion leads to strength degradation that leads to greater deformation our simulation also shows that the surface displacement due to internal erosion during the early stage of internal erosion may be large enough for detection by surface and space technological means it may provide the incentive to develop early warning to the impending failure for the mitigation of the catastrophic damage because the initial stage of internal erosion was neglected in earlier studies we unfortunately cannot compare our results with other works our hope is that this work may generate interest for making precise measurements of surface deformation of newly constructed dams which may be used for validation of models and for the prediction and prevention of future dam failures due to internal erosion structural damage caused by internal seepage erosion is not restricted to dams but can occur beneath other structures where substantial groundwater seepage occurs due perhaps to global warming torrential rain associated with extreme weather has occurred at ever increasing frequency around the globe this may lead to increasing groundwater seepage and internal erosion hence this work may also contribute to detecting other structural damages due to internal erosion the present simulation is only the first step towards an improved understanding of the coupled processes among groundwater flow internal erosion transport and deformation the later stages of internal erosion are important for understanding dam failure we did not simulate the later stages because during these stages of internal erosion groundwater flow becomes turbulent deformation becomes nonlinear and the constitutive relations become largely uncertain such deficiencies must be alleviated before one can take the next step of quantitative simulation and would require a great deal of experimental work and analysis which are beyond the scope

3767,high concentration occurrence probability estimation models was developed to estimate 238u and 222rn in groundwater using in situ monitoring data i e geological rock types well depth t ph eh ec do and hco3 the estimation models are based on a non linear data driven method to improve their effectiveness for applications in different estimation cases using various in situ monitoring data when developing the models most sensitive in situ monitoring data are selectively utilized to train the models where various statistical and correlation analyses are applied to overcome challenges including model overfitting during training a highly nonlinear correlation between input and target variables and poor training due to low quality monitoring data based on statistical analysis results all input variables except for eh and well depth are used for developing the 238u and 222rn estimation models respectively actual data collected from groundwater quality monitoring networks of south korea from 2007 to 2019 are used to validate the developed models although it is difficult to characterize 222rn occurrence using the geochemical conditions of groundwater because the gaseous phase behavior of 222rn highly depends on structural geology the 222rn estimation model achieves reasonable performance with more than 70 accuracy in addition compared to the 222rn estimation model the 238u estimation model achieves higher classification accuracy with approximately 80 consequently we can confirm that the developed estimation models can be effectively used to estimate the probability of high concentration risk of 238u and 222rn in groundwater conclusively the practical applicability of the developed models is wide as the models have been developed using direct observable and real time data keywords naturally occuring radioactive materials norms groundwater sensitivity analysis data driven model in situ monitoring 1 introduction groundwater is a major source of freshwater almost half of the world s drinking water comes from groundwater zektser and everett 2004 unesco world s 2012 approximately 51 of groundwater serves as drinking and living domestic water in korea and the use of groundwater has increased lee and kwon 2016 however groundwater is one of the vulnerable resources to naturally occurring radioactive materials norms dissolved by groundwater rock interactions that contribute to significant bio environmental problems in groundwater consumption martins et al 2019 among norms 238u and 222rn which is a daughter of 238u are the main sources of public exposure to natural radiation with rn contributing approximately 50 of the global effective dose to the public ramola et al 2016 dinh chau et al 2011 these radionuclides are recognized as more of a concern because they can naturally accumulate in groundwater under different physicochemical conditions zapecza and szabo 1986 unscear 2008 the ingestion of groundwater containing even low level uranium concentrations causes chronic kidney malfunction and bone toxicity brugge and buchner 2011 kurttio et al 2005 in particular radon causes more severe health damage through inhalation such as lung cancer so using groundwater in a small sealed room such as boiling underground water in a kitchen and taking a shower in a bathroom may increase the risk of inhaling radon therefore knowledge of concentration levels spatial distribution and sources of uranium and radon in groundwater has been extensively studied to ensure environmentally safe and sustainable groundwater resources skeppström and olofsson 2006 to date numerous studies have focused on the spatial distribution of norms in groundwater using water quality data e g temperature ph electric conductivity ec oxidation reduction potential eh dissolved oxygen do and dissolved ions although these studies provided valuable information on the occurrence release and movement of norms in groundwater environments isam salih et al

particular the acquisition of groundwater quality data is time consuming because it is mostly based on laboratory analyses only a few studies have tried to develop more in situ practical and efficient methods for example haghani et al 2020 proposed an indoor radon concentration estimation model using a regression method with measurable in situ data ciotoli et al 2017 developed a geogenic radon potential map based on weighted regression using relevant geological data and a high level of indoor radon concentration most of these methods are models for estimating indoor radon concentrations while groundwater radon and uranium risk estimation models based on in situ data have not been studied the development of in situ norm estimation models in groundwater improves water safety for the public this study aimed to develop high concentration risk estimation models for norms particularly 238u and 222rn in groundwater using in situ groundwater quality monitoring data the estimation models were developed using a non linear data driven method random forest rf model in this study to improve their effectiveness in different estimation applications using various in situ monitoring data in addition individual monitoring data were analyzed in terms of their relative importance to norm risk estimation where a newly proposed principal component analysis pca based correlation analysis was used to address erroneous correlation results due to low quality monitoring data norm concentrations in situ groundwater quality monitoring data and geological information were used to validate the proposed estimation models in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater data acquisition groundwater data were collected nationwide at a total of 5 272 groundwater wells of south korea 2007 to 2019 and 4 374 samples were selected for data analysis after preprocessing approximately 90 of the sampling wells supply drinking water while the remaining 10 provide water for residential and agricultural use the general bedrock composition of south korea was 35 9 granitic g 6 1 metamorphic m 20 5 gneissic metamorphic gm 18 8 sedimentary s 2 5 volcanic v rocks and 16 2 alluvial deposits based on the gis database in this study the geological rock type applied to data analysis was determined by confirming the rock type at each sampling well groundwater was pumped for at least 5 10 min before sampling procedures were conducted to remove stagnant groundwater from the wells and filtered using 0 45 µm acetate membrane filters whatman hercules us for uranium analysis groundwater samples were immediately acidified below ph 2 by adding 0 1 n nitric acid to prevent precipitation and adsorption to the container walls smedley et al 2006 these samples were stored in the dark at 4 c before laboratory analyses temperature ph eh do and salinity were measured using a multi parameter water quality meter professional plus ysi inc us at each well a 0 05 n hcl titration method was used to determine the alkalinity onsite because laboratory measurements after 12 h from sampling results in a relatively high error in the charge balance hindshaw et al 2011 turbidity

us after the groundwater was fully sampled into a 250 ml glass bottle without headspace 222rn was extracted from the water by continuous recirculation of air in a closed loop until it reached equilibrium each measurement comprises 4 cycles every 5 min and average values were used to evaluate 222rn radioactivity in the groundwater samples the aqueous concentration of total uranium 238u was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy agilent 7500 series us in a laboratory the detection limit of 238u that was determined through a linear calibration line was 0 1 mg l 1 with greater than 95 confidence level 2 2 data analysis method bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to evaluate the correlation between the norms and other measurements i e geological rock type well depth t ph eh ec do and hco3 before developing the high concentration risk estimation model for the norms for implementation the trend of the proportion of geological rock type corresponding to a specific quantile of norm was calculated where a decile was used to consider a sufficient amount of data for statistical inference for each decile more than 400 samples for each decile statistics for statistical analysis of other data a slightly modified pca was used to evaluate the bivariate correlation between the norms and continuous variables by considering the relationship of variables in multivariate data space relative pc based correlation consequently the statistical analysis results were considered to develop the high concentration risk estimation model

clear correlations between the norms and the other monitoring data shin et al 2016 as shown in table 2 the majority of the correlation coefficients are not evident compared to the standard values that are regarded as follows 0 0 2 as very weak 0 2 0 4 as weak 0 4 0 6 as moderate 0 6 0 8 as strong and 0 8 1 as very strong although the relation between eh and hco3 shows only a strong positive

222rn occurrence probabilities based on these results 3 1 2 2 relative pc based correlation the relative magnitude of the correlation between the two variables calculated based on a relative pc based correlation analysis method is presented in table 3 showing the relation between the in situ monitoring data and 238u and 222rn where the details on the relative pc based correlation analysis method in this study are in supporting information the majority of the in situ monitoring data except for eh correlates with 238u indicating a relatively high positive correlation with hco3 and ec followed by well depth and ph data meanwhile t shows a weak negative correlation with u 238u occurrence can have positive correlations with major ions e g ca2 f and hco3 of groundwater that was represented by the ec parameter shin et al 2016 cho and choo 2019 for example one of the predominant uranium species is the uranyl carbonate complex in a typical groundwater environment ph 6 to 8 in contrast the relation between the in situ monitoring data and 222rn is opposite to that between the data and 238u except for the relationship with well depth and t table 3 the magnitude of the relationship between well depth and 222rn is negligible compared to that between well depth and 238u while the effect of t on 222rn concentration is higher than on 238u the higher relativity between t and 222rn is due to the more sensitive solubility of radon in water than uranium because radon is a gas phase 3 2 performance of the high concentration risk estimation model for norms 3 2 1 estimation model development in developing the estimation model norm concentrations were used as output variables response variables to be estimated using different input variables explanatory variables in particular the probabilities of high concentration norm occurrence were estimated therefore norm concentration was transformed to be binary outcomes comprising 0 and 1 values one hot encoding where data of concentrations lower than the corresponding threshold limit value tlv changed to 01 while data of concentrations higher than the corresponding tlv changed to 10 for 238u and 222rn 30 μ g l and 100 bq l were considered as tlvs respectively the tlvs used in this study are referenced from a report by world health organization who 2009 although 150 bq l for 222rn concentration is recommended as a threshold in the who report the tlv of 222rn concentration in this study was conservatively defined by 100 bq l seven types of in situ measurements well depth t ph eh ec do and hco3 and five types of geological rocks g v m gm and s were considered input variables to estimate the occurrence probabilities of high concentration risk of norms output variables since the input variables comprised both continuous i e the in situ measurements and categorical variables i e the geological rock types the geological rock types were considered dummy variables to concurrently use the two variable types as input variables among the rock types g is highly correlated to norms with a relatively high occurrence probability on a high concentration of norms fig 1 therefore in this study g was set to be a basis dummy variable four input variables were prepared to represent the five rock types one hot encoding was used to prepare the input variables representing the rock types g 0 0 0 0 v 1 0 0 0 m 0 1 0 0 gm 0 0 1 0 and s 0 0 0 1 for the remaining input variables i e well depth t ph eh ec do and hco3 min max scaling was used to standardize the variables within a range of 0 to 1 for the total data in this study the amount of data exceeding the tlvs of the norms is substantially lower than that of data not exceeding the tlvs where data exceeding the tlv of 238u and 222rn are 7 98 and 27 9 of the total data respectively the imbalance in the exceeding and not exceeding data of the training dataset results in biased estimation because of unequal training toward the data with a higher percentage of total training data i e an overfitting problem this problem was solved by equalizing the amount of data between the not exceeding data to the exceeding class using over or under sampling techniques fernández et al 2018 the over sampling is to generate the new samples using the statistical method for the original training dataset while the under sampling is a method to keep the number of samples between the classes by randomly selecting the data from a class group with a large number of dataset in this study an amount of the not exceeding data was randomly selected using the under sampling technique instead of over sampling technique because of the data uncertainty of the actual field data caused from malfunction of monitoring device operating process error miss recording etc the under sampling can alleviate the imbalance problem in the dataset but it might increase the uncertainty of the trained model by discarding the important samples therefore to prevent performance bias using partial part of the not exceeding data in model training multiple estimation evaluations with randomly selected not exceeding training data were performed making it possible to evaluate the general performance of the estimation model in this study a total of 100 estimations were performed with different combinations of training and testing datasets for the estimation models for 238u and 222rn 80 of the total data were used as the training dataset for training the models and the remaining 20 was used as the testing dataset for validating the trained estimation models in addition to prevent the estimation models from overfitting to the training dataset 10 of the training dataset was used as a validation dataset when composing the training and testing datasets by random selection the data from nearby locations can be used for cross validation of the models which consequently might lead to over optimistic estimation performance roberts et al 2017 in this study although the multiple cross validation datasets were composed to alleviate this effect further test on the validation dataset considering spatial autocorrelation of the data might be needed in the global view of the training purpose the training of the rf models was implemented to reduce the root mean squared error between the estimated probability of the target and actual labels i e 01 or 10 where each decision tree composing the rf model was optimized by a greedy algorithm using splitting criterion e g gini impurity for the training data more details on the training algorithm of the decision tree are not included in this manuscript but it can be found in quinlan 1986 the stopping tolerance was set to be sufficiently small but excessively small values were intentionally avoided for regularization the performance of the rf model depends on several hyperparameters e g no of trees no of features that are used in each split and no of leaves of each tree in this study grid search based trial and error methods were used to determine the optimal hyperparameters of the model the model was coded using python 3 5 and scikit learn 0 22 2 the hardware used for training and estimation was equipped with an intel xeon 2 69 ghz cpu 48 cores and two sockets 128 gb memory and a microsoft windows 10 operating system 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis for the rf estimation model before developing the estimation model the proposed model was validated by evaluating the explainability of the proposed model on the relationship between the norms and the high correlated input variables that were confirmed using the relative pc based correlation analysis in the previous section to this end the correlation result was additionally validated by sensitivity analysis sa for rf estimation results that provide the relative impact of each input variable i e well depth t ph eh ec do and hco3 on the estimation performance sa was used on the trained 238u and 222rn estimation models using all types of input variables in this study we used a perturbation method scardi and harding 1999 which evaluates the contribution of small changes in each input variable to the model output under the condition that all other input variables remain constant this method evaluates the degrees of perturbation of output variables according to a change in respective input variables where the input variable causing the largest change in the output variables is the one that is the most influential each input variable was randomly changed with values ranging from 0 to 1 table 4 presents the sensitivity of individual input variables for 238u and 222rn concentration estimation for the estimation result of the 238u estimation model the case corresponding to the eh has the highest classification accuracy 76 44 which means that eh has the lowest correlation with 238u concentration meanwhile t and hco3 have a relatively high correlation with 238u occurrence and others well depth ph ec and do show a moderate correlation for the 222rn estimation model a high correlation with ph ec and hco3 60 33 61 55 and 63 39 of classification accuracy respectively was observed and a relatively lower correlation with well depth eh and do 69 94 68 92 and 69 74 of classification accuracy respectively all these facts correspond to the relative pc based correlation analysis results in table 3 which validate the proposed estimation model in this study by considering both the correlation and sa results the relatively effective input variables for developing the high concentration risk estimation model for norms were identified consequently in this study the input variables except eh and well depth were used for developing the estimation models of 238u and 222rn respectively the performance validation results of the developed models are discussed in the next section 3 2 3 performance of the estimation model for the probability of exceeding the tlv fig 2 a and 2 b show 100 estimation results obtained by testing the trained 238u and 222rn estimation models respectively with the prepared test datasets where eh and well depth data were excluded as input variables for both 238u and 222rn estimation models the optimal hyperparameters for each model of 238u and 222rn concentration in table 5 where each item from the upper indicates the number of trees in the single random forest the maximum number of variables considered for splitting a node the maximum number of levels in each decision tree the maximum number of leaf nodes and the splitting criterion respectively in the figures the x axis represents the estimated probability of exceeding the tlvs of 238u and 222rn concentrations the y axis represents the actual concentration the red solid line indicates the tlv of each norm 30 μ g l for 238u and 100 bq l for 222rn the blue solid line represents 0 5 probability of exceeding the tlvs according to the quadrant comprising the red and blue solid lines in the figures the data points in the first and third quadrants 1st q and 3rd q in fig 1 represent correct classification results while the second and fourth quadrants 2nd q and 4th q represent incorrect classification results specifically considering the environmental or health risk from the norms the results in the 2nd q i e the actual concentration is high but the probability of exceeding the tlvs is low can be a relevant factor for evaluating the performance of the estimation models in both estimation results shown fig 2 a and 2 b the majority of the results are within the 1st and 3rd quadrants in addition it can be observed that data estimated to have a high probability of exceeding the tlvs have a high actual 238u and 222rn concentrations the performance of the models was more quantitatively verified by calculating the confusion matrices of the models using binarized estimations and actual concentrations i e l 01 or h 10 as shown in table 6 table 6 illustrates that both estimation models demonstrate a reasonable estimation performance with more than 70 accuracy comparing the 238u and 222rn estimation models the 238u model shows higher classification accuracy with approximately 80 the higher classification performance of the 238u model might be due to different geochemical and physical characteristics of 238u and 222rn dissolution in groundwater the dissolution of 238u in groundwater is highly dependent on the geochemical characteristics of groundwater and this condition is limited therefore the estimation performance for 238u depends on the water quality data which represent geochemical conditions of groundwater used as input variables of the estimation model whereas 222rn exists as a gaseous phase in groundwater and the physical conditions of groundwater would be more influential than the geochemical conditions of groundwater in terms of the dissolution of the gaseous phase in groundwater in particular the mobility of the gaseous phase of 222rn is considerably high therefore it can spatially exist in a wider range of an area regardless of the geochemical characteristics of the groundwater this fact makes it difficult to specify geochemical conditions for estimating 222rn existence which is the reason that the estimation performance of the 222rn model is lower than that of the 238u model however both 238u and 222rn estimation models achieve reasonable estimation results therefore based on these results we can confirm that the developed estimation models can be effectively used to estimate the probability of high concentration risk of the norms in groundwater generally the developed models can be used in real time estimation because the models were developed using data that can be directly observed in actual fields and real time 4 conclusion in this study a high concentration risk estimation models for norms 238u and 222rn in groundwater were developed using the geologic rock type monitoring well depth and the in situ groundwater quality monitoring data t ph eh ec do and hco3 the rf model was applied to estimation model development to improve the estimation performance on the highly noisy data in the model development a preliminary analysis on the input variables was performed to assess relative important input variables where a non parametirc statistical analysis a newly proposed pca based correlation analysis and the developed model based sensitivity analysis were considered consequently the input variables except eh and well depth were finally used for developing the 238u and 222rn risk estimation models respectively although both the developed models showed reasonable estimation performance the performance of the model for 222rn is relatively lower than that for 238u which is the result from that it is difficult to characterize 222rn occurrence using the geochemical conditions of groundwater because of the gaseous phase behavior of 222rn however all the result confirmed that the developed estimation models can be effectively used to estimate the probability of the high concentration risk of norms in groundwater furthermore a prompt estimation for the high concentration risk of norms can be possible based on the developed models since the models were developed using the data that enable real time monitoring in the actual field the need for a prompt risk estimation model has been verified with examples of the geological disaster early warning system unisdr 2015 most of the existing related models enhance the efficiency of risk evaluation for natural hazards using in situ real time monitoring data and data driven methods for example various research works on earthquake early warning systems have been conducted and are currently deployed in practical applications e g shakealert system developed by usgs chung 2020 meanwhile studies on developing an efficient norm risk evaluation model in groundwater have rarely been conducted despite considerable groundwater consumption worldwide considering that the high potential of groundwater consumption is likely to increase as a result of global climate change the need for an early warning system for groundwater quality is inevitable the developed models showed superior estimation performance despite the in situ water quality data being solely used and the data can be collected in real time therefore a water quality early warning system can be developed based on the proposed models in this study when real time water quality monitoring data are a prerequisite in this regard the proposed estimation models that effectively evaluate the in situ risk of norm concentrations exceeding the tlv concentration in groundwater could be instrumental in ensuring the safety of drinking groundwater credit authorship

3767,high concentration occurrence probability estimation models was developed to estimate 238u and 222rn in groundwater using in situ monitoring data i e geological rock types well depth t ph eh ec do and hco3 the estimation models are based on a non linear data driven method to improve their effectiveness for applications in different estimation cases using various in situ monitoring data when developing the models most sensitive in situ monitoring data are selectively utilized to train the models where various statistical and correlation analyses are applied to overcome challenges including model overfitting during training a highly nonlinear correlation between input and target variables and poor training due to low quality monitoring data based on statistical analysis results all input variables except for eh and well depth are used for developing the 238u and 222rn estimation models respectively actual data collected from groundwater quality monitoring networks of south korea from 2007 to 2019 are used to validate the developed models although it is difficult to characterize 222rn occurrence using the geochemical conditions of groundwater because the gaseous phase behavior of 222rn highly depends on structural geology the 222rn estimation model achieves reasonable performance with more than 70 accuracy in addition compared to the 222rn estimation model the 238u estimation model achieves higher classification accuracy with approximately 80 consequently we can confirm that the developed estimation models can be effectively used to estimate the probability of high concentration risk of 238u and 222rn in groundwater conclusively the practical applicability of the developed models is wide as the models have been developed using direct observable and real time data keywords naturally occuring radioactive materials norms groundwater sensitivity analysis data driven model in situ monitoring 1 introduction groundwater is a major source of freshwater almost half of the world s drinking water comes from groundwater zektser and everett 2004 unesco world s 2012 approximately 51 of groundwater serves as drinking and living domestic water in korea and the use of groundwater has increased lee and kwon 2016 however groundwater is one of the vulnerable resources to naturally occurring radioactive materials norms dissolved by groundwater rock interactions that contribute to significant bio environmental problems in groundwater consumption martins et al 2019 among norms 238u and 222rn which is a daughter of 238u are the main sources of public exposure to natural radiation with rn contributing approximately 50 of the global effective dose to the public ramola et al 2016 dinh chau et al 2011 these radionuclides are recognized as more of a concern because they can naturally accumulate in groundwater under different physicochemical conditions zapecza and szabo 1986 unscear 2008 the ingestion of groundwater containing even low level uranium concentrations causes chronic kidney malfunction and bone toxicity brugge and buchner 2011 kurttio et al 2005 in particular radon causes more severe health damage through inhalation such as lung cancer so using groundwater in a small sealed room such as boiling underground water in a kitchen and taking a shower in a bathroom may increase the risk of inhaling radon therefore knowledge of concentration levels spatial distribution and sources of uranium and radon in groundwater has been extensively studied to ensure environmentally safe and sustainable groundwater resources skeppström

particular the acquisition of groundwater quality data is time consuming because it is mostly based on laboratory analyses only a few studies have tried to develop more in situ practical and efficient methods for example haghani et al 2020 proposed an indoor radon concentration estimation model using a regression method with measurable in situ data ciotoli et al 2017 developed a geogenic radon potential map based on weighted regression using relevant geological data and a high level of indoor radon concentration most of these methods are models for estimating indoor radon concentrations while groundwater radon and uranium risk estimation models based on in situ data have not been studied the development of in situ norm estimation models in groundwater improves water safety for the public this study aimed to develop high concentration risk estimation models for norms particularly 238u and 222rn in groundwater using in situ groundwater quality monitoring data the estimation models were developed using a non linear data driven method random forest rf model in this study to improve their effectiveness in different estimation applications using various in situ monitoring data in addition individual monitoring data were analyzed in terms of their relative importance to norm risk estimation where a newly proposed principal component analysis pca based correlation analysis was used to address erroneous correlation results due to low quality monitoring data norm concentrations in situ groundwater quality monitoring data and geological information were used to validate the proposed estimation models in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater data acquisition groundwater data were collected nationwide at a total of 5 272 groundwater wells of south korea 2007 to 2019 and 4 374 samples were selected for data analysis after preprocessing approximately 90 of the sampling wells supply drinking water while the remaining 10 provide water for

alluvial deposits based on the gis database in this study the geological rock type applied to data analysis was determined by confirming the rock type at each sampling well groundwater was pumped for at least 5 10 min before sampling procedures were conducted to remove stagnant groundwater from the wells and filtered using 0 45 µm acetate membrane filters whatman hercules us for uranium analysis

us after the groundwater was fully sampled into a 250 ml glass bottle without headspace 222rn was extracted from the water by continuous recirculation of air in a closed loop until it reached equilibrium each measurement comprises 4 cycles every 5 min and average values were used to evaluate 222rn radioactivity in the groundwater samples the aqueous concentration of total uranium 238u was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy agilent 7500 series us in a laboratory the detection limit of 238u that was determined through a linear calibration line was 0 1 mg l 1 with

decile statistics for statistical analysis of other data a slightly modified pca was used to evaluate the bivariate correlation between the norms and continuous variables by considering the relationship of variables in multivariate data space relative pc based correlation consequently the statistical analysis results were considered to develop the high concentration risk estimation model

from nearby locations can be used for cross validation of the models which consequently might lead to over optimistic estimation performance roberts et al 2017 in this study although the multiple cross validation datasets were composed to alleviate this effect further test on the validation dataset considering spatial autocorrelation of the data might be needed in the global view of the training purpose the training of the rf models was implemented to reduce the root mean squared error between the estimated probability of the target and actual labels i e 01 or 10 where each decision tree composing the rf model was optimized by a greedy algorithm using splitting criterion e g gini impurity for the training data more details on the training algorithm of the decision tree are not included in this manuscript but it can be found in quinlan 1986 the stopping tolerance was set to be sufficiently small but excessively small values were intentionally avoided for regularization the performance of the rf model depends on several hyperparameters e g no of trees no of features that are used in each split and no of leaves of each tree in this study grid search based trial and error methods were used to determine the optimal hyperparameters of the model the model was coded using python 3 5 and scikit learn 0 22 2 the hardware used for training and estimation was equipped with an intel xeon 2 69 ghz cpu 48 cores and two sockets 128 gb memory and a microsoft windows 10 operating system 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis for the rf estimation model before developing the estimation model the proposed model was validated by evaluating the explainability of the proposed model on the relationship between the norms and the high correlated input variables that were confirmed using the relative pc based correlation analysis in the previous section to this end the correlation result was additionally validated by sensitivity analysis sa for rf estimation results that provide the relative impact of each input variable i e well depth t ph eh ec do and hco3 on the estimation performance sa was used on the trained 238u and 222rn estimation models using all types of input variables in this study we used a perturbation method scardi and harding 1999 which evaluates the contribution of small changes in each input variable to the model output under the condition that all other input variables remain constant this method evaluates the degrees of perturbation of output variables according to a change in respective input variables where the input variable causing the largest change in the output variables is the one that is the most influential each input variable was randomly changed with values ranging from 0 to 1 table 4 presents the sensitivity of individual input variables for 238u and 222rn concentration estimation for the estimation result of the 238u estimation model the case corresponding to the eh has the highest classification accuracy 76 44 which means that eh has the lowest correlation with 238u concentration meanwhile t and hco3 have a relatively high correlation with 238u occurrence and others well depth ph ec and do show a moderate correlation for the 222rn estimation model a high correlation with ph ec and hco3 60 33 61 55 and 63 39 of classification accuracy respectively was observed and a relatively lower correlation with well depth eh and do 69 94 68 92 and 69 74 of classification accuracy respectively all these facts correspond to the relative pc based correlation analysis results in table 3 which validate the proposed estimation model in this study by considering both the correlation and sa results the relatively effective input variables for developing the high concentration risk estimation model for norms were identified consequently in this study the input variables except eh and well depth were used for developing the estimation models of 238u and 222rn respectively the performance validation results of the developed models are discussed in the next section 3 2 3 performance of the estimation model for the probability of exceeding the tlv fig 2 a and 2 b show 100 estimation results obtained by testing the trained 238u and 222rn estimation models respectively with the prepared test datasets where eh and well depth data were excluded as input variables for both 238u and 222rn estimation models the optimal hyperparameters for each model of 238u and 222rn concentration in table 5 where each item from the upper indicates the number of trees in the single random forest the maximum number of variables considered for splitting a node the maximum number of levels in each decision tree the maximum number of leaf nodes and the splitting criterion respectively in the figures the x axis represents the estimated probability of exceeding the tlvs of 238u and 222rn concentrations the y axis represents the actual concentration the red solid line indicates the tlv of each norm 30 μ g l for 238u and 100 bq l for 222rn the blue solid line represents 0 5 probability of exceeding the tlvs according to the quadrant comprising the red and blue solid lines in the figures the data points in the first and third quadrants 1st q and 3rd q in fig 1 represent correct classification results while the second and fourth quadrants 2nd q and 4th q represent incorrect classification results specifically considering the environmental or health risk from the norms the results in the 2nd q i e the actual concentration is high but the probability of exceeding the tlvs is low can be a relevant factor for evaluating the performance of the estimation models in both estimation results shown fig 2 a and 2 b the majority of the results are within the 1st and 3rd quadrants in addition it can be observed that data estimated to have a high probability of exceeding the tlvs have a high actual 238u and 222rn concentrations the performance of the models was more quantitatively verified by calculating the confusion matrices of the models using binarized estimations and actual concentrations i e l 01 or h 10 as shown in table 6 table 6 illustrates that both estimation models demonstrate a reasonable estimation performance with more than 70 accuracy comparing the 238u and 222rn estimation models the 238u model shows higher classification accuracy with approximately 80 the higher classification performance of the 238u model might be due to different geochemical and physical characteristics of 238u and 222rn dissolution in groundwater the dissolution of 238u in groundwater is highly dependent on the geochemical characteristics of groundwater and this condition is limited therefore the estimation performance for 238u depends on the water quality data which represent geochemical conditions of groundwater used as input variables of the estimation model whereas 222rn exists as a gaseous phase in groundwater and the physical conditions of groundwater would be more influential than the geochemical conditions of groundwater in terms of the dissolution of the gaseous phase in groundwater in particular the mobility of the gaseous phase of 222rn is considerably high therefore it can spatially exist in a wider range of an area regardless of the geochemical characteristics of the groundwater this fact makes it difficult to specify geochemical conditions for estimating 222rn existence which is the reason that the estimation performance of the 222rn model is lower than that of the 238u model however both 238u and 222rn estimation models achieve reasonable estimation results therefore based on these results we can confirm that the developed estimation models can be effectively used to estimate the probability of high concentration risk of the norms in groundwater generally the developed models can be used in real time estimation because the models were developed using data that can be directly observed in actual fields and real time 4 conclusion in this study a high concentration risk estimation models for norms 238u and 222rn in groundwater were developed using the geologic rock type monitoring well depth and the in situ groundwater quality monitoring data t ph eh ec do and hco3 the rf model was applied to estimation model development to improve the estimation performance on the highly noisy data in the model development a preliminary analysis on the input variables was performed to assess relative important input variables where a non parametirc statistical analysis a newly proposed pca based correlation analysis and the developed model based sensitivity analysis were considered consequently the input variables except eh and well depth were finally used for developing the 238u and 222rn risk estimation models respectively although both the developed models showed reasonable estimation performance the performance of the model for 222rn is relatively lower than that for 238u which is the result from that it is difficult to characterize 222rn occurrence using the geochemical conditions of groundwater because of the gaseous phase behavior of 222rn however all the result confirmed that the developed estimation models can be effectively used to estimate the probability of the high concentration risk of norms in groundwater furthermore a prompt estimation for the high concentration risk of norms can be possible based on the developed models since the models were developed using the data that enable real time monitoring in the actual field the need for a prompt risk estimation model has been verified with examples of the geological disaster early warning system unisdr 2015 most of the existing related models enhance the efficiency of risk evaluation for natural hazards using in situ real time monitoring data and data driven methods for example various research works on earthquake early warning systems have been conducted and are currently deployed in practical applications e g shakealert system developed by usgs chung 2020 meanwhile studies on developing an efficient norm risk evaluation model in groundwater have rarely been conducted despite considerable groundwater consumption worldwide considering that the high potential of groundwater consumption is likely to increase as a result of global climate change the need for an early warning system for groundwater quality is inevitable the developed models showed superior estimation performance despite the in situ water quality data being solely used and the data can be collected in real time therefore a water quality early warning system can be developed based on the proposed models in this study when real time water quality monitoring data are a prerequisite in this regard the proposed estimation models that effectively evaluate the in situ risk of norm concentrations exceeding the tlv concentration in groundwater could be instrumental in ensuring the safety of drinking groundwater credit authorship

3768,flood forecasting is a challenging task with major concerns that include forecast uncertainty and lead time this paper aims to comprehensively address the data correction issue for hydrological models by developing an integrated postprocessing framework for hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts based on three types of ensemble precipitation forecasts ecmwf gefs and cfsv2 this framework mainly comprises the ensemble preprocessor epp and the bayesian model averaging bma scheme 1 the epp eliminates various deviations from the ensemble precipitation forecasts with the canonical event model extracting useful predictive information and extending the lead time by linking the forecasts seamlessly and 2 the bma scheme develops more skillful and reliable probabilistic hydrological forecasts from ensemble streamflow forecasts generated by three hydrological models xaj vic and dtvgm driven by the postprocessed ensemble precipitation forecasts the ganjiang river basin was selected as a case study to examine the capacity and efficiency of our developed framework we found that the performance of the integrated postprocessing of hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts benefitted from a reasonable design of canonical events especially when the observed precipitation was factored into the canonical events streamflow forecasts with increased lead times and accuracy were obtained by employing postprocessed precipitation forecasts instead of raw forecasts as the input for the hydrological models we also found that the bma scheme further improved the forecast effect by generating more skillful and reliable forecasts than a single hydrological model which was verified by a series of statisticalindices and uncertainty analysis our results underscore the importance of considering both input and output for hydrological models in hydrological forecasting keywords multisource precipitation ensemble forecast hydrometeorological ensemble forecast ensemble preprocessor bayesian model averaging 1 introduction streamflow forecasting is gaining significant importance as a nonstructural measure for flood protection and is also helpful for drought resistance agricultural production and water resource management li et al 2011 schewe et al 2014 wei and hsu 2009 to accurately predict streamflow and provide useful information for flood control two major issues should be considered the reduction of forecast uncertainty and the extension of the lead time however classical hydrological forecasting basedon observed throughfall before the 1950s merely provides a single value deterministic forecast of future streamflow with limited lead time demeritt et al 2007 krzysztofowicz 2002 xuan et al 2009 withthedevelopmentofsocietyandtheprogressofscienceandtechnology e g the flourishing of numerical weather forecast nwp olsson et al 2016 classical hydrological forecasting highly affected by uncertainties in precipitation and hydrological models is unable to interpret the forecast uncertainty and satisfy the current demands for early flood warnings among many technical methods aimed at reducing the forecast uncertainty hydrometeorological ensemble forecasting which generates multiple individual numerical forecasts from different initial conditions and or different numerical model configurations hamill et al 2000 leith 1974 has been embraced as a significant way to improve forecast accuracy cloke and pappenberger 2009 zappa et al 2010 however raw model generated forecasts are still impacted by uncertainties from various sources including initial and boundary conditions model inputs and outputs and the model structure and parameters which prevents the final forecast results from being published directly this raises great interest in the development of statistical postprocessing methods for hydrometeorological elements to ameliorate these issues postprocessing methods are basically statistical models that establish a relationship between observations and the corresponding forecasts generated by meteorological or hydrological models the objective of these methods is to employ an established statistical relationship to reduce future systematic errors between the direct model output dmo forecasts and verifying observations hamill et al 2000 a sophisticated postprocessing method can not only reduce the biases and dispersion errors in raw forecasts but also retain their forecast skills in addition postprocessing methods can downscale raw forecasts to a particular scale to meet the needs of actual applications and generate ensemble members with the spatiotemporal and intervariable dependency of observations gneiting et al 2007 gneiting and katzfuss 2014 schaake et al 2007c yuan et al 2015 basically hydrometeorological postprocessing aiming at delivering more accurate forecasts either deterministic or probabilistic includes two aspects schaake et al 2007b addressing the uncertainties in the input meteorological data and the output of hydrological models meteorological ensemble forecast postprocessing which establishes a statistical relationship with the observed meteorological element information downscales inputs to fit with hydrological models quantifies the uncertainty and gives an ensemble forecast containing the uncertainty information li et al 2017 is widely used in ensemble forecast research the emergence of ensemble forecasts has promoted a surge in a series of bias correction methods the methods proposed at the early stage of this surge include perfect prognosis klein et al 1959 and model output statistics mos glahn and lowry 1972 these methods are successful and have attracted great interest in the meteorological field with many applications to a wide range of model variables and extensions to other types of regression functions like logistic regression or neural networks lemcke and kruizinga 1988 marzban 2003 vannitsem et al 2020 wilks 2009 in recent years many effective methods have been put forth such as the rank histogram calibration hamill 2001 thequantile regression qr bremnes 2004 the bayesian processor of output bpo reggiani and weerts 2008 the quantile mapping qm piani et al 2010 and the ensemble pre processor epp wu et al 2011 methods these postprocessing methods have proven to be efficient in optimizing the raw meteorological forecasts from numerical weather prediction olsson et al 2016 vannitsem et al 2018 specifically the epp which is a conditional distribution based method developed by schaake et al 2007a to generate temperature and precipitation ensemble forecasts from single value forecasts has been widely employed in the postprocessing of meteorological ensemble forecasts tao et al 2014 voisin et al 2010 wood and schaake 2008 based on establishing a relevant relationship between observations and forecasts the epp constructs ensemble forecasts using the schaake shuffle method clark et al 2004 schaake et al 2007a to maintain the spatiotemporal correlation of observations the multisource ensemble precipitation forecasts used in the study are from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf global ensemble forecast system gefs and second version of the climate forecast system cfsv2 although their effectiveness in hydrological forecasting has been verified jha et al 2018 liu et al 2017 roulin and vannitsem 2005 yuan et al 2013 it is still necessary to conduct statistical postprocessing of various deviations before they are used as input to hydrological models the postprocessing methods for hydrological forecasts are similar to those for meteorological forecasts the postprocessing techniques of hydrometeorological ensemble forecasting which is a statistical postprocessing method for hydrological and meteorological variables mendoza et al 2015 is also widely used and can be capable of enhancing the performance of hydrological forecasting by reducing the bias of input and output of hydrological models li et al 2017 conditional distribution based models e g the hydrological uncertainty processor hup krzysztofowicz and herr 2001 model conditional processor mcp todini 2013 and bayesian joint probability bjp model wang et al 2009 as well as regression based models e g the general linear model postprocessor glmpp zhao et al 2011 and kalman filter vrugt and robinson 2007 have been developed and are commonly used in hydrological forecasts moreover the proposal of nonparametric methods for hydrological forecasts evades parametric assumptions in postprocessing brown and seo 2010 and a study on using multiple nonparametric models on a large dataset postprocessed can be found in papacharalampous et al 2019 because errors in the predictions of individual models which consist of various sources e g model input data model parameter estimation and model structural deficiencies beven and freer 2001 tend to have mutually independent statistical properties ajami et al 2006 the multimodal averaging or combination method provides a different paradigm that can extract as much information as possible from the existing independently constructed individual models beven 2006 hagedorn et al 2005 shamseldin et al 1997 a variety of statistical postprocessing methods such as the simple average method hagedorn et al 2005 and bayesian model averaging bma raftery 1996 have been developed to address this issue in particular the bma method used not only to combine multiple models to obtain the optimal solution but also to calculate the uncertainty of a single model and model combination has been widely used in multimodal averaging and uncertainty analysis of hydrological forecasts duan et al 2007 liang et al 2013 madadgar and moradkhani 2014 many studies have shown that bma outperforms many other multimodel methods in generating accurate and reliable predictions clyde 1999 ellison 2004 raftery et al 2005 raftery and zheng 2003 most previous studies on hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts deal with uncertainty either by postprocessing the meteorological input or by postprocessing the hydrological output due to the efficiency and capacity of both methods in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of hydrological forecasts there is an interest to develop integrated postprocessing by considering both meteorological and hydrological ensemble forecasts simultaneously roulin and vannitsem 2015 conducted early work on this in simpler systems discussing when postprocessing of the input and the output is indeed effective in this study we aim to develop a postprocessing framework of hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts that can extract as much information as possible from the multisource input data and outputs of existing individual models the ganjiang river basin grb was selected as a case study area to examine the capacity and efficiency of our proposed method three types of ensemble precipitation forecasts ecmwf gefs and cfsv2 were considered and three generally used hydrological models xaj zhao 1992 vic liang 1994 and dtvgm xia et al 2003 were used the objectives of this study were to 1 develop the postprocessing framework of hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts to address the uncertainty in hydrometeorological elements and extend the lead time and 2 evaluate the efficiency of the postprocessing framework applied in the grb based on multisource precipitation the structure of this study is given as follows section 2 describes the postprocessing framework of hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts section 3 introduces the data and study area section 4 presents the results and discussion section 5 presents the conclusions 2 methodology the postprocessing framework of the hydrometeorological ensemble forecast fig 1 consists of three parts 1 a correction of multisource ensemble precipitation forecasts and seamless precipitation forecasts by the epp and schaake shuffle 2 a hydrological simulation based on three types of hydrological models and postprocessed ensemble precipitation forecasts for generating an ensemble of emulative streamflow forecasts and 3 the optimization of the ensemble streamflow forecasts by the bma method the detailed methods are briefly described below 2 1 postprocessing method of meteorological ensemble forecasting 2 1 1 ensemble preprocessor epp in this study the ensemble pre processor epp is utilized to convert the time series of single value quantitative precipitation forecasts qpf into corresponding ensemble forecasts of precipitation as input data for hydrological models the epp requires a long time series of historical forecast data and observed data as a basis for the correction of nwp as well as the quantification of uncertainty the main steps of the epp include the 1 establishment of the canonical events model 2 determination of the joint probability distributions of forecasts and observations 3 generation of probabilistic predictions of the observations conditioned on given forecasts and 4 ensemble construction by the schaake shuffle procedure the epp method for postprocessing qpfs is briefly described below see this article by ye et al 2017 for more details and specific steps of the epp method schaake et al 2007a proposed a method for constructing the canonical event model whose main aim is to extract useful information in forecasts to establish joint probability distributions between historical observations and forecasts for the correction of future forecasted precipitation a canonical event is defined as a meteorological event for a given location with a specific lead time and duration ye et al 2017 canonical events can be categorized as single time step canonical events sces e g events with time steps of one day the next day precipitation and composite time step canonical events cces e g multi day events like the average daily precipitation from day 1 to day 5 tao et al 2014 the former refers to events with one day precipitation or less and the latter refers to multiday precipitation events after the reasonable establishment of the canonical event model the marginal cumulative distribution functions cdf of forecasts x for a given canonical event can be expressed as 1 f x x 1 p x p x f xc x x 0 where p x denotes the forecasted probability of precipitation which can be determined by the ratio of the number of rainy events to the total number of events and f xc denotes the conditional distribution of the precipitation amount when precipitation occurs the marginal cdf of observations y is calculated similarly then we adopt a specific probability distribution function to interpret the functional form of the cdfs of x and y the gamma distribution function is used in this study due to its superior precipitation preprocessing results ye et al 2017 to facilitate the determination of the joint distribution of x and y the normal quantile transformation method nqt kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 krzysztofowicz 1997 is employed to convert x and y into standard normal space accordingly the joint distribution of x and y is transformed into the joint distribution f u v u v of the new random variables u and v which is assumed to be a bivariate standard normal distribution on the ground of the property of the bivariate standard normal the conditional probability distribution of v given u u f v u u v u can be expressed as 2 v u u n ρ uv u 1 ρ uv 2 where ρ uv denotes the correlation coefficient between u and v based on the conditional distribution formula f v u u v u can be calculated as 3 f v u u v u f u v u v f u u thus the probabilistic predictions of y for a given x can be derived by sampling the results of the random variables u and v in the normal space and the inverse of nqt 2 1 2 the schaake shuffle the conditional probabilistic forecasts generated by the method above lack the necessary space time continuity required for meteorological elements to be used in hydrological models therefore schaake shuffle is applied to construct the space time relationship of the ensemble forecasts based on years long observed precipitation taking the sces as an example the schaake shuffle procedure is divided into two steps 1 attaining the ascending ranks of the observations and sampled ensemble members in each time step and 2 shuffling the ensemble members to correspond the ranks of the observations for a new ensemble forecast with space time continuity compared with the procedure for the sces the procedure for the cces has an extra step namely splitting the cces into each time step according to specific ratios tao et al 2014 ye et al 2017 using the multiday precipitation information of the cces the splitting order of different canonical events can influence the postprocessing results this study adopts correlation coefficients of canonical events derived from forecasts and observations in ascending order to split canonical events the design of multiple scenarios of canonical events is utilized for various data sources of ensemble precipitation forecasts low correlation coefficients indicate subpar prediction skills 2 1 3 the seamless hydrologic ensemble forecast seamless predictions i e consistent predictions over successive lead times are becoming increasingly prominent in hydrometeorological forecasting when applied in the meteorological field the seamless prediction method covers weather to climate predictions hemri 2015 with weather forecasts from cfsv2 and climate predictions from gefs ecmwf this method is utilized to generate new ensemble precipitation data in the epp based on canonical events in this study this method consists of three parts 1 the conversion of the raw gefs ecmwf and cfsv2 time series into daily time series 2 the combination of the raw gefs ecmwf 1st 15th day data and the raw cfsv2 16th data to form a new data source gefs cfs ecm cfs and 3 the adoption of the gefs cfs ecm cfs to construct the canonical event model in the epp 2 2 postprocessing method of hydrological ensemble forecasting 2 2 1 generation of the hydrological model ensemble to test the postprocessing methods of hydrometeorological ensemble forecasting an ensemble of emulative predictions from several hydrological models of different mechanisms were produced we employed three hydrological models the xin anjiang model zhao 1992 xaj the variable infiltration capacity model liang et al 1994 vic and the distributed time variant gain model xia et al 2003 dtvgm these three models have been predominantly used in hydrological modeling in the study area du et al 2016 huang et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 yin et al 2018 and are described simply below the lumped xaj model is employed in this study this model which uses the storage capacity curve of river basins to calculate runoff yield and concentration values has been widely utilized in many humid and semihumid areas according to the lumped xaj model runoff starts when the soil moisture content in the aerated zone reaches the field capacity and is the difference between rainfall and steady infiltration considering the inhomogeneity of the rainfall and the underlying surface the xaj model divides the study basin into many subbasins calculates the runoff yield and confluence of each subbasin and then obtains the flow process of the basin outlet the vic model is a large scale grid based distributed hydrological model emphasizing the reciprocal power fed system that was proposed and developed in 1994 this model can either be executed in a water balance mode or in a water and energy balance mode which makes up for the deficiency of the traditional hydrological model in describing the heat process the vic model divides each grid unit into multiple land cover and elevation types by meshing the changes in the underlying surface and elevation of the basin the amount of evapotranspiration is calculated according to the penman equation monteith 1965 the surface runoff of the upper layer soil is calculated based on the varying infiltration curve the base flow in the lowest soil layer is simulated according to the nonlinear arno decay curve todini 1996 the unit hydrological principle within the grid unit and the linearized saint venant equation are used to simulate the confluence lohmann et al 1998 with a systematic relationship between precipitation and runoff as its core the dtvgm model based on the current watershed distributed hydrological simulation technology focuses on the influence of the time varying gain factor and water balance the dtvgm model combines spatial information with the nonlinear system theory which is a new technique it has clear hydrological meaning coupling the grid unit generation and the river network convergence process greatly shortening the model calculation furthermore the dtvgm model is simpler and practical than other hydrological physical mechanism models and conceptual models 2 2 2 bayesian model averaging bma bayesian model averaging bma is a statistical postprocessing method designed to yield more skillful and reliable probabilistic predictions than the raw ensemble members generated by multiple emulative models raftery et al 2003 madigan et al 1996 the basic principles of bma can be expressed as 4 p x y i 1 k p m i y p x m i y where p x y refers to the posterior distribution of the predictand x given the training data observations y also known as the weighted average of posterior distributions p x m i y under the ensemble of all considered model predictions m m 1 m 2 m k weighted by posterior model probability p m i y neuman 2003 p m i y reflects the compatibility between a certain ensemble member and the observations the better the prediction effect the greater the weight coefficient allocated to the model when we denote w i p m i y i 1 k w i 1 is obtained in the bma if the prediction results of the ith model obey the normal distribution x n μ σ i 2 of the mean m i and variance σ i 2 p x m i y obeys the normal distribution the posterior mean and variance of the bma prediction can be expressed as raftery et al 2005 5 e x m y i 1 k w i g x m i σ i 2 6 v a r x m y i 1 k w i m i j 1 k w j m j 2 i 1 k w i σ i 2 where i 1 k w i m i j 1 k w j m j 2 refers to the difference among the models σ i 2 refers to the variance between the model prediction m i and observation y and g y m i σ i 2 refers to the normal distribution of the mean m i and variance σ i 2 the parameters and the weights of the prediction result distribution of each hydrological model can be estimated via the expectation maximization em algorithm dempster 1977 which is an iterative method for maximum likelihood problems with incomplete data duan et al 2007 it is an effective method to calculate the bma model based on the assumption that every model prediction obeys the normal distribution duan et al 2007 raftery et al 2005 after the bma weight w i and model prediction error σ i 2 are calculated by the em algorithm the monte carlo method combined sampling method is used to generate the uncertainty interval of bma prediction at any time t chen et al 2000 in this paper we specify that the sample size at any time t is 100 after 100 samples of bma at any time t are sampled by the above method they are sorted from small to large the 90 prediction interval of bma is determined to the part between 5 and 95 quantiles thus we can implement the uncertainty analysis of hydrological modeling using the bma method the specific steps and more applications of the bma method can be found in duan et al 2007 2 3 verification strategy 2 3 1 statistical verification criteria for hydrometeorological forecasts to assess the postprocessing scheme of the hydrometeorological ensemble forecast we consider the following model performance measures the correlation coefficient r the root mean square error rmse the relative mean error rme the nash sutcliffe efficiency value nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the continuous rank probability skill score crpss brown et al 2010 the rank histogram is used to assess the reliability of the probability distribution given by the ensemble forecast if the ensemble forecast system is reliable in the rank histogram the probabilities of observations falling between any two ensemble members are basically the same a perfect rank histogram displays values uniformly distributed in equal probability bins the perfect rank value is 1 n 1 where n is the number of ensemble members 2 3 2 statistical verification criteria for uncertainty interval toachieve the goal of maximizing the predictive accuracy and reliability of hydrological probability forecast many ways can be adopted to measure these objectives in this study we take advantage of several criteria the coverage rate cr the average bandwidth b and the average deviation d table 1 shows the specific definition of these statistical measures 3 case study area and data 3 1 study area in this study the ganjiang river basin grb which is located between 24 20 28 45 n and 113 20 116 45 e is selected as the case study area fig 2 the grb with a total length of 766 km and a total drainage area of 80 948 km2 is the largest subbasin of the poyang lake river basin in the mid lower reaches of the yangtze river basin of china yin et al 2018 the ganjiang river originates in southwestern jiangxi province runs through the southern plains and finally falls into the yangtze river yang et al 2019 the whole study area is divided into 20 subbasins based on their physical geography and hydroclimatic conditions fig 2 the long term average annual precipitation in the grb is approximately 1590 mm and the precipitation between april and

datasets namely ecmwf gefs and cfsv2 were considered and are described in table 2 the ecmwf dataset which is produced by the thorpex interactive grand global ensemble tigge park et al 2008 uses 50 ensemble forecast members http apps ecmwf int datasets data tigge levtype sfc type pf provides daily precipitation ensemble forecasts of up to 15 days ahead with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 or 1 0 1 0 and is available from october 2006 to the present the gefs dataset is provided by the u s national center for environmental prediction ncep hamill et al 2013 https www emc ncep noaa gov emc pages numerical forecast systems gefs php the reforecast data adopted in this paper were generated using the gefs model version 9 0 1 the model provides a daily precipitation ensemble forecast with 11 ensemble forecast members of up to 8 days ahead from december 1984 to the present and has a spatial resolution of 1 0 1 0 the cfsv2 also released by the ncep https cfs ncep noaa gov cfsv2 downloads html gives precipitation predictions with various time scales ranging from hours to months and is updated every 5th day saha et al 2014 the forecast runs go out to 9 months every day starting from 1982 to the present and have a spatial resolution of 0 938 0 938 in this study the period from 2007 to 2016 was used for the comprehensive consideration of the three datasets the datasets were interpolated into 8 meteorological stations by the inverse distance weighted idw algorithm according to longitude and latitude to obtain raw precipitation ensemble forecasts at the meteorological stations the areal precipitation based on the raw precipitation ensemble forecast in the subbasins was calculated using the thiessen polygon method because the time step of the raw cfsv2 data was different from the other two types of data daily forecasts of the raw cfsv2 data with the same time step as the other two data sources were obtained using the cubic polynomial interpolation method 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of the ensemble means of multisource precipitation forecasts the performances of the ecmwf gefs and cfsv2 precipitation forecasts were evaluated at all subbasins in comparison to observation data to prevent large numbers of zero values from influencing the daily precipitation data and avoid insufficient sample space a 15 day time window was adopted to cover forecasts before and after the forecast day 7 days before and after the forecast day fig 3 shows the pearson correlation coefficients between the multisource ensemble precipitation forecasts and observations at different lead times for each day of the year at 6 typical subbasins named m1 m4 m7 m12 m15 and m20 the correlation coefficients decrease by varying degrees with increasing lead time the ecmwf shows the best performance followed by the gefs and the cfsv2 gives the worst performance the lead time is also an important influencing factor that should be carefully considered the performance also varies largely at different lead times and different days of the year for the same precipitation dataset the ecmwf gefs shows the best correlation with the observations in spring and winter with a lead time within the first five days this is consistent with previous studies bao and zhao 2012 ran et al 2018 ye et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 in addition the ecmwf has a slightly stronger correlation with the observation data than the gefs but the correlation of the former is more variable than that of the latter over one year indicating the stability of gefs is slightly stronger than that of ecmwf this may be related to the initial perturbation methods of different ensemble forecast systems buizza 2019 the lowest correlation at short lead times between cfsv2 and observations may result from the climate prediction data character of cfsv2 which improves its performance in long term forecasting although some studies have implied that the forecasting ability of cfsv2 still leaves much to be desired at a short lead time luo et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 its long term forecast skill is comparatively credible ma et al 2016 thus this study attempts to merge it with the other two data sources for long term simulations using the meteorological seamless prediction method 4 2 design of canonical events prior work on the application of the epp method was in the design of canonical events the canonical event combination can effectively affect the postprocessing quality of epp as introduced in section 2 1 1 4 canonical event scenarios were constructed table 3 there were 10 canonical events per scenario and the maximum lead time was set at 15 days through this design we made better use of the precipitation information contained in the sces cces and historical observations for scenario 1 sces were applied in the first 5 canonical events and cces were used in the last 5 canonical events different from scenario 1 all canonical events in scenario 2 were designed using the cces to contain as much useful information for precipitation forecasting as possible for event 10 in this scenario all the precipitation forecast information for the lead time from 1 to 15 was taken into account and its average value was used for postprocessing scenario 3 was constructed with the fusion of observation precipitation data into the forecast precipitation which was expected to improve the forecast accuracy of the ensemble postprocessing therefore the observed precipitation information of the day was contained in scenario 3 in the table 1 indicated the use of 1 day of observed data furthermore the proportion of the precipitation information of historical observations was increased by using 3 days of observed data in scenario 4 to verify the rationality of the four scenarios this paper first analyzed the correlation between the scenarios and the observed precipitation subbasin m1 was taken as an example to show the results of the four scenarios for the ecmwf gefs and cfsv2 precipitation forecasts fig 4 shows that the correlation generally increases from scenario 1 to scenario 4 for each ensemble precipitation forecast dataset compared with scenario 1 the correlation coefficient significantly improves in scenario 2 similarly an improvement occurs between scenario 2 and scenario 3 4 this may be caused by the fact that half of the canonical events used in scenario 1 are sces while more cces are considered in the remaining scenarios another reason may be that the observed precipitation information included in scenario 3 and 4 greatly enhances the values of the correlation coefficient the premise of the canonical event model is to determine high correlation events from historical observations and forecasts and to build a statistical relationship lorenz s 1963 chaotic theory of atmospheric systems states that any forecast of meteorological elements over five days is unreliable and that unreliable is not equivalent to useless tao et al 2014 this is because even if it is impossible to avoid the time error of precipitation forecasting total precipitation may be forecasted skillfully in the long term this means that the cumulative precipitation still delivers useful information even when the correlation between single day precipitation forecasts and observations in the corresponding period is weak thus it makes sense to design cce as a canonical event moreover the construction of canonical events by using the relationship between forecasts and observations to enhance the forecast effect has proven effective ye et al 2017 this is consistent with the results in scenario 3 and 4 4 3 verification of the epp ensemble mean precipitation forecasts for utilizing the epp to eliminate various deviations from the ensemble precipitation forecasts several canonical event schemes which is the core of epp are designed in the previous section next three evaluation methods are used to assess the postprocessed results of epp on the ensemble precipitation forecasts 4 3 1 verification of the mean of the epp ensemble precipitation forecasts based on the canonical event model the ecmwf gefs and cfsv2 data were postprocessed by the epp method the mean values of ensemble precipitation forecast members formed by postprocessing were treated as deterministic forecasts compared with the observations the raw forecasts and preprocessed forecasts were labelled ecmwf raw ecmwf post gefs raw gefs post cfs raw and cfs post furthermore their performances were evaluated by the rme rmse and nse among the three types of raw forecasts under the four scenarios fig 5 the rme of gefs raw is the largest followed by cfs raw while ecmwf raw has the smallest rme the gefs raw with the largest overall bias presents the characteristics of overforecasting solow and broadus 1988 especially in scenario 1 where the canonical events are basically composed of sces the results show that the longer the lead time is the larger the rme and the worse the overforecasting will be the dataset most affected by canonical events is also gefs raw notably the rme of gefs raw decreases by nearly half from scenario 1 to 4 li et al 2019 in research on postprocessing methods also found that gefs raw experienced an obvious positive bias of 20 60 in the huai river basin china on the whole increases in the precipitation information and lead time considered by canonical events result in decreased dataset rme moreover because the rme of the three datasets after postprocessing was small that is approximately between 0 05 and 0 05 it will no longer be listed the nse and the rmse were also used to evaluate the quality of the data before and after postprocessing for the four scenarios fig 6 demonstrates that the nse increased and the rmse decreased as a whole from scenario 1 to 4 both rendering better performance for all postprocessed data this result suggests that canonical events that contained more precipitation information were conducive to improving the accuracy of ensemble precipitation forecasts among the three datasets the ecmwf performed the best in the evaluation with postprocessing techniques aiding the greatly enhanced accuracy in addition the improved yet limited overall accuracy of cfsv2 with long lead times illustrates its insensitivity to canonical events by synthesizing the performance of these indices we can conclude that on the premise that the epp method enhances the forecast accuracy the improvement of forecast accuracy has a strong relationship with the lead time and canonical events specifically the longer the lead time the lower the improvement of forecast accuracy the improvement for cces is significantly higher than that for sces the improvement of canonical events with observed precipitation information is also higher than that without observed precipitation information however there may not be enough observed data for reference in ungauged basins in terms of indicator performance the accuracy of scenario 4 which considers a high amount of observed precipitation information has a limited improvement compared with that of scenario 3 ye et al 2017 argue that the addition of too much observed data at the expense of useful forecast information is unnecessary we investigate this issue in combination with other indices in this study 4 3 2 verification of the distribution of the epp ensemble precipitation forecasts the distribution of the epp ensemble precipitation forecasts was examined using rank histograms based on the daily ensemble forecast members generated by the epp and the rank of the observed precipitation in the ensemble members the number of ensemble members generated by preprocessing method is not artificially selected but determined by the original precipitation ensemble forecast data source because the characteristic of the method is to extract the data on the same day of each year for daily analysis the number of ensemble members is the length of years of the data therefore ecmwf has 10 ensemble members after post processed and ncep s two data sources have 32 ensemble members after post processed here we only show the results for subbasin m1 as an example but the situations in the remaining subbasins are similar to the situation in m1 fig 7 shows that the rank histograms of ecmwf and gefs in scenario 3 are obviously more homogenized than those in the other scenarios whereas the rank histogram of cfsv2 displays a more even distribution across the bins in scenario 2 these results indicate a better distribution of the corresponding epp ensemble precipitation forecasts due to a lack of precipitation information the rank histograms for scenario 1 show uneven bins with the height first rising and then falling from the middle to the right which indicates that the integration of the ensemble forecasts is on the low side and overestimation of extreme precipitation exists for scenario 3 and 4 the rank histograms of cfsv2 which have a deep concave shape resulted from narrow forecast ranges indicating no skill at precipitation forecasting compared with scenario 3 the increase in the inhomogeneity of the rank histograms of ecmwf and gefs in scenario 4 indicates that the use of 1 day historical observations is sufficient this also validates the conclusion of the previous section that excessive sacrifice of forecast information for data on past observations is unnecessary 4 3 3 verification of the skill of the epp ensemble precipitation forecasts the crpss was used to evaluate the skill of the epp results of both raw and postprocessed precipitation data similar to the previous section only the results of subbasin 1 are given to illustrate the results fig 8 displays the crpss of raw and postprocessed precipitation forecasts from ecmwf and cfsv2 since the evaluation results of ecmwf and gefs are similar in this section we omit the latter for reducing verbosity and present it in the supplementary material fig s1 we can note that the crpss increases with increasing precipitation information from scenario 1 to 4 regardless of whether the data were postprocessed meanwhile these scores also exhibited great improvement by using postprocessed data under each scenario indicating that the epp can develop the predictive ability of ensemble precipitation forecasts in particular the decent results of ecmwf post and gefs post in scenario 3 and 4 present good potentials in short term forecasting this result could be attributed to their data characteristic of concentrating on shorter lead times however the excessively low crpss in scenario 1 indicates that this scenario is not suitable for the canonical event based ensemble postprocessing model combined with the aforementioned results in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 we can conclude that scenario 3 is most compatible with the ecmwf and gefs similarly scenario 2 is the best scheme for processing the cfsv2 therefore we selected these two scenarios to process corresponding ensemble precipitation forecasts aiming to drive hydrological models through the evaluation of ensemble average ensemble distribution and ensemble skill of postprocessing results we find that the correction result of the epp method for multivariate precipitation is reliable in the grb similarly ye et al 2017 employ the epp method with different canonical event models also improve the quality of multisource precipitation and obtain streamflow forecasts with longer lead times and higher accuracy using postprocessed precipitation forecasts in the yalong river basin china tao et al 2014 also evaluate how the epp method can enhance raw precipitation forecasts made by different nwp models archived in the tigge database in the huai river basin china 4 4 calibration and validation of the hydrological model ensemble to test the effect of hydrometeorological postprocessing by the epp and the bma for streamflow predictions we selected three hydrological models the xaj vic and dtvgm to simulate the hydrological process in the grb the whole period was divided into two subperiods the calibration period from 1985 to 2005 and the validation period from 2006 to 2016 the daily streamflow data in the outlet of the grb named the waizhou hydrostation were used to verify the streamflow simulation the efficiency of the model and the comparison between the observed and simulated streamflow are presented in fig 9 the performance indices are reasonably good illustrating the decent streamflow simulation skill of all three models in the study area the overall performance of the xaj is the best in both the calibration and validation periods the rme for vic and dtvgm indicates the daily streamflow process is underestimated whereas the rme for xaj shows slightly high simulation results vic has the largest rmse and thus the worst simulation effect of the peak value this may be due to the exclusion of the impact of water conservancy projects on streamflow in the basin in general the required accuracy of the streamflow simulation of the three models can be achieved via quality data input therefore all models can be used to carry out hydrological forecasting for the grb in combination with ensemble precipitation forecasts 4 5 ensemble verification of hydrological forecasting eight sets of precipitation data namely the ecmwf raw ecmwf post gefs raw gefs post cfs raw cfs post ecm cfs and gefs cfs were used to drive the three hydrological models xaj vic and dtvgm the ecm cfs and gefs cfs were generated by integrating ecmwf and gefs for the first 15 days and cfsv2 from day 16 to one month into the future the simulation results vary dramatically between different models and inputs we only display the evaluation results for the ecmwf and integrated precipitation in the text figs 10 and 11 and other results are presented in the supplementary material figs s2 and s3 notably the use of postprocessed ensemble precipitation data as input to the hydrological models achieves a better simulation effect than the use of raw data sources the quality of the ecmwf raw data driving the hydrological models is high as evidenced by the nse of 0 6 during the first 3 days in both the calibration and verification periods however its sensitivity varies among different models thus the xaj is highly recommended compared to the other two models although ecmwf raw is generally effective when applied to the vic the results are the most improved when ecmwf post is taken as the input the improvement effect is more obvious at long lead times the simulation performance of gefs raw indicates that the raw data quality is sufficient to drive hydrological models during a short lead time but the accuracy is greatly compromised with a long lead time the simulation effect of gefs raw may be slightly weaker than that of ecmwf raw however gefs post has a better improvement for streamflow simulation than ecmwf post moreover regardless of the hydrological model driven by cfs raw there is basically no forecasting skill at a daily scale in addition cfs post can improve the accuracy of hydrological forecasting to some extent regardless of the lead time length this is an advantage in hydrological forecasting driven by integrated ensemble precipitation forecasts the model performance indices in streamflow simulation based on cfs post cfs ecm and cfs gefs at a long time scale are shown in fig 11 generally nse and r display the same characteristics in terms of the time scale the evaluation results of the three hydrological models driven by the two types of integrated precipitation are significantly better than those based on cfs post only whether in the calibration or verification period the simulation results in the first half of the month are also better than those in the second half of the month which demonstrates that the forecast accuracy declines with the lead time according to the comparison among the models we can note that xaj has the best model performance and that vic has the second best performance with the utilization of cfs post cfs ecm and cfs gefs of the three data sources the sensitivity of cfs gefs varies the most among different models followed by that of cfs ecm the simulation results based on cfs ecm are slightly better than those based on cfs gefs but the overall difference is not notable during the verification period cfs post has the worst model performance indices due to the insufficient accuracy of the early lead time which can be compensated for by using gefs and ecmwf in other words integrated ensemble precipitation forecasts have better performance than cfs forecasts in weekly and monthly hydrological forecasting especially after processing 4 6 testing of the bma method 4 6 1 verification of the accuracy of the expected bma forecasts the bma method was applied to the transformed ensemble members to obtain a set of bma weights using all data from the training period based on the daily streamflow simulation results for the 15 day lead time of the three models driven by eight ensemble precipitation forecasts multimodel ensemble postprocessing was performed by calculating the weights of the simulation results of the three models for each type of driving data and lead time the bma probabilistic forecasts of the eight types of precipitation driving data for the 15 day lead time were obtained taking the gefs post as an example the bma weights of different hydrological models are shown in fig 12 the complete calculation results are presented in the supplementary material fig s4 using various ensemble precipitation forecasts with different lead times to drive separate models the allocation of bma weights differed one premise of the bma method is that bma weights should reflect relative model performance as shown visually individual model performance is roughly exhibited by the bma weights with the xaj weighed more heavily than other models especially for the last four types of driving data this means that xaj did slightly better than the other two models in daily streamflow simulation with these driving data which coincides with what we found in the previous two sections the weight allocated to vic is substantially greater than that allocated to dtvgm however the simulation accuracy of vic is not necessarily better than that of dtvgm this may be caused by the similarity of some calculation principles between vic and xaj for example both adopt the storage capacity curve to calculate runoff yield which makes the two forecast results have a certain correlation thus similar to xaj the weight allocation of vic is superior to that of dtvgm according to the bma weight allocation results we obtained the streamflow simulation results based on the bma scheme for each type of driving data for the daily lead time they were compared with the outputs of the single models the nse rmse r and rme were selected as the evaluation indices due to the insufficient accuracy of cfsv2 in the daily streamflow simulation the evaluation indices of the forecast results for the 1 day lead time based on the last four types of forecast precipitation data were taken as an example for comparison in table 4 although the simulation results based on bma are not optimal in every single index the overall evaluation of the bma streamflow simulation is better than that of the single models whether driven by ecmwf or gefs the performance of xaj is only second to that of bma which confirms that the bma weights do reflect model performance the evaluation results of each lead time in the calibration and validation periods based on bma and xaj are presented in fig 13 and other results of single models can be found in the supplementary material fig s5 the x axis shows the lead time and the y axis shows eight sets of precipitation data namely cfs ecm cfs gefs cfs raw cfs post ecmwf raw ecmwf post gefs raw and gefs post from top to bottom the first lines in fig 13 are the evaluation results in the calibration period and the second lines represent the results in the verification period in terms of input the cfs raw shows no signs of forecast skills by the single models or the bma scheme while the ecmwf post gefs post and integrated precipitation forecasts perform best on the whole in the streamflow simulation most notable is the enhanced simulation accuracy of ecmwf post and gefs post when used as driving data within the lead time of the first 5 days compared with the corresponding raw precipitation forecasts the slow attenuation of nse and the r values of the integrated precipitation forecasts within the lead time of the last ten days indicate their stability in streamflow simulation for longer lead times these findings prove the epp s ability to improve the accuracy of hydrological forecasting as well as the seamless prediction method s effectiveness in extending the lead time of precipitation forecasts a comparison of the index evaluation results of streamflow simulations based on the bma scheme and single models indicates that bma forecasts present better nse r values and rmse values in both the calibration and verification period and demonstrate significant simulation accuracy for partial lead times however bma forecasts fail to demonstrate a marked advantage over the results of single models in rme values experiences proved that the final streamflow forecasting results postprocessed by the bma scheme were not necessarily optimal compared to the results generated by every single model in every aspect dong et al 2011 yang et al 2018 the comparison of index results for the input data before and after postprocessing in every model validated the pronounced improvement of the streamflow forecast accuracy by epp from this angle by measuring the index results of single models and bma the bma method was found to be conducive to streamflow simulation accuracy hence the research objective of addressing both input and output uncertainty in hydrological forecasting was attained by the postprocessing framework of the hydrometeorological ensemble forecast we developed 4 6 2 verification of the skill and reliability of the bma probabilistic forecasts after the bma method is employed to postprocess the multimodel hydrological forecasts the uncertainty of hydrological forecasts based on different data sources are analyzed via the uncertainty interval estimation method the skill and reliability of the bma probabilistic forecasts are measured by 3 statistical verification criteria cr b and d due to a large amount of data and the similarity of the results the hydrological forecasts with 1 day lead time in 2014 based on four data sources related to ecmwf and gefs are taken as examples for analysis in this section fig 14 the index evaluation results of the uncertainty interval in the validation period are shown in table 5 it can be seen from fig 14 that the bma hydrological forecasts obtained based on all four data sources have certain accuracy and their ranges of uncertainty intervals are reasonable in addition it is not difficult to see that the rationality of the 90 uncertainty interval generated by the bma results based on postprocessed precipitation is significantly better than the raw one and the observed streamflow points contained in the interval are also more than the latter combined with the results in table 5 we can find that the uncertainty interval obtained from the postprocessed precipitation within 7 days lead time has a higher coverage rate narrower bandwidth and smaller average deviation indicating that the hydrological models driven by the postprocessed precipitation can provide a more reliable uncertainty interval for the hydrological forecasts based on bma from the evaluation index results between the two precipitation data sources within the 3 days lead time the coverage rate based on ecmwf post is higher than gefs post while the latter is better in terms of average bandwidth and deviation there is little difference between the overall evaluation results of the two data sources meanwhile both two precipitation data sources after preprocessed can provide a reasonable uncertainty interval there are many successful applications of the bma method in hydrological postprocessing that can confirm our results such as duan et al 2007 studies the use of the bma scheme to develop more skillful and reliable probabilistic hydrologic predictions from multiple competing predictions made by several hydrological models and gain decent test results on three test basins in the united states some large scale studies with other methods on hydrological postprocessing also haveachievedgoodresults for instance papacharalampous et al 2019 apply machine learning quantile regression algorithms for probabilistic hydrological postprocessing in solving probabilistic hydrological modeling problems for 511 basins in the contiguous united states and provide large scale results and best practices to the problem of quantifying predictive uncertainty in hydrology 5 conclusion in this study we developed an integrated postprocessing framework of hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts based on epp seamless prediction and bma methods four scenarios for designing canonical events were evaluated to determine the optimal combination of canonical events taking the grb as the study area we also tested preprocessed ecmwf gefs and cfsv2 precipitation forecasts and integrated precipitation forecasts ecm cfs gefs cfs as inputs to hydrological models the xaj vic and dtvgm furthermore the bma method was utilized to generate probabilistic hydrologic forecasts from the three emulative individual forecasts based on the multisource precipitation forecasts thus postprocessed hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts for the grb were obtained in the four scenarios of canonical events the schemes considering the cumulative precipitation forecasts were obviously better than the scheme that only considered single day forecasts and the canonical events that considered information on the observed precipitation greatly improved the accuracy reasonable scenario design was shown to reduce various biases in the raw forecast and improve the accuracy of the final precipitation forecast in a comparison of preprocessed precipitation with the raw data regardless of the data sources the streamflow simulation results of hydrological models driven by the postprocessed precipitation were obviously better than those driven by raw data and the optimization degrees of different data sources were also different the long term streamflow simulation results driven by the integrated forecasts of cfs ecm and cfs gefs were significantly better than the results of cfsv2 as evidenced by the improved hydrological forecasting accuracy and extended forecast lead time in addition the uncertainty interval of bma forecasts based on the postprocessed precipitation is more reasonable than the raw one based on multisource forecast precipitation all the evaluation indices of the streamflow sequences obtained by the bma method were basically better than those of single hydrological models which indicates that the bma method can improve the hydrological forecasting accuracy to a certain extent at daily weekly and monthly scales in the design of canonical events the consideration of observed precipitation greatly improved the accuracy of the canonical event model we can conclude that observed precipitation or assimilated precipitation based on observed data have a great impact on the meteorological ensemble postprocessing method when extended to ungauged basins for research the design of canonical events can take into account remote sensing precipitation and build canonical event models another potential issue with the normal quantile conversion of forecasts and observations in meteorological ensemble postprocessing is that the correlation coefficient estimation method did not consider the correlation coefficients after zero values were eliminated from the precipitation or after the transformation of two precipitations into normal quantities which may introduce some uncertainty in the results credit authorship

3768,flood forecasting is a challenging task with major concerns that include forecast uncertainty and lead time this paper aims to comprehensively address the data correction issue for hydrological models by developing an integrated postprocessing framework for hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts based on three types of ensemble precipitation forecasts ecmwf gefs and cfsv2 this framework mainly comprises the ensemble preprocessor epp and the bayesian model averaging bma scheme 1 the epp eliminates various deviations from the ensemble precipitation forecasts with the canonical event model extracting useful predictive information and extending the lead time by linking the forecasts seamlessly and 2 the bma scheme develops more skillful and reliable probabilistic hydrological forecasts from ensemble streamflow forecasts generated by three hydrological models xaj vic and dtvgm driven by the postprocessed ensemble precipitation forecasts the ganjiang river basin was selected as a case study to examine the capacity and efficiency of our developed framework we found that the performance of the integrated postprocessing of hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts benefitted from a reasonable design of canonical events especially when the observed precipitation was factored into the canonical events streamflow forecasts with increased lead times and accuracy were obtained by employing postprocessed precipitation forecasts instead of raw forecasts as the input for the hydrological models we also found that the bma scheme further improved the forecast effect by generating more skillful and reliable forecasts than a single hydrological model which was verified by a series of statisticalindices and uncertainty analysis our results underscore the importance of considering both input and output for hydrological models in hydrological forecasting keywords multisource precipitation ensemble forecast hydrometeorological ensemble forecast ensemble preprocessor bayesian model averaging 1 introduction streamflow forecasting is gaining significant importance as a nonstructural measure for flood protection and is also helpful for drought resistance agricultural production and water resource management li et al 2011 schewe et al 2014 wei and hsu 2009 to accurately predict streamflow and provide useful information for flood control two major issues should be considered the reduction of forecast uncertainty and the extension of the lead time however classical hydrological forecasting basedon observed throughfall before the 1950s merely provides a single value deterministic forecast of future streamflow with limited lead time demeritt et al 2007 krzysztofowicz 2002 xuan et al 2009 withthedevelopmentofsocietyandtheprogressofscienceandtechnology e g the flourishing of numerical weather forecast nwp olsson et al 2016 classical hydrological forecasting highly affected by uncertainties in precipitation and hydrological models is unable to interpret the forecast uncertainty and satisfy the current demands for early flood warnings among many technical methods aimed at reducing the forecast uncertainty hydrometeorological ensemble forecasting which generates multiple individual numerical forecasts from different initial conditions and or different numerical model configurations hamill et al 2000 leith 1974 has been embraced as a significant way to improve forecast accuracy cloke and pappenberger 2009 zappa et al 2010 however raw model generated forecasts are still impacted by uncertainties from various sources including initial and boundary conditions model inputs and outputs and the model structure and parameters which prevents the final forecast results from being published directly this raises great interest in the development of statistical postprocessing methods for hydrometeorological elements to ameliorate these issues postprocessing methods are basically statistical models that establish a relationship between observations and the corresponding forecasts generated by meteorological or hydrological models the objective of these methods is to employ an established statistical relationship to reduce future systematic errors between the direct model output dmo forecasts and verifying observations hamill et al 2000 a sophisticated postprocessing method can not only reduce the biases and dispersion errors in raw forecasts but also retain their forecast skills in addition postprocessing methods can downscale raw forecasts to a particular scale to meet the needs of actual applications and generate ensemble members with the spatiotemporal and intervariable dependency of observations gneiting et al 2007 gneiting and katzfuss 2014 schaake et al 2007c yuan et al 2015 basically hydrometeorological postprocessing aiming at delivering more accurate forecasts either deterministic or probabilistic includes two aspects schaake et al 2007b addressing the uncertainties in the input meteorological data and the output of hydrological models meteorological ensemble forecast postprocessing which establishes a statistical relationship with the observed meteorological element information downscales inputs to fit with hydrological models quantifies the uncertainty and gives an ensemble forecast containing the uncertainty information li et al 2017 is widely used in ensemble forecast research the emergence of ensemble forecasts has promoted a surge in a series of bias correction methods the methods proposed at the early stage of this surge include perfect prognosis klein et al 1959 and model output statistics mos glahn and lowry 1972 these methods are successful and have attracted great interest in the meteorological field with many applications to a wide range of model variables and extensions to other types of regression functions like logistic regression or neural networks lemcke and kruizinga 1988 marzban 2003 vannitsem et al 2020 wilks 2009 in recent years many effective methods have been put forth such as the rank histogram calibration hamill 2001 thequantile regression qr bremnes 2004 the bayesian processor of output bpo reggiani and weerts 2008 the quantile mapping qm piani et al 2010 and the ensemble pre processor epp wu et al 2011 methods these postprocessing methods have proven to be efficient in optimizing the raw meteorological forecasts from numerical weather prediction olsson et al 2016 vannitsem et al 2018 specifically the epp which is a conditional distribution based method developed by schaake et al 2007a to generate temperature and precipitation ensemble forecasts from single value forecasts has been widely employed in the postprocessing of meteorological ensemble forecasts tao et al 2014 voisin et al 2010 wood and schaake 2008 based on establishing a relevant relationship between observations and forecasts the epp constructs ensemble forecasts using the schaake shuffle method clark et al 2004 schaake et al 2007a to maintain the spatiotemporal correlation of observations the multisource ensemble precipitation forecasts used in the study are from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf global ensemble forecast system gefs and second version of the climate forecast system cfsv2 although their effectiveness in hydrological forecasting has been verified jha et al 2018 liu et al 2017 roulin and vannitsem 2005 yuan et al 2013 it is still necessary to conduct statistical postprocessing of various deviations before they are used as input to hydrological models the postprocessing methods for hydrological forecasts are similar to those for meteorological forecasts the postprocessing techniques of hydrometeorological ensemble forecasting which is a statistical postprocessing method for hydrological and meteorological variables mendoza et al 2015 is also widely used and can be capable of enhancing the performance of hydrological forecasting by reducing the bias of input and output of hydrological models li et al 2017 conditional distribution based models e g the hydrological uncertainty processor hup krzysztofowicz and herr 2001 model conditional processor mcp todini 2013 and bayesian joint probability bjp model wang et al 2009 as well as regression based models e g the general linear model postprocessor glmpp zhao et al 2011 and kalman filter vrugt and robinson 2007 have been developed and are commonly used in hydrological forecasts moreover the proposal of nonparametric methods for hydrological forecasts evades parametric assumptions in postprocessing brown and seo 2010 and a study on using multiple nonparametric models on a large dataset postprocessed can be found in papacharalampous et al 2019 because errors in the predictions of individual models which consist of various sources e g model input data model parameter estimation and model structural deficiencies beven and freer 2001 tend to have mutually independent statistical properties ajami et al 2006 the multimodal averaging or combination method provides a different paradigm that can extract as much information as possible from the existing independently constructed individual models beven 2006 hagedorn et al 2005 shamseldin et al 1997 a variety of statistical postprocessing methods such as the simple average method hagedorn et al 2005 and bayesian model averaging bma raftery 1996 have been developed to address this issue in particular the bma method used not only to combine multiple models to obtain the optimal solution but also to calculate the uncertainty of a single model and model combination has been widely used in multimodal averaging and uncertainty analysis of hydrological forecasts duan et al 2007 liang et al 2013 madadgar and moradkhani 2014 many studies have shown that bma outperforms many other multimodel methods in generating accurate and reliable predictions clyde 1999 ellison 2004 raftery et al 2005 raftery and zheng 2003 most previous studies on hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts deal with uncertainty either by postprocessing the meteorological input or by postprocessing the hydrological output due to the efficiency and capacity of both methods in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of hydrological forecasts there is an interest to develop integrated postprocessing by considering both meteorological and hydrological ensemble forecasts simultaneously roulin and vannitsem 2015 conducted early work on this in simpler systems discussing when postprocessing of the input and the output is indeed effective in this study we aim to develop a postprocessing framework of hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts that can extract as much information as possible from the multisource input data and outputs of existing individual models the ganjiang river basin grb was selected as a case study area to examine the capacity and efficiency of our proposed method three types of ensemble precipitation forecasts ecmwf gefs and cfsv2 were considered and three generally used hydrological models xaj zhao 1992 vic liang 1994 and dtvgm xia et al 2003 were used the objectives of this study were to 1 develop the postprocessing framework of hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts to address the uncertainty in hydrometeorological elements and extend the lead time and 2 evaluate the efficiency of the postprocessing framework applied in the grb based on multisource precipitation the structure of this study is given as follows section 2 describes the postprocessing framework of hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts section 3 introduces the data and study area section 4 presents the results and discussion section 5 presents the conclusions 2 methodology the postprocessing framework of the hydrometeorological ensemble forecast fig 1 consists of three parts 1 a correction of multisource ensemble precipitation forecasts and seamless precipitation forecasts by the epp and schaake shuffle 2 a hydrological simulation based on three types of hydrological models and postprocessed ensemble precipitation forecasts for generating an ensemble of emulative streamflow forecasts and 3 the optimization of the ensemble streamflow forecasts by the bma method the detailed methods are briefly described below 2 1 postprocessing method of meteorological ensemble forecasting 2 1 1 ensemble preprocessor epp in this study the ensemble pre processor epp is utilized to convert the time series of single value quantitative precipitation forecasts qpf into corresponding ensemble forecasts of precipitation as input data for hydrological models the epp requires a long time series of historical forecast data and observed data as a basis for the correction of nwp as well as the quantification of uncertainty the main steps of the epp include the 1 establishment of the canonical events model 2 determination of the joint probability distributions of forecasts and observations 3 generation of probabilistic predictions of the observations conditioned on given forecasts and 4 ensemble construction by the schaake shuffle procedure the epp method for postprocessing qpfs is briefly described below see this article by ye et al 2017 for more details and specific steps of the epp method schaake et al 2007a proposed a method for constructing the canonical event model whose main aim is to extract useful information in forecasts to establish joint probability distributions between historical observations and forecasts for the correction of future forecasted precipitation a canonical event is defined as a meteorological event for a given location with a specific lead time and duration ye et al 2017 canonical events can be categorized as single time step canonical events sces e g events with time steps of one day the next day precipitation and composite time step canonical events cces e g multi day events like the average daily precipitation from day 1 to day 5 tao et al 2014 the former refers to events with one day precipitation or less and the latter refers to multiday precipitation events after the reasonable establishment of the canonical event model the marginal cumulative distribution functions cdf of forecasts x for a given canonical event can be expressed as 1 f x x 1 p x p x f xc x x 0 where p x denotes the forecasted probability of precipitation which can be determined by the ratio of the number of rainy events to the total number of events and f xc denotes the conditional distribution of the precipitation amount when precipitation occurs the marginal cdf of observations y is calculated similarly then we adopt a specific probability distribution function to interpret the functional form of the cdfs of x and y the gamma distribution function is used in this study due to its superior precipitation preprocessing results ye et al 2017 to facilitate the determination of the joint distribution of x and y the normal quantile transformation method nqt kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 krzysztofowicz 1997 is employed to convert x and y into standard normal space accordingly the joint distribution of x and y is transformed into the joint distribution f u v u v of the new random variables u and v which is assumed to be a bivariate standard normal distribution on the ground of the property of the bivariate standard normal the conditional probability distribution of v given u u f v u u v u can be expressed as 2 v u u n ρ uv u 1 ρ uv 2 where ρ uv denotes the correlation coefficient between u and v based on the conditional distribution formula f v u u v u can be calculated as 3 f v u u v u f u v u v f u u thus the probabilistic predictions of y for a given x can be derived by sampling the results of the random variables u and v in the normal space and the inverse of nqt 2 1 2 the schaake shuffle the conditional probabilistic forecasts generated by the method above lack the necessary space time continuity required for meteorological elements to be used in hydrological models therefore schaake shuffle is applied to construct the space time relationship of the ensemble forecasts based on years long observed precipitation taking the sces as an example the schaake shuffle procedure is divided into two steps 1 attaining the ascending ranks of the observations and sampled ensemble members in each time step and 2 shuffling the ensemble members to correspond the ranks of the observations for a new ensemble forecast with space time continuity compared with the procedure for the sces the procedure for the cces has an extra step namely splitting the cces into each time step according to specific ratios tao et al 2014 ye et al 2017 using the multiday precipitation information of the cces the splitting order of different canonical events can influence the postprocessing results this study adopts correlation coefficients of canonical events derived from forecasts and observations in ascending order to split canonical events the design of multiple scenarios of canonical events is utilized for various data sources of ensemble precipitation forecasts low correlation coefficients indicate subpar prediction skills 2 1 3 the seamless hydrologic ensemble forecast seamless predictions i e consistent predictions over successive lead times are becoming increasingly prominent in hydrometeorological forecasting when applied in the meteorological field the seamless prediction method covers weather to climate predictions hemri 2015 with weather forecasts from cfsv2 and climate predictions from gefs ecmwf this method is utilized to generate new ensemble precipitation data in the epp based on canonical events in this study this method consists of three parts 1 the conversion of the raw gefs ecmwf and cfsv2 time series into daily time series 2 the combination of the raw gefs ecmwf 1st 15th day data and the raw cfsv2 16th data to form a new data source gefs cfs ecm cfs and 3 the adoption of the gefs cfs ecm cfs to construct the canonical event model in the epp 2 2 postprocessing method of hydrological ensemble forecasting 2 2 1 generation of the hydrological model ensemble to test the postprocessing methods of hydrometeorological ensemble forecasting an ensemble of emulative predictions from several hydrological models of different mechanisms were produced we employed three hydrological models the xin anjiang model zhao 1992 xaj the variable infiltration capacity model liang et al 1994 vic and the distributed time variant gain model xia et al 2003 dtvgm these three models have been predominantly used in hydrological modeling in the study area du et al 2016 huang et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 yin et al 2018 and are described simply below the lumped xaj model is employed in this study this model which uses the storage capacity curve of river basins to calculate runoff yield and concentration values has been widely utilized in many humid and semihumid areas according to the lumped xaj model runoff starts when the soil moisture content in the aerated zone reaches the field capacity and is the difference between rainfall and steady infiltration considering the inhomogeneity of the rainfall and the underlying surface the xaj model divides the study basin into many subbasins calculates the runoff yield and confluence of each subbasin and then obtains the flow process of the basin outlet the vic model is a large scale grid based distributed hydrological model emphasizing the reciprocal power fed system that was proposed and developed in 1994 this model can either be executed in a water balance mode or in a water and energy balance mode which makes up for the deficiency of the traditional hydrological model in describing the heat process the vic model divides each grid unit into multiple land cover and elevation types by meshing the changes in the underlying surface and elevation of the basin the amount of evapotranspiration is calculated according to the penman equation monteith 1965 the surface runoff of the upper layer soil is calculated based on the varying infiltration curve the base flow in the lowest soil layer is simulated according to the nonlinear arno decay curve todini 1996 the unit hydrological principle within the grid unit and the linearized saint venant equation are used to simulate the confluence lohmann et al 1998 with a systematic relationship between precipitation and runoff as its core the dtvgm model based on the current watershed distributed hydrological simulation technology focuses on the influence of the time varying gain factor and water balance the dtvgm model combines spatial information with the nonlinear system theory which is a new technique it has clear hydrological meaning coupling the grid unit generation and the river network convergence process greatly shortening the model calculation furthermore the dtvgm model is simpler and practical than other hydrological physical mechanism models and conceptual models 2 2 2 bayesian model averaging bma bayesian model averaging bma is a statistical postprocessing method designed to yield more skillful and reliable probabilistic predictions than the raw ensemble members generated by multiple emulative models raftery et al 2003 madigan et al 1996 the basic principles of bma can be expressed as 4 p x y i 1 k p m i y p x m i y where p x y refers to the posterior distribution of the predictand x given the training data observations y also known as the weighted average of posterior distributions p x m i y under the ensemble of all considered model predictions m m 1 m 2 m k weighted by posterior model probability p m i y neuman 2003 p m i y reflects the compatibility between a certain ensemble member and the observations the better the prediction effect the greater the weight coefficient allocated to the model when we denote w i p m i y i 1 k w i 1 is obtained in the bma if the prediction results of the ith model obey the normal distribution x n μ σ i 2 of the mean m i and variance σ i 2 p x m i y obeys the normal distribution the posterior mean and variance of the bma prediction can be expressed as raftery et al 2005 5 e x m y i 1 k w i g x m i σ i 2 6 v a r x m y i 1 k w i m i j 1 k w j m j 2 i 1 k w i σ i 2 where i 1 k w i m i j 1 k w j m j 2 refers to the difference among the models σ i 2 refers to the variance between the model prediction m i and observation y and g y m i σ i 2 refers to the normal distribution of the mean m i and variance σ i 2 the parameters and the weights of the prediction result distribution of each hydrological model can be estimated via the expectation maximization em algorithm dempster 1977 which is an iterative method for maximum likelihood problems with incomplete data duan et al 2007 it is an effective method to calculate the bma model based on the assumption that every model prediction obeys the normal distribution duan et al 2007 raftery et al 2005 after the bma weight w i and model prediction error σ i 2 are calculated by the em algorithm the monte carlo method combined sampling method is used to generate the uncertainty interval of bma prediction at any time t chen et al 2000 in this paper we specify that the sample size at any time t is 100 after 100 samples of bma at any time t are sampled by the above method they are sorted from small to large the 90 prediction interval of bma is determined to the part between 5 and 95 quantiles thus we can implement the uncertainty analysis of hydrological modeling using the bma method the specific steps and more applications of the bma method can be found in duan et al 2007 2 3 verification strategy 2 3 1 statistical verification criteria for hydrometeorological forecasts to assess the postprocessing scheme of the hydrometeorological ensemble forecast we consider the following model performance measures the correlation coefficient r the root mean square error rmse the relative mean error rme the nash sutcliffe efficiency value nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the continuous rank probability skill score crpss brown et al 2010 the rank histogram is used to assess the reliability of the probability distribution given by the ensemble forecast if the ensemble forecast system is reliable in the rank histogram the probabilities of observations falling between any two ensemble members are basically the same a perfect rank histogram displays values uniformly distributed in equal probability bins the perfect rank value is 1 n 1 where n is the number of ensemble members 2 3 2 statistical verification criteria for uncertainty interval toachieve the goal of maximizing the predictive accuracy and reliability of hydrological probability forecast many ways can be adopted to measure these objectives in this study we take advantage of several criteria the coverage rate cr the average bandwidth b and the average deviation d table 1 shows the specific definition of these statistical measures 3 case study area and data 3 1 study area in this study the ganjiang river basin grb which is located between 24 20 28 45 n and 113 20 116 45 e is selected as the case study area fig 2 the grb with a total length of 766 km and a total drainage area of 80 948 km2 is the largest subbasin of the poyang lake river basin in the mid lower reaches of the yangtze river basin of china yin et al 2018 the ganjiang river originates in southwestern jiangxi province runs through the southern plains and finally falls into the yangtze river yang et al 2019 the whole study area is divided into 20 subbasins based on their physical geography and hydroclimatic conditions fig 2 the long term average annual precipitation in the grb is approximately 1590 mm and the precipitation between april and september accounts for approximately 80 of the total annual precipitation deng et al 2019 the mean annual air temperature in the study area is approximately 18 c and the highest and lowest air temperatures are 39 5 c and 5 8 c respectively yin et al 2018 the average annual discharge of the waizhou hydrological station 28 38 n 115 50 e which is at the outlet of the grb fig 4 is approximately 2200 m2 s floods occur frequently during the flooding season resulting in large socioeconomic losses yang et al 2019 3 2 observed meteorological and hydrological data from gauge stations in this study daily meteorological data including wind speed m s sunshine hours h average daily temperature c maximum daily temperature c minimum daily temperature c average relative humidity and daily precipitation mm day at 8 meteorological stations fig 2 during 1985 2015 were collected from the national climatic centre of the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn the homogeneity and quality of these data were checked and firmly controlled by the cma before their release to the scientific community yu et al 2014 the daily discharge data of the waizhou hydrological station during 1985 2015 were provided by the bureau of hydrology of the yangtze water resources commission 3 3 multisource precipitation ensemble forecast data in this study three precipitation datasets namely ecmwf gefs and cfsv2 were considered and are described in table 2 the ecmwf dataset which is produced by the thorpex interactive grand global ensemble tigge park et al 2008 uses 50 ensemble forecast members http apps ecmwf int datasets data tigge levtype sfc type pf provides daily precipitation ensemble forecasts of up to 15 days ahead with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 or 1 0 1 0 and is available from october 2006 to the present the gefs dataset is provided by the u s national center for environmental prediction ncep hamill et al 2013 https www emc ncep noaa gov emc pages numerical forecast systems gefs php the reforecast data adopted in this paper were generated using the gefs model version 9 0 1 the model provides a daily precipitation ensemble forecast with 11 ensemble forecast members of up to 8 days ahead from december 1984 to the present and has a spatial resolution of 1 0 1 0 the cfsv2 also released by the ncep https cfs ncep noaa gov cfsv2 downloads html gives precipitation predictions with various time scales ranging from hours to months and is updated every 5th day saha et al 2014 the forecast runs go out to 9 months every day starting from 1982 to the present and have a spatial resolution of 0 938 0 938 in this study the period from 2007 to 2016 was used for the comprehensive consideration of the three datasets the datasets were interpolated into 8 meteorological stations by the inverse distance weighted idw algorithm according to longitude and latitude to obtain raw precipitation ensemble forecasts at the meteorological stations the areal precipitation based on the raw precipitation ensemble forecast in the subbasins was calculated using the thiessen polygon method because the time step of the raw cfsv2 data was different from the other two types of data daily forecasts of the raw cfsv2 data with the same time step as the other two data sources were obtained using the cubic polynomial interpolation method 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of the ensemble means of multisource precipitation forecasts the performances of the ecmwf gefs and cfsv2 precipitation forecasts were evaluated at all subbasins in comparison to observation data to prevent large numbers of zero values from influencing the daily precipitation data and avoid insufficient sample space a 15 day time window was adopted to cover forecasts before and after the forecast day 7 days before and after the forecast day fig 3 shows the pearson correlation coefficients between the multisource ensemble precipitation forecasts and observations at different lead times for each day of the year at 6 typical subbasins named m1 m4 m7 m12 m15 and m20 the correlation coefficients decrease by varying degrees with increasing lead time the ecmwf shows the best performance followed by the gefs and the cfsv2 gives the worst performance the lead time is also an important influencing factor that should be carefully considered the performance also varies largely at different lead times and different days of the year for the same precipitation dataset the ecmwf gefs shows the best correlation with the observations in spring and winter with a lead time within the first five days this is consistent with previous studies bao and zhao 2012 ran et al 2018 ye et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 in addition the ecmwf has a slightly stronger correlation with the observation data than the gefs but the correlation of the former is more variable than that of the latter over one year indicating the stability of gefs is slightly stronger than that of ecmwf this may be related to the initial perturbation methods of different ensemble forecast systems buizza 2019 the lowest correlation at short lead times between cfsv2 and observations may result from the climate prediction data character of cfsv2 which improves its performance in long term forecasting although some studies have implied that the forecasting ability of cfsv2 still leaves much to be desired at a short lead time luo et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 its long term forecast skill is comparatively credible ma et al 2016 thus this study attempts to merge it with the other two data sources for long term simulations using the meteorological seamless prediction method 4 2 design of canonical events prior work on the application of the epp method was in the design of canonical events the canonical event combination can effectively affect the postprocessing quality of epp as introduced in section 2 1 1 4 canonical event scenarios were constructed table 3 there were 10 canonical events per scenario and the maximum lead time was set at 15 days through this design we made better use of the precipitation information contained in the sces cces and historical observations for scenario 1 sces were applied in the first 5 canonical events and cces were used in the last 5 canonical events different from scenario 1 all canonical events in scenario 2 were designed using the cces to contain as much useful information for precipitation forecasting as possible for event 10 in this scenario all the precipitation forecast information for the lead time from 1 to 15 was taken into account and its average value was used for postprocessing scenario 3 was constructed with the fusion of observation precipitation data into the forecast precipitation which was expected to improve the forecast accuracy of the ensemble postprocessing therefore the observed precipitation information of the day was contained in scenario 3 in the table 1 indicated the use of 1 day of observed data furthermore the proportion of the precipitation information of historical observations was increased by using 3 days of observed data in scenario 4 to verify the rationality of the four scenarios this paper first analyzed the correlation between the scenarios and the observed precipitation subbasin m1 was taken as an example to show the results of the four scenarios for the ecmwf gefs and cfsv2 precipitation forecasts fig 4 shows that the correlation generally increases from scenario 1 to scenario 4 for each ensemble precipitation forecast dataset compared with scenario 1 the correlation coefficient significantly improves in scenario 2 similarly an improvement occurs between scenario 2 and scenario 3 4 this may be caused by the fact that half of the canonical events used in scenario 1 are sces while more cces are considered in the remaining scenarios another reason may be that the observed precipitation information included in scenario 3 and 4 greatly enhances the values of the correlation coefficient the premise of the canonical event model is to determine high correlation events from historical observations and forecasts and to build a statistical relationship lorenz s 1963 chaotic theory of atmospheric systems states that any forecast of meteorological elements over five days is unreliable and that unreliable is not equivalent to useless tao et al 2014 this is because even if it is impossible to avoid the time error of precipitation forecasting total precipitation may be forecasted skillfully in the long term this means that the cumulative precipitation still delivers useful information even when the correlation between single day precipitation forecasts and observations in the corresponding period is weak thus it makes sense to design cce as a canonical event moreover the construction of canonical events by using the relationship between forecasts and observations to enhance the forecast effect has proven effective ye et al 2017 this is consistent with the results in scenario 3 and 4 4 3 verification of the epp ensemble mean precipitation forecasts for utilizing the epp to eliminate various deviations from the ensemble precipitation forecasts several canonical event schemes which is the core of epp are designed in the previous section next three evaluation methods are used to assess the postprocessed results of epp on the ensemble precipitation forecasts 4 3 1 verification of the mean of the epp ensemble precipitation forecasts based on the canonical event model the ecmwf gefs and cfsv2 data were postprocessed by the epp method the mean values of ensemble precipitation forecast members formed by postprocessing were treated as deterministic forecasts compared with the observations the raw forecasts and preprocessed forecasts were labelled ecmwf raw ecmwf post gefs raw gefs post cfs raw and cfs post furthermore their performances were evaluated by the rme rmse and nse among the three types of raw forecasts under the four scenarios fig 5 the rme of gefs raw is the largest followed by cfs raw while ecmwf raw has the smallest rme the gefs raw with the largest overall bias presents the characteristics of overforecasting solow and broadus 1988 especially in scenario 1 where the canonical events are basically composed of sces the results show that the longer the lead time is the larger the rme and the worse the overforecasting will be the dataset most affected by canonical events is also gefs raw notably the rme of gefs raw decreases by nearly half from scenario 1 to 4 li et al 2019 in research on postprocessing methods also found that gefs raw experienced an obvious positive bias of 20 60 in the huai river basin china on the whole increases in the precipitation information and lead time considered by canonical events result in decreased dataset rme moreover because the rme of the three datasets after postprocessing was small that is approximately between 0 05 and 0 05 it will no longer be listed the nse and the rmse were also used to evaluate the quality of the data before and after postprocessing for the four scenarios fig 6 demonstrates that the nse increased and the rmse decreased as a whole from scenario 1 to 4 both rendering better performance for all postprocessed data this result suggests that canonical events that contained more precipitation information were conducive to improving the accuracy of ensemble precipitation forecasts among the three datasets the ecmwf performed the best in the evaluation with postprocessing techniques aiding the greatly enhanced accuracy in addition the improved yet limited overall accuracy of cfsv2 with long lead times illustrates its insensitivity to canonical events by synthesizing the performance of these indices we can conclude that on the premise that the epp method enhances the forecast accuracy the improvement of forecast accuracy has a strong relationship with the lead time and canonical events specifically the longer the lead time the lower the improvement of forecast accuracy the improvement for cces is significantly higher than that for sces the improvement of canonical events with observed precipitation information is also higher than that without observed precipitation information however there may not be enough observed data for reference in ungauged basins in terms of indicator performance the accuracy of scenario 4 which considers a high amount of observed precipitation information has a limited improvement compared with that of scenario 3 ye et al 2017 argue that the addition of too much observed data at the expense of useful forecast information is unnecessary we investigate this issue in combination with other indices in this study 4 3 2 verification of the distribution of the epp ensemble precipitation forecasts the distribution of the epp ensemble precipitation forecasts was examined using rank histograms based on the daily ensemble forecast members generated by the epp and the rank of the observed precipitation in the ensemble members the number of ensemble members generated by preprocessing method is not artificially selected but determined by the original precipitation ensemble forecast data source because the characteristic of the method is to extract the data on the same day of each year for daily analysis the number of ensemble members is the length of years of the data therefore ecmwf has 10 ensemble members after post processed and ncep s two data sources have 32 ensemble members after post processed here we only show the results for subbasin m1 as an example but the situations in the remaining subbasins are similar to the situation in m1 fig 7 shows that the rank histograms of ecmwf and gefs in scenario 3 are obviously more homogenized than those in the other scenarios whereas the rank histogram of cfsv2 displays a more even distribution across the bins in scenario 2 these results indicate a better distribution of the corresponding epp ensemble precipitation forecasts due to a lack of precipitation information the rank histograms for scenario 1 show uneven bins with the height first rising and then falling from the middle to the right which indicates that the integration of the ensemble forecasts is on the low side and overestimation of extreme precipitation exists for scenario 3 and 4 the rank histograms of cfsv2 which have a deep concave shape resulted from narrow forecast ranges indicating no skill at precipitation forecasting compared with scenario 3 the increase in the inhomogeneity of the rank histograms of ecmwf and gefs in scenario 4 indicates that the use of 1 day historical observations is sufficient this also validates the conclusion of the previous section that excessive sacrifice of forecast information for data on past observations is unnecessary 4 3 3 verification of the skill of the epp ensemble precipitation forecasts the crpss was used to evaluate the skill of the epp results of both raw and postprocessed precipitation data similar to the previous section only the results of subbasin 1 are given to illustrate the results fig 8 displays the crpss of raw and postprocessed precipitation forecasts from ecmwf and cfsv2 since the evaluation results of ecmwf and gefs are similar in this section we omit the latter for reducing verbosity and present it in the supplementary material fig s1 we can note that the crpss increases with increasing precipitation information from scenario 1 to 4 regardless of whether the data were postprocessed meanwhile these scores also exhibited great improvement by using postprocessed data under each scenario indicating that the epp can develop the predictive ability of ensemble precipitation forecasts in particular the decent results of ecmwf post and gefs post in scenario 3 and 4 present good potentials in short term forecasting this result could be attributed to their data characteristic of concentrating on shorter lead times however the excessively low crpss in scenario 1 indicates that this scenario is not suitable for the canonical event based ensemble postprocessing model combined with the aforementioned results in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 we can conclude that scenario 3 is most compatible with the ecmwf and gefs similarly scenario 2 is the best scheme for processing the cfsv2 therefore we selected these two scenarios to process corresponding ensemble precipitation forecasts aiming to drive hydrological models through the evaluation of ensemble average ensemble distribution and ensemble skill of postprocessing results we find that the correction result of the epp method for multivariate precipitation is reliable in the grb similarly ye et al 2017 employ the epp method with different canonical event models also improve the quality of multisource precipitation and obtain streamflow forecasts with longer lead times and higher accuracy using postprocessed precipitation forecasts in the yalong river basin china tao et al 2014 also evaluate how the epp method can enhance raw precipitation forecasts made by different nwp models archived in the tigge database in the huai river basin china 4 4 calibration and validation of the hydrological model ensemble to test the effect of hydrometeorological postprocessing by the epp and the bma for streamflow predictions we selected three hydrological models the xaj vic and dtvgm to simulate the hydrological process in the grb the whole period was divided into two subperiods the calibration period from 1985 to 2005 and the validation period from 2006 to 2016 the daily streamflow data in the outlet of the grb named the waizhou hydrostation were used to verify the streamflow simulation the efficiency of the model and the comparison between the observed and simulated streamflow are presented in fig 9 the performance indices are reasonably good illustrating the decent streamflow simulation skill of all three models in the study area the overall performance of the xaj is the best in both the calibration and validation periods the rme for vic and dtvgm indicates the daily streamflow process is underestimated whereas the rme for xaj shows slightly high simulation results vic has the largest rmse and thus the worst simulation effect of the peak value this may be due to the exclusion of the impact of water conservancy projects on streamflow in the basin in general the required accuracy of the streamflow simulation of the three models can be achieved via quality data input therefore all models can be used to carry out hydrological forecasting for the grb in combination with ensemble precipitation forecasts 4 5 ensemble verification of hydrological forecasting eight sets of precipitation data namely the ecmwf raw ecmwf post gefs raw gefs post cfs raw cfs post ecm cfs and gefs cfs were used to drive the three hydrological models xaj vic and dtvgm the ecm cfs and gefs cfs were generated by integrating ecmwf and gefs for the first 15 days and cfsv2 from day 16 to one month into the future the simulation results vary dramatically between different models and inputs we only display the evaluation results for the ecmwf and integrated precipitation in the text figs 10 and 11 and other results are presented in the supplementary material figs s2 and s3 notably the use of postprocessed ensemble precipitation data as input to the hydrological models achieves a better simulation effect than the use of raw data sources the quality of the ecmwf raw data driving the hydrological models is high as evidenced by the nse of 0 6 during the first 3 days in both the calibration and verification periods however its sensitivity varies among different models thus the xaj is highly recommended compared to the other two models although ecmwf raw is generally effective when applied to the vic the results are the most improved when ecmwf post is taken as the input the improvement effect is more obvious at long lead times the simulation performance of gefs raw indicates that the raw data quality is sufficient to drive hydrological models during a short lead time but the accuracy is greatly compromised with a long lead time the simulation effect of gefs raw may be slightly weaker than that of ecmwf raw however gefs post has a better improvement for streamflow simulation than ecmwf post moreover regardless of the hydrological model driven by cfs raw there is basically no forecasting skill at a daily scale in addition cfs post can improve the accuracy of hydrological forecasting to some extent regardless of the lead time length this is an advantage in hydrological forecasting driven by integrated ensemble precipitation forecasts the model performance indices in streamflow simulation based on cfs post cfs ecm and cfs gefs at a long time scale are shown in fig 11 generally nse and r display the same characteristics in terms of the time scale the evaluation results of the three hydrological models driven by the two types of integrated precipitation are significantly better than those based on cfs post only whether in the calibration or verification period the simulation results in the first half of the month are also better than those in the second half of the month which demonstrates that the forecast accuracy declines with the lead time according to the comparison among the models we can note that xaj has the best model performance and that vic has the second best performance with the utilization of cfs post cfs ecm and cfs gefs of the three data sources the sensitivity of cfs gefs varies the most among different models followed by that of cfs ecm the simulation results based on cfs ecm are slightly better than those based on cfs gefs but the overall difference is not notable during the verification period cfs post has the worst model performance indices due to the insufficient accuracy of the early lead time which can be compensated for by using gefs and ecmwf in other words integrated ensemble precipitation forecasts have better performance than cfs forecasts in weekly and monthly hydrological forecasting especially after processing 4 6 testing of the bma method 4 6 1 verification of the accuracy of the expected bma forecasts the bma method was applied to the transformed ensemble members to obtain a set of bma weights using all data from the training period based on the daily streamflow simulation results for the 15 day lead time of the three models driven by eight ensemble precipitation forecasts multimodel ensemble postprocessing was performed by calculating the weights of the simulation results of the three models for each type of driving data and lead time the bma probabilistic forecasts of the eight types of precipitation driving data for the 15 day lead time were obtained taking the gefs post as an example the bma weights of different hydrological models are shown in fig 12 the complete calculation results are presented in the supplementary material fig s4 using various ensemble precipitation forecasts with different lead times to drive separate models the allocation of bma weights differed one premise of the bma method is that bma weights should reflect relative model performance as shown visually individual model performance is roughly exhibited by the bma weights with the xaj weighed more heavily than other models especially for the last four types of driving data this means that xaj did slightly better than the other two models in daily streamflow simulation with these driving data which coincides with what we found in the previous two sections the weight allocated to vic is substantially greater than that allocated to dtvgm however the simulation accuracy of vic is not necessarily better than that of dtvgm this may be caused by the similarity of some calculation principles between vic and xaj for example both adopt the storage capacity curve to calculate runoff yield which makes the two forecast results have a certain correlation thus similar to xaj the weight allocation of vic is superior to that of dtvgm according to the bma weight allocation results we obtained the streamflow simulation results based on the bma scheme for each type of driving data for the daily lead time they were compared with the outputs of the single models the nse rmse r and rme were selected as the evaluation indices due to the insufficient accuracy of cfsv2 in the daily streamflow simulation the evaluation indices of the forecast results for the 1 day lead time based on the last four types of forecast precipitation data were taken as an example for comparison in table 4 although the simulation results based on bma are not optimal in every single index the overall evaluation of the bma streamflow simulation is better than that of the single models whether driven by ecmwf or gefs the performance of xaj is only second to that of bma which confirms that the bma weights do reflect model performance the evaluation results of each lead time in the calibration and validation periods based on bma and xaj are presented in fig 13 and other results of single models can be found in the supplementary material fig s5 the x axis shows the lead time and the y axis shows eight sets of precipitation data namely cfs ecm cfs gefs cfs raw cfs post ecmwf raw ecmwf post gefs raw and gefs post from top to bottom the first lines in fig 13 are the evaluation results in the calibration period and the second lines represent the results in the verification period in terms of input the cfs raw shows no signs of forecast skills by the single models or the bma scheme while the ecmwf post gefs post and integrated precipitation forecasts perform best on the whole in the streamflow simulation most notable is the enhanced simulation accuracy of ecmwf post and gefs post when used as driving data within the lead time of the first 5 days compared with the corresponding raw precipitation forecasts the slow attenuation of nse and the r values of the integrated precipitation forecasts within the lead time of the last ten days indicate their stability in streamflow simulation for longer lead times these findings prove the epp s ability to improve the accuracy of hydrological forecasting as well as the seamless prediction method s effectiveness in extending the lead time of precipitation forecasts a comparison of the index evaluation results of streamflow simulations based on the bma scheme and single models indicates that bma forecasts present better nse r values and rmse values in both the calibration and verification period and demonstrate significant simulation accuracy for partial lead times however bma forecasts fail to demonstrate a marked advantage over the results of single models in rme values experiences proved that the final streamflow forecasting results postprocessed by the bma scheme were not necessarily optimal compared to the results generated by every single model in every aspect dong et al 2011 yang et al 2018 the comparison of index results for the input data before and after postprocessing in every model validated the pronounced improvement of the streamflow forecast accuracy by epp from this angle by measuring the index results of single models and bma the bma method was found to be conducive to streamflow simulation accuracy hence the research objective of addressing both input and output uncertainty in hydrological forecasting was attained by the postprocessing framework of the hydrometeorological ensemble forecast we developed 4 6 2 verification of the skill and reliability of the bma probabilistic forecasts after the bma method is employed to postprocess the multimodel hydrological forecasts the uncertainty of hydrological forecasts based on different data sources are analyzed via the uncertainty interval estimation method the skill and reliability of the bma probabilistic forecasts are measured by 3 statistical verification criteria cr b and d due to a large amount of data and the similarity of the results the hydrological forecasts with 1 day lead time in 2014 based on four data sources related to ecmwf and gefs are taken as examples for analysis in this section fig 14 the index evaluation results of the uncertainty interval in the validation period are shown in table 5 it can be seen from fig 14 that the bma hydrological forecasts obtained based on all four data sources have certain accuracy and their ranges of uncertainty intervals are reasonable in addition it is not difficult to see that the rationality of the 90 uncertainty interval generated by the bma results based on postprocessed precipitation is significantly better than the raw one and the observed streamflow points contained in the interval are also more than the latter combined with the results in table 5 we can find that the uncertainty interval obtained from the postprocessed precipitation within 7 days lead time has a higher coverage rate narrower bandwidth and smaller average deviation indicating that the hydrological models driven by the postprocessed precipitation can provide a more reliable uncertainty interval for the hydrological forecasts based on bma from the evaluation index results between the two precipitation data sources within the 3 days lead time the coverage rate based on ecmwf post is higher than gefs post while the latter is better in terms of average bandwidth and deviation there is little difference between the overall evaluation results of the two data sources meanwhile both two precipitation data sources after preprocessed can provide a reasonable uncertainty interval there are many successful applications of the bma method in hydrological postprocessing that can confirm our results such as duan et al 2007 studies the use of the bma scheme to develop more skillful and reliable probabilistic hydrologic predictions from multiple competing predictions made by several hydrological models and gain decent test results on three test basins in the united states some large scale studies with other methods on hydrological postprocessing also haveachievedgoodresults for instance papacharalampous et al 2019 apply machine learning quantile regression algorithms for probabilistic hydrological postprocessing in solving probabilistic hydrological modeling problems for 511 basins in the contiguous united states and provide large scale results and best practices to the problem of quantifying predictive uncertainty in hydrology 5 conclusion in this study we developed an integrated postprocessing framework of hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts based on epp seamless prediction and bma methods four scenarios for designing canonical events were evaluated to determine the optimal combination of canonical events taking the grb as the study area we also tested preprocessed ecmwf gefs and cfsv2 precipitation forecasts and integrated precipitation forecasts ecm cfs gefs cfs as inputs to hydrological models the xaj vic and dtvgm furthermore the bma method was utilized to generate probabilistic hydrologic forecasts from the three emulative individual forecasts based on the multisource precipitation forecasts thus postprocessed hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts for the grb were obtained in the four scenarios of canonical events the schemes considering the cumulative precipitation forecasts were obviously better than the scheme that only considered single day forecasts and the canonical events that considered information on the observed precipitation greatly improved the accuracy reasonable scenario design was shown to reduce various biases in the raw forecast and improve the accuracy of the final precipitation forecast in a comparison of preprocessed precipitation with the raw data regardless of the data sources the streamflow simulation results of hydrological models driven by the postprocessed precipitation were obviously better than those driven by raw data and the optimization degrees of different data sources were also different the long term streamflow simulation results driven by the integrated forecasts of cfs ecm and cfs gefs were significantly better than the results of cfsv2 as evidenced by the improved hydrological forecasting accuracy and extended forecast lead time in addition the uncertainty interval of bma forecasts based on the postprocessed precipitation is more reasonable than the raw one based on multisource forecast precipitation all the evaluation indices of the streamflow sequences obtained by the bma method were basically better than those of single hydrological models which indicates that the bma method can improve the hydrological forecasting accuracy to a certain extent at daily weekly and monthly scales in the design of canonical events the consideration of observed precipitation greatly improved the accuracy of the canonical event model we can conclude that observed precipitation or assimilated precipitation based on observed data have a great impact on the meteorological ensemble postprocessing method when extended to ungauged basins for research the design of canonical events can take into account remote sensing precipitation and build canonical event models another potential issue with the normal quantile conversion of forecasts and observations in meteorological ensemble postprocessing is that the correlation coefficient estimation method did not consider the correlation coefficients after zero values were eliminated from the precipitation or after the transformation of two precipitations into normal quantities which may introduce some uncertainty in the results credit authorship

3769,microbial communities are essential roles in aquatic ecosystems which participate in a number of biogeochemical processes and are vital for the protection and ecological remediation of water environment mathematical models have been demonstrated to be highly advantageous for investigating the composition functions and metabolic behaviors of microbial community moreover advances in molecular biology tools have provided sufficient information for numerical simulation of microbial community structure and dynamics which contribute to the rapid developments of microbial modelling approaches however models focusing only on the metabolic processes of microbial community exist nonnegligible drawbacks when applying in aquatic ecosystems they are not capable to simulate the hydrodynamic processes in flowing water which would significantly change the composition and functions of microbial community thus incorporating hydrodynamic processes into microbial models are vital for the in depth investigation of aquatic microbial community in this review latest developments on microbial modelling approaches have been summarized to demonstrate how different approaches have been adapted to highly dynamic context to unravel the characteristics of microbial community in the aquatic ecosystems furthermore present limitations of different modelling strategies have been discussed and several future development directions have been provided to make the simulation of microbial community in aquatic ecosystem to greater depth and accuracy keywords microbial community aquatic ecosystems flow structure metabolic dynamics 1 introduction microbial communities are vital features of aquatic ecosystems and are widely distributed their composition can vary which endow them with various ecological and environmental functions rivett and bell 2018 trevathan tackett et al 2021 there is a strong correlation between the functions of microbial communities and several biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems for instance material and energy transport organic matter degradation and nutrient cycling which make microbial communities crucial to sustain healthy aquatic ecosystems li et al 2020 stegen et al 2016 meanwhile composition and functions of microbiomes are influenced by varieties of environmental factors such as light temperature ph hydraulic structure as well as the types and concentrations of pollutants in aquatic ecosystems fang et al 2017 gobet et al 2012 therefore revealing the fate of microbial communities under multiple environmental stressors and impacts of microbial communities on biogeochemical processes are essential for the improvement of water quality and the protection of aquatic ecosystem health given the prevalence and importance of microbiomes in the past decades much effort has been invested in observational and experimental technologies to unravel the composition functions and metabolic processes of microbial communities kelsic et al 2015 shabarova et al 2021 vandeputte et al 2017 with the development of researching approaches especially with the advent of next generation sequencing the research objects of microbial communities have shifted from biomass to species abundance and even genetic materials such as genes enzymes and messenger rna li et al 2017 louca et al 2016 reed et al 2014 advanced sequencing tools have provided a growing source of data for studying spatial and temporal variations in the phylogenetic structure and geochemical function of aquatic microbial communities reed et al 2015 such insights are vital for quantitively evaluating and predicting the characteristics of microbial communities and associated biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems which could be accomplished with the application of mathematical modeling methods lauderdale et al 2020 shen et al 2021 wood et al 2020 mathematical models are widely used to analyze and predict complex systems in science and engineering as well as to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to quantify processes liu et al 2021a woolway et al 2021 wu et al 2021b several different modeling strategies have been applied to simulate composition and functions of microbial communities and crosstalk between microbiomes and observable environmental variables coyte et al 2015 friedman et al 2017 reed et al 2014 hui et al 2021 these modelling approaches can be categorized into two categories ecological models and metabolic models ecological models predict associations among different species and the changes of species abundance over time with the basis of sequence data coyte et al 2015 faust and raes 2012 friedman et al 2017 while metabolic models aim to simulate the dynamic behavior of cellular metabolism supported by data of different functional units such as genes enzymes and cells hui et al 2021 li et al 2017 louca et al 2016 reed et al 2014 in aquatic ecosystems with conspicuous flow the ultimate goals of mathematical modelling approaches are to simulate the transport and metabolic processes of microbial communities under distinctive hydrodynamic conditions and eventually make a prediction of water quality the water flow in different aquatic ecosystems would facilitate diverse hydrodynamic processes in addition to the ubiquitous longitudinal flow of rivers caused by gravity and the ocean current caused by monsoon there are a variety of other flow regimes caused by specific context such as the vertical flow in deep reservoirs caused by temperature gradients huang and zhang 2021 zhao et al 2016 and recirculating flow in rivers resulted from strong shear force between water and bank cook et al 2020 drouin et al 2021 rubin et al 2020 the complicated hydrodynamic conditions would directly determine the transport processes such as mass transfer between different phases water column and sediment molecular diffusion and hydrodynamic dispersion which can turn transport processes into the rate limiting steps and even the bottleneck for the biogeochemical processes li et al 2020 murray et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a therefore integrating hydrodynamic processes into microbial modelling approaches is essential to accurately capture the behaviors of microbial community in aquatic ecosystems this review aims to summarize the modelling approaches which were mainly published in the past decade and could predict the characteristics of microbial community under the flowing context of aquatic ecosystems to keep the scope of the review manageable only the models which have already been applied in aquatic ecosystem with conspicuous water flow and to study microbial community capable of transporting along with the water flow such as planktonic microorganisms and biofilms attached to suspended load sediment are selected in this review these models provide new insight into structure and dynamics of microbial community and reveal the underlying mechanisms of microbial metabolic processes in aquatic ecosystems modelling frameworks governing equations and underling mechanisms of each model would be described first then some application examples from literature would be discussed to exhibit the modification of modelling structure to adapt and simulate the characteristics of aquatic ecosystems finally advantages and challenges of these modelling approaches for studying microbial community in aquatic ecosystems would be detailed analyzed this review provides the first systematic summary of modelling approaches for simulating microbial community in aquatic ecosystems which would provide vital information for the evaluation and prediction of water environmental quality and guide the design of ecological remediation solutions 2 ecological modelling microorganisms do not exist in isolation but form complex networks through various ecological interactions antoniewicz 2020 faust and raes 2012 advanced sequencing technology could provide abundant data such as 16s rrna gene sequence data and metagenomic data for the in depth analyses of ecological interactions hsu et al 2019 kong et al 2018 with this basis ecological models have been developed to boost microbiome analysis beyond taxonomic assignment and abundance evaluation ecological models can be divided into models of microbial associations and models of microbial dynamics varying in the modelling purposes and governing processes gorter et al 2020 liu et al 2021b perez garcia et al 2016 models of microbial associations focus on correlations between different species mainly in term of co occurrence and co exclusion of microorganisms to obtain the association network and models of microbial dynamics simulate growth rates of species and interactions among species to obtain the changes of species over time li et al 2015 tan et al 2019 vieira silva and rocha 2010 wang et al 2021 2 1 models of microbial associations simulation of microbial associations starts from the microbial abundance matrix which is also mentioned as abundances of different operational taxonomic units otus abundances of otus can be extracted from raw 16s rrna sequence data which is a complicated multi step procedure relying on sequence clustering and reference databases faust and raes 2012 qin et al 2010 after abundance matrix have been obtained microbial associations between different otus i e co occurrence and co exclusion are computed with a suitable similarity or distance measuring method deng et al 2012 manirajan et al 2018 nyirabuhoro et al 2021 the common outcomes of these methods are microbial association networks where nodes represent otus and edges illustrate the significant relationship among them fig 1 robustness measure is applied then to calculate natural connectivity of the network through systematic or random removal of nodes which could quantify the alternative routes in the complicated network the computational approaches have experienced rapid developments in the past decade and these approaches vary in pre processing methods of raw sequence data and methods for calculating microbial associations a number of analytical tools facilitating the pre processing of raw sequence data have been developed in the past decade such as vegan dixon 2003 ade4 gonzalez and knight 2012 and quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime caporaso et al 2010 with the differences in usage of pre processing methods relative or absolute otu counts can be input for the analysis of microbial associations some researches even transfer otu data into synthetic otu data to avoid different numerical problems preheim et al 2016 proposed a method to cluster otu into different groups to investigate spatially correlated microorganisms in a deep lake ecosystem with gradients of environmental factors they used hierarchical clustering to group otus into different groups based on the similarity of the distributions of otus across depths and named the new groups as operational ecological units oeus further community characteristics and associations were conducted with basis of oeus calculation methods of microbial associations have a long history numerous measuring methods have been proposed in pervious researches including classical statistical methods such as pearson spearman bray curtis distance and kullback leibler dissimilarity and methods based on graphical models such as neighborhood and inverse covariance selection faust and raes 2012 kurtz et al 2015 proposed a statistical method for the inference of microbial ecological networks coupling a graphical model inference framework the method was meant to overcome technical challenges faced by traditional statistical tools including spurious calculation results of microbial associations because of relative and dependent otu counts and overlook of additional correlation information because of limited otu counts always hundreds of otus considered in calculating methods the proposed method was named as spiec easi sparse inverse covariance estimation for ecological association inference which transforms the field of compositional data analysis and then estimates the interaction graph from transformed data using neighborhood selection or sparse inverse covariance selection the method has reproducibly predicted previously unknown microbial associations using the measured sequence data the modelling methods of microbial associations have been applied to a range of communities from human body communities babaei et al 2018 david et al 2014 to soil communities bittihn et al 2020 brewer et al 2017 to aquatic communities huber et al 2020 in aquatic ecosystems with conspicuous flow the modelling methods have been significantly modified association networks were built not only for describing links of microorganisms within the same group or among different groups but also for exhibiting the correlation between microorganisms and various environmental factors such as light temperature concentrations of chemical materials and especially the hydraulic conditions huber et al 2020 investigated the characteristics of bacterioplankton metacommunity in floodplain river ecosystem where the hydraulic conditions varied significantly among different phases four sampling campaigns lasting 10 days each were performed in the floodplain during a low water phase a low water phase coupled with the sedimentological pulse a high water phase and an extraordinary high water phase to study community assembly and microbial associations among different hydraulic phase the co occurrence networks were constructed twice one considering all samples from four hydraulic phases together and the other considering every single hydraulic phase separately such procedures could exhibit the influence of hydraulic conditions on microbial associations simulation of microbial associations and the inferred networks can be considered as static models of microbial communities which exhibit the community status at a given time point however the majority of ecological laws can only be obtained with the models describing how microbial community changes over time the static results may not represent the practical rules in the dynamic environments especially in aquatic ecosystems besides though the networks could provide efficient and vital information about co occurrence or co exclusion of species it can not provide explanations for the underlying mechanism there may be totally different reasons accounting for the associations among different species e g biochemical dependencies and fictional similarities between species all of theses drawbacks call for dynamic modelling methods to further investigate dynamic rules of microbial community and the underlying mechanism responsible for the associations between species 2 2 models of microbial dynamics the popular ecological strategy to investigate the dynamics of microbial community is to fit community models to sequence data of microbial communities and the generalized lotka volterra glv model is one of the most selected methods descheemaeker and de buyl 2020 joseph et al 2020 momeni et al 2017 the glv equations are first order non linear differential equations which can predict the abundances changes of the specific community members over time with the input of growth rates and interaction strength between different species in the microbial community the mathematical format of glv equations is as follow 1 d x i t dt x i t b i j 1 n a i j x j t where n is the number of different species xi t is the abundance of species i at time t bi is the growth rate of species i aij is the interaction strength between species i and j positive or negative the growth rate and interaction strength can either be obtained experimentally or can be estimated from time series data using network inference techniques faust and raes 2012 after the model has been established and all of the associated parameters have been determined the model can be applied to investigate microbial community characteristics and to simulate community behavior in altered conditions or at different time other than estimating time series community data a number of systems biology approaches have been developed to estimate the growth rates of microbial species to obtain the necessary parameters of the glv modelling method vieira silva and rocha 2010 associated microbial growth with genomic characteristics such as gene amplification adapted chromosomal organization and biased codon usage and the results illustrated that biased codon usage had a more significant correlation with growth rates compared to other factors evaluated based on this a growth rate predicting approach was developed and applied to calculate the growth rates of species in microbial communities from different environments this predicting approach has further been integrated into glv modelling method to simulate dynamics of microbial community in human gut soil and aquatic ecosystems tan et al 2019 the glv modelling method was proposed based on the laboratory experiments which ignored the interaction between microbial community and surrounding context however in aquatic ecosystem which is an open environment with relatively strong transport process the influence of environment factors would significantly shift the ecological processes governing the microbial community assembly and make a significant difference to microbial communities gao et al 2021 wu et al 2021a zhang et al 2019b li et al 2015 established a mathematical model combining deterministic and stochastic ecological processes to fully understand the effects of hydrodynamics on a microbial community with the basis of community sequence data the proposed model was a modification of glv equations which considered not only the dynamics processes within the local microbial community but also the immigration from source community and dispersal from neighbor fig 2 the governing equation was modified as follow 2 d x i t dt x i t s i n i b i j 1 n a i j x j t where si is the immigration rate of species from source community ni is the dispersal rate of species from neighbor community the results of this research suggested that the driving force of community assembly changed with the hydraulic conditions individual reproduction within local microbial community acted as a key role when flow velocity was low while cell migration became more pronounced as the flow velocity increased considering the complexity and changeability of aquatic microorganisms the dynamic modelling methods with the use of 16 s rrna sequence data have shown promise for studying changes of microbial communities over time li et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b however the modelling structure is still based on the statistic rules rather than the thermodynamic mechanisms of the metabolic processes besides though the sequence data could provide abundant information about microbial communities the quantification of species through sequence data persists a great deal of uncertainty which would make the simulation results inconvincible thus it is meaningful to develop more effective methods to exhibit in depth mechanism underlying various observed microbial processes and explain the growth dynamics of microbial communities and the dynamics of associated metabolic processes which will ultimately open the door to manipulate microbial communities for ecological remediation of aquatic ecosystems 3 metabolic modelling contrary to the ecological modelling approaches which mainly focus on correlations between different species based on the sequence data analysis metabolic modelling approaches focus on the mechanism of metabolic processes and aim to describe reaction fluxes as a function of associated metabolites and the quantified proxies of microbial community chan et al 2017 dias et al 2018 korem et al 2015 metabolic models can provide a deep insight into metabolic interactions between species and enable dynamic analysis and quantitative integration of metabolomic proteomic and transcriptomic data saa and nielsen 2017 with the development of molecular biology analysis tools modelling objects i e the proxies of microbial community have changed from biomass to genes enzymes and transcripts according to differences in modelling objects metabolic reactions in these models are described by different non linear rate laws which classify metabolic models into biomass scale modelling approaches gene centric modelling approaches and agent based modelling approaches 3 1 biomass scale modelling approaches the biomass scale modelling approaches are composed of a set of ordinary differential equations odes to describe the metabolic processes of the specific microbial species including consumption of substrate growth of microorganisms and production of metabolites van wey et al 2014 van wey et al 2016 the changes of microbial biomasses are constructed as functions of substrates and metabolite concentrations and the equations can be calculated through standard computer solvers munoz tamayo et al 2011 the biomass scale models can predict how the variables including biomasses of associated microorganisms concentrations of substrates and metabolic products change over time the most prevalent biomass scale modelling approaches are the monod equations and the michaelis menten equations which uses substrates concentrations and characteristic constants of microorganisms and chemical materials to simulate the growth rates of microorganism biomass and metabolic reaction rate respectively the governing equations can be described in the following form 3 μ μ max s k s s 4 v μ y where μ is the growth rate of the specific species biomass μmax is the maximum growth rate constant of the species s is the concentration of substrate ks is the half saturation constant of the substrate v is the reaction rate of the specific metabolic process and y is the yield of biomass with the consumption of substrate as is exhibited in the equations there are many characteristic constants which vary among different species and substrates thus the biomass scale modelling approaches were firstly established to simulate metabolic processes of laboratory experiments under mono culture or co culture with a few species amaretti et al 2007 munoz tamayo et al 2011 compared with laboratory culture experiment the aquatic ecosystem is an open context with complicated transport processes and metabolic pathways with the addition of flow induced transport processes odes should be modified into partial differential equations to describe the changes of microorganism biomass and chemical concentration in different flow directions marzadri et al 2012 applied advection dispersion equations and monod equations to simulate nitrogen dynamics within hyporheic zone the hyporheic zone is characterized by the sharp mass transfer between ground water and surface meanwhile it is also a hot spot with biogeochemical transformation of nitrogen compounds thus hydraulic modelling approach and biomass scale modelling approach were integrated in this research to simulate the nitrogen dynamics fig 3 the modified equation describing the changes of biomasses were modified as follow 5 b i t b i x b i y b i z μ max s k s s b i where bi is the biomass of species i the first three terms in the right side of the equation are the transport processes of the microorganisms which can be obtained through the computational fluid dynamics software a similar method was applied to simulate flow structure microorganism respiration and oxygen concentration in the sediment layer of river wang et al 2021 the transport part of the modelling approach was further developed to simulate the mass transfer between two different phases i e overlying water and sediment it is exhibited in the research that there existed a specific scaling relationship between the oxygen consumption rate of aerobic heterotrophs and reynolds number biomass scale modelling approaches mark the beginning of metabolic models which could describe the dynamic metabolic processes through explaining thermodynamic mechanism biomass scale models are mostly applied to the simulation of microorganisms of laboratory experiments in mono cultures or co cultures with a few species with the addition of hydraulic modelling methods the biomass scale models could exhibit the dynamics of a few species and specific metabolic pathways in aquatic ecosystems but requirements of numerous model parameters still limit the application of biomass scale models in addressing questions related to complicated dynamics of aquatic ecosystems kumar et al 2019 besides applying biomass as the proxy of microbial community could describe the changes of metabolic substrates and metabolites but the intracellular processes are overlooked which could make a great difference to metabolic processes thus further modelling approaches such as genome scale models described later in this review are required for deeper simulation of microbial dynamics in aquatic ecosystem 3 2 gene centric modeling approaches gene centric modeling approaches are built based on genetic information to capture the dynamic behavior of specific genes in the system the genetic materials such as genes enzymes are used as the proxies of microorganisms kreft et al 2017 different from the biomass scale models there is no need to distinguish the specific species harboring the genetic materials the microorganisms are grouped based on specific functional genetic materials and the models simulate the changes of the groups over time basile et al 2020 leander et al 2020 rodriguez et al 2020 in gene centric models genetic materials are the participants of different metabolic reactions the genetic materials would govern rates of different metabolic reactions meanwhile the abundances of genetic materials would change as the reactions progress the key component of gene centric models is the stoichiometric matrix describing the stoichiometry of all biochemical reactions in the metabolic network similar with biomass scale models the genetic materials are constructed as functions of metabolite concentrations through the modified monod equations which is related to the gibbs free energy released by the reaction catalyzed by the corresponding genetic materials louca et al 2016 reed et al 2014 gene centric modelling approach was first proposed by reed et al 2014 to simulate nitrogen dynamics and cryptic sulfur cycling in oxygen minimum zones omzs of the arabian sea the modelling structure consists of ten metabolic pathways and uses associated genes as the proxies of microorganisms the main purpose of the proposed model is to simulate the changes of genes abundances and chemical concentrations in the model microbial growth depends on substrate and nutrient availability and is described using monod equations with inhibition whereas the thermodynamic potential factor ft accounts for the chemical energy available to drive the metabolism accordingly the equation of gene production rate is shown as below 6 r j γ j â μ j â f t sreactant o f r e a c t i o n r c s k s c s xinhibitor o f r e a c t i o n r k x k x c x where γj is gene abundance μj is the specific growth rate cs is the concentration of reactant or nutrient s ks is the half saturation constant of reactant or nutrient s cx is the concentration of inhibitor and kx is the half saturation constant of inhibitor x in the equation s belongs to the set of all potentially limiting nutrients or substrates for the pathway associated with gene j whereas belongs to the set off all potential inhibitors this equation describes the rate at which j genes e g nitrite reductase nirk nitrate reductase narg dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsr are produced as a result of the metabolism associated with the gene then the equation of gene production rate is applied to describe changes of genes abundances and metabolites concentrations 7 γ j t λ γ j r j z k γ j z v γ j z 8 c s t j γ j s γ j e â r j n j â y δ g j γ j e z k c s z v c s z where λ is the mortality rate constant of a gene γj s is the stoichiometric coefficient for chemical species s in the reaction associated with gene j negative for reactant and positive for product γj e is the stoichiometric coefficient of the electron donor in the metabolism and y is biomass production per mole of electron donor and is a function of free energy yield roden and jin 2011 to better simulate the dynamic processes in the ocean both transport and transformation processes are included in the equations the first two terms in eq 2 and the first term of eq 3 can be considered as the reaction part while the last two terms of these two are the transport part as described in previous content a number of genetic materials can be applied as proxies of microorganisms in gene centric models louca et al 2016 presented a modelling structure including six functional genes eight metabolites and a number of metabolic pathways to simulate the nitrogen and sulfur dynamics in a seasonally omz the modelling approach extends the original gene centric model by applying associated mrnas into the system the simulation of mrnas was similar with genes their production rates were assumed to be proportional to the corresponding reaction rates and changes of mrnas were also subjected to transport and decay processes the modelling results of genes mrna and associated metabolites were compared to observed data which illustrated than the model could provide an accurate prediction of nitrogen and sulfur pathways in omzs li et al 2017 thought that enzymes catalyzed biogeochemical processes more directly than functional genes and the abundance of functional enzymes may be different from functional genes so they modified the original gene centric model to propose a new enzyme based model that can incorporate omics data to link microbial community functions with biogeochemical process kinetics rather than gene concentrations this model treats enzyme as time variable catalysts for biogeochemical reactions and applies a biogeochemical reaction network to incorporate intermediate metabolites the sequences of genes and proteins from metagenomes as well as those from the uniprot database were used for targeted enzyme quantification and to provide insights into the dynamic linkage among functional genes enzymes and metabolites that are required in the model the application of the model was demonstrated using denitrification as an example by comparing model simulation with measured functional enzymes genes denitrification substrates and intermediates in aquatic ecosystems with strong convection such as rivers and shallow lakes the transport processes caused by water flow would make a significant difference to the distribution of microbial communities and chemical materials which would shift the metabolic processes hui et al 2021 coupled the gene centric modelling approach into the convection diffusion equation to simulate the nitrogen dynamics in an urban channel confluence which is characterized by complicated structure resulted from the joining of two rivers with different flow directions changes of genes and chemical materials are controlled by flow induced transport processes and microorganism induced transformation processes together in the modelling structure fig 4 the governing equation describing changes of genetic materials was modified as follow 9 γ j t γ j x γ j y γ j z λ γ j r j where the first three terms in the right side of the equation are the transport processes of the genetic materials the proposed model was capable to capture multiphase mass transport microbial population dynamics and nitrogen transformation and accurately predict the genes abundances and nitrogen concentrations among different hydraulic regions in the confluence the gene centric modelling approaches are a meaningful trait of detecting and simulating the underlying mechanism of intracellular metabolic processes applying the genetic materials including genes enzymes and mrnas as the proxies of microbial communities and the modelling objects could significantly lower the requirements of parameters with the integration of hydrodynamic equations the gene centric modelling approaches could accurately capture the characteristics of microbial communities and predict metabolic processes in aquatic ecosystems however current detecting methods of genetic materials could only represent the presence but could not guarantee the activeness which would influence the accuracy of model results the measurements and quantification of genetic materials in aquatic ecosystems could be difficult and costly which may limit the use and population of gene centric models thus further developments in sequencing technology would improve the accuracy and guarantee the promotion of gene centric modelling approaches 3 3 agent based modelling approaches agent based models abms treats an aggregate of bacteria or a single cell which can also be referred to as individual based model ibm as an individual particle hellweger et al 2016a kreft et al 2017 such kind of hypothesis is in contrast to the biomass scale models and gene centric models where microbes or proxies are simulated as state variables abms focus on the dynamics of an aggregate of bacteria and simulate the activities of cells within the aggregate and interactions of aggregate with environment through computational models including game theory evolutionary programming and monte carlo methods activities of cells are mainly referred to as the evolution processes following the central dogma of biology such as transcription of genes synthesizes of dna and cell division interactions of aggregate with environment include the effects of environmental factors on aggregates and the response of cell aggregates to environmental factors through metabolic reactions shashkova et al 2016 abms simulate the behaviors of a number of such aggregates and the changes of the aggerates compose the changes of the whole microbial community together fig 5 hellweger 2009 applied abm to explore the interaction of virus and its host cyanobacteria in oceans the modelling approach focuses on the individual viruses and host cells and describes the underlying mechanisms of gene expression protein synthesis photosynthesis and events associated with infection at the molecular level the first step is transcription and can be described using the mrna mass balance 10 dmrna dt k s m r n a c l dna r n a p γ c k d m r n a m r n a μ g m r n a where mrna is the concentration of mrna ks mrna c is the transcription rate constant ldna is total dna length rnap is the concentration of cell rna polymerase and positively correlated with the growth rate γc is the activity i e transcription efficiency promoter strength for cell rnap and kd mrna is the mrna decay rate constant μg is the specific growth rate of mrna and the last term in eq 7 accounts for growth dilution then the protein mass balance is applied to illustrate translation 11 d p r o d t k s p mrna txl r p t k d p r o p r o μ p r o where pro is the protein concentration ks p is the protein synthesis rate constant mrna and txl are the mrna corresponding to pro synthesis and total mrna concentrations and rpt is the concentration of gene product the ribosomes kd pro is the pro degradation rate constant and µ is the specific growth rate of protein the modelling results were calibrated with the observed virus and host gene transcript and protein levels in the sargasso sea although the proposed model was meant to simulate the dynamics of viruses in an aquatic ecosystem the influences of environmental factor such as the ocean current on the simulated aggerates were ignored thus the simulation results were not verified with the practical data to better study ocean microbial biogeography hellweger et al 2016b made a modification to abm and took environmental factors into consideration they combined the influences of ocean currents on microbial transport processes and effects of temperature on metabolic processes into abm structure to simulate different individual cells in the global ocean the simulated abundances of microbe were compared with observations from qpcr the model was able to reproduce much of the observed biogeography including the relative increase of the warm adapted ecotype with emperature and seasonality at bermuda besides the results of model with and without microbial transport processes were compared which illustrated that considering the tranport processes would significantly increase the accuracy of abm abms are capable to capture the intra population heterogeneity since they treat cells or aggerates of cells as independent individuals which may own specific dynamic processes rather than treat the quantity features of microbial community as state variables they possess distinct advantages in simulating the dynamics of microbial communities with a few species however the characteristics of abms also contribute to the challenges that the simulation of abms is of high computational cost especially when exploring the dynamics of complex microbial ecosystems an et al 2009 vodovotz and an 2019 in aquatic ecosystems the strong transport processes would make the cell to cell interactions more complicated not only in overlying water but also between different phases diverse microbial species and complicated interactions would make the simulation of every single cell highly difficult therefore improvements especially simplification are required before abms can be widely applied to simulate large microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems 4 conclusions and perspectives a predictive modelling approach with the basis of on site sampling data or laboratory experimental results does not only reproduce what is observed in the practical situation it can also be used to predict the underlying behavior which cannot be directly detected and the situation which will happen in the future with recent focus on ecological remediation of aquatic ecosystems modelling tools that could provide insight into the evaluation of current environment situation and the prediction of the remediation effects have experienced rapid developments microbial modelling approaches have significant advantages in investigating the changing characteristics of microbial community under different environmental factors the modelling results can provide vital information from the perspective of basic components of aquatic ecosystems for the design and evaluation of ecological remediation processes however aquatic ecosystems are characterized by various hydrodynamics processes which would make a difference to distribution of microorganisms and eventually change the rates of biogeochemical processes therefore coupling hydrodynamic processes to microbial models are vital for the application in aquatic ecosystems here the merits of modelling based approaches combining hydrodynamic processes to understand microbial communities and associated metabolic processes in aquatic ecosystems have been highlighted the various studies and discussed in this review suggest that with the help of advancing detecting methods and development of computing power the modelling objects are getting more microscopic from biomass to a single cell while the modelling phenomena and scenes are getting more macroscopical from culture experiments to open ecosystems the modelling approaches reviewed above have all been applied to aquatic ecosystems and can efficiently assist in investigating the microbial communities and the complicated metabolic traits such as activation inhabitation stability and interactions with surrounding environments it is not probable to select an optimal method as all of the modelling approaches have both edges and drawbacks table 1 modelling methods should be selected under the consideration of method characteristics and research scenarios and purposes though the modelling approaches have experienced significant developments there are still some challenges critical to the wide application in aquatic ecosystems first of all is the validation and verification of the models most of the parameters used in the modelling approaches are obtained and summarized from laboratory culture experiments which might not suitable for natural ecosystems moreover aquatic ecosystems are open systems a number of unknown processes and sources are overlooked or not capable to be simulated in the modelling methods these factors would significantly influence the modelling accuracy therefore one of the priorities for future developments is to refine parameters or empirical equation suitable to different aquatic ecosystems the second and third factors are associated and they address the difficulty in acquiring necessary data and conducting mathematic calculation when applying the models to large scale research areas a large number of demanded data would make the detecting and measuring processes costly and the complicated dynamics of microbial communities would significantly increase the computational requirements thus the

3769,microbial communities are essential roles in aquatic ecosystems which participate in a number of biogeochemical processes and are vital for the protection and ecological remediation of water environment mathematical models have been demonstrated to be highly advantageous for investigating the composition functions and metabolic behaviors of microbial community moreover advances in molecular biology tools have provided sufficient information for numerical simulation of microbial community structure and dynamics which contribute to the rapid developments of microbial modelling approaches however models focusing only on the metabolic processes of microbial community exist nonnegligible drawbacks when applying in aquatic ecosystems they are not capable to simulate the hydrodynamic processes in flowing water which would significantly change the composition and functions of microbial community thus incorporating hydrodynamic processes into microbial models are vital for the in depth investigation of aquatic microbial community in this review latest developments on microbial modelling approaches have been summarized to demonstrate how different approaches have been adapted to highly dynamic context to unravel the characteristics of microbial community in the aquatic ecosystems furthermore present limitations of different modelling strategies have been discussed and several future development directions have been provided to make the simulation of microbial community in aquatic ecosystem to greater depth and accuracy keywords microbial community aquatic ecosystems flow structure metabolic dynamics 1 introduction microbial communities are vital features of aquatic ecosystems and are widely distributed their composition can vary which endow them with various ecological and environmental functions rivett and bell 2018 trevathan tackett et al 2021 there is a strong correlation between the functions of microbial communities and several biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems for instance material and energy transport organic matter degradation and nutrient cycling which make microbial communities crucial to sustain healthy aquatic ecosystems li et al 2020 stegen et al 2016 meanwhile composition and functions of microbiomes are influenced by varieties of environmental factors such as light temperature ph hydraulic structure as well as the types and concentrations of pollutants in aquatic ecosystems fang et al 2017 gobet et al 2012 therefore revealing the fate of microbial communities under multiple environmental stressors and impacts of microbial communities on biogeochemical processes are essential for the improvement of water quality and the protection of aquatic ecosystem health given the prevalence and importance of microbiomes in the past decades much effort has been invested in observational and experimental technologies to unravel the composition functions and metabolic processes of microbial communities kelsic et al 2015 shabarova et al 2021 vandeputte et al 2017 with the development of researching approaches especially with the advent of next generation sequencing the research objects of microbial communities have shifted from biomass to species abundance and even genetic materials such as genes enzymes and messenger rna li et al 2017 louca et al 2016 reed et al 2014 advanced sequencing tools have provided a growing source of data for studying spatial and temporal variations in the phylogenetic structure and geochemical function of aquatic microbial communities reed et al 2015 such insights are vital for quantitively evaluating and predicting the characteristics of microbial communities and associated biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems which could be accomplished with the application of mathematical modeling methods lauderdale et al 2020 shen et al 2021 wood et al 2020 mathematical models are widely used to analyze and predict complex systems in science and engineering as well as to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to quantify processes liu et al 2021a woolway et al 2021 wu et al 2021b several different modeling strategies have been applied to simulate composition and functions of microbial communities and crosstalk between microbiomes and observable environmental variables coyte et al 2015 friedman et al 2017 reed et al 2014 hui et al 2021 these modelling approaches can be categorized into two categories ecological models and metabolic models ecological models predict associations among different species and the changes of species abundance over time with the basis of sequence data coyte et al 2015 faust and raes 2012 friedman et al 2017 while metabolic models aim to simulate the dynamic behavior of cellular metabolism supported by data of different functional units such as genes enzymes and cells hui et al 2021 li et al 2017 louca et al 2016 reed et al 2014 in aquatic ecosystems with conspicuous flow the ultimate goals of mathematical modelling approaches are to simulate the transport and metabolic processes of microbial communities under distinctive hydrodynamic conditions and eventually make a prediction of water quality the water flow in different aquatic ecosystems would facilitate diverse hydrodynamic processes in addition to the ubiquitous longitudinal flow of rivers caused by gravity and the ocean current caused by monsoon there are a variety of other flow regimes caused by specific context such as the vertical flow in deep reservoirs caused by temperature gradients huang and zhang 2021 zhao et al 2016 and recirculating flow in rivers resulted from strong shear force between water and bank cook et al 2020 drouin et al 2021 rubin et al 2020 the complicated hydrodynamic conditions would directly determine the transport processes such as mass transfer between different phases water column and sediment molecular diffusion and hydrodynamic dispersion which can turn transport processes into the rate limiting steps and even the bottleneck for the biogeochemical processes li et al 2020 murray et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a therefore integrating hydrodynamic processes into microbial modelling approaches is essential to accurately capture the behaviors of microbial community in aquatic ecosystems this review aims to summarize the modelling approaches which were mainly published in the past decade and could predict the characteristics of microbial community under the flowing context of aquatic ecosystems to keep the scope of the review manageable only the models which have already been applied in aquatic ecosystem with conspicuous water flow and to study microbial community capable of transporting along with the water flow such as planktonic microorganisms and biofilms attached to suspended load sediment are selected in this review these models provide new insight into structure and dynamics of microbial community and reveal the underlying mechanisms of microbial metabolic processes in aquatic ecosystems modelling frameworks governing equations and underling mechanisms of each model would be described first then some application examples from literature would be discussed to exhibit the modification of modelling structure to adapt and simulate the characteristics of aquatic ecosystems finally advantages and challenges of these modelling approaches for studying microbial community in aquatic ecosystems would be detailed analyzed this review provides the first systematic summary of modelling approaches for simulating microbial community in aquatic ecosystems which would provide vital information for the evaluation and prediction of water environmental quality and guide the design of ecological remediation solutions 2 ecological modelling microorganisms do not exist in isolation but form complex networks through various ecological interactions antoniewicz 2020 faust and raes 2012 advanced sequencing technology could provide abundant data such as 16s rrna gene sequence data and metagenomic data for the in depth analyses of ecological interactions hsu et al 2019 kong et al 2018 with this basis ecological models have been developed to boost microbiome analysis beyond taxonomic assignment and abundance evaluation ecological models can be divided into models of microbial associations and models of microbial dynamics varying in the modelling purposes and governing processes gorter et al 2020 liu et al 2021b perez garcia et al 2016 models of microbial associations focus on correlations between different species mainly in term of co occurrence and co exclusion of microorganisms to obtain the association network and models of microbial dynamics simulate growth rates of species and interactions among species to obtain the changes of species over time li et al 2015 tan et al 2019 vieira silva and rocha 2010 wang et al 2021 2 1 models of microbial associations simulation of microbial associations starts from the microbial abundance matrix which is also mentioned as abundances of different operational taxonomic units otus abundances of otus can be extracted from raw 16s rrna sequence data which is a complicated multi step procedure relying on sequence clustering and reference databases faust and raes 2012 qin et al 2010 after abundance matrix have been obtained microbial associations between different otus i e co occurrence and co exclusion are computed with a suitable similarity or distance measuring method deng et al 2012 manirajan et al 2018 nyirabuhoro et al 2021 the common outcomes of these methods are microbial association networks where nodes represent otus and edges illustrate the significant relationship among them fig 1 robustness measure is applied then to calculate natural connectivity of the network through systematic or random removal of nodes which could quantify the alternative routes in the complicated network the computational approaches have experienced rapid developments in the past decade and these approaches vary in pre processing methods of raw sequence data and methods for calculating microbial associations a number of analytical tools facilitating the pre processing of raw sequence data have been developed in the past decade such as vegan dixon 2003 ade4 gonzalez and knight 2012 and quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime caporaso et al 2010 with the differences in usage of pre processing methods relative or absolute otu counts can be input for the analysis of microbial associations some researches even transfer otu data into synthetic otu data to avoid different numerical problems preheim et al 2016 proposed a method to cluster otu into different groups to investigate spatially correlated microorganisms in a deep lake ecosystem with gradients of environmental factors they used hierarchical clustering to group otus into different groups based on the similarity of the distributions of otus across depths and named the new groups as operational ecological units oeus further community characteristics and associations were conducted with basis of oeus calculation methods of microbial associations have a long history numerous measuring methods have been proposed in pervious researches including classical statistical methods such as pearson spearman bray curtis distance and kullback leibler dissimilarity and methods based on graphical models such as neighborhood and inverse covariance selection faust and raes 2012 kurtz et al 2015 proposed a statistical method for the inference of microbial ecological networks coupling a graphical model inference framework the method was meant to overcome technical challenges faced by traditional statistical tools including spurious calculation results of microbial associations because of relative and dependent otu counts and overlook of additional correlation information because of limited otu counts always hundreds of otus considered in calculating methods the proposed method was named as spiec easi sparse inverse covariance estimation for ecological association inference which transforms the field of compositional data analysis and then estimates the interaction graph from transformed data using neighborhood selection or sparse inverse covariance selection the method has reproducibly predicted previously unknown microbial associations using the measured sequence data the modelling methods of microbial associations have been applied to a range of communities from human body communities babaei et al 2018 david et al 2014 to soil communities bittihn et al 2020 brewer et al 2017 to aquatic communities huber et al 2020 in aquatic ecosystems with conspicuous flow the modelling methods have been significantly modified association networks were built not only for describing links of microorganisms within the same group or among different groups but also for exhibiting the correlation between microorganisms and various environmental factors such as light temperature concentrations of chemical materials and especially the hydraulic conditions huber et al 2020 investigated the characteristics of bacterioplankton metacommunity in floodplain river ecosystem where the hydraulic conditions varied significantly among different phases four sampling campaigns lasting 10 days each were performed in the floodplain during a low water phase a low water phase coupled with the sedimentological pulse a high water phase and an extraordinary high water phase to study community assembly and microbial associations among different hydraulic phase the co occurrence networks were constructed twice one considering all samples from four hydraulic phases together and the other considering every single hydraulic phase separately such procedures could exhibit the influence of hydraulic conditions on microbial associations simulation of microbial associations and the inferred networks can be considered as static models of microbial communities which exhibit the community status at a given time point however the majority of ecological laws can only be obtained with the models describing how microbial community changes over time the static results may not represent the practical rules in the dynamic environments especially in aquatic ecosystems besides though the networks could provide efficient and vital information about co occurrence or co exclusion of species it can not provide explanations for the underlying mechanism there may be totally different reasons accounting for the associations among different species e g biochemical dependencies and fictional similarities between species all of theses drawbacks call for dynamic modelling methods to further investigate dynamic rules of microbial community and the underlying mechanism responsible for the associations between species 2 2 models of microbial dynamics the popular ecological strategy to investigate the dynamics of microbial community is to fit community models to sequence data of microbial communities and the generalized lotka volterra glv model is one of the most selected methods descheemaeker and de buyl 2020 joseph et al 2020 momeni et al 2017 the glv equations are first order non linear differential equations which can predict the abundances changes of the specific community members over time with the input of growth rates and interaction strength between different species in the microbial community the mathematical format of glv equations is as follow 1 d x i t dt x i t b i j 1 n a i j x j t where n is the number of different species xi t is the abundance of species i at time t bi is the growth rate of species i aij is the interaction strength between species i and j positive or negative the growth rate and interaction strength can either be obtained experimentally or can be estimated from time series data using network inference techniques faust and raes 2012 after the model has been established and all of the associated parameters have been determined the model can be applied to investigate microbial community characteristics and to simulate community behavior in altered conditions or at different time other than estimating time series community data a number of systems biology approaches have been developed to estimate the growth rates of microbial species to obtain the necessary parameters of the glv modelling method vieira silva and rocha 2010 associated microbial growth with genomic characteristics such as gene amplification adapted chromosomal organization and biased codon usage and the results illustrated that biased codon usage had a more significant correlation with growth rates compared to other factors evaluated based on this a growth rate predicting approach was developed and applied to calculate the growth rates of species in microbial communities from different environments this predicting approach has further been integrated into glv modelling method to simulate dynamics of microbial community in human gut soil and aquatic ecosystems tan et al 2019 the glv modelling method was proposed based on the laboratory experiments which ignored the interaction between microbial community and surrounding context however in aquatic ecosystem which is an open environment with relatively strong transport process the influence of environment factors would significantly shift the ecological processes governing the microbial community assembly and make a significant difference to microbial communities gao et al 2021 wu et al 2021a zhang et al 2019b li et al 2015 established a mathematical model combining deterministic and stochastic ecological processes to fully understand the effects of hydrodynamics on a microbial community with the basis of community sequence data the proposed model was a modification of glv equations which considered not only the dynamics processes within the local microbial community but also the immigration from source community and dispersal from neighbor fig 2 the governing equation was modified as follow 2 d x i t dt x i t s i n i b i j 1 n a i j x j t where si is the immigration rate of species from source community ni is the dispersal rate of species from neighbor community the results of this research suggested that the driving force of community assembly changed with the hydraulic conditions individual reproduction within local microbial community acted as a key role when flow velocity was low while cell migration became more pronounced as the flow velocity increased considering the complexity and changeability of aquatic microorganisms the dynamic modelling methods with the use of 16 s rrna sequence data have shown promise for studying changes of microbial communities over time li et al 2015 zhang et al 2019b however the modelling structure is still based on the statistic rules rather than the thermodynamic mechanisms of the metabolic processes besides though the sequence data could provide abundant information about microbial communities the quantification of species through sequence data persists a great deal of uncertainty which would make the simulation results inconvincible thus it is meaningful to develop more effective methods to exhibit in depth mechanism underlying various observed microbial processes and explain the growth dynamics of microbial communities and the dynamics of associated metabolic processes which will ultimately open the door to manipulate microbial communities for ecological remediation of aquatic ecosystems 3 metabolic modelling contrary to the ecological modelling approaches which mainly focus on correlations between different species based on the sequence data analysis metabolic modelling approaches focus on the mechanism of metabolic processes and aim to describe reaction fluxes as a function of associated metabolites and the quantified proxies of microbial community chan et al 2017 dias et al 2018 korem et al 2015 metabolic models can provide a deep insight into metabolic interactions between species and enable dynamic analysis and quantitative integration of metabolomic proteomic and transcriptomic data saa and nielsen 2017 with the development of molecular biology analysis tools modelling objects i e the proxies of microbial community have changed from biomass to genes enzymes and transcripts according to differences in modelling objects metabolic reactions in these models are described by different non linear rate laws which classify metabolic models into biomass scale modelling approaches gene centric modelling approaches and agent based modelling approaches 3 1 biomass scale modelling approaches the biomass scale modelling approaches are composed of a set of ordinary differential equations odes to describe the metabolic processes of the specific microbial species including consumption of substrate growth of microorganisms and production of metabolites van wey et al 2014 van wey et al 2016 the changes of microbial biomasses are constructed as functions of substrates and metabolite concentrations and the equations can be calculated through standard computer solvers munoz tamayo et al 2011 the biomass scale models can predict how the variables including biomasses of associated microorganisms concentrations of substrates and metabolic products change over time the most prevalent biomass scale modelling approaches are the monod equations and the michaelis menten equations which uses substrates concentrations and characteristic constants of microorganisms and chemical materials to simulate the growth rates of microorganism biomass and metabolic reaction rate respectively the governing equations can be described in the following form 3 μ μ max s k s s 4 v μ y where μ is the growth rate of the specific species biomass μmax is the maximum growth rate constant of the species s is the concentration of substrate ks is the half saturation constant of the substrate v is the reaction rate of the specific metabolic process and y is the yield of biomass with the consumption of substrate as is exhibited in the equations there are many characteristic constants which vary among different species and substrates thus the biomass scale modelling approaches were firstly established to simulate metabolic processes of laboratory experiments under mono culture or co culture with a few species amaretti et al 2007 munoz tamayo et al 2011 compared with laboratory culture experiment the aquatic ecosystem is an open context with complicated transport processes and metabolic pathways with the addition of flow induced transport processes odes should be modified into partial differential equations to describe the changes of microorganism biomass and chemical concentration in different flow directions marzadri et al 2012 applied advection dispersion equations and monod equations to simulate nitrogen dynamics within hyporheic zone the hyporheic zone is characterized by the sharp mass transfer between ground water and surface meanwhile it is also a hot spot with biogeochemical transformation of nitrogen compounds thus hydraulic modelling approach and biomass scale modelling approach were integrated in this research to simulate the nitrogen dynamics fig 3 the modified equation describing the changes of biomasses were modified as follow 5 b i t b i x b i y b i z μ max s k s s b i where bi is the biomass of species i the first three terms in the right side of the equation are the transport processes of the microorganisms which can be obtained through the computational fluid dynamics software a similar method was applied to simulate flow structure microorganism respiration and oxygen concentration in the sediment layer of river wang et al 2021 the transport part of the modelling approach was further developed to simulate the mass transfer between two different phases i e overlying water and sediment it is exhibited in the research that there existed a specific scaling relationship between the oxygen consumption rate of aerobic heterotrophs and reynolds number biomass scale modelling approaches mark the beginning of metabolic models which could describe the dynamic metabolic processes through explaining thermodynamic mechanism biomass scale models are mostly applied to the simulation of microorganisms of laboratory experiments in mono cultures or co cultures with a few species with the addition of hydraulic modelling methods the biomass scale models could exhibit the dynamics of a few species and specific metabolic pathways in aquatic ecosystems but requirements of numerous model parameters still limit the application of biomass scale models in addressing questions related to complicated dynamics of aquatic ecosystems kumar et al 2019 besides applying biomass as the proxy of microbial community could describe the changes of metabolic substrates and metabolites but the intracellular processes are overlooked which could make a great difference to metabolic processes thus further modelling approaches such as genome scale models described later in this review are required for deeper simulation of microbial dynamics in aquatic ecosystem 3 2 gene centric modeling approaches gene centric modeling approaches are built based on genetic information to capture the dynamic behavior of specific genes in the system the genetic materials such as genes enzymes are used as the proxies of microorganisms kreft et al 2017 different from the biomass scale models there is no need to distinguish the specific species harboring the genetic materials the microorganisms are grouped based on specific functional genetic materials and the models simulate the changes of the groups over time basile et al 2020 leander et al 2020 rodriguez et al 2020 in gene centric models genetic materials are the participants of different metabolic reactions the genetic materials would govern rates of different metabolic reactions meanwhile the abundances of genetic materials would change as the reactions progress the key component of gene centric models is the stoichiometric matrix describing the stoichiometry of all biochemical reactions in the metabolic network similar with biomass scale models the genetic materials are constructed as functions of metabolite concentrations through the modified monod equations which is related to the gibbs free energy released by the reaction catalyzed by the corresponding genetic materials louca et al 2016 reed et al 2014 gene centric modelling approach was first proposed by reed et al 2014 to simulate nitrogen dynamics and cryptic sulfur cycling in oxygen minimum zones omzs of the arabian sea the modelling structure consists of ten metabolic pathways and uses associated genes as the proxies of microorganisms the main purpose of the proposed model is to simulate the changes of genes abundances and chemical concentrations in the model microbial growth depends on substrate and nutrient availability and is described using monod equations with inhibition whereas the thermodynamic potential factor ft accounts for the chemical energy available to drive the metabolism accordingly the equation of gene production rate is shown as below 6 r j γ j â μ j â f t sreactant o f r e a c t i o n r c s k s c s xinhibitor o f r e a c t i o n r k x k x c x where γj is gene abundance μj is the specific growth rate cs is the concentration of reactant or nutrient s ks is the half saturation constant of reactant or nutrient s cx is the concentration of inhibitor and kx is the half saturation constant of inhibitor x in the equation s belongs to the set of all potentially limiting nutrients or substrates for the pathway associated with gene j whereas belongs to the set off all potential inhibitors this equation describes the rate at which j genes e g nitrite reductase nirk nitrate reductase narg dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsr are produced as a result of the metabolism associated with the gene then the equation of gene production rate is applied to describe changes of genes abundances and metabolites concentrations 7 γ j t λ γ j r j z k γ j z v γ j z 8 c s t j γ j s γ j e â r j n j â y δ g j γ j e z k c s z v c s z where λ is the mortality rate constant of a gene γj s is the stoichiometric coefficient for chemical species s in the reaction associated with gene j negative for reactant and positive for product γj e is the stoichiometric coefficient of the electron donor in the metabolism and y is biomass production per mole of electron donor and is a function of free energy yield roden and jin 2011 to better simulate the dynamic processes in the ocean both transport and transformation processes are included in the equations the first two terms in eq 2 and the first term of eq 3 can be considered as the reaction part while the last two terms of these two are the transport part as described in previous content a number of genetic materials can be applied as proxies of microorganisms in gene centric models louca et al 2016 presented a modelling structure including six functional genes eight metabolites and a number of metabolic pathways to simulate the nitrogen and sulfur dynamics in a seasonally omz the modelling approach extends the original gene centric model by applying associated mrnas into the system the simulation of mrnas was similar with genes their production rates were assumed to be proportional to the corresponding reaction rates and changes of mrnas were also subjected to transport and decay processes the modelling results of genes mrna and associated metabolites were compared to observed data which illustrated than the model could provide an accurate prediction of nitrogen and sulfur pathways in omzs li et al 2017 thought that enzymes catalyzed biogeochemical processes more directly than functional genes and the abundance of functional enzymes may be different from functional genes so they modified the original gene centric model to propose a new enzyme based model that can incorporate omics data to link microbial community functions with biogeochemical process kinetics rather than gene concentrations this model treats enzyme as time variable catalysts for biogeochemical reactions and applies a biogeochemical reaction network to incorporate intermediate metabolites the sequences of genes and proteins from metagenomes as well as those from the uniprot database were used for targeted enzyme quantification and to provide insights into the dynamic linkage among functional genes enzymes and metabolites that are required in the model the application of the model was demonstrated using denitrification as an example by comparing model simulation with measured functional enzymes genes denitrification substrates and intermediates in aquatic ecosystems with strong convection such as rivers and shallow lakes the transport processes caused by water flow would make a significant difference to the distribution of microbial communities and chemical materials which would shift the metabolic processes hui et al 2021 coupled the gene centric modelling approach into the convection diffusion equation to simulate the nitrogen dynamics in an urban channel confluence which is characterized by complicated structure resulted from the joining of two rivers with different flow directions changes of genes and chemical materials are controlled by flow induced transport processes and microorganism induced transformation processes together in the modelling structure fig 4 the governing equation describing changes of genetic materials was modified as follow 9 γ j t γ j x γ j y γ j z λ γ j r j where the first three terms in the right side of the equation are the transport processes of the genetic materials the proposed model was capable to capture multiphase mass transport microbial population dynamics and nitrogen transformation and accurately predict the genes abundances and nitrogen concentrations among different hydraulic regions in the confluence the gene centric modelling approaches are a meaningful trait of detecting and simulating the underlying mechanism of intracellular metabolic processes applying the genetic materials including genes enzymes and mrnas as the proxies of microbial communities and the modelling objects could significantly lower the requirements of parameters with the integration of hydrodynamic equations the gene centric modelling approaches could accurately capture the characteristics of microbial communities and predict metabolic processes in aquatic ecosystems however current detecting methods of genetic materials could only represent the presence but could not guarantee the activeness which would influence the accuracy of model results the measurements and quantification of genetic materials in aquatic ecosystems could be difficult and costly which may limit the use and population of gene centric models thus further developments in sequencing technology would improve the accuracy and guarantee the promotion of gene centric modelling approaches 3 3 agent based modelling approaches agent based models abms treats an aggregate of bacteria or a single cell which can also be referred to as individual based model ibm as an individual particle hellweger et al 2016a kreft et al 2017 such kind of hypothesis is in contrast to the biomass scale models and gene centric models where microbes or proxies are simulated as state variables abms focus on the dynamics of an aggregate of bacteria and simulate the activities of cells within the aggregate and interactions of aggregate with environment through computational models including game theory evolutionary programming and monte carlo methods activities of cells are mainly referred to as the evolution processes following the central dogma of biology such as transcription of genes synthesizes of dna and cell division interactions of aggregate with environment include the effects of environmental factors on aggregates and the response of cell aggregates to environmental factors through metabolic reactions shashkova et al 2016 abms simulate the behaviors of a number of such aggregates and the changes of the aggerates compose the changes of the whole microbial community together fig 5 hellweger 2009 applied abm to explore the interaction of virus and its host cyanobacteria in oceans the modelling approach focuses on the individual viruses and host cells and describes the underlying mechanisms of gene expression protein synthesis photosynthesis and events associated with infection at the molecular level the first step is transcription and can be described using the mrna mass balance 10 dmrna dt k s m r n a c l dna r n a p γ c k d m r n a m r n a μ g m r n a where mrna is the concentration of mrna ks mrna c is the transcription rate constant ldna is total dna length rnap is the concentration of cell rna polymerase and positively correlated with the growth rate γc is the activity i e transcription efficiency promoter strength for cell rnap and kd mrna is the mrna decay rate constant μg is the specific growth rate of mrna and the last term in eq 7 accounts for growth dilution then the protein mass balance is applied to illustrate translation 11 d p r o d t k s p mrna txl r p t k d p r o p r o μ p r o where pro is the protein concentration ks p is the protein synthesis rate constant mrna and txl are the mrna corresponding to pro synthesis and total mrna concentrations and rpt is the concentration of gene product the ribosomes kd pro is the pro degradation rate constant and µ is the specific growth rate of protein the modelling results were calibrated with the observed virus and host gene transcript and protein levels in the sargasso sea although the proposed model was meant to simulate the dynamics of viruses in an aquatic ecosystem the influences of environmental factor such as the ocean current on the simulated aggerates were ignored thus the simulation results were not verified with the practical data to better study ocean microbial biogeography hellweger et al 2016b made a modification to abm and took environmental factors into consideration they combined the influences of ocean currents on microbial transport processes and effects of temperature on metabolic processes into abm structure to simulate different individual cells in the global ocean the simulated abundances of microbe were compared with observations from qpcr the model was able to reproduce much of the observed biogeography including the relative increase of the warm adapted ecotype with emperature and seasonality at bermuda besides the results of model with and without microbial transport processes were compared which illustrated that considering the tranport processes would significantly increase the accuracy of abm abms are capable to capture the intra population heterogeneity since they treat cells or aggerates of cells as independent individuals which may own specific dynamic processes rather than treat the quantity features of microbial community as state variables they possess distinct advantages in simulating the dynamics of microbial communities with a few species however the characteristics of abms also contribute to the challenges that the simulation of abms is of high computational cost especially when exploring the dynamics of complex microbial ecosystems an et al 2009 vodovotz and an 2019 in aquatic ecosystems the strong transport processes would make the cell to cell interactions more complicated not only in overlying water but also between different phases diverse microbial species and complicated interactions would make the simulation of every single cell highly difficult therefore improvements especially simplification are required before abms can be widely applied to simulate large microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems 4 conclusions and perspectives a predictive modelling approach with the basis of on site sampling data or laboratory experimental results does not only reproduce what is observed in the practical situation it can also be used to predict the underlying behavior which cannot be directly detected and the situation which will happen in the future with recent focus on ecological remediation of aquatic ecosystems modelling tools that could provide insight into the evaluation of current environment situation and the prediction of the remediation effects have experienced rapid developments microbial modelling approaches have significant advantages in investigating the changing characteristics of microbial community under different environmental factors the modelling results can provide vital information from the perspective of basic components of aquatic ecosystems for the design and evaluation of ecological remediation processes however aquatic ecosystems are characterized by various hydrodynamics processes which would make a difference to distribution of microorganisms and eventually change the rates of biogeochemical processes therefore coupling hydrodynamic processes to microbial models are vital for the application in aquatic ecosystems here the merits of modelling based approaches combining hydrodynamic processes to understand microbial communities and associated metabolic processes in aquatic ecosystems have been highlighted the various studies and discussed in this review suggest that with the help of advancing detecting methods and development of computing power the modelling objects are getting more microscopic from biomass to a single cell while the modelling phenomena and scenes are getting more macroscopical from culture experiments to open ecosystems the modelling approaches reviewed above have all been applied to aquatic ecosystems and can efficiently assist in investigating the microbial communities and the complicated metabolic traits such as activation inhabitation stability and interactions with surrounding environments it is not probable to select an optimal method as all of the modelling approaches have both edges and drawbacks table 1 modelling methods should be selected under the consideration of method characteristics and research scenarios and purposes though the modelling approaches have experienced significant developments there are still some challenges critical to the wide application in aquatic ecosystems first of all is the validation and verification of the models most of the parameters used in the modelling approaches are obtained and summarized from laboratory culture experiments which might not suitable for natural ecosystems moreover aquatic ecosystems are open systems a number of unknown processes and sources are overlooked or not capable to be simulated in the modelling methods these factors would significantly influence the modelling accuracy therefore one of the priorities for future developments is to refine parameters or empirical equation suitable to different aquatic ecosystems the second and third factors are associated and they address the difficulty in acquiring necessary data and conducting mathematic calculation when applying the models to large scale research areas a large number of demanded data would make the detecting and measuring processes costly and the complicated dynamics of microbial communities would significantly increase the computational requirements thus the
