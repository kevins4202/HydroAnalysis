22505,wind wave characteristics of the palk bay a semi enclosed water body are studied by the wave measurements carried out at 2 locations during a one year period the analysis of wave data sets shows that wind sea dominates the palk bay during 96 of the time and the contribution of swells are insignificant 4 in the palk bay wind speeds are low and act on a limited fetch of only a few kilometers and thus cause waves with small amplitudes short wave periods and short wavelengths in an annual cycle significant wave height varied from 0 2 to 1 9 m with an average of 0 6 m the mean wave periods are mostly concentrated in a narrow range 2 4 s with a large proportion 48 of the waves with a mean wave period less than 3 s in the southern part of the palk bay northerly waves are more energetic compared to the southerly waves the wave hindcast data reproduce significant wave height with reasonable accuracy with a positive bias of 0 08 m root mean square error of 0 3 m and scatter index of 0 5 when the forcing winds are from weather research and forecast wrf numerical model keywords semi enclosed water body wind sea mixed sea state north indian ocean wave hindcast 1 introduction knowledge of wave characteristics in shallow waters is required for coastal engineers working on navigational studies coastal protection and port development due to the large fetch high waves reaching up to several meters are generated in the oceans and big lakes during storm events komen et al 1996 and propagate to coastal areas anoop et al 2015 while in small to medium sized and semi enclosed water bodies high surface waves are sporadically generated by high wind events seibt et al 2013 in the semi enclosed basin the local wind generates waves due to the wind action over a small fetch and swell components propagating from distant storms penetrate through the openings resulting in multi peaked wave spectra hanson and phillips 1999 in the open ocean the multi peaked spectra observed are chiefly swell dominated arena and guedes soares 2009 kumar et al 2002 2014 whereas the waves in lakes and enclosed bay are locally generated the simulated wind waves in large lakes show a dominance of wind seas jin and ji 2001 moeini and etemad shahidi 2007 recently amrutha and sanil kumar 2017 observed that even in areas in the gulf of mannar gom swell dominance is observed due to the presence of swells from the southeast and south most studies dealing with modelling of wind generated surface waves in the indian waters focused on coastal areas remya et al 2012 amrutha et al 2016 and semi enclosed water bodies are not attempted palk bay pb is a shallow semi enclosed water body with a maximum water depth of 13 m located between the southeast coast of india and sri lanka the pb is located between 8 50 and 10 30 north latitudes and 78 50 and 80 30 east longitudes the width of pb ranges from 57 to 107 km and the length is around 150 km fig 1 the pb is considered to be one amongst the major sinks for sediments along with gom chandramohan et al 2001 sediments discharged by rivers and transported by the surf currents as littoral drift settle in this sink gowthaman et al 2013 studied the wave characteristics within the southern location in pb around dhanushkodi and found that wind seas dominate the southern portion of pb the northern portion of pb is exposed to the bay of bengal through shallow palk strait and hence the swells can enter the pb through this opening the characteristics of the waves in the northern pb are not known it is difficult to carry out the measurements at many locations in the pb to know the wave characteristics for areas devoid of measurements in many regions the wind wave climate is estimated generally using numerical models moeini and etemad shahidi 2007 however the fetch restrictions and a large number of influencing parameters make wind wave modelling over pb a difficult process earlier studies like those by Ã¶zhan and abdalla 1999 suggests that numerical modelling using european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim wind fields berrisford et al 2009 dee et al 2011 over small water bodies may give poor results this study therefore analyze the performance of available ecwmf wind data over pb and thereafter make an account over the wind wave climate of pb using wind fields from weather research and forecast wrf numerical model http www2 mmm ucar edu wrf users docs user guide v3 9 contents html the study by gowthaman et al 2013 shows that southern pb is dominated by wind seas and thus the numerical model delft3d wave module delft hydraulics 2011 with model domain covering the pb is used to simulate the waves and compared the results with the measured data since waves along the east coast of india is influenced by the north east monsoon october january the south west monsoon june september and the tropical cyclones during april may and october november the study is carried out for a period of one year due to the anomalous winds the sea level was raised depressed in the western eastern indian ocean during the negative positive indian ocean dipole iod events yamagata et al 2002 adding to this the north east monsoon with relatively higher wind speed would result in a higher significant wave height for understanding the influences of global events like la nina el nino and iod over palk bay the wave model data for the years 2010 which was observed to be a year of intense negative iod with a concurrent la nina and 2009 which was marked with a moderate el nino are examined 2 data and methodology 2 1 data a location at 10 m water depth off gopalapatnam location 9 53 59 n 79 18 93 e in the northwestern part of pb referred to as north buoy in this study representing the north palk bay npb and a location north of adam s bridge location 9 19 14 n 79 25 98 e at 12 m water depth referred to as south buoy representing the south palk bay spb are selected for the wave measurements fig 1 datawell directional waverider buoy datawell 2009 is used for the wave measurement from 1 march 2010 to 28 february 2011 three translational motions east west vertical and north south of the buoy are recorded at 1 28 hz 0 78125 s and the data covering 30 min are analyzed as one record wave spectrum is obtained with a high frequency cutoff at 0 58 hz through fast fourier transform cross and auto spectral densities of the 3 translational motions are estimated using a hanning window with 50 overlap vertical motion is measured in the range of 20 to 20 m with an accuracy of 3 and a resolution of 1 cm datawell 2009 significant wave height hs which is 4 m o and mean wave period tm02 which is m 0 m 2 are derived from the wave spectral moments here mn is the nth order spectral moment m n 0 f n s f df n 0 and 2 s f is the spectral energy density corresponding to frequency f the wave period related to the maximum spectral energy i e spectral peak period tp is estimated from the wave spectrum peak wave direction dp at the spectral peak is estimated based on circular moments kuik et al 1988 the meteorological convention is used for presenting the data of wave and wind direction 0 and 360 for wave wind coming from north 90 for east 180 for south 270 for west the time mentioned in the paper is utc and the local time is 05 30 h ahead of utc wind seas and swells from the measured buoy data are divided through the method described by portilla et al 2009 portilla et al 2009 proposed a 1 d algorithm on the assumption that the energy at peak frequency of a swell cannot be higher than the value of a pm spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 with the same peak frequency the algorithm calculates the ratio between the peak energy of a wave system and the energy of a pm spectrum at the same frequency and if the ratio is more than a threshold value of 1 the system is considered as wind sea else it is taken to be swell and a cut off frequency fc is determined swell parameters are estimated by integrating frequency ranging from 0 025 hz to fc and wind sea parameters are by integrating frequency from fc to 0 58 hz the waves measured at 2 m water depth both in gom and pb using the interocean s4 wave gauge from 9 september 2010 to 27 october 2010 is used to compare the wave characteristics in the nearshore waters the s4 was moored at 0 5 m above the seabed the s4 wave gauge records pressure that is converted into depth data and the data records are transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain using the fast fourier transform the data are sampled at a rate of 2 hz every 3 h and hs and tm02 are obtained from the wave spectrum the study area bathymetry was developed by merging digitized data from four naval hydrographic charts chart nos 358 nho 2003 316 nho 2006 317 nho 2006 and 3016 nho 2005 akpinar et al 2012 sylla et al 2010 shanas and kumar 2015 shanas and sanil kumar 2014 and many others suggest that with physical consistency and high temporal coverage of the re analyses the ecmwf wind data is one among the most accurate wind field available for the entire globe kumar et al 2013 compared wind stress estimates from era interim against in situ observations in the tropical indian ocean and found that the data captured good temporal variability with better performance than other reanalysis data the correlation coefficient was 0 86 however the grid resolution of the data is of the order of 80 km studies like those by hilburn et al 2003 and umesh et al 2017 suggests that with the coarse resolution it might be difficult to represent the dynamics of mesoscale convective systems as well as some local topographical features particularly in smaller domains meridional and zonal components of wind speed at 10 m height with intervals of 1 h and 6 h respectively derived using wrf and obtained era interim has been used to force wave model the wrf model is a sophisticated numerical weather prediction nwp model that solves the compressible non hydrostatic euler equations in a flux form on a mass based terrain following vertical coordinate system otkin et al 2007 ncep global 1 1

temperature sea surface temperature geopotential height otkin et al 2013 wrf model produces relatively fine spatial and temporal resolution wind data over 26 mandatory levels from 1000 hpa to 10 hpa the spatially and temporally varying wind fields from wrf were extracted with a spatial resolution of 3 km 3 km fig 2 shows the climatology of wind speed in different seasons over pb during 1979 2015 it is observed that the wind speeds are lower within the bay compared to those in the gulf of mannar and the coastal regions along the bay of bengal the annual average wind speed within the pb is 6 m s and the wind speed contours lie parallel with a decreasing trend towards the coast which could be related to the presence of landmass and associated orography besides wind climatology also indicates a higher wind speed along the southern regions of pb spb whereas the northern regions npb shows relatively weak wind speeds 2 2 modeling framework delft3d wave delft hydraulics 2011 model capable of computing wave generation by wind non linear wave wave interactions wave propagation and dissipation for a given bottom topography current field wind field and water level is employed for the study the wave model is the third generation swan wave model booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 version 40 41 the evolution of wave spectrum in swan is described by the spectral action balance equation which is 1 t n x c x n y c y n Ï c Ï n Î¸ c Î¸ n s Ï where cx cy cÏ and cÎ¸ are respective propagation velocities in the x y Ï n is the action density and Î¸ spaces Î¸ the wave direction Ï is the wave relative frequency s represents energy density and t represents time a resonance mechanism phillips 1957 and a feedback mechanism miles 1957 is used to describe the transfer of wind energy to the waves in the model the corresponding source term for these mechanisms is generally described as the sum together of the linear and exponential growth 2 sin Ï Î¸ a b e Ï Î¸ where a and b depend on wave frequency and direction and sin represents the wave energy generation by the wind the model boundaries are boundary1 south boundary2 east boundary3 north and boundary4 west hs mean wave direction Î¸ and mean wave period tm02 data extracted from the new ecmwf climate reanalysis era5 were defined along these boundaries along with spreading index the era 5 wave parameters applied at the south and west boundary and at the north and east boundary of the model is presented in fig 3 the measured wave data at 12 m water depth in the gulf of mannar gowthaman et al 2013 are overlaid on the southwest boundary data to know how the era5 parameters compare well with the measured data even though the distance between the era5 point and the buoy is around 15 km the era5 data compares well with the measured buoy data at 12 m water depth except in december january during which era5 overestimates the wave height due to the coarse resolution era5 does not represent the land north of dwr hence it might be why there is an overestimation of wave height when waves are coming from the north additional parameters defined include acceleration due to gravity g 9 81 m s2 and water density 1025 kg m3 model default values were set for bottom friction coefficient 0 067 m2 s3 and alpha 1 and gamma 0 73 of depth induced breaking white capping dissipation and refraction effects were also taken into consideration the spectral resolution consists of 25 intervals from 0 05 to 1 hz the directional discretization is done for 360 divided in 36 directions a rectangular computational grid with 400 x 393 in x and y directions respectively grid points was generated specifically for the domain the grid had a spatial resolution 400 m along the plain rgfgrid utility of the delft3d module was used for generating the grid while quickin utility was used for preparing and manipulating grid oriented data this grid was employed for the study throughout the study was carried out in 3 parts the first part aimed at evaluating the forcing wind data a set of 2 model runs were completed for a period of two months june and november 2010 these two months were chosen after careful assessment of the available buoy data both in the north and the south which marked the extreme wave conditions the first set of model run was forced with 10 m zonal and meridional wind components from the wrf numerical model while the second was forced with era interim wind data the winds from wrf are compared with the available aws data over mandapam 9 15 65 n 79 7 77 e and a good comparison of modelled meridional and zonal wind components is observed fig 4 the outputs hs and mean wave period were extracted and compared with measured buoy data both in the north and south three error measuring criteria were used for the quantitative evaluation of the degree of accuracy of model results the second part of the study aimed at understanding the wave characteristics in the palk bay and was based on the model run over the study area for a period of one year january 2010 december 2010 in consideration of the result from the first part of the study wind fields from numerical model wrf were employed all wave model parameterizations were set identical to the first part of the study the wave parameters were extracted from the output and were compared with the available buoy data in the third part of the study for the better understanding of the influences of global events like la nina el nino and iod over pb model runs were carried out for the years 2009 and 2010 after careful assessment of pb geographical position and possible global events that can influence the model runs were restricted for the months of october 2010 was observed to be a year of intense negative iod with a concurrent la nina while 2009 was marked with a moderate el nino the outputs extracted from 2 locations 9 53 59 n 79 18 93 e npb and 9 19 14 n 79 25 98 e spb were compared and inferred this part of the study presents only a primary assessment of the influence of global events in the wave climatology in palk bay long term assessment is required to understand the variability and associated mechanisms 2 3 error measuring

oi and pi stand for the observed and predicted value respectively and n represents the number of data 3 results 3 1 comparison of model results obtained with different wind sources the waves in the pb were predicted with reasonable accuracy during june and november when forced with wrf and era interim winds fig 5 the general patterns of the wave parameters are reasonably reproduced when compared with measurements in npb buoy the highest significant wave height was marked 1 83 m in june and 1 36 m in november the model run with era interim wind dataset as input modelled a maximum significant height of 1 12 m for june and 0 75 m for november in npb while the model run with wrf wind dataset gave better estimations with 1 46 m and 1 28 m respectively for june and november however both the models were observed to produce a negative bias of 0 29 m era interim dataset and 0 1 m wrf dataset during june and 0 24 m era interim dataset and 0 14 m wrf dataset during november table 1 the negative bias in wave height could be due to low wind speed fields produced by the input sources in spb the observed maximum significant wave height is 1 83 m during june the wave model run with era interim forcing was observed to produce a negative bias of 0 08 m while the other produced 0 06 m in significant wave height the bias values were 0 2 m and 0 1 m respectively for era interim based model run and wrf dataset based model run during november similar to the hindcast of significant wave height both cases under predicted the wave period at both npb and spb during both june and november 2010 a systematic bias is observed between the model and buoy mean wave period and could be due to different cut off frequency adopted in model and buoy low frequency cut off in the buoy is 0 025 hz and for the model it is 0 04 hz the wave parameters from the buoy data are estimated with low frequency cut off at 0 025 hz and 0 04 hz and found that there is no significant variation in the wave height in the present study area due to the fact that in the study area long period waves with frequency less than 0 04 hz are absent on the other hand model tm02 will tend to be lower than the observed one because it has weighted in more contribution from high frequency since the buoy data have a high frequency cut off at 0 58 hz whereas that for model is at 1 hz hence model results are obtained with high frequency cut off at 0 58 hz and compared with that at 1 hz and the variations in both height and period are observed fig 6 the variation is due to the presence of very low period wind seas less than 1 72 s especially in this region the comparison of the observed wave period with the model runs also showed that the model with wrf dataset was relatively better table 2 all the outputs were evaluated using other statistical parameters rmse and si too table 2 the wave parameters derived using fine resolution shows that outputs from fine resolution wrf winds are relatively better than those derived using era interim winds abdalla et al 1997 Ã¶zhan and abdalla 1999 ponce de leÃ³n and orfila 2013 langodan et al 2016 also found similar inferences when studying the regional scale enclosed basin ocean surface processes the wind speeds derived from global models could be insufficient due to their coarse resolutions however it is also to be understood that despite its relatively coarse resolution the era interim inputs were capable of reproducing the wave heights as salvaÃ§Ã£o et al 2014 states wrf outputs were observed to help hindcast most of the highs and lows of both significant wave height and wave period this study suggests that wrf generated wind components could be relatively better in generating the wave climatology over the region 3 2 comparison of simulation with observations at npb over an annual cycle the measured hs varied between 0 07 m and 1 87 m with an average of 0 59 m while the wave hindcast data ranged between 0 01 and 1 94 m with an average of 0 48 m the model run reproduces hs with reasonable accuracy with a positive bias of 0 09 m rmse of 0 3 m si of 0 5 correlation of 0 4 fig 7 at spb over an annual cycle the measured hs varied between 0 01 m and 1 8 m with an average value of 0 5 m while the wave hindcast data ranged between 0 01 and 1 87 m with an average of 0 4 m the calculated statistical parameters on significant wave height at spb were 0 06 0 24 0 45 and 0 5 respectively for bias rmse correlation and si the mean wave period measurements from the buoy ranged between 1 7s and 18s along npb and 1 7s 13s along spb at npb mean wave period modelled varied between 1s and 10 5s while at spb it varied between 0 8s and 15s a negative bias of 0 48s with an rmse of 0 48s correlation of 0 3 and si value of 0 24 was calculated along npb fig 7 along spb a negative bias of 0 82s correlation of 0 3 and si of 0 34 fig 7 was calculated mean wave direction also was computed with good accuracy with a reasonable error margin fig 7 relatively bigger values for error parameters at spb may be accounted to the complex bathymetry and influences of islands which needs to be examined in detail 3 3 wave dynamics in the palk bay in an annual cycle hs up to 1 87 m with a mean of 0 6 m and hmax up to 3 6 m are observed in the study area in one year period 44 of the time hs is less than 0 5 m and 90 of the time hs is less than 1 m the wave field in pb is mainly restricted the northeastern side of the pb is exposed to the waves arriving from the bay of bengal the sri lankan landmass is present in the south eastern side at a distance of 60 km from the measurement location in the northern location in the north direction indian landmass is present at 50 km and in the south direction rameshwaram island is present at a distance of 64 km fig 1 plots of the wave spectral energy density at the measurement locations inside the pb show the predominance of wind sea fig 8 a and b whereas swell dominance is observed in gom fig 8c some swells though weaker are apparent during the summer monsoon and these swells are from the east fig 8a and b wind seas are from the south southeast during 96 of the time during one year period sixty eight percent of the wave height was due to the wind seas and the remaining were the swells monthly average directional wave spectrum along npb shows that the energy maximums are confined to the two monsoon periods however the energy spread is confined only to a small angle for most of the period while the spread is more during the summer monsoon fig 9 the energy spread to lower frequencies is observed during december the mean wave periods are mostly concentrated in a narrow range of 2 4 s fig 8 a very large proportion up to 48 of waves are with mean wave periods below 3 s spectral peak period is less than 6 s during 96 of the time and long period waves tp 12 s are present during only 1 5 of the time fig 8a and b the water depth at the wave measurement location is 10 m and hence the measured waves will have depth influence the wavelength associated with the mean wave period l varied from 7 to 71 m and the d l ratio is more than 0 5 during most of the time indicating that the measured waves satisfy the deep water condition spm 1984 all the sea waves satisfy the deep water condition the ratio of depth and wavelength associated with the swell wave period varied from 0 09 to 0 28 which satisfies the transitional water condition spm 1984 most of the time the wind wave field is fetch limited and the mean wind waves periods are short 5 s in order to know the contribution of waves from different direction in the npb waves are separated into 3 categories i from 0 to 136 and from 324 to 360 representing waves from north northeast and east ii from 140 to 228 representing waves from southeast to southwest iii 232 320 waves from the southwest to northwest significant percentage of waves from north northeast during november to february fig 10 comparing to the north and northeasterly waves the southeast southwesterly waves are more energetic at npb in the spb the waves are separated into 2 categories i from 0 to 90 and from 270 to 360 representing waves from west northwest to northeast and east ii from 90 to 270 representing waves from southeast to southwest significant percentage of waves from northwest to northeast during november to february fig 11 comparing to the southerly waves the northerly waves are more energetic at spb during most of the time except during december february fig 12 shows the monthly average of significant wave height over the area from january 2010 till december 2010 the monthly averages of significant wave heights modelled shows high values in the pb during the southwest monsoon periods during the southwest monsoon period peaks of monthly averaged significant height are focused around the northeastern borders of the pb due to its closeness to the land and shallow bathymetry areas around adam s bridge southern pb shows relatively high significant wave height only in june and july the waves measured at 12 m and 2 m water depth both in the gom and pb indicates that in the gom high wave activity is present even at 2 m water depth whereas in the pb the waves at 2 m water depth is very low compared to that at 12 m water depth fig 13 the figure shows that as expected the waves reduce from 12 to 2 m in the gom with the same pattern but the waves are different in the pb and the wave intensity is very less at 2 m water depth in pb the wave measurements show that adam s bridge is acting as a wall since the passage between the pb and the gom is shallow with the depth not exceeding 2 m at any location most of this opening is shallower than 1 m the examination of the influences of global events on the waves in the semi enclosed pb indicates that during october 2009 the whole spatial stretch of pb was marked with relatively lower significant wave height whereas during october 2010 only the indian margins showed lower significant height fig 14 the difference between monthly means of significant wave heights at these locations marked a difference of 0 2 m for npb and spb 4 discussion and conclusion the wave climate variability over pb is governed by the diversified meteorological features active over the region pb being a semi enclosed basin wind speeds in the bay are low and act on a limited fetch of few kilometres and thus cause waves with short wave periods small amplitudes and short wavelengths measured data show that the wave characteristics are wind sea dominated the waves could be hindcasted with reasonable accuracy using the fine resolution wrf model wind data and with numerical wave model delft 3d the underestimation relatively more arising while using global wind data era interim could be related to the coarse spatial and temporal resolutions of wind fields salvaÃ§Ã£o et al 2014 however cavaleri 2009 explains that the missing wind peaks are not only due to resolution but due to the presently used formulations for nonlinear energy transfer which lead to too wide distributions in frequency and direction thereby reducing the input by the wind the limitation of the mesoscale model wrf in estimating the wind speed also could have lead to less accurate hindcasting of wave period further a detailed analysis of the present capabilities of the wave models in the inner and coastal seas is presented by cavaleri et al 2018 the gridded values of average significant wave height in each month of the data set are the basic climatology for all calculations woolf et al 2002 wave heights throughout pb are seasonal peaking in southwest monsoon seasons the high monthly averages of significant wave height fig 12 during monsoon periods show that the wave climatology over pb is governed by the indian monsoon northeast monsoon show relatively higher values for significant wave height along the central regions of pb this could be arising due to the orographic hindrance faced by winds from southwest during southwest monsoon the significant wave heights marked extremes and high variability along sri lankan coasts while along the indian coast it remained less diverse with relatively lower peaks the complex bathymetry along the southern regions and influences of various islands delft island kachchativu etc are found to invoke significant influence on wave climate over pb the geographical uniqueness of pb restrict the influences of swell waves from gom and bob even during monsoon periods and thereby behaving similar to nearly a closed water body these specialties aided in hindcasting mean wave direction with reasonable accuracy with pb being a shallow water basin shallow water processes are of high significance all over the area calibration and validation of wind fields against all possible measured data are recommended considering the fact that global events are making a significant influence on the wave height despite the swell restrictions makes it clear that despite the land boundedness and small domain influences of global phenomena are to be considered and evaluated for any effective study the reasons for relatively less accurate hindcast of wave period are due to the limitations in wind input complex bathymetry the difference in cut off frequency ranges between buoy and model and the possible errors

22505,wind wave characteristics of the palk bay a semi enclosed water body are studied by the wave measurements carried out at 2 locations during a one year period the analysis of wave data sets shows that wind sea dominates the palk bay during 96 of the time and the contribution of swells are insignificant 4 in the palk bay wind speeds are low and act on a limited fetch of only a few kilometers and thus cause waves with small amplitudes short wave periods and short wavelengths in an annual cycle significant wave height varied from 0 2 to 1 9 m with an average of 0 6 m the mean wave periods are mostly concentrated in a narrow range 2 4 s with a large proportion 48 of the waves with a mean wave period less than 3 s in the southern part of the palk bay northerly waves are more energetic

of wave characteristics in shallow waters is required for coastal engineers working on navigational studies coastal protection and port development due to the large fetch high waves reaching up to several meters are generated in the oceans and big lakes during storm events komen et al 1996 and propagate to coastal areas anoop et al 2015 while in small to medium sized and semi enclosed water bodies high surface waves are sporadically generated by high wind events seibt et al 2013 in the semi enclosed basin the local wind generates waves due to the wind action over a small fetch and swell components propagating from distant storms penetrate through the openings resulting in multi peaked wave spectra hanson and phillips 1999 in the open ocean the multi peaked spectra observed are chiefly swell dominated arena and guedes soares 2009 kumar et al 2002 2014 whereas the waves in lakes and enclosed bay are locally generated the simulated wind waves in large lakes show a dominance of wind seas jin and ji 2001 moeini and etemad shahidi 2007 recently amrutha and sanil kumar 2017 observed that even in areas in the gulf of mannar gom swell dominance is observed due to the presence of swells from the southeast and south most studies dealing with modelling of wind generated surface waves in the indian waters focused on coastal areas remya et al 2012 amrutha et al 2016 and semi enclosed water bodies are not attempted palk bay pb is a shallow semi enclosed water body with a maximum water depth of 13 m located between the southeast coast of india and sri lanka the pb is located between 8 50 and 10 30 north latitudes and 78 50 and 80 30 east longitudes the width of pb ranges from 57 to 107 km and the length is around 150 km fig 1 the pb is considered to be one amongst the major sinks for sediments along with gom chandramohan et al 2001 sediments discharged by rivers and transported by the surf currents as littoral drift settle in this sink gowthaman et al 2013 studied the wave characteristics within the southern location in pb around dhanushkodi and found that wind seas dominate the southern portion of pb the northern portion of pb is exposed to the bay of bengal through shallow palk strait and hence the swells can enter the pb through this opening the characteristics of the waves in the northern pb are not known it is difficult to carry out the measurements at many locations in the pb to know the wave characteristics for areas devoid of measurements in many regions the wind wave climate is estimated generally using numerical models moeini and etemad shahidi 2007 however the fetch restrictions and a large number of influencing parameters make wind wave modelling over pb a difficult process earlier studies like those by Ã¶zhan and abdalla 1999 suggests that numerical modelling using european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim wind fields berrisford et al 2009 dee et al 2011 over small water bodies may give poor results this study therefore analyze the performance of available ecwmf wind data over pb and thereafter make an account over the wind wave climate of pb using wind fields from weather research and forecast wrf numerical model http www2 mmm ucar edu wrf users docs user guide v3 9 contents html the study by gowthaman et al 2013 shows that southern pb is dominated by wind seas and thus the numerical model delft3d wave module delft hydraulics 2011 with model domain covering the pb is used to simulate the waves and compared the results with the measured data since waves along the east coast of india is influenced by the north east monsoon october january the south west monsoon june september and the tropical cyclones during april may and october november the study is carried out for a period of one year due to the anomalous winds the sea level was raised depressed in the western eastern indian ocean during the negative positive indian ocean dipole iod events yamagata et al 2002 adding to this the north east monsoon with relatively higher wind speed would result in a higher significant wave height for understanding the influences of global events like la nina el nino and iod over palk bay the wave model data for the years 2010 which was observed to be a year of intense negative iod with a concurrent la nina and 2009 which was marked with a moderate el nino are examined 2 data and methodology 2 1 data a location at 10 m water depth off gopalapatnam location 9 53 59 n 79 18 93 e in the northwestern part of pb referred to as north buoy in this study

for the wave measurements fig 1 datawell directional waverider buoy datawell 2009 is used for the wave measurement from 1 march 2010 to 28 february 2011 three translational motions east west vertical and north south of the buoy are recorded at 1 28 hz 0 78125 s and the data covering 30 min are analyzed as one record wave spectrum is obtained with a high frequency cutoff at 0 58 hz through fast fourier transform cross and auto spectral densities of the 3 translational motions are estimated using a hanning window with 50 overlap vertical motion is measured in the range of 20 to 20 m with an accuracy of 3 and a resolution of 1 cm datawell 2009 significant wave height hs which is 4 m o and mean wave period tm02 which is m 0 m 2 are derived from the wave spectral moments here mn is the nth order spectral moment m n 0 f n s f df n 0 and 2 s f is the spectral energy density corresponding to frequency f the wave period related to the maximum spectral energy i e spectral peak period tp is estimated from the wave spectrum peak wave direction dp at the spectral peak is estimated based on circular moments kuik et al 1988 the meteorological convention is used for presenting the data of wave and wind direction 0 and 360 for wave wind coming from north 90 for east 180 for south 270 for west the time mentioned in the paper is utc and the local time is 05 30 h ahead of utc wind seas and swells from the measured buoy data are divided through the method described by portilla et al 2009 portilla et al 2009 proposed a 1 d algorithm on the assumption that the energy at peak frequency of a swell cannot be higher than the value of a pm spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 with the same peak frequency the algorithm calculates the ratio between the peak energy of a wave system and the energy of a pm spectrum at the same frequency and if the ratio is more than a threshold value of 1 the system is considered as wind sea else it is taken to be swell and a cut off frequency fc is determined swell parameters are estimated by integrating frequency ranging from 0 025 hz to fc and wind sea parameters are by integrating frequency from fc to 0 58 hz the waves measured at 2 m water depth both in gom and pb using the interocean s4 wave gauge from 9 september 2010 to 27 october 2010 is used to compare the wave characteristics in the nearshore waters the s4 was moored at 0 5 m above the seabed the s4 wave gauge records pressure that is converted into depth data and the data records are transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain using the fast fourier transform the data are sampled at a rate of 2 hz every 3 h and hs and tm02 are obtained from the wave spectrum the study area bathymetry was developed by merging digitized data from four naval hydrographic charts chart nos 358 nho 2003 316 nho 2006 317 nho 2006 and 3016 nho 2005 akpinar et al 2012 sylla et al 2010 shanas and kumar 2015 shanas and sanil kumar 2014 and many others suggest that with physical consistency and high temporal coverage of the re analyses the ecmwf wind data is one among the most accurate wind field available for the entire globe kumar et al 2013 compared wind stress estimates from era interim against in situ observations in the tropical indian ocean and found that the data captured good temporal variability with better performance than other reanalysis data the correlation coefficient was 0 86 however the grid resolution of the data is of the order of 80 km studies like those by hilburn et al 2003 and umesh et al 2017 suggests that with the coarse resolution it might be difficult to represent the dynamics of mesoscale convective systems as well as some local topographical features particularly in smaller domains meridional and zonal components of wind

the spatially and temporally varying wind fields from wrf were extracted with a spatial resolution of 3 km 3 km fig 2 shows the climatology of wind speed in different seasons over pb during 1979 2015 it is observed that the wind speeds are lower within the bay compared to those in the gulf of mannar and the coastal regions along the bay of bengal the annual average wind speed within the pb is 6 m s and the wind speed contours lie parallel with a decreasing trend towards the coast which could be related to the presence of landmass and associated orography besides wind climatology also indicates a higher wind speed along the southern regions of pb spb whereas the northern regions npb shows relatively weak wind speeds 2 2 modeling framework delft3d wave delft hydraulics 2011 model capable of computing wave generation by wind non linear wave wave interactions wave propagation and dissipation for a given bottom topography current field wind field and water level is employed for the study the wave model is the third generation swan wave model booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 version 40 41 the evolution of wave spectrum in swan is described by the spectral action balance equation which is 1 t n x c x n y c y n Ï c Ï n Î¸ c Î¸ n s Ï where cx cy cÏ and cÎ¸ are respective propagation velocities in the x y Ï n is the action density and Î¸ spaces Î¸ the wave direction Ï is the wave relative frequency s represents energy density and t represents time a resonance mechanism phillips 1957 and a feedback mechanism miles 1957 is used to describe the transfer of wind energy to the waves in the model the corresponding source term for these mechanisms is generally described as the sum together of the linear and exponential growth 2 sin Ï Î¸ a b e Ï Î¸ where a and b depend on

Î¸ and mean wave period tm02 data extracted from the new ecmwf climate reanalysis era5 were defined along these boundaries along with spreading index the era 5 wave parameters applied at the south and west boundary and at the north and east boundary of the model is presented in fig 3 the measured wave data at 12 m water depth in the gulf of mannar gowthaman et al 2013 are overlaid on the southwest boundary data to know how the era5 parameters compare well with the measured data even though the distance between the era5 point and the buoy is around 15 km the era5 data compares well with the measured buoy data at 12 m water depth except in december january during which era5 overestimates the wave height due to the coarse resolution era5 does not represent the land north of dwr hence it might be why there is an overestimation of wave height when waves are coming from the north additional parameters defined include acceleration due to gravity g 9 81 m s2 and water density 1025 kg m3 model default values were set for bottom friction coefficient 0 067 m2 s3 and alpha 1 and gamma 0 73 of depth induced breaking white capping dissipation and refraction effects were also taken into consideration the spectral resolution consists of 25 intervals from 0 05 to 1 hz the directional discretization is done for 360 divided in 36 directions a rectangular computational grid with 400 x 393 in x and y directions respectively grid points was generated specifically for the domain the grid had a spatial resolution 400 m along the plain rgfgrid utility of the delft3d module was used for generating the grid while quickin utility was used for preparing and manipulating grid oriented data this grid was employed for the study throughout the study was carried out in 3 parts the first part aimed at evaluating the forcing wind data a set of 2 model runs were completed for a period of two months june and november 2010 these two months were chosen after careful assessment of the available buoy data both in the north and the south which marked the extreme wave conditions the first set of model run was forced with 10 m zonal and meridional wind components from the wrf numerical model while the second was forced with era interim wind data the winds from wrf are compared with the available aws data over mandapam 9 15 65 n 79 7 77 e and a good comparison of modelled meridional and zonal wind components is observed fig 4 the outputs hs and mean wave period were extracted and compared with measured buoy data both in the north and south three error measuring criteria were used for the quantitative evaluation of the degree of accuracy of model results the second part of the study aimed at understanding the wave characteristics in the palk bay and was based on the model run over the study area for a period of one year january 2010 december 2010 in consideration of the result from the first part of the study wind fields from numerical model wrf were employed all wave model parameterizations were set identical to the first part of the study the wave parameters were extracted from the output and were compared with the available buoy data in the third part of the study for the better understanding of the influences of global events like la nina el nino and iod over pb model runs were carried out for the years 2009 and 2010 after careful assessment of pb geographical position and possible global events that can influence the model runs were restricted for the months of october 2010 was observed to be a year of intense negative iod with a concurrent la nina while 2009 was marked with a moderate el nino the outputs extracted from 2 locations 9 53 59 n 79 18 93 e npb and 9 19 14 n 79 25 98 e spb were compared and inferred this part of the study presents only a primary assessment of the influence of global events in the wave climatology in palk bay long term assessment is required to understand the variability and associated mechanisms 2 3 error measuring

oi and pi stand for the observed and predicted value respectively and n represents the number of data 3 results 3 1 comparison of model results obtained with different wind sources the waves in the pb were predicted with reasonable accuracy during june and november when forced with wrf and era interim winds fig 5 the general patterns of the wave parameters are reasonably reproduced when compared with measurements in npb buoy the highest significant wave height was marked 1 83 m in june and 1 36 m in november the model run with era interim wind dataset as input modelled a maximum significant height of 1 12 m for june and 0 75 m for november in npb while the model run with wrf wind dataset gave better estimations with 1 46 m and 1 28 m respectively for june and november however both the models were observed to produce a negative bias of 0 29 m era interim dataset and 0 1 m wrf dataset during june and 0 24 m era interim dataset and 0 14 m wrf dataset during november table 1 the negative bias in wave height could be due to low wind speed fields produced by the input sources in spb the observed maximum significant wave height is 1 83 m during june the wave model run with era interim forcing was observed to produce a negative bias of 0 08 m while the other produced 0 06 m in significant wave height the bias values were 0 2 m and 0 1 m respectively for era interim based model run and wrf dataset based model run during november similar to the hindcast of significant wave height both cases under predicted the wave period at both npb and spb during both june and november 2010 a systematic bias is observed between the model and buoy mean wave period and could be due to different cut off frequency adopted in model and buoy low frequency cut off in the buoy is 0 025 hz and for the model it is 0 04 hz the wave parameters from the buoy data are estimated with low frequency cut off at 0 025 hz and 0 04 hz and found that there is no significant variation in the wave height in the present study area due to the fact that in the study area long period waves with frequency less than 0 04 hz are absent on the other hand model tm02 will tend to be lower than the observed one because it has weighted in more contribution from high frequency since the buoy data have a high frequency cut off at 0 58 hz whereas that for model is at 1 hz hence model results are obtained with high frequency cut off at 0 58 hz and compared with that at 1 hz and the variations in both height and period are observed fig 6 the variation is due to the presence of very low period wind seas less than 1 72 s especially in this region the comparison of the observed wave period with the model runs also showed that the model with wrf dataset was relatively better table 2 all the outputs were evaluated using other statistical parameters rmse and si too table 2 the wave parameters derived using fine resolution shows that outputs from fine resolution wrf winds are relatively better than those derived using era interim winds abdalla et al 1997 Ã¶zhan and abdalla 1999 ponce de leÃ³n and orfila 2013 langodan et al 2016 also found similar inferences when studying the regional scale enclosed basin ocean surface processes the wind speeds derived from global models could be insufficient due to their coarse resolutions however it is also to be understood that despite its relatively coarse resolution the era interim inputs were capable of reproducing the wave heights as salvaÃ§Ã£o et al 2014 states wrf outputs were observed to help hindcast most of the highs and lows of both significant wave height and wave period this study suggests that wrf generated wind components could be relatively better in generating the wave climatology over the region 3 2 comparison of simulation with observations at npb over an annual cycle the measured hs varied between 0 07 m and 1 87 m with an average of 0 59 m while the wave hindcast data ranged between 0 01 and 1 94 m with an average of 0 48 m the model run reproduces hs with reasonable accuracy with a positive bias of 0 09 m rmse of 0 3 m si of 0 5 correlation of 0 4 fig 7 at spb over an annual cycle the measured hs varied between 0 01 m and 1 8 m with an average value of 0 5 m while the wave hindcast data ranged between 0 01 and 1 87 m with an average of 0 4 m the calculated statistical parameters on significant wave height at spb were 0 06 0 24 0 45 and 0 5 respectively for bias rmse correlation and si the mean wave period measurements from the buoy ranged between 1 7s and 18s along npb and 1 7s 13s along spb at npb mean wave period modelled varied between 1s and 10 5s while at spb it varied between 0 8s and 15s a negative bias of 0 48s with an rmse of 0 48s correlation of 0 3 and si value of 0 24 was calculated along npb fig 7 along spb a negative bias of 0 82s correlation of 0 3 and si of 0 34 fig 7 was calculated mean wave direction also was computed with good accuracy with a reasonable error margin fig 7 relatively bigger values for error parameters at spb may be accounted to the complex bathymetry and influences of islands which needs to be examined in detail 3 3 wave dynamics in the palk bay in an annual cycle hs up to 1 87 m with a mean of 0 6 m and hmax up to 3 6 m are observed in the study area in one year period 44 of the time hs is less than 0 5 m and 90 of the time hs is less than 1 m the wave field in pb is mainly restricted the northeastern side of the pb is exposed to the waves arriving from the bay of bengal the sri lankan landmass is present in the south eastern side at a distance of 60 km from the measurement location in the northern location in the north direction indian landmass is present at 50 km and in the south direction rameshwaram island is present at a distance of 64 km fig 1 plots of the wave spectral energy density at the measurement locations inside the pb show the predominance of wind sea fig 8 a and b whereas swell dominance is observed in gom fig 8c some swells though weaker are apparent during the summer monsoon and these swells are from the east fig 8a and b wind seas are from the south southeast during 96 of the time during one year period sixty eight percent of the wave height was due to the wind seas and the remaining were the swells monthly average directional wave spectrum along npb shows that the energy maximums are confined to the two monsoon periods however the energy spread is confined only to a small angle for most of the period while the spread is more during the summer monsoon fig 9 the energy spread to lower frequencies is observed during december the mean wave periods are mostly concentrated in a narrow range of 2 4 s fig 8 a very large proportion up to 48 of waves are with mean wave periods below 3 s spectral peak period is less than 6 s during 96 of the time and long period waves tp 12 s are present during only 1 5 of the time fig 8a and b the water depth at the wave measurement location is 10 m and hence the measured waves will have depth influence the wavelength associated with the mean wave period l varied from 7 to 71 m and the d l ratio is more than 0 5 during most of the time indicating that the measured waves satisfy the deep water condition spm 1984 all the sea waves satisfy the deep water condition the ratio of depth and wavelength associated with the swell wave period varied from 0 09 to 0 28 which satisfies the transitional water condition spm 1984 most of the time the wind wave field is fetch limited and the mean wind waves periods are short 5 s in order to know the contribution of waves from different direction in the npb waves are separated into 3 categories i from 0 to 136 and from 324 to 360 representing waves from north northeast and east ii from 140 to 228 representing waves from southeast to southwest iii 232 320 waves from the southwest to northwest significant percentage of waves from north northeast during november to february fig 10 comparing to the north and northeasterly waves the southeast southwesterly waves are more energetic at npb in the spb the waves are separated into 2 categories i from 0 to 90 and from 270 to 360 representing waves from west northwest to northeast and east ii from 90 to 270 representing waves from southeast to southwest significant percentage of waves from northwest to northeast during november to february fig 11 comparing to the southerly waves the northerly waves are more energetic at spb during most of the time except during december february fig 12 shows the monthly average of significant wave height over the area from january 2010 till december 2010 the monthly averages of significant wave heights modelled shows high values in the pb during the southwest monsoon periods during the southwest monsoon period peaks of monthly averaged significant height are focused around the northeastern borders of the pb due to its closeness to the land and shallow bathymetry areas around adam s bridge southern pb shows relatively high significant wave height only in june and july the waves measured at 12 m and 2 m water depth both in the gom and pb indicates that in the gom high wave activity is present even at 2 m water depth whereas in the pb the waves at 2 m water depth is very low compared to that at 12 m water depth fig 13 the figure shows that as expected the waves reduce from 12 to 2 m in the gom with the same pattern but the waves are different in the pb and the wave intensity is very less at 2 m water depth in pb the wave measurements show that adam s bridge is acting as a wall since the passage between the pb and the gom is shallow with the depth not exceeding 2 m at any location most of this opening is shallower than 1 m the examination of the influences of global events on the waves in the semi enclosed pb indicates that during october 2009 the whole spatial stretch of pb was marked with relatively lower significant wave height whereas during october 2010 only the indian margins showed lower significant height fig 14 the difference between monthly means of significant wave heights at these locations marked a difference of 0 2 m for npb and spb 4 discussion and conclusion the wave climate variability over pb is governed by the diversified meteorological features active over the region pb being a semi enclosed basin wind speeds in the bay are low and act on a limited fetch of few kilometres and thus cause waves with short wave periods small amplitudes and short wavelengths measured data show that the wave characteristics are wind sea dominated the waves could be hindcasted with reasonable accuracy using the fine resolution wrf model wind data and with numerical wave model delft 3d the underestimation relatively more arising while using global wind data era interim could be related to the coarse spatial and temporal resolutions of wind fields salvaÃ§Ã£o et al 2014 however cavaleri 2009 explains that the missing wind peaks are not only due to resolution but due to the presently used formulations for nonlinear energy transfer which lead to too wide distributions in frequency and direction thereby reducing the input by the wind the limitation of the mesoscale model wrf in estimating the wind speed also could have lead to less accurate hindcasting of wave period further a detailed analysis of the present capabilities of the wave models in the inner and coastal seas is presented by cavaleri et al 2018 the gridded values of average significant wave height in each month of the data set are the basic climatology for all calculations woolf et al 2002 wave heights throughout pb are seasonal peaking in southwest monsoon seasons the high monthly averages of significant wave height fig 12 during monsoon periods show that the wave climatology over pb is governed by the indian monsoon northeast monsoon show relatively higher values for significant wave height along the central regions of pb this could be arising due to the orographic hindrance faced by winds from southwest during southwest monsoon the significant wave heights marked extremes and high variability along sri lankan coasts while along the indian coast it remained less diverse with relatively lower peaks the complex bathymetry along the southern regions and influences of various islands delft island kachchativu etc are found to invoke significant influence on wave climate over pb the geographical uniqueness of pb restrict the influences of swell waves from gom and bob even during monsoon periods and thereby behaving similar to nearly a closed water body these specialties aided in hindcasting mean wave direction with reasonable accuracy with pb being a shallow water basin shallow water processes are of high significance all over the area calibration and validation of wind fields against all possible measured data are recommended considering the fact that global events are making a significant influence on the wave height despite the swell restrictions makes it clear that despite the land boundedness and small domain influences of global phenomena are to be considered and evaluated for any effective study the reasons for relatively less accurate hindcast of wave period are due to the limitations in wind input complex bathymetry the difference in cut off frequency ranges between buoy and model and the possible errors

22506,the appropriate assessment of dynamical response of the marine propeller shaft is essential to enable optional power delivery to propeller and to minimize friction of supporting bearings abnormal shaft vibration induced by the interaction of water lubricated stern bearings seriously affect the reliability of marine propulsion system during ships navigation an applicable numerical model regarding dynamical response of the shaft bearing system considering velocity friction interaction is proposed the cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² iterative method is applied to solve this nonlinear model with velocity dependent friction to capture the nature of shaft bearing interaction the dynamical response of shaft relative velocity bearing reaction force and dynamic friction coefficient with various model parameters are obtained the influence of rotational speed stick factor and slip factor regarding velocity dependent friction on the dynamical response is discussed with data comparison in detail the residual force defined in theoretical basis is also analyzed for each case to certificate the reliability of the numerical calculation a comparison of the poincarÃ© surface between present work and previous reference is conducted to validate the applicability of the proposed frictional model the optimized design for marine propeller shaft and water lubricated stern bearings is thus realized based on the adjustment of material friction properties keywords shaft bearing system marine propeller shaft velocity dependent friction newton raphson newmark Î² method shaft relative velocity bearing reaction force 1 introduction the propulsion system of ships is mainly composed of main engine propeller marine propeller shaft and its accessories jang et al 2004 the marine propeller shaft transfers the thrust of the main engine to the propeller and its reliability closely relate to the ship s safety during navigation andersen and jensen 2014 zou et al 2015 the shaft journal and bearing are separated by the supporting force of lubricating film of the hydro lubricated sliding bearing the lubricating film provides supporting force for the shaft and the surface wear caused by the direct contact between shaft journals and bearing can be avoid while the clearance of lubricating film between shaft journal and bearing changes as unstable loadings on the shaft wang et al 2013 geng et al 2014 the variation of a single bearing affect other relative bearings considering the coordination of total bearings as the shaft is generally supported by several bearings as a result not only the dynamic characteristics beside supporting force of the lubricating film but also the bearing stiffness and shaft damping which affect the dynamical response of the shaft bearing system may vary significantly shen et al 2008 wu and yang 1995 therefore it is crucial to find out the basic mechanism leading to the shaft bearing interaction and then control it efficiently as the pulsatility of main engine the non uniformity of propeller working area and the irregularity of hull deformation ji and jiang 2013 zhang et al 2014a hanninen et al 2014 xing et al 2016 intensify the external loadings on the marine propeller shaft the unbalance mass of shaft components murawski 2004 and the misalignment of the shaft axis murawski 2005 shi et al 2010 are undesirable which cause the reaction force of the bearing much complex the rapid wear overheating and even burnout of the stern bearings produce serious damage on the shaft because of the poor operating quality abnormal shaft vibrations in torsional and transverse modes and their coupled forms are induced during the rotational process yang et al 2014 qu et al 2017 han et al 2017 huang et al 2019 the enlarged nonlinearity leads to partial fatigue and fracture on the shaft and then overall failures of the propulsion system h han and park 2015 in addition to reduce the friction and wear of water lubricated stern bearing the control of nonlinear vibration of the marine propeller shaft should also be considered lu et al 2013 li et al 2013 therefore the minimization of dynamical response of the shaft bearing interaction has been gradually noticed s berger et al 2001 analyzed the coupling dynamical behavior between the axial thrust bearing and the transverse vibrations of the shaft using an unsteady time integration procedure with the fluid supports are considered to be nonlinear s jun et al 2007 found that there is obvious variation of stress distribution and great increase of stress near the area on shaft where it is acted upon the highest film pressure of the shaft bearing system z zhang et al 2013 2014b 2014c calculated the stability and transient dynamics of the shaft bearing system which is modeled involving the nonlinear interaction among torsional vibrations of the continuous shaft tangential vibrations of the rubber bearing and the nonlinear friction acting on the contact interface l dong et al dong and wang 2018 established a mechanical model of shaft film stern structure coupled system to investigate the influence of the stern structure on the vibration characteristics of the shaft over various types of wave loads which ship faces on ocean d zou et al 2019 concluded that the amplitudes of axial bearing force are proportional to the longitudinal vibration amplitudes of the propulsion shaft and also squared with the vibration frequencies with the maturity of numerical method and the improvement of computational capability the finite element analysis lee et al 2019 have been applied to reveal that the ignorance of the relative slope angle between propeller shaft and stern tube bearing which resulted in adverse effects on the stability of the shaft system and consequently damaged the bearing meanwhile related experiments in laboratory and onboard have also been conducted h hirani et al hirani and verma 2009 measured the dynamical viscosity of sea water and surface roughness of propeller shaft for proper operation of shaft bearing system to maintain the wear within the permissible limits during ship s operational cycle g zhou et al 2017 concluded that relatively low water film pressure will led to partly contact between shaft and bearings and the maximum film pressure of water lubricated bearings increases with the increment of the shaft rotational speed and bearing loadings nevertheless the internal relationship of the shaft bearing system produced by friction induced interaction has not been clarified as the amount of published literatures focusing on the numerical calculation of shaft bearing interaction is limited and insufficient the disadvantage of abovementioned analytical analysis is that they are not flexible enough to deal with the shaft vibration behavior and bearing reaction force simultaneously considering velocity dependent dynamic friction coefficient meanwhile a serious deviation may exist in the solving process which is caused by the assumption for the structural stiffness damping coefficient and other mechanical characteristics they are not able to represent detailed description on velocity dependent friction and clearly clarify the roles of vibration components of shaft bearing system hence the most suitable method for shaft bearing interaction should be able to predict the dynamical performance with above impact factors and be convenient to be applied in numerical calculation it should be pointed out the dynamic friction coefficient changes nonlinearly and during shaft rotation and has been proved to be closely related to shaft rotational speed litwin 2010 while there is few investigations have considered the velocity dependent performance of the continuous frictional model for the water lubricated stern bearings as the stribeck curve has been proved to be practicable to describe the interface characteristics of the shaft bearing system with water lubricated stern bearings krauter 1981 kraker et al 2007 it should be reasonably involved in the theoretical model to describe the velocity dependent behavior of the dynamic friction coefficient therefore it is essential to establish a more reliable numerical model with consideration of velocity dependent friction to calculate the shaft bearing interaction of the marine propeller shaft in view of this a numerical model in the exploration of shaft bearing interaction of the marine propeller shaft is thus proposed the impact factors of model parameters on initial friction coefficient is discussed the dynamical response of the shaft and bearing due to the velocity friction interaction are numerical investigated by solving the nonlinear equations the influence of rotational speed and model parameters regarding dynamic friction coefficient is discussed with specific comparison comparisons with model definition in the literature are also performed to verify the frictional model of present work on this basis a practicable method for predicting the dynamical performance of the shaft bearing interaction is proposed 2 methodology 2 1 motion of equation the schematic of fig 1 represents the marine propulsion system with shaft bearing interaction the proposed system contains a marine propeller shaft which consists of intermediate shaft and tail shaft with hydraulic couplings connecting each two shaft segments the intermediate shaft issupported by oil lubricated bearing while the tail shaft is supported by water lubricated stern bearing the main engine and propeller are arranged at the right and left side of the marine propeller shaft the initial shaft axis droops because of the self weight which produces permanent reaction force of the fluid film on the shaft bearing contact surfaces and the external loadings causes the shaft bearing interaction more serious and keeps the two components in contact during the shaft rotating in order to simplify the model only the friction of water lubricated stern bearing is considered while other forms of friction of the bearing are ignored here the x o y is the orthogonal non rotating coordinate system with an origin of point o the Ï is the rotational speed of the shaft and the point o is the center of the cross section of the shaft the marine propeller shaft can be modeled as a cantilever beam with continuous uniform cross section and the bearing is modeled as a spring mass system in tangential direction the cross sectional diagrammatic sketch of the shaft bearing interaction is shown in the right part of fig 1 according to the theoretical formula of friction the friction force f is proportional to the normal contact force f n and the dynamic friction coefficient Î¼ d v r e l 1 f Î¼ d v r e l f n where v r e l is the relative velocity of the shaft the contact force f n can be approximately given with statics calculation of the shaft gravitation the dynamic friction coefficient Î¼ d v r e l is directly related to the relative velocity v r e l of the shaft on the basis of previous literature and validated experimental data an exponential velocity dependent frictional model with continuous gradient can be used to describe the stribeck cabrera et al 2005 kalin et al 2009 characteristics for the shaft bearing interaction with water lubricated supported the dynamic friction coefficient Î¼ d v can be given as zhang et al 2013 berger 2002 2 Î¼ d v r e l 2 Ï arctan Îµ v r e l Î¼ 0 Î¼ 1 exp Î² 0 v r e l where Îµ is the smoothing coefficient Î¼ 0 controls the larger relative velocity stick factor Î² 0 governs the gradient of the relative velocity and slip factor Î¼ 1 is the static friction coefficient the coupling between nonlinear friction and vibration of the shaft bearing system will produce dynamical response with stick slip form defining the rotational speed of the shaft is Ï a pair of equal and opposite tangential friction force f is produced due to relative motion between the shaft and the bearing the friction force f can be equivalent to a force f f and a moment m f which act on the center of the shaft the friction moment m f will excite torsional vibration of shaft and also the tangential vibration of the bearing the relative velocity v r e l at the shaft bearing contact surface resulting from the rotational speed Ï and the angular velocity Î¸ x t of torsional vibration can be expressed as 3 v r e l r 0 Ï Î¸ x t where r 0 is the radius of each shaft segment and x is the contract position of the shaft bearing contact surface at time t thus the time varying relative velocity v r e l will affect the friction force f f and vice versa according to the equivalence of the force and moment the friction moment m f can be theoretically obtained 4 m f r 0 Î¼ d v r e l f n as only the torsional vibration of the shaft is involved the motion equation of self excited vibration of the shaft considering friction moment can be expressed as 5 j Î¸ c Î¸ k Î¸ m f where j c and k are the matrix of the moment of inertia damping and stiffness respectively the Î¸ Î¸ and Î¸ is the state vector for the acceleration velocity and displacement of shaft torsional vibration it is worth mentioning that the damping coefficient is a significant aspect of the dynamical response ding et al 2018a 2018b because of the unknown sources and precision the damping matrix c is directly defined with modal approach rao 2011 6 c Î± c 1 j Î² c 1 k where Î± c 1 and Î² c 1 are the parameters of damping coefficients and defined by experiments finally the theoretical model for shaft bearing interaction with water lubricated supported is presented it should be noted that the friction moment m f contains dynamic friction coefficient Î¼ d v r e l which depends on the relative velocity v r e l of the shaft while the time varying v r e l will affect the magnitude of the friction moment m f in turn this is the mechanism of the shaft bearing interaction caused by velocity depend friction 2 2 newton raphson method as the nonlinearity of the motion equation of the shaft bearing interaction with velocity dependent friction a cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method is proposed to be applied for the numerical calculation assuming the nonlinear equation is solved in a static problem without considering the inertia and damping a nonlinear force deformation interaction f s u p is defined for the system to describe the deformation u due to the external force p supposing the estimate of unknown displacement after cycles of iteration u j is close to the solution with the variation Î´ u j u j 1 u j is small enough to be ignored expanding the force f s j 1 in taylor series about the known estimate u j the following equation can be obtained 7 f s j 1 f s j k t j Î´ u j p where k t j f s u is the tangent stiffness at the u j by solving this equation the value of variation Î´ u j and displacement u j 1 are recalculated 8 u j 1 u j Î´ u j due to the iterative procedure that associated with u j and f s j is not equal to the applied force p a residual force is thus defined 9 r j p f s j the additional displacement Î´ u j 1 caused by this residual force is determined by solving k t j Î´ u j 1 r j 1 it gives a new estimate solution of the residual force r j 1 p f s j 1 and the refreshed value of the displacement u j 2 can be obtained 10 u j 2 u j 1 Î´ u j 1 in the newton raphson method the solution is checked and the iterative process is terminated after each iteration when some measure of the error in the solution is less than a specified tolerance this process is continued until the convergence or acceptance is achieved the convergence criteria for the residual force is enforced to be less than a tolerance 11 r j Îµ r where the conventional value for the tolerance Îµ r ranges from 10 3 to 10 8 2 3 newmark Î² method as the static problem of force deformation interaction f s u p is solved with newton raphson iteration the dynamical analysis of newmark Î² method is to determine the response quantities that satisfy the vibration eq 5 which can be written as 12 f Ë s i 1 p i 1 m u i 1 c u i 1 f s i 1 where the force f Ë s includes the inertia and damping the dynamical solution of eq 12 is the same form as the static eq 7 differentiating above equation at the known displacement

the eq 7 to the eq 12 interpreting the f Ë s i 1 j as a function of u i 1 the following formula can be obtained with the preceding definition of k Ë t i 1 j 15 k Ë t i 1 j Î´ u j p i 1 f Ë s i 1 j r Ë i 1 j this linearized equation for jth iteration in dynamical analysis is similar in form with eq 9 in static analysis substituting the eq 8 in eq 12 and then combining it with the right side of the eq 15 the residual force can be expressed as 16 r i 1 j p i 1 f s i 1 j a 1 u i 1 j u i a 2 u i a 3 u i a 1 1 Î² Î´ t 2 m Î³ Î² Î´ t c a 2 1 Î² Î´ t m Î³ Î² 1 c a 3 1 2 Î² 1 m Î´ t Î³ 2 Î² 1 c the reaction force f Ë s i 1 j and i 1st displacement u i 1 j need to be updated with each estimate of the iteration as the eq 15 provides the basis of the newton raphson iteration method the velocity u

validation to verify the proposed cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method a comparison for the numerical model with individual newmark Î² method is conducted taking the example of a shaft platform the shaft model contains three shaft segments and connects with hydraulic couplings which is considered in a free running condition and is oriented horizontally with the keel line three bearings with hydro lubricated sliding are arranged about the middle of each shaft segment to support the entire shaft a simple physical model of the shaft bearing system is constituted the modeled parameters applied in the numerical calculation are selected to represent the shaft platform which summarized in table 1 on the basis of the theoretical model in eq 1 6 the lengths and diameters of each shaft segment are defined from the main engine to the propeller with the elastic modulus shear modulus and mass density of the entire shaft detailed modeling data of the propeller couplings and bearings as well as damping and friction are also given in the cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method a switch parameter Î· is defined to represent the ratio of time step size and natural period which controls the detailed method in eq 18 applied in the iteration process the liner acceleration method is applied with the case of Î· 0 551 while the Î· changes to other values the average acceleration method will be applied moreover the conventional values of the tolerance which defined in eq 11 is given as Îµ r 1 0 10 3 during the iteration in the individual newmark Î² solving method only the average acceleration method is applied without considering the switch parameter Î· in the numerical calculation clearly there is no tolerance Îµ r as it is only defined in the newton raphson method for both solving methods the initial conditions of the shaft displacements and velocities of are u 0 j u 0 j 0 the solving time is given by t 1 0 sec and the size of time steps is defined as Î´ t 0 001 moreover the moment m f is assumed to be loaded on each shaft segment with the value of 19 m f 10 sin p t 0 5 20 sin p t 0 5 30 sin p t 0 5 kn m t 0 1 0 0 0 t 0 1 the matlab code on the basis of above mentioned theoretical algorithm and model parameters is applied for numerical calculation therefore the results of the shaft bearing system by the two different methods are obtained and compared due to the absent of the velocity dependent friction in excitation force only the shaft displacement and bearing force are compared as a matter of convenience only the displacement of both shaft and bearing at the first 0 2 s are selected for the comparison figs 2 and 3 show the results comparison of the cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method and individual newmark Î² solving method the numerical results include the displacement of the each shaft segment and the force for every bearing respectively it can be observed that the motion process of the shaft displacement is much similar with the movement from the 1st to the 3rd shaft segment over the time similar regularity can be noticed for the variation of the reaction force of these three bearings moreover it is significant to find that the dynamical response of both solving method agrees well while slight deviation still exists based on the analysis of the specific data of every time steps which can be seen from the local enlargement of fig 2 a in order to investigate the minimal diversity of this two methods specific data at every time steps of the 1 0 s solving time are compared a relative average deviation e r r o r is thus defined 20 e r r o r 1 i i 1 i x 1 i x 2 i x 1 i where the x 1 i and x 2 i are the specific data at every time steps for the cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method and individual newmark Î² solving method including shaft displacement and bearing force wtih i denotes the numbers of the time steps fig 4 shows the average deviation of the shaft displacement are 0 126 0 127 and 0 149 for the three shaft segment and the values of 0 146 0 068 and 0 254 for bearing force respectively considering the tolerance Îµ r which is not defined in the individual newmark Î² method the accuracy of calculation will be somewhat different as the residual deviation is not controlled during the iteration meanwhile the liner acceleration method which is only applied in the cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method the iteration process will obviously lead to a deviation while as the confidence level are much high with the maximal value is smaller than 0 3 which should be accepted for the validation of the numerical calculation as the joint of the newton raphson method for cooperative solving increases the calculation accuracy by controlling the residual deviation during iteration the cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method is more suitable and applicable for the investigation of the shaft bearing interaction 4 initial friction coefficient the theoretical basis in eq 2 indicates the dynamic friction coefficient closely related to the smoothing factor Îµ control factor Î¼ 0 stick factor Î² 0 and slip factor Î¼ 1 as well as the relative velocity of the shaft these impact factors which defined according to empirical formula and experimental measurement without detailed explanation on the value ranges are indispensable during the shaft rotating in order to investigate the influence of the impact factor on the dynamic friction coefficient without considering the angular velocity Î¸ x t in the relative velocity the initial value of friction is analyzed with the combining of dynamic friction coefficient in eq 2 and relative velocity in eq 3 assuming that the angular velocity is Î¸ x t 0 moreover three specific cases are considered case a effect of rotational speed the rotational speed Ï is defined as 50 100 and 200 rpm case b effect of stick factor the stick factor Î² 0 for dynamic friction coefficient is defined as 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 case c effect of slip factor the slip factor Î¼ 1 for dynamic friction coefficient is defined as 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 it should be stressed that the value of any parameters changes with the others keep the initial value in table 1 in the numerical calculation of the following section thus the initial values of the dynamic friction coefficient with various model parameters including these three cases can be obtained in fig 5 reminding the friction induced vibration of shaft bearing system is generally considered to be a low velocity behavior krauter 1981 without exception the value of the friction decreases with the rotational speed increases from 50 to 100 and then to 200 rpm it is further noted that the rotational speed has a significantly greater effect on the dynamic friction coefficient meanwhile a slight reduction can be observed with the stick factor increases from Î² 0 1 0 to Î² 0 4 0 while a relatively obvious increase is shown with the slip factor ranges from Î¼ 1 0 1 to Î¼ 1 0 4 therefore it should be pointed that the slip factor Î¼ 1 which dominates the form and degree of the friction has more significant influence than that of the stick factor Î² 0 in order to investigate the variation of initial friction with continuous rotational speed in detail two special combination modes of stick factor and slip factor are considered fig 6 shows the initial dynamic friction coefficient of slip factor is Î¼ 1 0 2 with case b and stick factor is Î² 0 2 0 with case c respectively it is extremely interesting that the value of initial friction first increases rapidly and then decrease slowly as the rotational speed increases continuously this point is observed to agree well with the behavior of typical measured friction force versus speed curve in ref krauter 1981 meanwhile the initial friction coefficient is found to decrease with larger stick factor fig 6 a and smaller slip factor fig 6 b which is also same with the results in fig 5 specifically the stick factor in fig 6 a is observed to independent with the maximal value of the friction which contributes to the decreasing speed from the maximal value to stability the speed is noticed to be much faster with the stick factor multiplied increase while the slip factor increases the amplitude of the maximal friction value shown in fig 6 b still a unification will be achieved for the initial friction coefficient for this two combination modes with larger rotational speed consequently the friction induced system with lower rotational speed smaller stick factor and larger slip factor should be considered more seriously during actual working process on account of more potential friction damage to address this issue the dynamic response of the shaft bearing interaction considering abovetioned impact factor of the velocity dependent friction is thus analyzed 5 numerical calculation along with the proposed cooperative newmark Î² method newton raphson solving method is proved to be suitable and applicable for the theoretical model of the shaft bearing interaction and the influence of rotational speed stick factor and slip factor on the initial friction coefficient is investigated the numerical calculation focusing on the dynamical response of shaft bearing interaction with velocity dependent friction is thus analyzed the response including shaft relative velocity bearing reaction force and dynamic friction coefficient during the iteration process are therefore calculated moreover the residual force which is defined in the newton raphson method is also analyzed during the calculation on this basis the influence of above mentioned impact factor on the dynamic response of the shaft bearing system is compared and determined moreover as the shaft displacement and bearing force of these three shaft segments are much similar the behavior of the third part is selected to present the entire shaft in the following investigation 5 1 effect of rotational speed the theoretical basis indicates that the shaft bearing interaction with self excited friction is caused by the dynamic friction coefficient specifically it is determined by the relative velocity of the shaft that means the increasing relative velocity lowers the dynamic friction coefficient and the friction contrarily weaken the relative velocity while the decreasing relative velocity enlarge the dynamic friction the relative velocity changes greater in turn as it is shown in eq 3 the relative velocity includes the rotational speed Ï and torsional angular velocity Î¸ x t the rotational speed is an initial value that can be defined while the torsional angular velocity is unknown which will be calculated as the dynamical response of the shaft vibration as the variation of initial friction coefficient is investigated in fig 5 the results comparison of the dynamical response for shaft bearing system with different rotational speed is shown in fig 7 a decaying oscillation can be found for the shaft relative velocity in fig 7 a which the initial position is a bit greater than zero as the function of initial rotational speed Ï the curves show nonlinearity at peaks and troughs which is the stick domain during each motion cycle and the more smooth section is the slip domain of the interaction as marked in fig 7 a the reason for the stick domain is because of the interaction between dynamic friction coefficient and relative velocity as predicted in the theoretical basis in eq 2 as the bearing reaction force f b and the shaft friction force f f are a pair of equal and opposite force which can be obtained through a simple transform of the friction moment m f and shaft radius r 0 21 f b m f r 0 the bearing reaction force in fig 7 b shows gradual decline during the time period with more clear tick and slip performance it can be seen that the motion regularity is exact opposite with that of the shaft relative speed in fig 7 a that is as the shaft relative speed decreases to the trough while the bearing reaction force increases to the peak vice versa the results in fig 7 c indicates the time varying behavior of the dynamic friction coefficient with wave line can be found more clear in the local enlargement specifically the dynamic friction coefficient with largest Ï 200 rpm is smaller and more close to be wavy than other lower rotational speed that is because of the consideration of torsional angular velocity Î¸ x t while the initial dynamic friction coefficient in figs 4 and 5 have not taken into account it proves the interaction between the dynamic friction coefficient and relative velocity producing the velocity dependent friction in general it can be concluded that the dynamical response of shaft relative velocity bearing reaction force and dynamic friction coefficient decrease slightly with increasing rotational speed Ï as predicted in theoretical analysis in addition the residual force r i 1 j which describe the disparity of applied force p i 1 and nonlinear force deformation f s i 1 j interaction force in eq 16 with the convergence criteria of the residual force which defined in eq 11 is also analyzed fig 7 d indicates the variation regularity of the residual keeps excellent similar for these three cases the maximal residual value is about r j 1 8 10 12 and basically occurs at each peaks and troughs which represent the stick domains as the residual is much smaller than the defined tolerance Îµ r 10 3 it proves the accuracy of the numerical calculation for shaft bearing interaction 5 2 effect of stick factor the results in fig 6 a indicates that the initial friction coefficient decreases with increasing stick factor Î² 0 which control the speed of friction from maximum to stability and the results in fig 7 proves that there exists stick domain with irregular variation and slip domain with smooth curve for the dynamical response of shaft bearing interaction without doubt the parameter value of stick factor will affect the dynamical response of the shaft bearing system in some degree in order to investigate the influence the results comparison with various parameter values based on numerical calculation is an appropriate technique therefore fig 8 shows the dynamical response of the shaft bearing interaction with different values of the stick factor the result in fig 8 a shows that the vibration amplitude of relative velocity of the interaction is found to decrease gradually with time and the increasing stick factor Î² 0 reduces the dynamical response of shaft relative velocity with a slight effect same conclusion has been observed in fig 7 a the bearing reaction force in fig 8 b changes slightly with various stick factor which is similar with the case of various rotational speed shown in fig 7 b the nonlinearity of stick domain for the bearing reaction force is noticed to be more serious than that of the shaft relative velocity meanwhile the peaks and troughs of the shaft relative speed and bearing reaction force are exhibited to be opposite appears which is well consistent with fig 7 a and b fig 8 c shows that the time varying dynamic friction coefficient with Î² 0 1 0 is more close to a straight line while the case of Î² 0 4 0 trends to be a wavy line during same time range the variation between the case of Î² 0 4 0 and Î² 0 2 0 is basically doubled as those of Î² 0 2 0 and Î² 0 1 0 this variation of dynamic friction coefficient is about the same with that of the initial friction coefficient performed in fig 5 a it proves that the stick factor Î² 0 increases the degree of the dynamic friction coefficient in stick domain it should be concluded that a slight decrease occurs for the shaft relative velocity bearing reaction force and dynamic friction coefficient with the increasing stick factor Î² 0 which is similar with the case of increasing rotational speed that means the stick factor Î² 0 introduces a minimal effect on the dynamic response of the shaft bearing interaction including that of the stick domain and the residual force in fig 8 d show the largest value at the peaks and troughs which is observed to be significant small to ensure the computational accuracy of the numerical calculation 5 3 effect of slip factor similarly the slip factor Î¼ 1 is proved to increase the amplitude of the maximal value of initial friction coefficient shown in fig 6 b with the influence of the stick factor on the shaft bearing interaction is investigated the effect of the corresponding slip factor is thus analyzed in this case the influence of slip factor regarding dynamic friction coefficient on the dynamical response of the shaft bearing system is investigated shown in fig 9 it can be observed that the dynamical response with different slip factor is more significant than that of the rotational speed and stick factor the result in fig 9 a shows that the increasing slip factor Î¼ 1 enlarges the shaft relative velocity with the variation which is an opposite variation trend compared with that of figs 7 a and 8 a and this variation suffers severe increase which is about multiple relationship as the slip factor increases from 0 1 to 0 2 and then to 0 4 similarly the variation of the bearing reaction force in fig 9 b is much larger than that of figs 7 b and 8 b especially for the case of Î¼ 1 0 4 and this variation between the case of Î¼ 1 0 4 and Î¼ 1 0 2 seems to be twice as that of Î¼ 1 0 2 and Î¼ 1 0 1 meanwhile the shaft relative velocity and bearing reaction force are observed to decaying with opposite peaks and troughs which is consistent with figs 7 and 8 it is noticed from fig 9 c that the time varying dynamic friction coefficient with Î¼ 1 0 4 trends to be larger than other cases which is well consistent with the initial friction coefficient in fig 5 b the increase of friction seems to be multiple relationship with the multiplier is the ratio of the slip factor the results indicate that the variation of slip factor Î¼ 1 on the dynamic response including shaft relative velocity bearing reaction force and dynamic friction factor is much obvious it demonstrates the slip factor Î¼ 1 regarding to dynamic friction coefficient is more sensitive to the shaft bearing interaction moreover the residual force gets larger with a maximum of r j 3 4 10 12 in fig 9 d as the slip factor increased which is still significantly smaller than the defined tolerance that means the calculation residual of proposed solving method for the numerical model of shaft bearing interaction should be accepted in any case 6 discussion as the dynamic friction coefficient of shaft bearing interaction relates much impact factors besides relative velocity the stiffness of friction pairs morphology of contact surface and temperature of working environment which cause strong randomness and uncontrollability to the friction performance these factors are beyond the consideration of theoretical models for the parameters definition and thus it has been ignored meanwhile the observed results and revealed mechanism by the experiments are not fully provided with universal the theoretical model proposed in this paper is qualitative as a result of introducing parameter assuming and model simplification nevertheless this research provides a practicable tool for the optimal design and vibration control of the shaft bearing interaction therefore a results comparison of dynamical response with early research is discussed to investigate the accuracy and applicability of the frictional model proposed in this work the model definition of dynamic friction coefficient Î¼ d v r e l in ref vrande et al 1999 is given as 22 Î¼ d v r e l Î² 0 2 Ï arctan Îµ v r e l 1 Î³ v r e l g Î² 0 1 3 Î³ 3 0 where the smoothing coefficient Îµ the stick factor Î² 0 and the relative velocity v r e l have the same definition in table 1 and the slip factor of present work is defined as Î¼ 1 0 1 the initial dynamic friction factor with present work and ref vrande et al 1999 can be obtained shown in fig 10 the results of both friction definitions can be found to agree well with continuous rotational speed which is the same variation tendency as shown in fig 6 the value of ref rao 2011 is slight larger than that of the present work which is much similar with the results of different slip factor in fig 6 b similarly the dynamical response of the shaft bearing interaction with both friction definition can be obtained for convenience the poincarÃ© surface which includes the response of displacement and velocity is applied to describe the axis orbit of the shaft cross section during interaction the comparison in fig 11 is the poincarÃ© surface of section for friction definition t with proposed model and early reference over a range of rotational speed the results show that the shape of poincarÃ© diagram for both frictional model trends to be ellipses as the effect of the shaft bearing interaction the displacement and velocity of the shaft decrease with the rotational speed increases from 50 to 100 and then to 200 rpm which have been proved in figs 7 a 8 a and 9 a as it can be observed the displacement and velocity show periodic growth and decline with the amplitude slowly decrease during the motion process although the axis orbit indicates slight discreteness between the two frictional models this disparity nearly remain unchanged with time while the motion process and amplitude magnitude of both frictional model agree well especially for the lower rotational speed which proves the applicability of proposed friction definition in this paper 7 conclusion in this paper a theoretical model for shaft bearing interaction of the marine propeller shaft induced by velocity dependent friction is proposed the cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method is validated to be more suitable to solve this nonlinear numerical model considering velocity friction interaction on this basis the dynamical response of system including shaft relative velocity bearing reaction force and dynamic friction coefficient are respectively obtained the influence of rotational speed stick factor and slip factor regarding frictional model on the dynamical response are compared in detail moreover the accuracy of the frictional model proposed in this work is discussed with empirical formula of early research three detailed conclusion can be given first the model parameters including stick factor and slip factor have significant influence on the dynamic friction coefficient it is found to dominant different behavior of the shaft relative velocity and bearing reaction force a possible parameters range for friction performance of the shaft bearing system needs to be seriously considered to reduce abrasive wear and increase service life secondly the dynamic friction coefficient of the shaft bearing system is closely dependent on the relative velocity of the shaft it is observed to be time varying as the variation of the relative velocity during shaft rotation the friction with lower relative velocity should be considered more seriously during actual working process in consideration of more potential damage finally due to the occasion and influence of the dynamic friction coefficient on shaft bearing system it is therefore vital to not only consider the vibration response of the shaft but also to minimize the external loadings on the bearing in the early design process in summary a more suitable calculation method considering dynamic friction coefficient is proposed for marine engineers and designers as its ability of estimating dynamical response of the shaft bearing interaction in future work the coupled vibrations of the shaft will be considered for the shaft bearing system acknowledgement this research is supported by the national natural science foundation of

method shaft relative velocity bearing reaction force 1 introduction the propulsion system of ships is mainly composed of main engine propeller marine propeller shaft and its accessories jang et al 2004 the marine propeller shaft transfers the thrust of the main engine to the propeller and its reliability closely relate to the ship s safety during navigation andersen and jensen 2014 zou et al 2015 the shaft journal and bearing are separated by the supporting force of lubricating film of the hydro lubricated sliding bearing the lubricating film provides supporting force for the shaft and the surface wear caused by the direct contact between shaft journals and bearing can be avoid while the clearance of lubricating film between shaft journal and bearing changes as unstable loadings on the shaft wang et al 2013 geng et al 2014 the variation of a single bearing affect other relative bearings considering the coordination of total bearings as the shaft is generally supported by several bearings as a result not only the dynamic characteristics beside supporting force of the lubricating film but also the bearing stiffness and shaft damping which affect the dynamical response of the shaft bearing system may vary significantly shen et al 2008 wu and yang 1995 therefore it is crucial to find out the basic mechanism leading to the shaft bearing interaction and then control it efficiently as the pulsatility of main engine the non uniformity of propeller working area and the irregularity of hull deformation ji and jiang 2013 zhang et al 2014a hanninen et al 2014 xing et al 2016 intensify the external loadings on the marine propeller shaft the unbalance mass of shaft components murawski 2004 and the misalignment of the shaft axis murawski 2005 shi et al 2010 are undesirable which cause the reaction force of the bearing much complex the rapid wear overheating and even burnout of the stern bearings produce serious damage on the shaft because of the poor operating quality abnormal shaft vibrations in torsional and transverse modes and their coupled forms are induced during the rotational process yang et al 2014 qu et al 2017 han et al 2017 huang et al 2019 the enlarged nonlinearity leads to partial fatigue and fracture on the shaft and then overall failures of the propulsion system h han and park 2015 in addition to reduce the friction and wear of water lubricated stern bearing the control of nonlinear vibration of the marine propeller shaft should also be considered lu et al 2013 li et al 2013 therefore the minimization of dynamical response of the shaft bearing interaction has been gradually noticed s berger et al 2001 analyzed the coupling dynamical behavior between the axial thrust bearing and the transverse vibrations of the shaft

vibration amplitudes of the propulsion shaft and also squared with the vibration frequencies with the maturity of numerical method and the improvement of computational capability the finite element analysis lee et al 2019 have been applied to reveal that the ignorance of the relative slope angle between propeller shaft and stern tube bearing which resulted in adverse effects on the stability of the shaft system and consequently damaged the bearing meanwhile related experiments in laboratory and onboard have also been conducted h hirani et al hirani and verma 2009 measured the dynamical viscosity of sea water and surface roughness of propeller shaft for proper operation of shaft bearing system to maintain the wear within the permissible limits during ship s operational cycle g zhou et al 2017 concluded that relatively low water film pressure will led to partly contact between shaft and bearings and the maximum film pressure of water lubricated bearings increases with the increment of the shaft rotational speed and bearing loadings nevertheless the internal relationship of the shaft bearing system produced by friction induced interaction has not been clarified as the amount of published literatures focusing on the numerical calculation of shaft bearing interaction is limited and insufficient the disadvantage of abovementioned analytical analysis is that they are not flexible enough to deal with the shaft vibration behavior and bearing reaction force simultaneously considering velocity dependent dynamic friction coefficient meanwhile a serious deviation may exist in the solving process which is caused by the assumption for the structural stiffness damping coefficient and other mechanical characteristics they are not able to represent detailed description on velocity dependent friction and clearly clarify the roles of vibration components of shaft bearing system hence the most suitable method for shaft bearing interaction should be able to predict the dynamical performance with above impact factors and be convenient to be applied in numerical calculation it should be pointed out the dynamic friction coefficient changes nonlinearly and during shaft rotation and has been proved to be closely related to shaft rotational speed litwin 2010 while there is few investigations have considered the velocity dependent performance of the continuous frictional model for the water lubricated stern bearings as the stribeck curve has been proved to be practicable to describe the interface characteristics of the shaft bearing system with water lubricated stern bearings krauter 1981 kraker et al 2007 it should be reasonably involved in the theoretical model to describe the velocity dependent behavior of the dynamic friction coefficient therefore it is essential to establish a more reliable numerical model with consideration of velocity dependent friction to calculate the shaft bearing interaction of the marine propeller shaft in view of this a numerical model in the exploration of shaft bearing interaction of the marine propeller shaft is thus proposed the impact factors of model parameters on initial friction coefficient is discussed the dynamical response of the shaft and bearing due to the velocity friction interaction are numerical investigated by solving the nonlinear equations the influence of rotational speed and model parameters regarding dynamic friction coefficient is discussed with specific comparison comparisons with model definition in the literature are also performed to verify the frictional model of present work on this basis a practicable method for predicting the dynamical performance of the shaft bearing interaction is proposed 2 methodology 2 1 motion of equation the schematic of fig 1 represents the marine propulsion system with shaft bearing interaction the proposed system contains a marine propeller shaft which consists of intermediate shaft and tail shaft with hydraulic couplings connecting each two shaft segments the intermediate shaft issupported by oil lubricated bearing while the tail shaft is supported by water lubricated stern bearing the main engine and propeller are arranged at the right and left side of the marine propeller shaft the initial shaft axis droops because of the self weight which produces permanent reaction force of the fluid film on the shaft bearing contact surfaces and the external loadings causes the shaft bearing interaction more serious and keeps the two components in contact during the shaft rotating in order to simplify the model only the friction of water lubricated stern bearing is considered while other forms of friction of the bearing are ignored here the x o y is the orthogonal non rotating coordinate system with an origin of point o the Ï is the rotational speed of the shaft and the point o is the center of the cross section of the shaft the marine propeller shaft can be modeled as a cantilever beam with continuous uniform cross section and the bearing is modeled as a spring mass system in tangential direction the cross sectional diagrammatic sketch of the shaft bearing interaction is shown in the right part of fig 1 according to the theoretical formula of friction the friction force f is proportional to the normal contact force f n and the dynamic friction coefficient Î¼ d v r e l 1 f Î¼ d v r e l f n where v r e l is the relative velocity of the shaft the contact force f n can be approximately given with statics calculation of the shaft gravitation the dynamic friction coefficient Î¼ d v r e l is directly related to the relative velocity v r e l of the shaft on the basis of previous literature and validated experimental data an exponential velocity dependent frictional model with continuous gradient can be used to describe the stribeck cabrera et al 2005 kalin et al 2009 characteristics for the shaft bearing interaction with water lubricated supported the dynamic friction coefficient Î¼ d v can be given as zhang et al 2013 berger 2002 2 Î¼ d v r e l 2 Ï arctan Îµ v r e l Î¼ 0 Î¼ 1 exp Î² 0 v r e l where Îµ is the smoothing coefficient Î¼ 0 controls the larger relative velocity stick factor Î² 0 governs the gradient of the relative velocity and slip factor Î¼ 1 is the static friction coefficient the coupling between nonlinear friction and vibration of the shaft bearing system will produce dynamical response with stick slip form defining the rotational speed of the shaft is Ï a pair of equal and opposite tangential friction force f is produced due to relative motion between the shaft and the bearing the friction force f can be equivalent to a force f f and a moment m f which act on the center of the shaft the friction moment m f will excite torsional vibration of shaft and also the tangential vibration of the bearing the relative velocity v r e l at the shaft bearing contact surface resulting from the rotational speed Ï and the angular velocity Î¸ x t of torsional vibration can be expressed as 3 v r e l r 0 Ï Î¸ x t where r 0 is the radius of each shaft segment and x is the contract position of the shaft bearing contact surface at time t thus the time varying relative velocity v r e l will affect the friction force f f and vice versa according to the equivalence of the force and moment the friction moment m f can be theoretically obtained 4 m f r 0 Î¼ d v r e l f n as only the torsional vibration of the shaft is involved the motion equation of self excited vibration of the shaft considering friction moment can be expressed as 5 j Î¸ c Î¸ k Î¸ m f where j c and k are the matrix of the moment of inertia damping and stiffness respectively the Î¸ Î¸ and Î¸ is the state vector for the acceleration velocity and displacement of shaft torsional vibration it is worth mentioning that the damping coefficient is a significant aspect of the dynamical response ding et al 2018a 2018b because of the unknown sources and precision the damping matrix c is directly defined with modal approach rao 2011 6 c Î± c 1 j Î² c 1 k where Î± c 1 and Î² c 1 are the parameters of damping coefficients and defined by experiments finally the theoretical model for shaft bearing interaction with water lubricated supported is presented it should be noted that the friction moment m f contains dynamic friction coefficient Î¼ d v r e l which depends on the relative velocity v r e l of the shaft while the time varying v r e l will affect the magnitude of the friction moment m f in turn this is the mechanism of the shaft bearing interaction caused by velocity depend friction 2 2 newton raphson method as the nonlinearity of the motion equation of the shaft bearing interaction with velocity dependent friction a cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method is proposed to be applied for the numerical calculation assuming the nonlinear equation is solved in a static problem without considering the inertia and damping a nonlinear force deformation interaction f s u p is defined for the system to describe the deformation u due to the external force p supposing the estimate of unknown displacement after cycles of iteration u j is close to the solution with the variation Î´ u j u j 1 u j is small enough to be ignored expanding the force f s j 1 in taylor series about the known estimate u j the following equation can be obtained 7 f s j 1 f s j k t j Î´ u j p where k t j f s u is the tangent stiffness at the u j by solving this equation the value of variation Î´ u j and displacement u j 1 are recalculated 8 u j 1 u j Î´ u j due to the iterative procedure that associated with u j and f s j is not equal to the applied force p a residual force is thus defined 9 r j p f s j the additional displacement Î´ u j 1 caused by this residual force is determined by solving k t j Î´ u j 1 r j 1 it gives a new estimate solution of the residual force r j 1 p f s j 1 and the refreshed value of the displacement u j 2 can be obtained 10 u j 2 u j 1 Î´ u j 1 in the newton raphson method the solution is checked and the iterative process is terminated after each iteration when some measure of the error in the solution is less than a specified tolerance this process is continued until the convergence or acceptance is achieved the convergence criteria for the residual force is enforced to be less than a tolerance 11 r j Îµ r where the conventional value for the tolerance Îµ r ranges from 10 3 to 10 8 2 3 newmark Î² method as the static problem of force deformation interaction f s u p is solved with newton raphson iteration the dynamical analysis of newmark Î² method is to determine the response quantities that satisfy the vibration eq 5 which can be written as 12 f Ë s i 1 p i 1 m u i 1 c u i 1 f s i 1 where the force f Ë s includes the inertia and damping the dynamical solution of eq 12 is the same form as the static eq 7 differentiating above equation at the known displacement u i 1 j gives 13 f Ë s u i 1 m u u i 1 c u u i 1 f s u i 1 u u i 1 1 Î² Î´ t 2 u u i 1 Î³ Î² Î´ t where the derivatives in inertia term and damping term on the right side can be derived from newmark

the eq 7 to the eq 12 interpreting the f Ë s i 1 j as a function of u i 1 the following formula can be obtained with the preceding definition of k Ë t i 1 j 15 k Ë t i 1 j Î´ u j p i 1 f Ë s i 1 j r Ë i 1 j this linearized equation for jth iteration in dynamical analysis is similar in form with eq 9 in static analysis substituting the eq 8 in eq 12 and then combining it with the right side of the eq 15 the residual force can be expressed as 16 r i 1 j p i 1 f s i 1 j a 1 u i 1 j u i a 2 u i a 3 u i a 1 1 Î² Î´ t 2 m Î³ Î² Î´ t c a 2 1 Î² Î´ t m Î³ Î² 1 c a 3 1 2 Î² 1 m Î´ t Î³ 2 Î² 1 c the reaction force f Ë s i 1 j and i 1st displacement u i 1 j need to be updated with each estimate of the iteration as the eq 15 provides the basis of the newton raphson iteration method the velocity u

validation to verify the proposed cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method a comparison for the numerical model with individual newmark Î² method is conducted taking the example of a shaft platform the shaft model contains three shaft segments and connects with hydraulic couplings which is considered in a free running condition and is oriented horizontally with the keel line three bearings with hydro lubricated sliding are arranged about the middle of each shaft segment to support the entire shaft a simple physical model of the shaft bearing system is constituted the modeled parameters applied in the numerical calculation are selected to represent the shaft platform which summarized in table 1 on the basis of the theoretical model in eq 1 6 the lengths and diameters of each shaft segment are defined from the main engine to the propeller with the elastic modulus shear modulus and mass density of the entire shaft detailed modeling data of the propeller couplings and bearings as well as damping and friction are also given in the cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method a switch parameter Î· is defined to represent the ratio of time step size and natural period which controls the detailed method in eq 18 applied in the iteration process the liner acceleration method is applied with the case of Î· 0 551 while the Î· changes to other values the average acceleration method will be applied moreover the conventional values of the tolerance which defined in eq 11 is given as Îµ r 1 0 10 3 during the iteration in the individual newmark Î² solving method only the average acceleration method is applied without considering the switch parameter Î· in the numerical calculation clearly there is no tolerance Îµ r as it is only defined in the newton raphson method for both solving methods the initial conditions of the shaft displacements and velocities of are u 0 j u 0 j 0 the solving time is given by t 1 0 sec and the size of time steps is defined as Î´ t 0 001 moreover the moment m f is assumed to be loaded on each shaft segment with the value of 19 m f 10 sin p t 0 5 20 sin p t 0 5 30 sin p t 0 5 kn m t 0 1 0 0 0 t 0 1 the matlab code on the basis of above mentioned theoretical algorithm and model parameters is applied for numerical calculation therefore the results of the shaft bearing system by the two different methods are obtained and compared due to the absent of the velocity dependent friction in excitation force only the shaft displacement and bearing force are compared as a matter of convenience only the displacement of both shaft and bearing at the first 0 2 s are selected for the comparison figs 2 and 3 show the results comparison of the cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method and individual newmark Î² solving method the numerical results include the displacement of the each shaft segment and the force for every bearing respectively it can be observed that the motion process of the shaft displacement is much similar with the movement from the 1st to the 3rd shaft segment over the time similar regularity can be noticed for the variation of the reaction force of these three bearings moreover it is significant to find that the dynamical response of both solving method agrees well while slight deviation still exists based on the analysis of the specific data of every time steps which can be seen from the local enlargement of fig 2 a in order to investigate the minimal diversity of this two methods specific data at every time steps of the 1 0 s solving time are compared a relative average deviation e r r o r is thus defined 20 e r r o r 1 i i 1 i x 1 i x 2 i x 1 i where the x 1 i and x 2 i are the specific data at every time steps for the cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method and individual newmark Î² solving method including shaft displacement and bearing force wtih i denotes the numbers of the time steps fig 4 shows the average deviation of the shaft displacement are 0 126 0 127 and 0 149 for the three shaft segment and the values of 0 146 0 068 and 0 254 for bearing force respectively considering the tolerance Îµ r which is not defined in the individual newmark Î² method the accuracy of calculation will be somewhat different as the residual deviation is not controlled during the iteration meanwhile the liner acceleration method which is only applied in the cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method the iteration process will obviously lead to a deviation while as the confidence level are much high with the maximal value is smaller than 0 3 which should be accepted for the validation of the numerical calculation as the joint of the newton raphson method for cooperative solving increases the calculation accuracy by controlling the residual deviation during iteration the cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method is more suitable and applicable for the investigation of the shaft bearing interaction 4 initial friction coefficient the theoretical basis in eq 2 indicates the dynamic friction coefficient closely related to the smoothing factor Îµ control factor Î¼ 0 stick factor Î² 0 and slip factor Î¼ 1 as well as the relative velocity of the shaft these impact factors which defined according to empirical formula and experimental measurement without detailed explanation on the value ranges are indispensable during the shaft rotating in order to investigate the influence of the impact factor on the dynamic friction coefficient without considering the angular velocity Î¸ x t in the relative velocity the initial value of friction is analyzed with the combining of dynamic friction coefficient in eq 2 and relative velocity in eq 3 assuming that the angular velocity is Î¸ x t 0 moreover three specific cases are considered case a effect of rotational speed the rotational speed Ï is defined as 50 100 and 200 rpm case b effect of stick factor the stick factor Î² 0 for dynamic friction coefficient is defined as 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 case c effect of slip factor the slip factor Î¼ 1 for dynamic friction coefficient is defined as 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 it should be stressed that the value of any parameters changes with the others keep the initial value in table 1 in the numerical calculation of the following section thus the initial values of the dynamic friction coefficient with various model parameters including these three cases can be obtained in fig 5 reminding the friction induced vibration of shaft bearing system is generally considered to be a low velocity behavior krauter 1981 without exception the value of the friction decreases with the rotational speed increases from 50 to 100 and then to 200 rpm it is further noted that the rotational speed has a significantly greater effect on the dynamic friction coefficient meanwhile a slight reduction can be observed with the stick factor increases from Î² 0 1 0 to Î² 0 4 0 while a relatively obvious increase is shown with the slip factor ranges from Î¼ 1 0 1 to Î¼ 1 0 4 therefore it should be pointed that the slip factor Î¼ 1 which dominates the form and degree of the friction has more significant influence than that of the stick factor Î² 0 in order to investigate the variation of initial friction with continuous rotational speed in detail two special combination modes of stick factor and slip factor are considered fig 6 shows the initial dynamic friction coefficient of slip factor is Î¼ 1 0 2 with case b and stick factor is Î² 0 2 0 with case c respectively it is extremely interesting that the value of initial friction first increases rapidly and then decrease slowly as the rotational speed increases continuously this point is observed to agree well with the behavior of typical measured friction force versus speed curve in ref krauter 1981 meanwhile the initial friction coefficient is found to decrease with larger stick factor fig 6 a and smaller slip factor fig 6 b which is also same with the results in fig 5 specifically the stick factor in fig 6 a is observed to independent with the maximal value of the friction which contributes to the decreasing speed from the maximal value to stability the speed is noticed to be much faster with the stick factor multiplied increase while the slip factor increases the amplitude of the maximal friction value shown in fig 6 b still a unification will be achieved for the initial friction coefficient for this two combination modes with larger rotational speed consequently the friction induced system with lower rotational speed smaller stick factor and larger slip factor should be considered more seriously during actual working process on account of more potential friction damage to address this issue the dynamic response of the shaft bearing interaction considering abovetioned impact factor of the velocity dependent friction is thus analyzed 5 numerical calculation along with the proposed cooperative newmark Î² method newton raphson solving method is proved to be suitable and applicable for the theoretical model of the shaft bearing interaction and the influence of rotational speed stick factor and slip factor on the initial friction coefficient is investigated the numerical calculation focusing on the dynamical response of shaft bearing interaction with velocity dependent friction is thus analyzed the response including shaft relative velocity bearing reaction force and dynamic friction coefficient during the iteration process are therefore calculated moreover the residual force which is defined in the newton raphson method is also analyzed during the calculation on this basis the influence of above mentioned impact factor on the dynamic response of the shaft bearing system is compared and determined moreover as the shaft displacement and bearing force of these three shaft segments are much similar the behavior of the third part is selected to present the entire shaft in the following investigation 5 1 effect of rotational speed the theoretical basis indicates that the shaft bearing interaction with self excited friction is caused by the dynamic friction coefficient specifically it is determined by the relative velocity of the shaft that means the increasing relative velocity lowers the dynamic friction coefficient and the friction contrarily weaken the relative velocity while the decreasing relative velocity enlarge the dynamic friction the relative velocity changes greater in turn as it is shown in eq 3 the relative velocity includes the rotational speed Ï and torsional angular velocity Î¸ x t the rotational speed is an initial value that can be defined while the torsional angular velocity is unknown which will be calculated as the dynamical response of the shaft vibration as the variation of initial friction coefficient is investigated in fig 5 the results comparison of the dynamical response for shaft bearing system with different rotational speed is shown in fig 7 a decaying oscillation can be found for the shaft relative velocity in fig 7 a which the initial position is a bit greater than zero as the function of initial rotational speed Ï the curves show nonlinearity at peaks and troughs which is the stick domain during each motion cycle and the more smooth section is the slip domain of the interaction as marked in fig 7 a the reason for the stick domain is because of the interaction between dynamic friction coefficient and relative velocity as predicted in the theoretical basis in eq 2 as the bearing reaction force f b and the shaft friction force f f are a pair of equal and opposite force which can be obtained through a simple transform of the friction moment m f and shaft radius r 0 21 f b m f r 0 the bearing reaction force in fig 7 b shows gradual decline during the time period with more clear tick and slip performance it can be seen that the motion regularity is exact opposite with that of the shaft relative speed in fig 7 a that is as the shaft relative speed decreases to the trough while the bearing reaction force increases to the peak vice versa the results in fig 7 c indicates the time varying behavior of the dynamic friction coefficient with wave line can be found more clear in the local enlargement specifically the dynamic friction coefficient with largest Ï 200 rpm is smaller and more close to be wavy than other lower rotational speed that is because of the consideration of torsional angular velocity Î¸ x t while the initial dynamic friction coefficient in figs 4 and 5 have not taken into account it proves the interaction between the dynamic friction coefficient and relative velocity producing the velocity dependent friction in general it can be concluded that the dynamical response of shaft relative velocity bearing reaction force and dynamic friction coefficient decrease slightly with increasing rotational speed Ï as predicted in theoretical analysis in addition the residual force r i 1 j which describe the disparity of applied force p i 1 and nonlinear force deformation f s i 1 j interaction force in eq 16 with the convergence criteria of the residual force which defined in eq 11 is also analyzed fig 7 d indicates the variation regularity of the residual keeps excellent similar for these three cases the maximal residual value is about r j 1 8 10 12 and basically occurs at each peaks and troughs which represent the stick domains as the residual is much smaller than the defined tolerance Îµ r 10 3 it proves the accuracy of the numerical calculation for shaft bearing interaction 5 2 effect of stick factor the results in fig 6 a indicates that the initial friction coefficient decreases with increasing stick factor Î² 0 which control the speed of friction from maximum to stability and the results in fig 7 proves that there exists stick domain with irregular variation and slip domain with smooth curve for the dynamical response of shaft bearing interaction without doubt the parameter value of stick factor will affect the dynamical response of the shaft bearing system in some degree in order to investigate the influence the results comparison with various parameter values based on numerical calculation is an appropriate technique therefore fig 8 shows the dynamical response of the shaft bearing interaction with different values of the stick factor the result in fig 8 a shows that the vibration amplitude of relative velocity of the interaction is found to decrease gradually with time and the increasing stick factor Î² 0 reduces the dynamical response of shaft relative velocity with a slight effect same conclusion has been observed in fig 7 a the bearing reaction force in fig 8 b changes slightly with various stick factor which is similar with the case of various rotational speed shown in fig 7 b the nonlinearity of stick domain for the bearing reaction force is noticed to be more serious than that of the shaft relative velocity meanwhile the peaks and troughs of the shaft relative speed and bearing reaction force are exhibited to be opposite appears which is well consistent with fig 7 a and b fig 8 c shows that the time varying dynamic friction coefficient with Î² 0 1 0 is more close to a straight line while the case of Î² 0 4 0 trends to be a wavy line during same time range the variation between the case of Î² 0 4 0 and Î² 0 2 0 is basically doubled as those of Î² 0 2 0 and Î² 0 1 0 this variation of dynamic friction coefficient is about the same with that of the initial friction coefficient performed in fig 5 a it proves that the stick factor Î² 0 increases the degree of the dynamic friction coefficient in stick domain it should be concluded that a slight decrease occurs for the shaft relative velocity bearing reaction force and dynamic friction coefficient with the increasing stick factor Î² 0 which is similar with the case of increasing rotational speed that means the stick factor Î² 0 introduces a minimal effect on the dynamic response of the shaft bearing interaction including that of the stick domain and the residual force in fig 8 d show the largest value at the peaks and troughs which is observed to be significant small to ensure the computational accuracy of the numerical calculation 5 3 effect of slip factor similarly the slip factor Î¼ 1 is proved to increase the amplitude of the maximal value of initial friction coefficient shown in fig 6 b with the influence of the stick factor on the shaft bearing interaction is investigated the effect of the corresponding slip factor is thus analyzed in this case the influence of slip factor regarding dynamic friction coefficient on the dynamical response of the shaft bearing system is investigated shown in fig 9 it can be observed that the dynamical response with different slip factor is more significant than that of the rotational speed and stick factor the result in fig 9 a shows that the increasing slip factor Î¼ 1 enlarges the shaft relative velocity with the variation which is an opposite variation trend compared with that of figs 7 a and 8 a and this variation suffers severe increase which is about multiple relationship as the slip factor increases from 0 1 to 0 2 and then to 0 4 similarly the variation of the bearing reaction force in fig 9 b is much larger than that of figs 7 b and 8 b especially for the case of Î¼ 1 0 4 and this variation between the case of Î¼ 1 0 4 and Î¼ 1 0 2 seems to be twice as that of Î¼ 1 0 2 and Î¼ 1 0 1 meanwhile the shaft relative velocity and bearing reaction force are observed to decaying with opposite peaks and troughs which is consistent with figs 7 and 8 it is noticed from fig 9 c that the time varying dynamic friction coefficient with Î¼ 1 0 4 trends to be larger than other cases which is well consistent with the initial friction coefficient in fig 5 b the increase of friction seems to be multiple relationship with the multiplier is the ratio of the slip factor the results indicate that the variation of slip factor Î¼ 1 on the dynamic response including shaft relative velocity bearing reaction force and dynamic friction factor is much obvious it demonstrates the slip factor Î¼ 1 regarding to dynamic friction coefficient is more sensitive to the shaft bearing interaction moreover the residual force gets larger with a maximum of r j 3 4 10 12 in fig 9 d as the slip factor increased which is still significantly smaller than the defined tolerance that means the calculation residual of proposed solving method for the numerical model of shaft bearing interaction should be accepted in any case 6 discussion as the dynamic friction coefficient of shaft bearing interaction relates much impact factors besides relative velocity the stiffness of friction pairs morphology of contact surface and temperature of working environment which cause strong randomness and uncontrollability to the friction performance these factors are beyond the consideration of theoretical models for the parameters definition and thus it has been ignored meanwhile the observed results and revealed mechanism by the experiments are not fully provided with universal the theoretical model proposed in this paper is qualitative as a result of introducing parameter assuming and model simplification nevertheless this research provides a practicable tool for the optimal design and vibration control of the shaft bearing interaction therefore a results comparison of dynamical response with early research is discussed to investigate the accuracy and applicability of the frictional model proposed in this work the model definition of dynamic friction coefficient Î¼ d v r e l in ref vrande et al 1999 is given as 22 Î¼ d v r e l Î² 0 2 Ï arctan Îµ v r e l 1 Î³ v r e l g Î² 0 1 3 Î³ 3 0 where the smoothing coefficient Îµ the stick factor Î² 0 and the relative velocity v r e l have the same definition in table 1 and the slip factor of present work is defined as Î¼ 1 0 1 the initial dynamic friction factor with present work and ref vrande et al 1999 can be obtained shown in fig 10 the results of both friction definitions can be found to agree well with continuous rotational speed which is the same variation tendency as shown in fig 6 the value of ref rao 2011 is slight larger than that of the present work which is much similar with the results of different slip factor in fig 6 b similarly the dynamical response of the shaft bearing interaction with both friction definition can be obtained for convenience the poincarÃ© surface which includes the response of displacement and velocity is applied to describe the axis orbit of the shaft cross section during interaction the comparison in fig 11 is the poincarÃ© surface of section for friction definition t with proposed model and early reference over a range of rotational speed the results show that the shape of poincarÃ© diagram for both frictional model trends to be ellipses as the effect of the shaft bearing interaction the displacement and velocity of the shaft decrease with the rotational speed increases from 50 to 100 and then to 200 rpm which have been proved in figs 7 a 8 a and 9 a as it can be observed the displacement and velocity show periodic growth and decline with the amplitude slowly decrease during the motion process although the axis orbit indicates slight discreteness between the two frictional models this disparity nearly remain unchanged with time while the motion process and amplitude magnitude of both frictional model agree well especially for the lower rotational speed which proves the applicability of proposed friction definition in this paper 7 conclusion in this paper a theoretical model for shaft bearing interaction of the marine propeller shaft induced by velocity dependent friction is proposed the cooperative newton raphson newmark Î² solving method is validated to be more suitable to solve this nonlinear numerical model considering velocity friction interaction on this basis the dynamical response of system including shaft relative velocity bearing reaction force and dynamic friction coefficient are respectively obtained the influence of rotational speed stick factor and slip factor regarding frictional model on the dynamical response are compared in detail moreover the accuracy of the frictional model proposed in this work is discussed with empirical formula of early research three detailed conclusion can be given first the model parameters including stick factor and slip factor have significant influence on the dynamic friction coefficient it is found to dominant different behavior of the shaft relative velocity and bearing reaction force a possible parameters range for friction performance of the shaft bearing system needs to be seriously considered to reduce abrasive wear and increase service life secondly the dynamic friction coefficient of the shaft bearing system is closely dependent on the relative velocity of the shaft it is observed to be time varying as the variation of the relative velocity during shaft rotation the friction with lower relative velocity should be considered more seriously during actual working process in consideration of more potential damage finally due to the occasion and influence of the dynamic friction coefficient on shaft bearing system it is therefore vital to not only consider the vibration response of the shaft but also to minimize the external loadings on the bearing in the early design process in summary a more suitable calculation method considering dynamic friction coefficient is proposed for marine engineers and designers as its ability of estimating dynamical response of the shaft bearing interaction in future work the coupled vibrations of the shaft will be considered for the shaft bearing system acknowledgement this research is supported by the national natural science foundation of

therefore it is necessary to determine effective methods to decrease wave run up a traditional and direct method to protect coastal regions from wave run up is the construction of hard structures such as seawalls and break waters however this approach is expensive and harmful to the environment hence research regarding the mitigation of damage due to wave run ups by using structures with low environmental impact has become quite prevalent coastal vegetation can realize reasonable wave run up dissipation with less environmental disruption than that associated with artificial engineering

discretised to tn n Î´ t in time where n is a positive integer and Î´ t denotes the time step for computational unit i i j eq 1 was integrated from tn to tn 1 by using green s theorem 13 u i j n 1 u i

numerical method of the model have been described by fang et al 2014 3 numerical results and analysis 3 1 validation of numerical model the proposed model was validated by comparing the laboratory data of wave run up on a vegetated slope reported by thuy et al 2009 with the simulation results the experiments were conducted in a wave basin with a length of 15 m and width of 0 4 m and the specific arrangement is shown in fig 1 the vegetation was fixed from x 10 36 m to x 11 36 m on the bottom of the flume and it fully occupied the flume width the height and diameter of the vegetation stem were 0 5 m and 0 005 m respectively the density of the vegetation was 2200 unit m2 an incident sinusoidal wave with a period of 20 s and height of 0 02 m was generated on the offshore side and the still water depth was 0 44 m the wave heights wave crests and wave troughs for the wave run up on the bare slope and vegetated slope which were measured using 6 gauges in the experiments were used to validate the proposed numerical model the numerical model was run on a uniform spatial grid with a spatial resolution Î´ x 0 05 m and time step Î´ t 0 02 s the total computation time was 200 s the bed friction coefficient was set as 0 007 the comparison between the numerical results and the laboratory data for wave run up on a bare slope and vegetated slope is shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the wave heights increase as the waves run up on the slope and the presence of vegetation on the slope can attenuate this increase meanwhile the average wave height measured using gauge 5 for waves on the vegetated slope is larger than that for waves on the bare slope and this finding may be attributed to the reflection due to vegetation fig 2 shows that the numerically simulated wave heights wave crests and wave troughs for the wave run up on a bare slope and vegetated slope agree with the laboratory data and this finding indicates that the present model can suitably predict the wave propagation and run up on vegetated slopes 3 2 effect of vegetation zone width on wave run up the validated model was used to test the sensitivities of wave run up attenuation on a sloping beach to the vegetation zone width lv in the numerical tests regular waves with an incident wave height of 0 05 m and periods of 1 0 s 1 5 s 2 0 s 2 5 s and 3 0 s were propagated from a 20 m long flat zone with a water depth h0 0 5 m to a 1 10 slope the vegetation zone with a density of 700 unit m2 fully occupied the tank width the vegetation had a height of 0 8 m above still water and the diameter of the vegetation stem was 0 01 m the spatial step Î´ x 0 04 m and time step Î´ t 0 02 s and the total computation time was 60 s the bed friction coefficient was set as 0 001 fig 3 shows the profile of the tank arrangement for the numerical experiment the wave run up value was defined as the maximum height of the water surface at the moving shoreline boundary recorded from the time history of the simulated water surface tang et al 2017 in the numerical tests four different widths of the vegetation zone specifically lv l 0 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 where lv l denotes the ratio of the vegetation zone width to the wave length were adopted to investigate the effect of vegetation zone width on the wave run up the specific numerical test conditions are listed in table 1 fig 4 to fig 8 show the numerically simulated wave height and wave run up as an incident wave with different wave periods propagating on a bare flat and vegetated flat region with different vegetation zone widths in fig 4 the wave period and wave length are respectively 1 0 s and 1 51 m and the wave height in the vegetation zone is noted to decrease slightly compared to that in the case without vegetation the wave height at x 20 m the end of vegetation zone is noted to reduce by approximately 4 9 and 12 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively compared to that on the bare flat region the wave run up decreases with increase in the width of the vegetation zone and it is decreased by approximately 4 6 and 6 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively in fig 5 the wave period and wave length are respectively 1 5 s and 2 83 m and the wave height in the vegetation zone is noted to decrease more than that demonstrated in fig 4 the wave height at x 20 m the end of vegetation zone is noted to decrease by approximately 7 14 and 20 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively compared to that on the bare flat region the wave run up decreases with increase in the width of the vegetation zone the wave run up is decreased slightly when lv l 0 5 and by approximately 9 and 12 when lv l 1 0 and 1 5 respectively in fig 6 the wave period and wave length are respectively 2 0 s and 4 06 m and the wave height in the vegetation zone decreases considerably compared to that in the case without vegetation the wave height at x 20 m the end of vegetation zone is decreased by approximately 13 23 and 31 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively compared to that on the bare flat region the wave run up decreases more than that shown in fig 5 d and it is decreased by approximately 7 13 and 16 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively in fig 7 the wave period and wave length are respectively 2 5 s and 5 24 m and the wave height in the vegetation zone decreases considerably compared to that in the case without vegetation the wave height at x 20 m the end of vegetation zone is decreased by approximately 12 28 and 37 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively compared to that on the bare flat region the extent of decrease of the wave run up is similar to that shown in fig 6 d and it is decreased by approximately 6 13 and 16 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively in fig 8 the wave period and wave length are respectively 3 0 s and 6 40 m and the wave height in the vegetation zone decreases significantly compared to that shown in fig 7 the wave height at x 20 m the end of vegetation zone is decreased by approximately 23 36 and 47 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively compared to that on a bare flat region the wave run up decreases more than that shown in fig 7 d and it is decreased by approximately 11 29 and 37 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively by comparing the simulated results of wave heights on a bare flat and vegetated flat with different vegetation zone widths as shown in figs 4 8 it can be observed that vegetation can attenuate the wave height efficiently and the attenuation increases with increase in the vegetation zone width moreover figs 4 8 also indicate that the wave run up on a sloping beach behind a vegetated flat region attenuates considerably compared to that behind a bare flat region and similar to the variation in wave height the attenuation increases with increase in the vegetation zone width these effects occur because with increase in the vegetation zone width the wave energy dissipation due to vegetation hereafter referred to as wdv is increased and thus the wave energy is decreased which leads to an increase in the attenuation of wave height and wave run up fig 9 shows the attenuation rates of wave height and wave run up for waves with different periods due to vegetation with constant lv l it can be seen that as the wave period increases the reduction rates of wave height and wave run up exhibit an overall upward trend under the condition of constant lv l however tang et al 2011 indicated that when the vegetation zone width is constant does not change with incident wave length the wdv does not simply increase or decrease monotonously the wdv increases with increase in the wave period when the wave period is small however when the wave period increases to a certain extent the wdv decreases with increase in the wave period in the case of a constant vegetation zone width 4 conclusions the effect of vegetation zone width on wave run up is investigated using a numerical simulation the numerical model is based on two order fully nonlinear boussinesq equations and solved using a combination of finite difference and finite volume methods the numerical model is validated using laboratory data of period wave run up on a rigid vegetated slope subsequently the model is applied to investigate the effect of the vegetation zone width on wave run up by simulating regular waves with different wave periods propagating through the vegetation zone with different widths located in front of the slope the numerical results show that coastal vegetation can reduce the wave height and wave run up effectively and the attenuation of wave height on the vegetation zone and wave run up on sloping beach increases monotonously with increase in the vegetation zone width furthermore the attenuation rates of wave height and wave run up due to vegetation increase overall when the ratio of vegetation zone width and wave length is constant in the present study the coastal vegetation is simplified to a rigid cylinder which obviously does not accord with the fact several types of plants exist in nature however only the simplest model is considered in this work future work will concentrate on reducing the difference between the numerical vegetation model and natural vegetation and attempt to parameterize the effect of vegetation characteristics furthermore the numerical model neglects the effect of current which may have a considerable influence on the wave dissipation effect of coastal vegetation in future research laboratory data of flexible cylinder or real vegetation may be used to examine the model and the effect of current may be incorporated in the model acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge support from the national natural science foundation of china under contract nos 51579036 and 51779039

population increase in coastal areas people are encountering problems pertaining to marine disaster alleviation and marine environmental protection wave run up is one of the most harmful marine

finite volume method and musta scheme while the other terms are solved using a finite difference method by employing the third order runge kutta method to perform time integration the details of the numerical method of the model have been described by fang et al 2014 3 numerical results and analysis 3 1 validation of numerical model the proposed model was validated by comparing the laboratory data of wave run up on a vegetated slope reported by thuy et al 2009 with the simulation results the experiments were conducted in a wave basin with a length of 15 m and width of 0 4 m and the specific arrangement is shown in fig 1 the vegetation was fixed from x 10 36 m to x 11 36 m on the bottom of the flume and it fully occupied the flume width the height and diameter of the vegetation stem were 0 5 m and 0 005 m respectively the density of the vegetation was 2200 unit m2 an incident sinusoidal wave with a period of 20 s and height of 0 02 m was generated on the offshore side and the still water depth was 0 44 m the wave heights wave crests and wave troughs for the wave run up on the bare slope and vegetated slope which were measured using 6 gauges in the experiments were used to validate the proposed numerical model the numerical model was run on a uniform spatial grid with a spatial resolution Î´ x 0 05 m and time step Î´ t 0 02 s the total computation time was 200 s the bed friction coefficient was set as 0 007 the comparison between the numerical results and the laboratory data for wave run up on a bare slope and vegetated slope is shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the wave heights increase as the waves run up on the slope and the presence of vegetation on the slope can attenuate this increase meanwhile the average wave height measured using gauge 5 for waves on the vegetated slope is larger than that for waves on the bare slope and this finding may be attributed to the reflection due to vegetation fig 2 shows that the numerically simulated wave heights wave crests and wave troughs for the wave run up on a bare slope and vegetated slope agree with the laboratory data and this finding indicates that the present model can suitably predict the wave propagation and run up on vegetated slopes 3 2 effect of vegetation zone width on wave run up the validated model was used to test the sensitivities of wave run up attenuation on a sloping beach to the vegetation zone width lv in the numerical tests regular waves with an incident wave height of 0 05 m and periods of 1 0 s 1 5 s 2 0 s 2 5 s and 3 0 s were propagated from a 20 m long flat zone with a water depth h0 0 5 m to a 1 10 slope the vegetation zone with a density of 700 unit m2 fully occupied the tank width the vegetation had a height of 0 8 m above still water and the diameter of the vegetation stem was 0 01 m the spatial step Î´ x 0 04 m and time step Î´ t 0 02 s and the total computation time was 60 s the bed friction coefficient was set as 0 001 fig 3 shows the profile of the tank arrangement for the numerical experiment the wave run up value was defined as the maximum height of the water surface at the moving shoreline boundary recorded from the time history of the simulated water surface tang et al 2017 in the numerical tests four different widths of the vegetation zone specifically lv l 0 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 where lv l denotes the ratio of the vegetation zone width to the wave length were adopted to investigate the effect of vegetation zone width on the wave run up the specific numerical test conditions are listed in table 1 fig 4 to fig 8 show the numerically simulated wave height and wave run up as an incident wave with different wave periods propagating on a bare flat and vegetated flat region with different vegetation zone widths in fig 4 the wave period and wave length are respectively 1 0 s and 1 51 m and the wave height in the vegetation zone is noted to decrease slightly compared to that in the case without vegetation the wave height at x 20 m the end of vegetation zone is noted to reduce by approximately 4 9 and 12 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively compared to that on the bare flat region the wave run up decreases with increase in the width of the vegetation zone and it is decreased by approximately 4 6 and 6 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively in fig 5 the wave period and wave length are respectively 1 5 s and 2 83 m and the wave height in the vegetation zone is noted to decrease more than that demonstrated in fig 4 the wave height at x 20 m the end of vegetation zone is noted to decrease by approximately 7 14 and 20 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively compared to that on the bare flat region the wave run up decreases with increase in the width of the vegetation zone the wave run up is decreased slightly when lv l 0 5 and by approximately 9 and 12 when lv l 1 0 and 1 5 respectively in fig 6 the wave period and wave length are respectively 2 0 s and 4 06 m and the wave height in the vegetation zone decreases considerably compared to that in the case without vegetation the wave height at x 20 m the end of vegetation zone is decreased by approximately 13 23 and 31 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively compared to that on the bare flat region the wave run up decreases more than that shown in fig 5 d and it is decreased by approximately 7 13 and 16 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively in fig 7 the wave period and wave length are respectively 2 5 s and 5 24 m and the wave height in the vegetation zone decreases considerably compared to that in the case without vegetation the wave height at x 20 m the end of vegetation zone is decreased by approximately 12 28 and 37 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively compared to that on the bare flat region the extent of decrease of the wave run up is similar to that shown in fig 6 d and it is decreased by approximately 6 13 and 16 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively in fig 8 the wave period and wave length are respectively 3 0 s and 6 40 m and the wave height in the vegetation zone decreases significantly compared to that shown in fig 7 the wave height at x 20 m the end of vegetation zone is decreased by approximately 23 36 and 47 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively compared to that on a bare flat region the wave run up decreases more than that shown in fig 7 d and it is decreased by approximately 11 29 and 37 when lv l 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 respectively by comparing the simulated results of wave heights on a bare flat and vegetated flat with different vegetation zone widths as shown in figs 4 8 it can be observed that vegetation can attenuate the wave height efficiently and the attenuation increases with increase in the vegetation zone width moreover figs 4 8 also indicate that the wave run up on a sloping beach behind a vegetated flat region attenuates considerably compared to that behind a bare flat region and similar to the variation in wave height the attenuation increases with increase in the vegetation zone width these effects occur because with increase in the vegetation zone width the wave energy dissipation due to vegetation hereafter referred to as wdv is increased and thus the wave energy is decreased which leads to an increase in the attenuation of wave height and wave run up fig 9 shows the attenuation rates of wave height and wave run up for waves with different periods due to vegetation with constant lv l it can be seen that as the wave period increases the reduction rates of wave height and wave run up exhibit an overall upward trend under the condition of constant lv l however tang et al 2011 indicated that when the vegetation zone width is constant does not change with incident wave length the wdv does not simply increase or decrease monotonously the wdv increases with increase in the wave period when the wave period is small however when the wave period increases to a certain extent the wdv decreases with increase in the wave period in the case of a constant vegetation zone width 4 conclusions the effect of vegetation zone width on wave run up is investigated using a numerical simulation the numerical model is based on two order fully nonlinear boussinesq equations and solved using a combination of finite difference and finite volume methods the numerical model is validated using laboratory data of period wave run up on a rigid vegetated slope subsequently the model is applied to investigate the effect of the vegetation zone width on wave run up by simulating regular waves with different wave periods propagating through the vegetation zone with different widths located in front of the slope the numerical results show that coastal vegetation can reduce the wave height and wave run up effectively and the attenuation of wave height on the vegetation zone and wave run up on sloping beach increases monotonously with increase in the vegetation zone width furthermore the attenuation rates of wave height and wave run up due to vegetation increase overall when the ratio of vegetation zone width and wave length is constant in the present study the coastal vegetation is simplified to a rigid cylinder which obviously does not accord with the fact several types of plants exist in nature however only the simplest model is considered in this work future work will concentrate on reducing the difference between the numerical vegetation model and natural vegetation and attempt to parameterize the effect of vegetation characteristics furthermore the numerical model neglects the effect of current which may have a considerable influence on the wave dissipation effect of coastal vegetation in future research laboratory data of flexible cylinder or real vegetation may be used to examine the model and the effect of current may be incorporated in the model acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge support from the national natural science foundation of china under contract nos 51579036 and 51779039

22508,fluid mud widely exists in the movement of fine sediment which is an important potential cause of marine geological disasters it is important to understand the generation and migration mechanism of fluid mud the purpose of this study is to investigate the vertical migration response of fine grained sediments by wave fluid test of pore pressure response of silty seabed under wave action the results show that the adhesion between the silt particles and the additional pressure of the film water have a significant effect on the liquefaction characteristics of the silt even if the liquefaction degree is far more than 100 the soil does not completely liquefy the experiment result show that there is concentrated movement of the split channel and mesoscopic migration of fine particles between the gaps of the particles pumping effect provides an effective source of supply for the development of the floating mud layer it also exacerbates modern sedimentation when strengthening the vertical exchange of shallow soil in the seabed besides the blending of the middle and lower layers of the previous soil with the recent sediments has increased the difficulty of identifying the time series of the modern sedimentary layer to some extent keywords pumping effect wave induced silty seabed fluid mud layer 1 introduction fluid mud refers to a layer of high concentration sediment laden water near the bottom of the sea it is mainly composed of clay and silt with obvious viscous properties and the main particle composition is generally not more than 63 Î¼m li et al 2013 fluid mud has a clear interface with the upper water body and has great mobility it is a unique sediment movement pattern in the muddy coastal estuaries mcanally et al 2007 qian and wan 1983 it has been found in thames estuary of england gironde estuary of france granboulan et al 1989 amazon estuary of brazil allison et al 1995 kineke and sternberg 1995 yellow river estuary and yangtze river estuary of china xu et al 1994 the liquefaction of sand and the resuspension of sediment under the action of waves were always the focus of coastal research most scholars focus on liquefaction mechanisms and resuspension fluxes wainright 1990 gao et al 2011 moriarty et al 2017 tao et al 2018 however few researchers pay attention to the vertical pumping effect of wave induced pore pressure from a microscopic point of view especially the development of fluid mud in silty soil when there is a large amount of fluid mud it can cause ecological environmental and navigation safety problems such as burying benthic organisms corselli and basso 1996 sediment eutrophication montserrat et al 2011 and channel sudden siltation disturbing sounding results affecting the judgment of navigable water depth niu et al 2003 etc besides its interaction with suspended load and bedload has an important impact on the topographic and geomorphological evolution of estuary areas yunping and tian 2014 liu et al 2018 such as channel siltation serious time and even navigation safety it will block the channel and cause the ship to run aground k and z 2019 zhen 2019 the problem of fluid mud originates from the results of field observation liu et al 2018 2019 whose means includes frozen sampling bathymetry gamma ray method ultrasonic method tuning fork density method and coupling method ju et al 2014 which can be summarized as a direct measurement isotope measurement and acoustic measurement by measuring principle laboratory tests are mainly divided into two directions one is the experimental study of the rheological properties of the sludge itself maa and mehta 1988 hasar and kinaci 2004 abujdayil et al 2010 the other is the experimental study of the movement characteristics of the sludge under dynamic action including wave action zhao 1982 wang et al 2008 lambrechts et al 2010 yang et al 2011 and current action hong and ying 1988 kreeke et al 1997 almroth et al 2009 wu et al 2017 on the basis of field observation and laboratory test the formation conditions xu and dong 2011 xu and yuan 2001 of sludge and the numerical simulation maa and mehta 1990 of sludge response under dynamic action are studied from the angle of theoretical analysis in view of the development mechanism of floating sludge the prevailing view is that the conditions for the formation of floating sludge include abundant fine sediment supply relatively weak hydrodynamic conditions and appropriate salinity salinity and weak dynamic force are the external conditions for flocculation and sedimentation of fine sediment f l et al 2019 daoji 2007 and abundant fine sediment provides the material source for the formation and development of fluid mud previous studies have been carried out on the flocculation environment of fine sediment li et al 2008 considered that the yangtze river estuary has a good environment for flocculation of fine sediment through field observation li and zhang 1998 found that salinity and sediment concentration contribute significantly to the flocculation of fine sediment the periodic change of flow velocity is the most sensitive factor to control the flocculation size of fine sediment li et al 2008 li and zhang 1998 it is generally believed that there are two forms of material supply of fluid mud one is direct input from rivers winterwerp 1999 and li and ren 1996 point out that the potential of density inflow is a special manifestation of the rapid deposition of sediment at the bottom which provides a rich material source for the formation of fluid mud the other is the resuspension supply of storm events whose dynamic mechanism is that storms transmit huge energy to the nearshore water body thereby significantly increasing wave current linkage the shear stress of the combined bed leads to the re suspension of fine sediment yeh and mason 2014 miao et al 2016a b sheremet et al 2005 both of these two opinions are lack of dynamic process research from a micro perspective and insufficient to fully explain the source supply mechanism of the development of fluid mud which are based on field observation revealing from a macro perspective in this paper silt from the yellow river delta is taken as the research object and the cumulative process of pore pressure and liquefaction response of soil under wave action are analyzed based on the wave flume test in this paper the vertical migration law of soil particles under wave action is studied by tracing the particle size composition combining with theoretical calculation this paper reveals the source and supply ways for the development of fluid mud from a mesoscopic point of view in order to further complement and enrich the development mechanism transport law of fluid mud 2 methodology 2 1 experiment design and materials the wave flume experiment was completed in the geotechnical laboratory of the ocean university of china the experimental device is shown in fig 1 the size of the flume is 3 m 0 6 m 1 2 m and the size of the lower soil flume is 1 m 0 6 m 0 5 m the air compressor is used to provide power for the device a double acting cylinder is installed at one end of the tank to push the water body to and fro with the wave making plate to produce waves the output waveform is changed by adjusting the stroke of the cylinder and the damping of the cylinder a wedge sponge block is installed at the other end to eliminate the reflection effect of the waves and ensure the stable output of the waveform as shown in fig 1 the soil tank is filled with saturated silt with a thickness of about 40 cm and a kaolin layer is set at a distance of 5 cm from the surface of the soil body with a thickness of less than 0 5 cm to study the transportation process and influence of pumping effect on fine granular sediment the silt was quiesced for 4 h before and after the experiment and then its surface samples were taken the particle size components were determined by laser particle size analyzer six pore water pressure sensors type yy 2b were embedded in this experiment which were located at 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm 25 cm and 30 cm away from the surface of the soil the pore pressure sensor is immersed in clear water for 24 h before burial and continuously shakes sufficiently to ensure that the internal air is completely discharged the water is artificial seawater with 35 salinity the silt was taken from the tidal flat of the yellow river estuary with median particle size d50 ranging from 32 to 41 Î¼m and kaolin was brought from industrial factories with a mesh size of 4000 and d50 ranging from 2 1 to 2 8 Î¼m 2 2 quantification of kaolin the results of particle size measurement can not only obtain the parameters such as d50 and average particle size dav but also obtain the distribution of particle size content and its cumulative distribution by studying the grain size characteristics of sediments the transport mode of sediments can be determined and the environmental factors affecting the grain size change of sediments can be inverted especially the material sources and hydrodynamic environment mclaren and bowles 1985 wang et al 2009 the experimental silt and kaolin are obviously different in origin and particle size composition in this experiment the silt particle size is relatively coarser fig 2 a d50 is about 32 49 Î¼m which is taken from the tidal flat of the yellow river estuary liu et al 2019 it is formed by natural accumulation after long distance transportation and long term screening of water flow it has good sorting and grinding roundness whose material source is relatively consistent approximating to the normal curve the experimental kaolin has a finer particle size as shown in fig 2b d50 is about 2 1 2 8 Î¼m it is manufactured in industrial batches and screened artificially which has poor sorting and grinding roundness and its shape is more sharp and fine fig 3 a is the particle size distribution curve of mixed kaolin and silt its main component is 80 kaolin mixed with 20 silt it can be seen that there are two independent peaks in the particle size distribution curve and the maximum of the two peaks corresponds to the particle size range of kaolin d50 2 1 Î¼m and silt d50 34 Î¼m respectively therefore the number of peaks in the particle size distribution curve can be used to qualitatively determine whether there are many components in the sample and whether there are corresponding components can be qualitatively judged by the size range corresponding to the maximum value sample size distribution curve contains multiple peaks which can be seen as superimposed by single peaks of different particle sizes as shown in fig 3b the particle size distribution of one component can be obtained by decomposing the particle size distribution curve the component proportion of different particle sizes corresponding to different material sources can be quantitatively evaluated by cumulative distribution 2 3 experiment procedure in order to simulate the physical characteristics of silt under natural consolidation and saturate the samples air dried silt samples were selected to remove impurities such as grass and branches after crushing sifted soil samples are put into the mixer and standard seawater is added to mix at the same time to ensure uniform mixing of the samples the pore water pressure sensor is fixed in the middle of the soil trough in advance according to the specified depth to avoid disturbance to the soil after embedding the mixture is slowly injected into the soil tank along the inner wall until the thickness is about 35 cm after the soil is stabilized a layer of kaolin with a thickness less than 0 5 cm is evenly laid on the surface then continue adding soil to 40 cm hibino et al 2014 the experimental group without kaolin layer directly injects the mixture to 40 cm after the soil is basically stable the standard seawater is slowly injected into the tank along the inner wall until about 35 cm away from the surface of the soil after 12 h the soil was naturally consolidated under hydrostatic pressure and then the wave loading experiment was started before and after wave action four surface samples were evenly sampled in the soil trough by the sampling tube for particle size measurement in order to avoid component interference between different experimental groups samples in artificial seawater and soil trough should be replaced completely after each group of experiments wave loads were applied by using the wave generator installed at one end of the flume and different wave actions wave height and wave duration were experimentally studied the specific experimental group settings are shown in table 1 the experimental group a and c were the basic control group which focused on the experimental pore pressure response and surface particle size change caused by wave action the pumping effect of wave induced excess pore pressure on fine sediment was studied yy 2b pore water pressure sensors were used to record the pore pressure changes at different depths of soil before during and after wave action based on this the accumulation of pore pressure caused by wave and the migration of fine particles under pumping action were calculated and analyzed 3 results 3 1 experimental phenomena with the beginning of wave action the consolidated soil gradually shows a slight fluctuation the fluctuation period of soil is consistent with the period of wave action the surface layer of soil has the largest fluctuation and the amplitude is less than 2 cm the initial time of soil fluctuation is delayed with the increase of depth and the ultimate influence of wave on soil depth increases with the increase of wave height the maximum influence depth that can be distinguished by naked eyes can reach 15 cm below the surface layer of soil the overlying water body gradually changes from clear to turbid and the silt on the surface of the soil is lifted up with few bubbles escaping occasionally when the wave action stops the fluctuation of the upper soil disappears quickly and consolidation begins the suspended particles settle slowly and the water gradually recovers clarity after a long time of setting occasionally obvious small channels can be seen at the boundary of the flume as shown in fig 4 a the splitting channels of 3 17 cm in length can be seen the sediment in the lower part of the soil moves up along these small channels rapidly and forms many small hilly deposits on the surface after a period of time a large number of small hilly deposits are formed on the surface of the soil fig 4b the diameter and height of the hilly deposits generally do not exceed 3 cm and 1 cm at 5 cm below the surface of the soil kaolin migrates rapidly to the surface along the channels and forms a series of white accumulation the phenomena of group c and d are most obvious fig 4b at first the white kaolin upwells in group d and then the color gradually deepens to the normal silt upwelling gradually covering the white kaolin after a long period of stationary time the hilly accumulation center gradually presents obvious depression fig 4b and the whole process lasts for about 1 h 3 2 accumulative pore pressure due to the loosening of the fixture in the process of sensor embedding the actual position and the desired position deviate but the overall order will not change fig 5 a which does not affect the analysis of the overall pore pressure variation law so this paper still labels and describes the set position according to the experiment besides all sensors were calibrated before and after the experiment and it was found that the stability of pore pressure sensors located 5 cm below the surface of soil was difficult to meet the experimental requirements fig 5bâ â¡ there are obvious anomalies in the data so the relevant results and analysis were not involved in this paper fig 6 shows the pore pressure response before during and after wave action h 7 cm t 30 min at 10 30 cm below the surface of the soil the pore pressure fluctuations of the sensors are basically the same before the wave action 0 20 s the pore water pressure of each layer is stable after a long period of static consolidation and its value is consistent with the overburden hydrostatic pressure during wave action 20 2100 s pore water pressure began to fluctuate with wave load and the pore water pressure began to accumulate in all layers as shown in table 2 the maximum increment was 0 80 1 27 kpa the average increment was 0 74 0 94 kpa the accumulative value and velocity of pore water pressure in the upper layer were greater than those in the lower layer and the pore water pressure reached the maximum value 5 09 kpa at about 150 s at 10 cm then decreased slightly to stable pore pressure value 4 76 kpa the pore water pressure tends to stabilize gradually with the passage of time after the wave action stops the pore water pressure fluctuation disappears rapidly and the pore water pressure in each layer dissipates continuously after the wave load ends the pore water pressure returns to the level before the wave action and remains stable about 100 min 3 3 particle size and kaolin content table 3 shows the variation of surface particle size and kaolin content before and after wave action it can be concluded that the surface particle size of soil tends to be finer after wave action the presence of kaolin is generally detected in the surface layer after wave action except for group a and f the content of kaolin in surface samples increases first and then decreases with the increase of wave action time group b c and d and decreases with the decrease of wave height group c e an f a small amount of kaolin group g can be detected in surface samples even without settling 4 discussion 4 1 identification of soil liquefaction process according to the terzaghi s principle of effective stress terzaghi 1965 the total stress Ï is equal to the sum of effective stress Ï and pore water pressure Î¼ i e Ï Ï Î¼ for saturated silt subjected to wave cyclic loading the total stress remains unchanged during wave action due to poor permeability of silt wave action leads to continuous accumulation of excess pore pressure and the effective stress decreases accordingly here excess pore pressure is expressed as Î´u liquefaction occurs when Î´u accumulates to the maximum value which is equal to the initial average normal effective stress according to sumer et al 2010 and jia et al 2014 research in order to quantify soil liquefaction more intuitively the degree parameter l is introduced to quantify liquefaction as shown in formula 1 the larger the l is the closer the soil is to liquefaction and the lower its strength is the easier it is to deform or form splitting 1 l 3 Î´ u Î³ d 1 2 k 0 100 where k 0 is the ratio of transverse effective stress to longitudinal effective stress i e k 0 Ï h Ï v for different soils the values are different according to previous studies sumer et al 2010 this experiment takes k 0 0 5 d is the thickness of overlying soil unit m and gamma is the floating bulk density of experimental silt which is the saturated bulk density of silt minus the bulk density of water here take gamma 7 9 kn m3 table 4 shows the liquefaction of soil at different layers during wave action it can be seen that the liquefaction degree of the soil decreases significantly with the increase of depth the liquefaction degree of shallow soil at 15 cm is 102 the stable liquefaction degree at 10 cm is 178 5 and the maximum liquefaction degree is as high as 241 4 combining with the cumulative response curve of pore pressure under wave action fig 6 it is found that although the cumulative pore pressure at 10 cm decreases the cumulative excess pore pressure does not decrease to 0 instantaneously but decreases steadily and finally stabilizes to 0 94 kpa indicating that the liquefaction of this layer does occur but does not liquefy completely for sandy soil when the liquefaction degree l exceeds 100 it can be considered that the soil is completely liquefied however for silt with finer grains because of the cohesive force between grains and the additional pressure of membrane water the liquefaction characteristics of the soil are affected so even if the pore water pressure exceeds the effective stress Î´ u Ï 0 the soil may not be completely liquefied that is the l value calculated according to formula 1 can be greater than 100 however due to excessive accumulation of pore pressure the strength of soil decreases greatly and the spacing of particles increases which provides a good condition for particle migration and formation of splitting channels 4 2 centralized pumping migration based on splitting channels during the experiment it was observed that a series of splitting channels were formed in the soil after wave action driven by wave induced excess pore pressure the particles in the lower layer moved rapidly along these channels to the surface and accumulated near the exit of the channel the upstream particles in group c were collected and analyzed the results showed that the upstream particles were finer in size with an average particle size of only 9 5 Î¼m they were mainly composed of kaolin and fine silt of which kaolin accounted for about 56 4 fig 7 it can be seen from fig 6 that the pore pressure inside the soil can be divided into the instantaneous pore pressure curve fluctuation caused by the rapid change of water level and the cumulative pore pressure curve variation trend caused by the wave action the cumulative pore pressure is much larger than the instantaneous pore pressure due to the relatively poor permeability of silt measured by experiment the permeability of the sample used is about 1 10 7m s the accumulated excess pore pressure of silt cannot dissipate rapidly in a short time after the wave action stops at the same time due to the obvious decrease of soil strength the accumulated excess pore pressure will rapidly dissipate along the weak points or weak paths of the soil by breaking through the soil layer thus forming a series of splitting channels with the dissipation of excess pore pressure the liquefied soil particles in the fluid state inside the soil will be separated from the soil skeleton under the action of seepage force the particles will be quickly moved to the surface along these channels and the fine particles will be more easily moved under the same seepage force generally speaking the longer the wave action time group b c and d is the more sufficient the strength of the soil decreases the easier to form a splitting channel and the higher the kaolin content can be detected on the surface of the soil in the experiment the upwelling particles seen in group d were obviously white at first then the color gradually deepened and turned to silt color and the continuous upward appearance did not end the results show that kaolin with fine particle size is the main type in the initial stage of particle upwelling with the continuous upwelling the kaolin near the channel decreases gradually because the kaolin layer is only a very thin layer and the upwelling particles become mainly silt and a large number of silt upwelling conceals the kaolin which makes the content of kaolin decrease relatively 4 3 general pumping migration between particles in addition to the visible channel transport the general transport of kaolin in soil particles was also studied in this experiment group g through a long term action of waves in the time between visible channels formed and waves stopped the surface samples of soil were taken for particle size testing the results also showed that 1 7 of kaolin existed table 3 for the upper soil 0 15 cm with full wave action without considering the interaction between particles the vertical

visible centralized migration of splitting channels and the other is the general migration of fine particles between granular cracks on the mesoscale 4 4 geomorphological effect of pumping rivers carry a large amount of fine sediment into the sea which can provide abundant material supply for the development of fluid mud density flow is a unique flow pattern in high sediment laden rivers such as the yellow river it can transport sediments rapidly and massively to the sea along the bottom but only when runoff and sediment content meet specific conditions can it occur in addition there are obvious seasonal characteristics of sediment transport in rivers affected by water and sediment processes such as the yellow river where water mainly comes from melting glaciers in the upper reaches and rainfall in the middle reaches while sediment mainly comes from rainstorm scouring in the middle reaches of the loess plateau so the supply of water and sediment is mainly concentrated in the flood season wang et al 2017 at the same time affected by the hydrodynamic environment of the delta sea area the hydrodynamic force in summer is weak mainly sedimentation and deposition while in winter the hydrodynamic force is strong mainly transport erosion and sediment transport to the sea also presents obvious characteristics of summer storage and winter transport yang et al 1992 for the long term and stable development of the fluid mud layer especially in the dry season of sediment supply a relatively stable and effective material source is needed to ensure the existence of the fluid mud layer the pumping effect of wave induced pore pressure continuously transports the fine sediment at a certain depth of the lower layer to the surface so that the dry season with less sediment supply can be effectively supplemented it seems that this process is an indispensable factor for the development of fluid mud previous studies have shown that the continuous scouring of water in rivers can take away fine sediment and leave coarse sediment leading to the coarsening of the riverbed miao et al 2016a b similarly for the seabed under the combined action of waves and currents for a long time the influence depth of pumping is also limited if there is a long term lack of effective material supply mainly the supply of fine particles coupled with the long term transport and erosion of current the fine particles will gradually decrease and the seabed will continue to coarsen this may be a reasonable explanation for the formation of topographic phenomena such as iron sands or hard crust wang et al 2004 in the yellow river delta 5 conclusions in this paper the silt in the yellow river delta is taken as the research object and the main components of fluid mud are simulated with 4000 mesh kaolin the responses of pore pressure accumulation soil liquefaction and particle movement under wave action are experimented based on the experimental results and calculation analysis the following conclusions are drawn in this paper 1 surface soil particles can be re suspended and naturally subsided by wave action meanwhile the pumping effect of wave induced pore pressure will transport the finer kaolin from the lower layer to the surface layer resulting in a general thinning of surface soil particle size after wave action than before wave action 2 the silt particle size is fine the cohesive force between particles and the additional pressure of membrane water have significant effects on the liquefaction characteristics of silt the maximum excess pore pressure accumulated at 1 27 kpa the liquefaction degree of surface soil is far over 100 and the strength of soil decreases greatly but the instantaneous complete liquefaction of soil has not yet occurred 3 the pumping effect of wave induced excess pore pressure is manifested in two aspects one is the formation of splitting channels in the sedimentary layer under the influence of wave induced pore pressure and the centralized migration of fine particles along the channels the other is the general migration of fine particles such as floating mud between the grain cracks 4 pumping effect brings fine grained sediments from the lower layer to the surface layer which provides an effective source for the development of the fluid mud layer in addition pumping not only strengthens the vertical exchange of shallow seabed soils but also intensifies the integration of old and new sediments from the lower layer of modern sediments which to some extent increases the difficulty of identifying the modern sedimentary sequence acknowledgments this paper is supported by the national natural science foundation of china project no 41602318 and no 41672272 the national key research and development

22508,fluid mud widely exists in the movement of fine sediment which is an important potential cause of marine geological disasters it is important to understand the generation and migration mechanism of fluid mud the purpose of this study is to investigate the vertical migration response of fine grained sediments by wave fluid test of pore pressure response of silty seabed under wave action the results show that the adhesion between the silt particles and the additional pressure of the film water have a significant effect on the liquefaction characteristics of the silt even if the liquefaction degree is far more than 100 the soil does not completely liquefy the experiment result show that there is concentrated movement of the split channel and mesoscopic migration of fine particles between the gaps of the particles pumping effect provides an effective source of supply for the development of the floating mud layer it also exacerbates modern sedimentation when strengthening the vertical exchange of shallow soil in the seabed besides the blending of the middle and lower layers of the previous soil with the recent sediments has increased the difficulty of identifying the time series of the modern sedimentary layer to some extent keywords pumping effect wave induced silty seabed fluid mud layer 1 introduction fluid mud refers to a layer of high concentration sediment laden water near the bottom of the sea it is mainly composed of clay and silt with obvious viscous properties and the main particle composition is generally not more than 63 Î¼m li et al 2013 fluid mud has a clear interface with the upper water body and has great mobility it is a unique sediment movement pattern in the muddy coastal estuaries mcanally et al 2007 qian and wan 1983 it has been found in thames estuary of england gironde estuary of france granboulan et al 1989 amazon estuary of brazil allison et al 1995 kineke and sternberg 1995 yellow river estuary and yangtze river estuary of china xu et al 1994 the liquefaction of sand and the resuspension of sediment under the action of waves were always the focus of coastal research most scholars focus on liquefaction mechanisms and resuspension fluxes wainright 1990 gao et al 2011 moriarty et al 2017 tao et al 2018 however few researchers pay attention to the vertical pumping effect of wave induced pore pressure from a microscopic point of view especially the development of fluid mud in silty soil when there is a large amount of fluid mud it can cause ecological environmental and navigation safety problems such as burying benthic organisms corselli and basso 1996 sediment eutrophication montserrat et al 2011 and channel sudden siltation disturbing sounding results affecting the judgment of navigable water depth niu et al 2003 etc besides its interaction with suspended load and bedload has an important impact on the topographic and geomorphological evolution of estuary areas yunping and tian 2014 liu et al 2018 such as channel siltation serious time and even navigation safety it will block the channel and cause the ship to run aground k and z 2019 zhen 2019 the problem of fluid mud originates from the results of field observation liu et al 2018 2019 whose means includes frozen sampling bathymetry gamma ray method ultrasonic method tuning fork density method and coupling method ju et al 2014 which can be summarized as a direct measurement isotope measurement and acoustic measurement by measuring principle laboratory tests are mainly divided into two directions one is the experimental study of the rheological properties of the sludge itself maa and mehta 1988 hasar and kinaci 2004 abujdayil et al 2010 the other is the experimental study of the movement characteristics of the sludge under dynamic action including wave action zhao 1982 wang et al 2008 lambrechts et al 2010 yang et al 2011 and current action hong and ying 1988 kreeke et al 1997 almroth et al 2009 wu et al 2017 on the basis of field observation and laboratory test the formation conditions xu and dong 2011 xu and yuan 2001 of sludge and the numerical simulation maa and mehta 1990 of sludge response under dynamic action are studied from the angle of theoretical analysis in view of the development mechanism of floating sludge the prevailing view is that the conditions for the formation of floating sludge include abundant fine sediment supply relatively weak hydrodynamic conditions and appropriate salinity salinity and weak dynamic force are the external conditions for flocculation and sedimentation of fine sediment f l et al 2019 daoji 2007 and abundant fine sediment provides the material source for the formation and development of fluid mud previous studies have been carried out on the flocculation environment of fine sediment li et al 2008 considered that the yangtze river estuary has a good environment for flocculation of fine sediment through field observation li and zhang 1998 found that salinity and sediment concentration contribute significantly to the flocculation of fine sediment the periodic change of flow velocity is the most sensitive factor to control the flocculation size of fine sediment li et al 2008 li and zhang 1998 it is generally believed that there are two forms of material supply of fluid mud one is direct input from rivers winterwerp 1999 and li and ren 1996 point out that the potential of density inflow is a special manifestation of the rapid deposition of sediment at the bottom which provides a rich material source for the formation of fluid mud the other is the resuspension supply of storm events whose dynamic mechanism is that storms transmit huge energy to the nearshore water body thereby significantly increasing wave current linkage the shear stress of the combined bed leads to the re suspension of fine sediment yeh and mason 2014 miao et al 2016a b sheremet et al 2005 both of these two opinions are lack of dynamic process research from a micro perspective and insufficient to fully explain the source supply mechanism of the development of fluid mud which are based on field observation revealing from a macro perspective in this paper silt from the yellow river delta is taken as the research object and the cumulative process of pore pressure and liquefaction response of soil under wave action are analyzed based on the wave flume test in this paper the vertical migration law of soil particles under wave action is studied by tracing the particle size composition combining with theoretical calculation this paper reveals the source and supply ways for the development of fluid mud from a mesoscopic point of view in order to further complement and enrich the development mechanism transport law of fluid mud 2 methodology 2 1 experiment design and materials the wave flume experiment was completed in the geotechnical laboratory of the ocean university of china the experimental device is shown in fig 1 the size of the flume is 3 m 0 6 m 1 2 m and the size of the lower soil flume is 1 m 0 6 m 0 5 m the air compressor is used to provide power for the device a double acting cylinder is installed at one end of the tank to push the water body to and fro with the wave making plate to produce waves the output waveform is changed by adjusting the stroke of the cylinder and the damping of the cylinder a wedge sponge block is installed at the other end to eliminate the reflection effect of the waves and ensure the stable output of the waveform as shown in fig 1 the soil tank is filled with saturated silt with a thickness of about 40 cm and a kaolin layer is set at a distance of 5 cm from the surface of the soil body with a thickness of less than 0 5 cm to study the transportation process and influence of pumping effect on fine granular sediment the silt was quiesced for 4 h before and after the experiment and then its surface samples were taken the particle size components were determined by laser particle size analyzer six pore water pressure sensors type yy 2b were embedded in this experiment which were located at 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm 25 cm and 30 cm away from the surface of the soil the pore pressure sensor is immersed in clear water for 24 h before burial and continuously shakes sufficiently to ensure that the internal air is completely discharged the water is artificial seawater with 35 salinity the silt was taken from the tidal flat of the yellow river estuary with median particle size d50 ranging from 32 to 41 Î¼m and kaolin was brought from industrial factories with a mesh size of 4000 and d50 ranging from 2 1 to 2 8 Î¼m 2 2 quantification of kaolin the results of particle size measurement can not only obtain the parameters such as d50 and average particle size dav but also obtain the distribution of particle size content and its cumulative distribution by studying the grain size characteristics of sediments the transport mode of sediments can be determined and the environmental factors affecting the grain size change of sediments can be inverted especially the material sources and hydrodynamic environment mclaren and bowles 1985 wang et al 2009 the experimental silt and kaolin are obviously different in origin and particle size composition in this experiment the silt particle size is relatively coarser fig 2 a d50 is about 32 49 Î¼m which is taken from the tidal flat of the yellow river estuary liu et al 2019 it is formed by natural accumulation after long distance transportation and long term screening of water flow it has good sorting and grinding roundness whose material source is relatively consistent approximating to the normal curve the experimental kaolin has a finer particle size as shown in fig 2b d50 is about 2 1 2 8 Î¼m it is manufactured in industrial batches and screened artificially which has poor sorting and grinding roundness and its shape is more sharp and fine fig 3 a is the particle size distribution curve of mixed kaolin and silt its main component is 80 kaolin mixed with 20 silt it can be seen that there are two independent peaks in the particle size distribution curve and the maximum of the two peaks corresponds to the particle size range of kaolin d50 2 1 Î¼m and silt d50 34 Î¼m respectively therefore the number of peaks in the particle size distribution curve can be used to qualitatively determine whether there are many components in the sample and whether there are corresponding components can be qualitatively judged by the size range corresponding to the maximum value sample size distribution curve contains multiple peaks which can be seen as superimposed by single peaks of different particle sizes as shown in fig 3b the particle size distribution of one component can be obtained by decomposing the particle size distribution curve the component proportion of different particle sizes corresponding to different material sources can be quantitatively evaluated by cumulative distribution 2 3 experiment procedure in order to simulate the physical characteristics of silt under natural consolidation and saturate the samples air dried silt samples were selected to remove impurities such as grass and branches after crushing sifted soil samples are put into the mixer and standard seawater is added to mix at the same time to ensure uniform mixing of the samples the pore water pressure sensor is fixed in the middle of the soil trough in advance according to the specified depth to avoid disturbance to the soil after embedding the mixture is slowly injected into the soil tank along the inner wall until the thickness is about 35 cm after the soil is stabilized a layer of kaolin with a thickness less than 0 5 cm is evenly laid on the surface then continue adding soil to 40 cm hibino et al 2014 the experimental group without kaolin layer directly injects the mixture to 40 cm after the soil is basically stable the standard seawater is slowly injected into the tank along the inner wall until about 35 cm away from the surface of the soil after 12 h the soil was naturally consolidated under hydrostatic pressure and then the wave loading experiment was started before and after wave action four surface samples were evenly sampled in the soil trough by the sampling tube for particle size measurement in order to avoid component interference between different experimental groups samples in artificial seawater and soil trough should be replaced completely after each group of experiments wave loads were applied by using the wave generator installed at one end of the flume and different wave actions wave height and wave duration were experimentally studied the specific experimental group settings are shown in table 1 the experimental group a and c were the basic control group which focused on the experimental pore pressure response and surface particle size change caused by wave action the pumping effect of wave induced excess pore pressure on fine sediment was studied yy 2b pore water pressure sensors were used to record the pore pressure changes at different depths of soil before during and after wave action based on this the accumulation of pore pressure caused by wave and the migration of fine particles under pumping action were calculated and analyzed 3 results 3 1 experimental phenomena with the beginning of wave action the consolidated soil gradually shows a slight fluctuation the fluctuation period of soil is consistent with the period of wave action the surface layer of soil has the largest fluctuation and the amplitude is less than 2 cm the initial time of soil fluctuation is delayed with the increase of depth and the ultimate influence of wave on soil depth increases with the increase of wave height the maximum influence depth that can be distinguished by naked eyes can reach 15 cm below the surface layer of soil the overlying water body gradually changes from clear to turbid and the silt on the surface of the soil is lifted up with few bubbles escaping occasionally when the wave action stops the fluctuation of the upper soil disappears quickly and consolidation begins the suspended particles settle slowly and the water gradually recovers clarity after a long time of setting occasionally obvious small channels can be seen at the boundary of the flume as shown in fig 4 a the splitting channels of 3 17 cm in length can be seen the sediment in the lower part of the soil moves up along these small channels rapidly and forms many small hilly deposits on the surface after a period of time a large number of small hilly deposits are formed on the surface of the soil fig 4b the diameter and height of the hilly deposits generally do not exceed 3 cm and 1 cm at 5 cm below the surface of the soil kaolin migrates rapidly to the surface along the channels and forms a series of white accumulation the phenomena of group c and d are most obvious fig 4b at first the white kaolin upwells in group d and then the color gradually deepens to the normal silt upwelling gradually covering the white kaolin after a long period of stationary time the hilly accumulation center gradually presents obvious depression fig 4b and the whole process lasts for about 1 h 3 2 accumulative pore pressure due to the loosening of the fixture in the process of sensor embedding the actual position and the desired position deviate but the overall order will not change fig 5 a which does not affect the analysis of the overall pore pressure variation law so this paper still labels and describes the set position according to the experiment besides all sensors were calibrated before and after the experiment and it was found that the stability of pore pressure sensors located 5 cm below the surface of soil was difficult to meet the experimental requirements fig 5bâ â¡ there are obvious anomalies in the data so the relevant results and analysis were not involved in this paper fig 6 shows the pore pressure response before during and after wave action h 7 cm t 30 min at 10 30 cm below the surface of the soil the pore pressure fluctuations of the sensors are basically the same before the wave action 0 20 s the pore water pressure of each layer is stable after a long period of static consolidation and its value is consistent with the overburden hydrostatic pressure during wave action 20 2100 s pore water pressure began to fluctuate with wave load and the pore water pressure began to accumulate in all layers as shown in table 2 the maximum increment was 0 80 1 27 kpa the average increment was 0 74 0 94 kpa the accumulative value and velocity of pore water pressure in the upper layer were greater than those in the lower layer and the pore water pressure reached the maximum value 5 09 kpa at about 150 s at 10 cm then decreased slightly to stable pore pressure value 4 76 kpa the pore water pressure tends to stabilize gradually with the passage of time after the wave action stops the pore water pressure fluctuation disappears rapidly and the pore water pressure in each layer dissipates continuously after the wave load ends the pore water pressure returns to the level before the wave action and remains stable about 100 min 3 3 particle size and kaolin content table 3 shows the variation of surface particle size and kaolin content before and after wave action it can be concluded that the surface particle size of soil tends to be finer after wave action the presence of kaolin is generally detected in the surface layer after wave action except for group a and f the content of kaolin in surface samples increases first and then decreases with the increase of wave action time group b c and d and decreases with the decrease of wave height group c e an f a small amount of kaolin group g can be detected in surface samples even without settling 4 discussion 4 1 identification of soil liquefaction process according to the terzaghi s principle of effective stress terzaghi 1965 the total stress Ï is equal to the sum of effective stress Ï and pore water pressure Î¼ i e Ï Ï Î¼ for saturated silt subjected to wave cyclic loading the total stress remains unchanged during wave action due to poor permeability of silt wave action leads to continuous accumulation of excess pore pressure and the effective stress decreases accordingly here excess pore pressure is expressed as Î´u liquefaction occurs when Î´u accumulates to the maximum value which is equal to the initial average normal effective stress according to sumer et al 2010 and jia et al 2014 research in order to quantify soil liquefaction more intuitively the degree parameter l is introduced to quantify liquefaction as shown in formula 1 the larger the l is the closer the soil is to liquefaction and the lower its strength is the easier it is to deform or form splitting 1 l 3 Î´ u Î³ d 1 2 k 0 100 where k 0 is the ratio of transverse effective stress to longitudinal effective stress i e k 0 Ï h Ï v for different soils the values are different according to previous studies sumer et al 2010 this experiment takes k 0 0 5 d is the thickness of overlying soil unit m and gamma is the floating bulk density of experimental silt which is the saturated bulk density of silt minus the bulk density of water here take gamma 7 9 kn m3 table 4 shows the liquefaction of soil at different layers during wave action it can be seen that the liquefaction degree of the soil decreases significantly with the increase of depth the liquefaction degree of shallow soil at 15 cm is 102 the stable liquefaction degree at 10 cm is 178 5 and the maximum liquefaction degree is as high as 241 4 combining with the cumulative response curve of pore pressure under wave action fig 6 it is found that although the cumulative pore pressure at 10 cm decreases the cumulative excess pore pressure does not decrease to 0 instantaneously but decreases steadily and finally stabilizes to 0 94 kpa indicating that the liquefaction of this layer does occur but does not liquefy completely for sandy soil when the liquefaction degree l exceeds 100 it can be considered that the soil is completely liquefied however for silt with finer grains because of the cohesive force between grains and the additional pressure of membrane water the liquefaction characteristics of the soil are affected so even if the pore water pressure exceeds the effective stress Î´ u Ï 0 the soil may not be completely liquefied that is the l value calculated according to formula 1 can be greater than 100 however due to excessive accumulation of pore pressure the strength of soil decreases greatly and the spacing of particles increases which provides a good condition for particle migration and formation of splitting channels 4 2 centralized pumping migration based on splitting channels during the experiment it was observed that a series of splitting channels were formed in the soil after wave action driven by wave induced excess pore pressure the particles in the lower layer moved rapidly along these channels to the surface and accumulated near the exit of the channel the upstream particles in group c were collected and analyzed the results showed that the upstream particles were finer in size with an average particle size of only 9 5 Î¼m they were mainly composed of kaolin and fine silt of which kaolin accounted for about 56 4 fig 7 it can be seen from fig 6 that the pore pressure inside the soil can be divided into the instantaneous pore pressure curve fluctuation caused by the rapid change of water level and the cumulative pore pressure curve variation trend caused by the wave action the cumulative pore pressure is much larger than the instantaneous pore pressure due to the relatively poor permeability of silt measured by experiment the permeability of the sample used is about 1 10 7m s the accumulated excess pore pressure of silt cannot dissipate rapidly in a short time after the wave action stops at the same time due to the obvious decrease of soil strength the accumulated excess pore pressure will rapidly dissipate along the weak points or weak paths of the soil by breaking through the soil layer thus forming a series of splitting channels with the dissipation of excess pore pressure the liquefied soil particles in the fluid state inside the soil will be separated from the soil skeleton under the action of seepage force the particles will be quickly moved to the surface along these channels and the fine particles will be more easily moved under the same seepage force generally speaking the longer the wave action time group b c and d is the more sufficient the strength of the soil decreases the easier to form a splitting channel and the higher the kaolin content can be detected on the surface of the soil in the experiment the upwelling particles seen in group d were obviously white at first then the color gradually deepened and turned to silt color and the continuous upward appearance did not end the results show that kaolin with fine particle size is the main type in the initial stage of particle upwelling with the continuous upwelling the kaolin near the channel decreases gradually because the kaolin layer is only a very thin layer and the upwelling particles become mainly silt and a large number of silt upwelling conceals the kaolin which makes the content of kaolin decrease relatively 4 3 general pumping migration between particles in addition to the visible channel transport the general transport of kaolin in soil particles was also studied in this experiment group g through a long term action of waves in the time between visible channels formed and waves stopped the surface samples of soil were taken for particle size testing the results also showed that 1 7 of kaolin existed table 3 for the upper soil 0 15 cm with full wave action without considering the interaction between particles the vertical

small size d50 3 Î¼m 30 Î¼m the resultant force positive orientation is positive with time integration impulse which indicates that the momentum of particles increases with time accumulation and the impulse of particles with relatively large size d50 300 Î¼m is negative fig 9 in summary the pumping effect of wae induced excess pore pressure is mainly manifested in two aspects fig 9 one is the visible centralized migration of splitting channels and the other is the general migration of fine particles between granular cracks on the mesoscale 4 4 geomorphological effect of pumping rivers carry a large amount of fine sediment into the sea which can provide abundant material supply for the development of fluid mud density flow is a unique flow pattern in high sediment laden rivers such as the yellow river it can transport sediments rapidly and massively to the sea along the bottom but only when runoff and sediment content meet specific conditions can it occur in addition there are obvious seasonal characteristics of sediment transport in rivers affected by water and sediment processes such as the yellow river where water mainly comes from melting glaciers in the upper reaches and rainfall in the middle reaches while sediment mainly comes from rainstorm scouring in the middle reaches of the loess plateau so the supply of water and sediment is mainly concentrated in the flood season wang et al 2017 at the same time affected by the hydrodynamic environment of the delta sea area the hydrodynamic force in summer is weak mainly sedimentation and deposition while in winter the hydrodynamic force is strong mainly transport erosion and sediment transport to the sea also presents obvious characteristics of summer storage and winter transport yang et al 1992 for the long term and stable development of the fluid mud layer especially in the dry season of sediment supply a relatively stable and effective material source is needed to ensure the existence of the fluid mud layer the pumping effect of wave induced pore pressure continuously transports the fine sediment at a certain depth of the lower layer to the surface so that the dry season with less sediment supply can be effectively supplemented it seems that this process is an indispensable factor for the development of fluid mud previous studies have shown that the continuous scouring of water in rivers can take away fine sediment and leave coarse sediment leading to the coarsening of the riverbed miao et al 2016a b similarly for the seabed under the combined action of waves and currents for a long time the influence depth of pumping is also limited if there is a long term lack of effective material supply mainly the supply of fine particles coupled with the long term transport and erosion of current the fine particles will gradually decrease and the seabed will continue to coarsen this may be a reasonable explanation for the formation of topographic phenomena such as iron sands or hard crust wang et al 2004 in the yellow river delta 5 conclusions in this paper the silt in the yellow river delta is taken as the research object and the main components of fluid mud are simulated with 4000 mesh kaolin the responses of pore pressure accumulation soil liquefaction and particle movement under wave action are experimented based on the experimental results and calculation analysis the following conclusions are drawn in this paper 1 surface soil particles can be re suspended and naturally subsided by wave action meanwhile the pumping effect of wave induced pore pressure will transport the finer kaolin from the lower layer to the surface layer resulting in a general thinning of surface soil particle size after wave action than before wave action 2 the silt particle size is fine the cohesive force between particles and the additional pressure of membrane water have significant effects on the liquefaction characteristics of silt the maximum excess pore pressure accumulated at 1 27 kpa the liquefaction degree of surface soil is far over 100 and the strength of soil decreases greatly but the instantaneous complete liquefaction of soil has not yet occurred 3 the pumping effect of wave induced excess pore pressure is manifested in two aspects one is the formation of splitting channels in the sedimentary layer under the influence of wave induced pore pressure and the centralized migration of fine particles along the channels the other is the general migration of fine particles such as floating mud between the grain cracks 4 pumping effect brings fine grained sediments from the lower layer to the surface layer which provides an effective source for the development of the fluid mud layer in addition pumping not only strengthens the vertical

22509,based on the boundary element method and the superposition principle of structural elastic modes the three dimensional time domain green s function in finite water depth is applied to hydroelasticity and the theoretical basis of three dimensional time domain hydroelasticity is established to address the difficulty and divergence of the three dimensional time domain green s function in finite water depth a numerical solution method that has high accuracy and good stability is developed using series expansion asymptotic methods and fourth order differential equations taking a large bulk carrier as an example the corresponding predictions of resonance frequency motion wave load and hydroelastic response with speed in finite water depth are carried out the numerical results are compared with the results of the three dimensional frequency domain method and the time domain method of inner and outer region matching and are verified by the towing model test the three dimensional time domain hydroelastic theory and numerical method established in this paper are of great significance for fluid coupling analysis structural dynamic response research and wave load prediction of complex floating bodies with speed keywords time domain green s function finite water depth hydro elastic fluid structure interaction 1 introduction the basic mathematical model of three dimensional hydroelasticity was first developed by wu 1984 furthermore the hydroelastic problems with forward speed have been studied in the frequency domain du 1996 and the time domain wang 1996 for infinite water depth the green s function with forward speed in the frequency domain has been directly utilized du 1996 and the green s function with forward speed in the time domain has also been utilized wang 1996 the theory of 3d second order nonlinear hydroelasticity in the frequency domain has been presented wu et al 1997 the second order hydroelastic responses of a vlfs have been investigated maeda et al 1997 ikoma et al 1998 furthermore based on the second order nonlinear hydroelastic theory software has been developed and applied to the mooring analysis of a ship hull chen 2001 and to the prediction of nonlinear hydroelastic responses of a swath in irregular waves tian and wu 2006 the inner and outer region matching method has been applied in the time domain liu et al 2006 liu and papanikolaou 2011 and in 3d hydroelasticity models yang 2016 the rankine source has been used in the inner region and the green s function of infinite water depth has been used in the outer region in the past two decades the scale of ships has increased rapidly for example the maximum volume of a container has increased from several thousand to more than 22 000 teu because large ships are generally constructed of high strength steel and because some of them have large openings their hulls are relatively soft under wave loads their hydroelastic effects are obvious so they are prone to vertical and torsional wave induced vibration called springing the springing of an ultra large ore carrier was investigated using the 3d second order nonlinear hydroelastic method in the frequency domain hu et al 2012 the wave load transfer functions and the hydroelastic responses of the carrier in irregular waves are given for the cases of zero speed and forward speed and for heading and oblique wave directions at the same time the results are compared with the data from model tests and the influence of wave induced vibration on structural fatigue is evaluated furthermore the nonlinear hydroelastic responses springing and whipping of a large bulk carrier in infinite water depth are studied by means of the inner and outer region matching method and model tests yang 2016 yang et al 2018 on the other hand due to the emergence of large offshore structures or multi module floating structures the hydroelastic method has been more widely used these structures have large deflections and nonlinear responses so a better method than the hydroelastic method to solve problems involving these structures such as vlfss and large flexural fish cages is the time domain method the fish cage group structure with hinged connectors has elastic torsion and vertical bending as well as multiple rigid body modes fu and moan 2012 the dynamic responses between the modules of the cage group structure are mainly controlled by relative rigid body motion modes in heading waves however the elastic torsional mode contributes more to oblique waves than to heading waves so it is necessary to consider the elastic deformation responses of the structure from the viewpoint of analysing the dynamic responses of the water surface bracing frame the net clothing and the mooring system attached to the fishery and aquaculture platform only the damping effect needs to be considered furthermore the nonlinear hydroelastic analysis of a single cage structure in irregular waves was carried out li et al 2013 the authors concluded that there are large motions and deformations of the cage in waves the effect of low order modes on motion and structural stress is more important than that of high order modes on the other hand the contribution of wave energy generation devices and auxiliary buoys in reducing the hydroelastic responses of very large floating structures has been studied nguyen et al 2019 and the hydroelastic responses of legged floating box structures have also been studied by numerical methods and model tests wu et al 2019 some researchers have combined the boussinesq equation with the rankine source to form a direct coupling method in the time domain by considering wave evolution near the reef and the hydroelastic effect of the floating structures ding et al 2017 the motions and dynamic responses of very large floating structures have been predicted and the numerical results have been verified by model tests furthermore the hydroelastic responses of one 8 module very large floating structure and the load principles of connectors have been analysed by considering the non uniformity of wave parameters in time and space fields in addition model tests for verification have been carried out ding et al 2019 in recent years the three dimensional hydroelastic method has been more widely used at the same time increasingly complex problems need to be solved by the time domain method at present in the framework of potential flow theory there are two main types of three dimensional hydroelasticity based on the time domain method 1 the boundary element and three dimensional time domain green s function wang and wu 1996 and 2 the boundary element combined with the rankine source yang 2016 it can be seen from the above summary that there is little research involving 3d hydroelasticity in the time domain for finite water depth in this paper a three dimensional hydroelastic method in the time domain is established based on the three dimensional time domain green s function in finite water depth and a solution method for the three dimensional time domain green s function is given the model test is carried out in the towing tank the correctness of the theory and the numerical method is verified by cross comparison among the numerical results and the experimental results 2 fundamental theory and mathematical formulation 2 1 basic assumptions when the interaction between floating structures and waves is studied the fluid around the elastic ship hull is usually assumed to be uniform incompressible non viscous and non rotating moreover the effects of lift force and surface tension are not considered on the other hand it is assumed that the elastic deformation of the structure is small and that the overall response satisfies the linear superposition principle of modal deformation the translational displacement u and rotation Î¸ at any position of the ship structure may be expressed as an aggregate of the

computations in this paper show that when the fourth order runge kutta method is applied a stable value can be obtained with a time step of 0 001 the non dimensional green s function g Î¼ Î² and its derivatives are shown in fig 1 and fig 2 it is shown that at time Î¼ 0 when the source point and the field point are both on the free surface the green s function and its derivatives oscillate sharply with increasing values of the non dimensional time variable Î² when Î¼ becomes larger the green s function and its derivatives decrease with increasing values of Î² finally these values tend toward zero and the larger Î¼ is the faster these values tend toward zero when Î¼ 0 the oscillation of the green s function and its derivatives increases with an increasing non dimensional time and the stability of the calculation results become very important the analytical expression of g 0 Î² is as follows clement 1998 20 g 0 Î² Ï Î² 2 2 j 1 4 Î² 2 8 j 1 4 Î² 2 8 j 3 4 Î² 2 8 j 3 4 Î² 2 8 Î² 2 8 it can be concluded that when Î² g 0 Î² is always between the asymptotes of Î² 2 the numerical results for Î² 0 20 are given in fig 3 the calculation results in this paper are in good agreement with the analytical solution which shows that the numerical results are stable the variation in non dimensional time and its derivatives with respect to x and v when t equals 1 0 is shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively the results show that the contours of f f and its derivative with respect to x are more intense and have greater oscillatory attenuation while the contours of f f and its derivatives with respect to v are gentler the results in fig 6 show that when v remains unchanged f f and its derivative vary dramatically with t and take many oscillations to attenuate the x is larger the more time is needed for attenuation in addition the larger the horizontal scale of the floating body is the longer it takes for the time axis of the green s function to be calculated and the more time elapses the results in fig 7 show that when x remains unchanged f f and its derivative vary dramatically with t and take many oscillations to attenuate however for different values of v the oscillation attenuation times are almost the same it can be concluded that the amount of time needed to calculate the time axis of the green s function does not change much when the vertical scale of the floating body increases 4 incident force and diffraction force 4 1 incident velocity potential the incident wave direction Î² is defined in fig 8 the 0 and 180 denote the following sea and heading

time domain analysis of wave and structural responses the dead weight of the ship is 205 000 tons the model test of the ship under full loading conditions was carried out at the wave basin of the china ship scientific research center cssrc the scale of the segmented model was 1 50 and the model was made of frp fibre reinforced plastic with ten segments and elastic backbone as shown in fig 9 the 10 segments were cut at stations no 2 4 6 8 10 50 mm 12 14 16 and 18 in the model test the wave height was 0 04 m for all regular wave cases to examine the loads and the structural responses of the ship in waves the geometric similarity of the wetted surface the hydrodynamic similarity of global motions and the similarities of the mass and stiffness distributions of the hull girder along the length were analysed together with the radius of longitudinal gyration the principal details of the ship and the model are listed in table 1 the resonant frequency of the two node bending mode in calm water was calculated by employing the software thafts for frequency domain three dimensional hydroelastic analysis this software was developed by cssrc based on the 3d theory of the frequency domain wu 1984 the resonant frequency and damping ratio of the two node bending mode of the model in calm water without speed were measured in the hammering test the numerical predictions and the results of the model test are compared in table 2 the relative error between the two results of the two node frequency is approximately 4 48 the damping ratio of the two node elastic mode is 4 55 in the model test which includes the added damping effect the hydrodynamic viscous effect and the structural damping effect the hydrodynamic viscous effect and structural damping ratio are taken to be 1 in the following numerical simulation 5 2 numerical calculation and results the 3d fem model of the ship hull has 178157 shell elements 124032 beam elements and 302189 elements in total the symmetry property of the ship allows the hydroelastic responses to be numerically calculated using half of the wetted surface constituted with a mesh of 794 panels as shown in fig 10 a this model is used in the predictions made by the tdgf time domain green s function method in the predictions made by the iorm inner and outer region matching method in the time domain yang 2016 a control surface combining a circular cylinder of radius 450 m and a flat bottom is introduced similarly the mesh of the half boundary of the inner fluid region Ï i consists of 1200 panels on the semi circle free surface and 672 panels on the half control surface as shown in fig 10 b the 3d fem model of the bulk carrier in a vacuum is used to calculate the dry global modes and corresponding natural frequencies fig 11 shows the models of two node vertical bending one node torsion two node horizontal bending and three node vertical bending with full scale natural frequencies from 3 768 rad s to 7 632 rad s when the ship floats on the water surface and encounters sinusoidal excitations its structural dynamic responses may contain contributions from different modes at special exciting frequencies there are structural resonances due to fluid structure interactions the hydrodynamic effect appears as the added mass causing each of the resonant frequencies to be lower than the natural frequencies of the ship as shown in table 3 clearly it is important to avoid the resonant frequencies lying in the major frequency regions of the engine and the machinery excitations when designing the ship structure the smallest resonant frequency of the bulk carrier among all structural distortion modes corresponds to the two node vertical bending mode which is 2 8 rad s although the frequency region of major wave energy in the sea is usually lower than 1 5 rad s the high forward speed of the ship may increase the encounter wave frequency and reach as high as the resonant frequency of the two node vertical bending mode resulting in springing responses in this section the motions and wave loading of the bulk carrier are predicted by the tdgf and iorm methods the predicted impulse response function the transfer functions of motions and the wave load of the ship advancing in waves at 14 8 kn are compared under the three methods in fig 12 along with the model test results the two time domain methods provide the results of the impulse response function of heave with good agreement as shown in fig 12 a the impulse response function approaches zero when the non dimensional time is larger than 3 0 the impulse response function of heave predicted by the tdgf method fluctuates slightly when the non dimensional time is greater than 1 0 the reason for this finding requires further investigation as shown in fig 12 b and 12 c the numerical and experimental results of heave and pitch at 14 8 kn show similar tendencies except in the encounter frequency region from 0 5 rad s to 0 6 rad s this is the frequency region of heave and pitch resonances the numerical predictions by any approaches around this region are usually influenced by the damping effect including viscous damping in the model test the wave height is 0 04 m for all of the regular wave cases in addition there is a small amount of spraying in the range of 0 5 0 6 rad s which may influence the experimental results it seems that the numerical results agree well with the model test results in fig 12 b fig 12 d in the area labelled s1 where the ratio of wave length to ship length is approximately 1 0 the predictions of tdgf and iorm and the experimental results for the vertical bending moment all decrease while the prediction of the frequency domain method does not for the two time domain methods the hydrodynamic panel models of the wetted surface are the same however one is a rankine source on the wetted body and the other is the green s function therefore the impulse response functions of the hydrodynamic coefficients and the diffraction force differ somewhat thus the heave and pitch responses are slightly different in some cases in the vbm plots the peak at 2 8 rad s is due to the linear springing response the present method predicts lower springing responses compared to thafts and iorm there are two reasons for this result 1 the peak at 2 8 rad s is the resonant point which is more sensitive to damping and exciting forces and 2 the three methods are based on the difference principle the hydrodynamic coefficients and diffraction force have a certain level of difference meaning that their linear springing responses are different 6 conclusions based on the boundary element method and the superposition principle of structural elastic modes the three dimensional time domain green s function in finite water depth is applied to hydroelasticity to address more complex problems focusing on the difficulties and divergence of the three dimensional time domain green s function in finite water depth a numerical solution method that has high accuracy and good stability is developed using series expansion asymptotic methods and fourth order differential equations the numerical results obtained by the present method for a large bulk carrier are compared with the results of other numerical methods and verified by the towing model test some important conclusions are as follows 1 the numerical analysis shows that the time interval of the fourth order differential equation is 0 001 and the fourth order runge kutta method can obtain stable and high precision numerical results 2 f f and its derivatives with respect to x are more intense and have greater oscillatory attenuation while f f and its derivatives with respect to v are gentler the larger the horizontal scale of the floating body the longer it takes for the time axis of the green s function to be calculated and the more time elapses however the amount of time needed to calculate the time axis of the green s function does not change much when the vertical scale of the floating body increases 3 the convergence rate of the integral of the green s function the incident potential and the diffraction boundary condition in finite water depth can be accelerated by adding and subtracting an appropriate asymptotically equivalent function 4 the impulse response function approaches zero when the non dimensional time is larger than 3 0 for the bulk carrier with a forward speed of 14 8 kn the time domain method provides results that are in good agreement with the experimental data when the ratio of wave length to ship length is approximately 1 0 the predictions of tdgf and iorm and the experimental results for the vertical bending moment all decrease while the prediction of the frequency domain method does not acknowledgment the study is supported by the national natural science foundation of china the theoretical fundamentals and principle investigation of 3d nonlinear hydroelasticity in time domain by

22509,based on the boundary element method and the superposition principle of structural elastic modes the three dimensional time domain green s function in finite water depth is applied to hydroelasticity and the theoretical basis of three dimensional time domain hydroelasticity is established to address the difficulty and divergence of the three dimensional time domain green s function in finite water depth a numerical solution method that has high accuracy and good stability is developed using series expansion asymptotic methods and fourth order differential equations taking a large bulk carrier as an example the corresponding predictions of resonance frequency motion wave load and hydroelastic response with speed in finite water depth are carried out the numerical results are compared with the results of the three dimensional frequency domain method and the time domain method of inner and outer region matching and are verified by the towing model test the three dimensional time domain hydroelastic theory and numerical method established in this paper are of great significance for fluid coupling analysis structural dynamic response research and wave load prediction of complex floating bodies with speed keywords time domain green s function finite water depth hydro elastic fluid structure interaction 1 introduction the basic mathematical model of three dimensional hydroelasticity was first developed by wu 1984 furthermore the hydroelastic problems with forward speed have been studied in the frequency domain du 1996 and the time domain wang 1996 for infinite water depth the green s function with forward speed in the frequency domain has been directly utilized du 1996 and the green s function with forward speed in the time domain has also been utilized wang 1996 the theory of 3d second order nonlinear hydroelasticity in the frequency domain has been presented wu et al 1997 the second order hydroelastic responses of a vlfs have been investigated maeda et al 1997 ikoma et al 1998 furthermore based on the second order nonlinear hydroelastic theory software has been developed and applied to the mooring analysis of a ship hull chen 2001 and to the prediction of nonlinear hydroelastic responses of a swath in irregular waves tian and wu 2006 the inner and outer region matching method has been applied in the time domain liu et al 2006 liu and papanikolaou 2011 and in 3d hydroelasticity models yang 2016 the rankine source has been used in the inner region and the green s function of infinite water depth has been used in the outer region in the past two decades the scale of ships has increased rapidly for example the maximum volume of a container has increased from several thousand to more than 22 000 teu because large ships are generally constructed of high strength steel and because some of them have large openings their hulls are relatively soft under wave loads their hydroelastic effects are obvious so they are prone to vertical and torsional wave induced vibration called springing the springing of an ultra large ore carrier was investigated using the 3d second order nonlinear hydroelastic method in the frequency domain hu et al 2012 the wave load transfer functions and the hydroelastic responses of the carrier in irregular waves are given for the cases of zero speed and forward speed and for heading and oblique wave directions at the same time the results are compared with the data from model tests and the influence of wave induced vibration on structural fatigue is evaluated furthermore the nonlinear hydroelastic responses springing and whipping of a large bulk carrier in infinite water depth are studied by means of the inner and outer region matching method and model tests yang 2016 yang et al 2018 on the other hand due to the emergence of large offshore structures or multi module floating structures the hydroelastic method has been more widely used these structures have large deflections and nonlinear responses so a better method than the hydroelastic method to solve problems involving these structures such as vlfss and large flexural fish cages is the time domain method the fish cage group structure with hinged connectors has elastic torsion and vertical bending as well as multiple rigid body modes fu and moan 2012 the dynamic responses between the modules of the cage group structure are mainly controlled by relative rigid body motion modes in heading waves however the elastic torsional mode contributes more to oblique waves than to heading waves so it is necessary to consider the elastic deformation responses of the structure from the viewpoint of analysing the dynamic responses of the water surface bracing frame the net clothing and the mooring system attached to the fishery and aquaculture platform only the damping effect needs to be considered furthermore the nonlinear hydroelastic analysis of a single cage structure in irregular waves was carried out li et al 2013 the authors concluded that there are large motions and deformations of the cage in waves the effect of low order modes on motion and structural stress is more important than that of high order modes on the other hand the contribution of wave energy generation devices and auxiliary buoys in reducing the hydroelastic responses of very large floating structures has been studied nguyen et al 2019 and the hydroelastic responses of legged floating box structures have also been studied by numerical methods and model tests wu et al 2019 some researchers have combined the boussinesq equation with the rankine source to form a direct coupling method in the time domain by considering wave evolution near the reef and the hydroelastic effect of the floating structures ding et al 2017 the motions and dynamic responses of very large floating structures have been predicted and the numerical results have been verified by model tests furthermore the hydroelastic responses of one 8 module very large floating structure and the load principles of connectors have been analysed by considering the non uniformity of wave parameters in time and space fields in addition model tests for verification have been carried out ding et al 2019 in recent years the three dimensional hydroelastic method has been more widely used at the same time increasingly complex problems need to be solved by the time domain method at present in the framework of potential flow theory there are two main types of three dimensional hydroelasticity based on the time domain method 1 the boundary element and three dimensional time domain green s function wang and wu 1996 and 2 the boundary element combined with the rankine source yang 2016 it can be seen from the above summary that there is little research involving 3d hydroelasticity in the time domain for finite water depth in this paper a three dimensional hydroelastic method in the time domain is established based on the three dimensional time domain green s function in finite water depth and a solution method for the three dimensional time domain green s function is given the model test is carried out in the towing tank the correctness of the theory and the numerical method is verified by cross comparison among the numerical results and the experimental results 2 fundamental theory and mathematical formulation 2 1 basic assumptions when the interaction between floating structures and waves is studied the fluid around the elastic ship hull is usually assumed to be uniform incompressible non viscous and non rotating moreover the effects of lift force and surface tension are not considered on the other hand it is assumed that the elastic deformation of the structure is small and that the overall response satisfies the linear superposition principle of modal deformation the translational displacement u and rotation Î¸ at any position of the ship structure may be expressed as an aggregate of the

computations in this paper show that when the fourth order runge kutta method is applied a stable value can be obtained with a time step of 0 001 the non dimensional green s function g Î¼ Î² and its derivatives are shown in fig 1 and fig 2 it is shown that at time Î¼ 0 when the source point and the field point are both on the free surface the green s function and its derivatives oscillate sharply with increasing values of the non dimensional time variable Î² when Î¼ becomes larger the green s function and its derivatives decrease with increasing values of Î² finally these values tend toward zero and the larger Î¼ is the faster these values tend toward zero when Î¼ 0 the oscillation of the green s function and its derivatives increases with an increasing non dimensional time and the stability of the calculation results become very important the analytical expression of g 0 Î² is as follows clement 1998 20 g 0 Î² Ï Î² 2 2 j 1 4 Î² 2 8 j 1 4 Î² 2 8 j 3 4 Î² 2 8 j 3 4 Î² 2 8 Î² 2 8

the analytical solution which shows that the numerical results are stable the variation in non dimensional time and its derivatives with respect to x and v when t equals 1 0 is shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively the results show that the contours of f f and its derivative with respect to x are more intense and have greater oscillatory attenuation while the contours of f f and its derivatives with respect to v are gentler the results in fig 6 show that when v remains unchanged f f and its derivative vary dramatically with t and take many oscillations to attenuate the x is larger the more time is needed for attenuation in addition the larger the horizontal scale of the floating body is the longer it takes for the time axis of the green s function to be calculated and the more time elapses the results in fig 7 show that when x remains unchanged f f and its derivative vary dramatically with t and take many oscillations to attenuate however for different values of v the oscillation attenuation times are almost the same it can be concluded that the amount of time needed to calculate the time axis of the green s function does not change much when the vertical scale of the floating body increases 4 incident force and diffraction force 4 1 incident velocity potential the incident wave direction Î² is defined in fig 8 the 0 and 180 denote the following sea and heading

test which includes the added damping effect the hydrodynamic viscous effect and the structural damping effect the hydrodynamic viscous effect and structural damping ratio are taken to be 1 in the following numerical simulation 5 2 numerical calculation and results the 3d fem model of the ship hull has 178157 shell elements 124032 beam elements and 302189 elements in total the symmetry property of the ship allows the hydroelastic responses to be numerically calculated using half of the wetted surface constituted with a mesh of 794 panels as shown in fig 10 a this model is used in the predictions made by the tdgf time domain green s function method in the predictions made by the iorm inner and outer region matching method in the time domain yang 2016 a control surface combining a circular cylinder of radius 450 m and a flat bottom is introduced similarly the mesh of the half boundary of the inner fluid region Ï i consists of 1200 panels on the semi circle free surface and 672 panels on the half control surface as shown in fig 10 b the 3d fem model of the bulk carrier in a vacuum is used to calculate the dry global modes and corresponding natural frequencies fig 11 shows the models of two node vertical bending one node torsion two node horizontal bending and three node vertical bending with full scale natural frequencies from 3 768 rad s to 7 632 rad s when the ship floats on the water surface and encounters sinusoidal excitations its structural dynamic responses may contain contributions from different modes at special exciting frequencies there are structural resonances due to fluid structure interactions the hydrodynamic effect appears as the added mass causing each of the resonant frequencies to be lower than the natural frequencies of the ship as shown in table 3 clearly it is important to avoid the resonant frequencies lying in the major frequency regions of the engine and the machinery excitations when designing the ship structure the smallest resonant frequency of the bulk carrier among all structural distortion modes corresponds to the two node vertical bending mode which is 2 8 rad s although the frequency region of major wave energy in the sea is usually lower than 1 5 rad s the high forward speed of the ship may increase the encounter wave frequency and reach as high as the resonant frequency of the two node vertical bending mode resulting in springing responses in this section the motions and wave loading of the bulk carrier are predicted by the tdgf and iorm methods the predicted impulse response function the transfer functions of motions and the wave load of the ship advancing in waves at 14 8 kn are compared under the three methods in fig 12 along with the model test results the two time domain methods provide the results of the impulse response function of heave with good agreement as shown in fig 12 a the impulse response function approaches zero when the non dimensional time is larger than 3 0 the impulse response function of heave predicted by the tdgf method fluctuates slightly when the non dimensional time is greater than 1 0 the reason for this finding requires further investigation as shown in fig 12 b and 12 c the numerical and experimental results of heave and pitch at 14 8 kn show similar tendencies except in the encounter frequency region from 0 5 rad s to 0 6 rad s this is the frequency region of heave and pitch resonances the numerical predictions by any approaches around this region are usually influenced by the damping effect including viscous damping in the model test the wave height is 0 04 m for all of the regular wave cases in addition there is a small amount of spraying in the range of 0 5 0 6 rad s which may influence the experimental results it seems that the numerical results agree well with the model test results in fig 12 b fig 12 d in the area labelled s1 where the ratio of wave length to ship length is approximately 1 0 the predictions of tdgf and iorm and the experimental results for the vertical bending moment all decrease while the prediction of the frequency domain method does not for the two time domain methods the hydrodynamic panel models of the wetted surface are the same however one is a rankine source on the wetted body and the other is the green s function therefore the impulse response functions of the hydrodynamic coefficients and the diffraction force differ somewhat thus the heave and pitch responses are slightly different in some cases in the vbm plots the peak at 2 8 rad s is due to the linear springing response the present method predicts lower springing responses compared to thafts and iorm there are two reasons for this result 1 the peak at 2 8 rad s is the resonant point which is more sensitive to damping and exciting forces and 2 the three methods are based on the difference principle the hydrodynamic coefficients and diffraction force have a certain level of difference meaning that their linear springing responses are different 6 conclusions based on the boundary element method and the superposition principle of structural elastic modes the three dimensional time domain green s function in finite water depth is applied to hydroelasticity to address more complex problems focusing on the difficulties and divergence of the three dimensional time domain green s function in finite water depth a numerical solution method that has high accuracy and good stability is developed using series expansion asymptotic methods and fourth order differential equations the numerical results obtained by the present method for a large bulk carrier are compared with the results of other numerical methods and verified by the towing model test some important conclusions are as follows 1 the numerical analysis shows that the time interval of the fourth order differential equation is 0 001 and the fourth order runge kutta method can obtain stable and high precision numerical results 2 f f and its derivatives with respect to x are more intense and have greater oscillatory attenuation while f f and its derivatives with respect to v are gentler the larger the horizontal scale of the floating body the longer it takes for the time axis of the green s function to be calculated and the more time elapses however the amount of time needed to calculate the time axis of the green s function does not change much when the vertical scale of the floating body increases 3 the convergence rate of the integral of the green s function the incident potential and the diffraction boundary condition in finite water depth can be accelerated by adding and subtracting an appropriate asymptotically equivalent function 4 the impulse response function approaches zero when the non dimensional time is larger than 3 0 for the bulk carrier with a forward speed of 14 8 kn the time domain method provides results that are in good agreement with the experimental data when the ratio of wave length to ship length is approximately 1 0 the predictions of tdgf and iorm and the experimental results for the vertical bending moment all decrease while the prediction of the frequency domain method does not acknowledgment the study is supported by the national natural science foundation of china the theoretical fundamentals and principle investigation of 3d nonlinear hydroelasticity in time domain by
