management framework for a rainfed paddy rice field in savannakhet province of lao people s democratic republic pdr that allows achieving the national target yield 5 0mg ha 1 under climatic uncertainty we collected the multi model ensemble mme tercile hindcasts of 3 month september to november son and 5 month july to november jason rainfall for 1991 2010 from the international collaborative archive of the apec climate center apcc the monthly probabilistic hindcasts were temporally downscaled by a stochastic weather generator to daily meteorological inputs for the ceres rice crop model then the lowland rainfed rice yields at the field scale were simulated by the process based crop model with different nitrogen n fertilizing strategies and compared the outcomes against the observed rice yields the results showed that the simulated rice yields from the 3 month hindcasts with the n fertilizer application rate of level 1 60 kg ha 1 were closer to the observed than those from the 5 month hindcasts about 3 05mg ha 1 of rice yields were estimated under the 3 month seasonal forecasts in 2020 with the n fertilizer application rate we found that additional 40 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer rate may be required to achieve the national target rice yield 5 0mg ha 1 under climatic uncertainty conditioned by the seasonal forecasts we also suggest that the proposed crop modeling

fields in the savannakhet province of laos approximately within 15 50 17 10 n and 104 40 106 50 e fig 1 the chosen rice fields are scattered along the laos rice belt and most of them are found in the western half of the province where the wide floodplain adjacent to the mekong river locates the province is under a monsoonal climate that clearly separates a year into a wet may october and a dry november april season the rainfed wet season rice production accounts for 78 of the total production of the province in 2011 while the remaining 22 was harvested from irrigated fields during the dry

the period of 20 years from 1991 to 2010 the soil data was obtained from global high resolution soil profile database for crop modeling applications iri et al 2015 the set of dssat model compatible soil profiles are provided in 5 arc minute grid by containing the required soil properties han et al 2019 the dominant topsoil texture types in savannakhet province are coarse textured sand 5 sandy loam 38 and loamy sand 41 while clay loam and loam texture groups account for less than 20 of the total area of province and yields in savannakhet province responds sensitively to changes in a fertilizer application rate due to the low soil fertility inthavong et al 2011 under a fertilizer rate of 60 13 16 n p k kg ha 1 the average yield can be increased from 1 6 mg ha 1 2 9 mg ha 1 while it could reach around 6 0 mg ha 1 under an unlimited nutrient condition inthavong et al 2014 2 3 the applications of the ceres rice model due to the lack of the detailed management information such as transplanting and harvesting dates and fertilizer application rates and timing we attempted to identify the standard agricultural management practices with the nasa power data the two cases of hindcasts for the rice growing seasons july to november jason and september to november son were selected in the study according to schiller et al 2001 we assumed that the lowland rainfed rice is transplanted in july and harvested in november for the case that the rice yields are predicted in june the nasa power data were used from january to june the synthetic weather data conditionally generated with the apcc mme hindcasts from july to november and the nasa power data for december hcst1 represents this case in fig 2 for hcst2 the meteorological variables from january to august and december are the nasa power data those from september to november are the apcc mme hindcasts for fcst the meteorological variables from january to august are the nasa power data those from september to november are the apcc mme forecast issued by august in the year 2020 and those for december is the climatological datasets therefore we first assessed rice yield variations with the two cases for the hindcast period and selected a case to more closely estimate the rice yields to the observed rice yields then we predicted the rice yield under the seasonal forecasts for the year of 2020 and suggested the n fertilizer application rate for achieving the national target yield overall procedures for this study are illustrated in fig 2 and more details are provided in the following sections the ceres rice is a crop module in the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer cropping system model dssat csm that enables to simulate rice growth and yield at different spatial and temporal scales under various management options jones et al 2003 provides a comprehensive description of the model including its predictive performance under diverse climates and various management practices the ceres rice model requires soil properties information daily weather data and rice genetic information after generating all input data the crop experimental data are identified by the information on fields planting dates initial conditions and cultivars in the form of the users specified file type with one s purpose tsuji et al 1994 seasonal analysis is run for the long term consecutive historical weather to select the best management options for crop the different combination of management options was designed as different treatment of crop correspondingly seasonal analysis runs as many times as the number of treatments at one site sarkar and kar 2006 once all the required input files are prepared we run the model at 195 individual each soil points in batch mode which contains the list of experiments and treatments on the different level of n fertilizer application rates each soil points could represent individual field information and it corresponds with the field distribution of paddy rice field in the study area the apcc mme seasonal hindcasts forecasts are produced in the tercile based categorical probabilities which used for the conditional weather generation to generate weather series we employed the stochastic weather generator formulated by apipattanavis et al 2007 based on the three state and first order markovian process the semi parametric generator allowed us to generate 100 sets of synthetic weather series by resampling the nasa power data conditioned with the tercile probabilities of seasonal climate forecasts the generated synthetic weathers datasets were used as daily basis meteorological inputs of the ceres rice the details of this stochastic connection are found in kim et al 2021 the meteorological input files consist of the three types of climate datasets the nasa power data the synthetic weather datasets generated by the stochastic weather generator under the apcc mme hindcasts forecasts and the climatological datasets as shown in fig 2 in this study the year of 2020 for fcst i e seasonal forecasts from september to november issued by august in the year 2020 was selected because the most recent observed rice yield data is those in 2020 a thadokkham1 tdk1 was selected as the target rice generic information for this study the cultivar features a high yielding photoperiod non sensitive and fertilizer responsive modern type variety and is resistant to gall midge this selected cultivar classified as a medium maturing variety could ripen in 134 140 days in the lowland environment inthapanya 2006 genotype of this rice variety was calibrated with flowering date period p1 p2o p2r and rice yield g1 g2 and validated the model for these cultivars showing in the perfect match with the measured value mape 3 27 chun et al 2018 table 1 due to a lack of fertilizer application rates for each rice paddy field we investigated the fertilizer application rates in savannakhet province proposed by inthavong et al 2014 to reasonably assume the representative fertilizer application rates with the three treatments level 0 0 n 0 p 0 k kg ha 1 level 1 60 n 13 p 16 k kg ha 1 and level 2 120 n 26 p 32 k kg ha 1 for these three treatments urea was assumed to be broadcast in flooded soil 20 days after transplanting dates the transplanting date was on july 1st when it is approximately one month after sowing for the rain fed lowland rice in wet season schiller 2006 the young seedlings 25 days were transplanted with a population density of 22 plants m 2 having an inter row spacing of 20 cm and a transplanting depth of 2 5 cm based on the standard agricultural practices for rice the parameters used for this study is summarized in table 2 for this study we applied this proposed crop modeling approach to identify a n fertilizer application rate to achieve the national target rice yield under the seasonal forecasts in the year of 2020 a total of nine fertilizer treatments were tested by incrementing 10 kg n ha 1 of n fertilizer rate 60 140 kg n ha 1 without any change in phosphorus and potassium application rates urea and its application method were assumed as the same as the above 2 4 the evaluation of the ceres rice model the ceres rice model was validated with the observed rice yield dataset by laos rice yield average statistics 1995 2010 issued by the department of meteorology and hydrology and laos statistical information services 2009 2019 http www laosis lsb gov la last access on 6 july 2022 and crop statistics in rainy season year book 2020 issued by department of agriculture and forestry maf 2021 the performance of the model by three different levels of fertilizer application rates was assessed using percent bias pbias root mean square deviation rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape 1 pbias i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 100 2 mape 100 n i 1 n o i p i o i 3 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n where oi is the observed value and pi is the predicted value 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance table 3 summarizes the goodness of fit of the simulated rice yields with the nasa power data for the hindcast period 1991 2010 measured against the observed rice yields the simulation with the level 1 fertilization 60 n 13 p 16 k kg ha 1 showed the best performance among the three management options against the observations the pbias mape and rmse were 4 5 5 8 0 2mg ha 1 respectively the simulated yields were relatively higher than those by inthavong et al s experiment 2014 in the same area but was closer to the actual yields inthavong et al 2014 predicted approximately 2 9 mg ha 1 and 3 9mg ha 1 with the fertilizer application rates at levels 1 and 2 3 2 rice yield variations with the apcc mme hindcasts fig 3 displays the simulated rice yield distributions under the apcc mme hindcasts for both hcst1 fig 3a and hcst2 fig 3b the three goodness of fit measures were 10 71 10 75 0 38mg ha 1 and 6 86 7 72 0 31mg ha 1 for hcst1 and hcst2 respectively the results showed that the seasonal variability of the simulated rice yields for hcst2 was better predicted than for hcst1 however the simulated rice yields in several years e g 2000 2001 and 2010 were largely underestimated in part the large discrepancy between simulated and observed rice yields is explained by the extreme flood events driven by la niña sutton et al 2019 approximately 12 460 ha of rainfed rice fields were destroyed by flooding in savannakhet province lao 2009 potentially causing the low rice yield in 2000 another possible reason is that mme hindcast probably caused uncertainties in predictions the predictability of the apcc mme hindcasts was not ideal because 60 days are mismatched out of 91 days in 2001 the central and southern parts of laos experienced flash floods in 2001 sutton et al 2019 and the tercile categorical rainfall from nasa power data was demonstrated as above normal an but the apcc mme hindcast was predicted as near normal nn likewise the 2010 hindcast indicates the above normal an rainfall for savannakhet province during september to november but the rainfall of nasa power data was rather indicated as below normal bn 3 3 rice yield predictions for fcst fig 5 shows the tercile based categorical probabilities of the simulated rice yields in savannakhet province the shaded areas represent the probabilities of the predicted rice yields based on the distribution of the simulated rice yields for the hindcast period for example the purple area represents the probability which the simulated rice yield would be bn for the year of 2020 the crop model simulated as approximately 18 of an 23 of nn and 59 of bn under fcst the predictability of apcc mme forecast of 2020 can be assessed throughout fig 4 the mme forecast was issued as an an nn with the 45 39 38 of probability from september to november respectively in the same year the average precipitation of nasa power data was categorized as nn an an considering matching 61 days out of total 91 days the predictability of mme forecast of 2020 is acceptable and reasonable to use for rice yield prediction fig 6a displays the observed and simulated rice yields in 2020 while the difference between the simulated rice yields for hcst2 and those for the nasa power data was not very large even the latter 2 98 mg ha 1 was largely underestimated one possible reason for similar trends could be that mme forecast would have good performance for 2020 however the observed rice yield in savannakhet province in 2020 was 4 24mg ha 1 this discrepancy can be explained by considering that the ceres rice model was calibrated with the n fertilizer application rates for the hindcast period 1991 2010 the tendency of observed yield needs to be importantly mentioned the scatter plot showed a clear increasing tendency in the observed rice yields fig 6b the average of rice yields in the period of 2011 2022 was 4 16 mg ha 1 and was 0 94 mg ha 1 higher than that in the hindcast period these findings led us to infer that the inclusive public investments or government strategies were probably adopted to increase productions such as increases in agricultural inputs including fertilizers and mechanization as well as an expansion of irrigation infrastructures fao 2020 the increasing trend in the rice yield in savannakhet province suggests that there have been substantial investments for agricultural sector according to the reports an average of usd 0 27 million was invested to the relevant government agencies annually during 2009 10 eliste et al 2012 in fact the rice production in laos significantly increased since 1990 s along with expanding irrigation areas and improving the rice cultivars the rice production has more than doubled even for the hindcast period 1991 2010 compared to the previous decade based on the extensive actions and efforts from governments and international societies eliste et al 2012 it should also be noted that it is hard to reflect these investments and advancements in technologies in simulation studies these findings suggest a further study on the calibration of the crop model to better represent a more resent decade for this more agricultural management practices should be collected in the province 3 4 farming decision makings for achieving the national target yield fig 7 displays the simulated rice yields in response to changing n fertilizer application rates increasing by 10 kg n ha 1 from 60 kg to 140 kg n ha 1 without any changes in phosphorus and potassium application rates the results showed that the average of rice yields in savannakhet province was 3 99 mg ha 1 4 27 mg ha 1 4 5 mg ha 1 4 75 mg ha 1 4 99 mg ha 1 and 5 23 mg ha 1 along with the increase in n fertilizer application rates from 60 70 80 90 100 110 kg n ha 1 respectively this result also indicated that about 70 kg n ha 1 of the n fertilizer application rate may be required to closely simulate the rice yield 4 27mg ha 1 in savannakhet province against the observed rice yield 4 24mg ha 1 these results also revealed that the national target yield could be fully achieved with 110 kg n ha 1 of the n fertilizer application rate according to the agricultural development strategy laos 2015 the laos government has planned to increase the total rice production to at least 5 million ton by the year of 2025 this study leads us to believe that the proposed crop modeling approach reflecting seasonal climate forecasts has promise as a tool in reducing impacts of climate variability on rice yield to produce more stable rice nonetheless the study has the gap from reality apart from n fertilizer application decision makers may concern in many different aspects ranging from the specific agricultural practices to the broad socio economic status for the modeling approach the study did not extend the analysis to the genotype of the improved cultivars the levels of irrigation for the non crop modeling approach the study could not cover socio economic status of farmer household such as access to climate information and the level of government subsidy which may also contribute to the achievement of the national target yield in reality 4 summary and conclusions to assess the interannual rice yields variability in savannakhet province we employed the ceres rice model and a stochastic weather generator to embed multi model climate forecasts in rice yield simulations the refined rice model allowed us to examine the specific fertilizing options to attain target yields under climate uncertainty from the case study with actual crop yield records we found that the ceres rice model could reproduce the observed rice yields with the level 1 fertilization of 60 n 13 p 16 k under the level 1 fertilization the rice yield simulation with the 3 month hindcasts were more accurate than those by the 5 month hindcasts to achieve the national target yield under the climatic variability the n fertilization level should be increased to 110 kg n ha 1 we also found that the ceres rice model forced by the 2020 apcc mme forecasts generated a rice yield trend similar to the generation by the reanalysis data suggesting acceptable predictability of the multi model climate forecasts a distinct advantage of the modeling framework in the study is that it enables to manage specific agricultural practices in a probabilistic manner based on advanced climate information the study thus has a potential to be used as a tool for exploring farming decisions in the various climate region although the case study mostly used the averages of simulated rice yields each management option can be compared in a more probabilistic manner for example by counting the simulated yields beyond a target hence the framework can be more informative for agricultural decision making than shown by the case study obviously some refinements are essential for the modeling framework to allow a more realistic risk management in this work a clear increasing trend was found in the rice yield observations and the crop model may not adequately reflect the increased productivity by technological advancements hence further efforts need to be made for but not limited to better parameterization of cultivar behaviors assessments of resources availability and formulating regional strategies based on the climate risk

to november are the apcc mme forecast issued by august in the year 2020 and those for december is the climatological datasets therefore we first assessed rice yield variations with the two cases for the hindcast period and selected a case to more closely estimate the rice yields to the observed rice yields then we predicted the rice yield under the seasonal forecasts for the year of 2020 and suggested the n fertilizer application rate for achieving the national target yield overall procedures for this study are illustrated in fig 2 and more details are provided in the following sections the ceres rice is a crop module in the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer cropping system model dssat csm that enables to simulate rice growth and yield at different spatial and temporal scales under various management options jones et al 2003 provides a comprehensive description of the model including its predictive performance under diverse climates and various management practices the ceres rice model requires soil properties information daily weather data and rice genetic information after generating all input data the crop experimental data are identified by the information on fields planting dates initial conditions and cultivars in the form of the users specified file type with one s purpose tsuji et al 1994 seasonal analysis is run for the long term consecutive historical weather to select the best management options for crop the different combination of management options was designed as different treatment of crop correspondingly seasonal analysis runs as many times as the number of treatments at one site sarkar and kar 2006 once all the required input files are prepared we run the model at 195 individual each soil points in batch mode which contains the list of experiments and treatments on the different level of n fertilizer application rates each soil points could represent individual field information and it corresponds with the field distribution of paddy rice field in the study area the apcc mme seasonal hindcasts forecasts are produced in the tercile based categorical probabilities which used for the conditional weather generation to generate weather series we employed the stochastic weather generator formulated by apipattanavis et al 2007 based on the three state and first order markovian process the semi parametric generator allowed us to generate 100 sets of synthetic weather series by resampling the nasa power data conditioned with the tercile probabilities of seasonal climate forecasts the generated synthetic weathers datasets were used as daily basis meteorological inputs of the ceres rice the details of this stochastic connection are found in kim et al 2021 the meteorological input files consist of the three types of climate datasets the nasa power data the synthetic weather datasets generated by the stochastic weather generator under the apcc mme hindcasts forecasts and the climatological datasets as shown in fig 2 in this study the year of 2020 for fcst i e seasonal forecasts from september to november issued by august in the year 2020 was selected because the most recent observed rice yield data is those in 2020 a thadokkham1 tdk1 was selected as the target rice generic information for this study the cultivar features a high yielding photoperiod non sensitive and fertilizer responsive modern type variety and is resistant to gall midge this selected cultivar classified as a medium maturing variety could ripen in 134 140 days in the lowland environment inthapanya 2006 genotype of this rice variety was calibrated with flowering date period p1 p2o p2r and rice yield g1 g2 and validated the model for these cultivars showing in the perfect match with the measured value mape 3 27 chun et al 2018 table 1 due to a lack of fertilizer application rates for each rice paddy field we investigated the fertilizer application rates in savannakhet province proposed by inthavong et al 2014 to reasonably assume the representative fertilizer application rates with the three treatments level 0 0 n 0 p 0 k kg ha 1 level 1 60 n 13 p 16 k kg ha 1 and level 2 120 n 26 p 32 k kg ha 1 for these three treatments urea was assumed to be broadcast in flooded soil 20 days after transplanting dates the transplanting date was on july 1st when it is approximately one month after sowing for the rain fed lowland rice in wet season schiller 2006 the young seedlings 25 days were transplanted with a population density of 22 plants m 2 having an inter row spacing of 20 cm and a transplanting depth of 2 5 cm based on the standard agricultural practices for rice the parameters used for this study is summarized in table 2 for this study we applied this proposed crop modeling approach to identify a n fertilizer application rate to achieve the national target rice yield under the seasonal forecasts in the year of 2020 a total of nine fertilizer treatments were tested by incrementing 10 kg n ha 1 of n fertilizer rate 60 140 kg n ha 1 without any change in phosphorus and potassium application rates urea and its application method were assumed as the same as the above 2 4 the evaluation of the ceres rice model the ceres rice model was validated with the observed rice yield dataset by laos rice yield average statistics 1995 2010 issued by the department of meteorology and hydrology and laos statistical information services 2009 2019 http www laosis lsb gov la last access on 6 july 2022 and crop statistics in rainy season year book 2020 issued by department of agriculture and forestry maf 2021 the performance of the model by three different levels of fertilizer application rates was assessed using percent bias pbias root mean square deviation rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape 1 pbias i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 100 2 mape 100 n i 1 n o i p i o i 3 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n where oi is the observed value and pi is the predicted value 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance table 3 summarizes the goodness of fit of the simulated rice yields with the nasa power data for the hindcast period 1991 2010 measured against the observed rice yields the simulation with the level 1 fertilization 60 n 13 p 16 k kg ha 1 showed the best performance among the three management options against the observations the pbias mape and rmse were 4 5 5 8 0 2mg ha 1 respectively the simulated yields were relatively higher than those by inthavong et al s experiment 2014 in the same area but was closer to the actual yields inthavong et al 2014 predicted approximately 2 9 mg ha 1 and 3 9mg ha 1 with the fertilizer application rates at levels 1 and 2 3 2 rice yield variations with the apcc mme hindcasts fig 3 displays the simulated rice yield distributions under the apcc mme hindcasts for both hcst1 fig 3a and hcst2 fig 3b the three goodness of fit measures were 10 71 10 75 0 38mg ha 1 and 6 86 7 72 0 31mg ha 1 for hcst1 and hcst2 respectively the results showed that the seasonal variability of the simulated rice yields for hcst2 was better predicted than for hcst1 however the simulated rice yields in several years e g 2000 2001 and 2010 were largely underestimated in part the large discrepancy between simulated and observed rice yields is explained by the extreme flood events driven by la niña sutton et al 2019 approximately 12 460 ha of rainfed rice fields were destroyed by flooding in savannakhet province lao 2009 potentially causing the low rice yield in 2000 another possible reason is that mme hindcast probably caused uncertainties in predictions the predictability of the apcc mme hindcasts was not ideal because 60 days are mismatched out of 91 days in 2001 the central and southern parts of laos experienced flash floods in 2001 sutton et al 2019 and the tercile categorical rainfall from nasa power data was demonstrated as above normal an but the apcc mme hindcast was predicted as near normal nn likewise the 2010 hindcast indicates the above normal an rainfall for savannakhet province during september to november but the rainfall of nasa power data was rather indicated as below normal bn 3 3 rice yield predictions for fcst fig 5 shows the tercile based categorical probabilities of the simulated rice yields in savannakhet province the shaded areas represent the probabilities of the predicted rice yields based on the distribution of the simulated rice yields for the hindcast period for example the purple area represents the probability which the simulated rice yield would be bn for the year of 2020 the crop model simulated as approximately 18 of an 23 of nn and 59 of bn under fcst the predictability of apcc mme forecast of 2020 can be assessed throughout fig 4 the mme forecast was issued as an an nn with the 45 39 38 of probability from september to november respectively in the same year the average precipitation of nasa power data was categorized as nn an an considering matching 61 days out of total 91 days the predictability of mme forecast of 2020 is acceptable and reasonable to use for rice yield prediction fig 6a displays the observed and simulated rice yields in 2020 while the difference between the simulated rice yields for hcst2 and those for the nasa power data was not very large even the latter 2 98 mg ha 1 was largely underestimated one possible reason for similar trends could be that mme forecast would have good performance for 2020 however the observed rice yield in savannakhet province in 2020 was 4 24mg ha 1 this discrepancy can be explained by considering that the ceres rice model was calibrated with the n fertilizer application rates for the hindcast period 1991 2010 the tendency of observed yield needs to be importantly mentioned the scatter plot showed a clear increasing tendency in the observed rice yields fig 6b the average of rice yields in the period of 2011 2022 was 4 16 mg ha 1 and was 0 94 mg ha 1 higher than that in the hindcast period these findings led us to infer that the inclusive public investments or government strategies were probably adopted to increase productions such as increases in agricultural inputs including fertilizers and mechanization as well as an expansion of irrigation infrastructures fao 2020 the increasing trend in the rice yield in savannakhet province suggests that there have been substantial investments for agricultural sector according to the reports an average of usd 0 27 million was invested to the relevant government agencies annually during 2009 10 eliste et al 2012 in fact the rice production in laos significantly increased since 1990 s along with expanding irrigation areas and improving the rice cultivars the rice production has more than doubled even for the hindcast period 1991 2010 compared to the previous decade based on the extensive actions and efforts from governments and international societies eliste et al 2012 it should also be noted that it is hard to reflect these investments and advancements in technologies in simulation studies these findings suggest a further study on the calibration of the crop model to better represent a more resent decade for this more agricultural management practices should be collected in the province 3 4 farming decision makings for achieving the national target yield fig 7 displays the simulated rice yields in response to changing n fertilizer application rates increasing by 10 kg n ha 1 from 60 kg to 140 kg n ha 1 without any changes in phosphorus and potassium application rates the results showed that the average of rice yields in savannakhet province was 3 99 mg ha 1 4 27 mg ha 1 4 5 mg ha 1 4 75 mg ha 1 4 99 mg ha 1 and 5 23 mg ha 1 along with the increase in n fertilizer application rates from 60 70 80 90 100 110 kg n ha 1 respectively this result also indicated that about 70 kg n ha 1 of the n fertilizer application rate may be required to closely simulate the rice yield 4 27mg ha 1 in savannakhet province against the observed rice yield 4 24mg ha 1 these results also revealed that the national target yield could be fully achieved with 110 kg n ha 1 of the n fertilizer application rate according to the agricultural development strategy laos 2015 the laos government has planned to increase the total rice production to at least 5 million ton by the year of 2025 this study leads us to believe that the proposed crop modeling approach reflecting seasonal climate forecasts has promise as a tool in reducing impacts of climate variability on rice yield to produce more stable rice nonetheless the study has the gap from reality apart from n fertilizer application decision makers may concern in many different aspects ranging from the specific agricultural practices to the broad socio economic status for the modeling approach the study did not extend the analysis to the genotype of the improved cultivars the levels of irrigation for the non crop modeling approach the study could not cover socio economic status of farmer household such as access to climate information and the level of government subsidy which may also contribute to the achievement of the national target yield in reality 4 summary and conclusions to assess the interannual rice yields variability in savannakhet province we employed the ceres rice model and a stochastic weather generator to embed multi model climate forecasts in rice yield simulations the refined rice model allowed us to examine the specific fertilizing options to attain target yields under climate uncertainty from the case study with actual crop yield records we found that the ceres rice model could reproduce the observed rice yields with the level 1 fertilization of 60 n 13 p 16 k under the level 1 fertilization the rice yield simulation with the 3 month hindcasts were more accurate than those by the 5 month hindcasts to achieve the national target yield under the climatic variability the n fertilization level should be increased to 110 kg n ha 1 we also found that the ceres rice model forced by the 2020 apcc mme forecasts generated a rice yield trend similar to the generation by the reanalysis data suggesting acceptable predictability of the multi model climate forecasts a distinct advantage of the modeling framework in the study is that it enables to manage specific agricultural practices in a probabilistic manner based on advanced climate information the study thus has a potential to be used as a tool for exploring farming decisions in the various climate region although the case study mostly used the averages of simulated rice yields each management option can be compared in a more probabilistic manner for example by counting the simulated yields beyond a target hence the framework can be more informative for agricultural decision making than shown by the case study obviously some refinements are essential for the modeling framework to allow a more realistic risk management in this work a clear increasing trend was found in the rice yield observations and the crop model may not adequately reflect the increased productivity by technological advancements hence further efforts need to be made for but not limited to better parameterization of cultivar behaviors assessments of resources availability and formulating regional strategies based on the climate risk

9271,water is an important for plants growth development and generating good crop yield the rate of consumption of water by the crops depends on the type of crop stage soil characteristics and local climatic conditions irrigation scheduling takes care of when and how much water is to be applied to a crop during the entire the growing period this calls for optimal water management equipment and labor in developing countries an electronic wetting front detector was developed for irrigation scheduling by estimating the optimum soil moisture content present at the root zone depth of the crops the device measures the volumetric water content using electrical resistance of the soil and alarms the growers for the need of irrigation through its led indicator installed in the device the device was further calibrated and validated in the laboratory as well as in the farmer s field near central university of jharkhand ranchi india the device was tested and calibrated in the laboratory with the soil present in a container along with the tensiometer fixed in the same container of soil and the data of the gravimetric soil moisture content was compared for accuracy by using regression analysis similarly validation was also performed in the farmer s field and the result showed that it has a higher accuracy for measuring the soil water content the developed device interprets readings from the sensors and alarms the farmer of overirrigation or underirrigation based on the sensors data the ewfd developed is new intervention since the device could be easily used by farmer to understand the soil water content and schedule irrigation with respect to crop needs by alarming the farming therefore the device may prove a valuable contribution to the list of other scientific instruments used for measuring the soil water content the device can be used perfectly for scheduling irrigation keywords electronic wetting front detector electrical resistance irrigation scheduling regression analysis tensiometer light emitting diode data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is consumed by the growing crops continuously and its rate of consumption is affected by the type of crop crop stage soil characteristics and atmospheric conditions irrigation is provided as a supplemental water application to land for agricultural production when crop water requirement is not met with normal rainfall the key to maximize the irrigation performance is uniformity and timely application of irrigation water poor irrigation management results in either over or under irrigation and it can cause reduced crop yields poor crop quality increased vulnerability for disease increased costs of pumping and soluble nutrients leaching from the root zone excess water application leads to the nitrogen levels reductions within the crop root zone ashley et al 1997 the time interval of irrigation water application affects the crop yields and operating costs timely application of water in required quantity throughout the agricultural field helps in deriving the maximum benefits from water managing and irrigation scheduling to schedule the irrigation for utilizing the water efficiently and to optimize the production of the crops it is important to check the soil moisture conditions of the crop root zone of at regular intervals several methods for irrigation scheduling are in practice and used for specific purpose with varying degrees of success the aim of irrigation scheduling is to ensure the optimum water supply and maintain the soil moisture close to field capacity jones 2004 present methods devices and equipment used for scheduling irrigation and precisely to determine the water availability in the soil and the irrigation requirement has become either obsolete or are not handy to be used by farmers the various methods adopted to schedule irrigation are water balance method soil water potential measurement using tensiometer soil water potential measurement using electrical resistance gypsum blocks plant moisture content measurement using turgor pressure sensor soil water content measurement employing neutron probe and soil water content measurement by using time domain reflectrometry the water balance method maintains a record of incoming and outgoing soil water and ensure that adequate water is available for the plant growth the method is tedious and difficult to determine the data of input and output in a certain region or cropland grabow et al 2008 a tensiometer measures the soil water tension and is receptive to soil water tensions of 0 100 centibars cbars practically the tensiometer operates in the range of 0 75 cbars for a particular type of soil tensiometer is calibrated to constitute a relationship between soil water tension and soil water content tensiometers are normally used in coarse textured soils or where the soil moisture is kept at higher levels such as drip or centre pivot irrigation systems moa 2015 further a tensiometer is not appropriate for fruit trees due to more negative soil water tensions than a tensiometer can read sharma 2019 for example 100 kpa soil water tension can be considered as dry condition for vegetable crops but that can still be considered as wet moisture condition for fruit tress an analog tensiometer generally cost around inr 6000 8000 and the price of digital tensiometer starts from inr 9000 the developed electronic wetting front detector cost around the inr 7000 however it should be noted that the developed device is a prototype and the development cost include trial and error wear and tear of components used during developing the device electrical resistance block measures the soil water potential and cannot be used at soil water potential at which most of the available water is held by soils as the resistance blocks do not directly show the soil water content deciding the depth of irrigation water application is difficult a neutron probe is the most advanced accurate and complex equipment that measures the moisture content in the soil this is non destructive and directly measure the moisture content without disturbing the soil the main disadvantage is to follow the safety rules for operation transportation and storing the probe the neutron probes are usually used by large organizations or consultants running a service for smaller operators due to high cost and the need for a licensed operator time domain reflectometry tdr measure soil water content indirectly and works on the principle of time taken to travel by a high frequency electromagnetic pulse through the soil this travel time is used to determine the dielectric constant permittivity of the material the permittivity of the soil is firmly related to the water content due to the exclusive properties of the water molecule topp 1987 the time domain reflectometry is beyond the range of equipment affordable by farmers apart from the existing instruments many research works have been carried out to ease the scheduling of irrigation cary and fisher 1983 developed an irrigation scheduling system with electronic and soil water sensors the device used electrical resistance to determine irrigation water application these devices were based on a microprocessor circuit with a programmable calculator to predict the time for the next irrigation and detect wetting front and indicate with a mechanical flag the mechanical flag may not work at night plant et al 1992 developed a program shell of experts called calex to promote decision making in crop management the methods employs irrigation scheduling based on leaf water capacity increasing degree days water budgeting process final irrigation based on the planned cutout date and last irrigation based on the optimum dates observed torres 1998 designed and tested a visual apparatus in the form of a plastic container to schedule irrigation of sugarcane the developed irrigation scheduling system was also patented by the us patent office this device use centre pivot and drip irrigation systems to automate water management upchurch and wanjura 1996 testezlaf et al 1997 developed an integrated system for managing greenhouse container plants using a device to control irrigation the development consisted of three distinctive steps selection of appropriate water application control hardware development of a convenient software interface that allows for simple control of system operation and testing of the control system s reliability george et al 2000 developed an irrigation scheduling model consisting of a database management system model base and graphical user interface to perform irrigation scheduling for single and multiple fields under various management options the model focused on a regular approach to water management and records climate crop and soil information as data stirzaker and hutchinson 2005 used a simple wetting front detector fullstop wetting front detector to check the accuracy of scheduling irrigation to turf by sprinkler which shut off the water automatically after the wetting front had approached a required depth in the soil the detector was a funnel shaped tube buried in the earth once a wetting front enters the detector it distorts the unsaturated flow lines such that the water content at the funnel base approaches saturation the free water generated was electronically detected and that gave the signal to stop irrigation fullstop wetting front detector is a mechanical device that detect the depth of the wetting front and when the wetting front occurs but the fullstop wetting front detector would not be able to measure the soil moisture content however the electronic wetting front detector can not only detect and alarm the farmer of the wetting front but can also measure the soil moisture content before and after the wetting front is detected munoz carpena et al 2008 developed an irrigation controller and used dielectric soil water probe the developed model was tested in the field conditions and compared with other traditional automated scheduling methods on tomato crop under drip irrigation system and plastic mulch in south florida ouda et al 2013 provided an evaluation of the use of gpr technology to compute soil water content they further suggested the gpr technique to be used in the study region of eastern province saudi arabia to measure agricultural field soil water content as a precise accurate and alternative approach to traditional measurement methods a new irrigation scheduling program was suggested based on the gpr methodology which was tested and revised to apply to the crops in the intended region several soil moisture sensors are gaining popularity in the suite of irrigation equipment with advancements in microcomputer and communication technology the telemetry system provides a continuous and real time data which is transmitted through portable communication devices to the irrigation manager with the development in design and electronic components sector smaller soil moisture sensors can be installed at multiple depths aguilar et al 2015 kore et al 2017 conducted a study to evaluate crop water requirements and developed irrigation scheduling for selected crops for the khadakwasla dam in pune district of maharashtra katsoulas et al 2017 developed a knowledge based framework for online precise irrigation scheduling opiris an algorithm was developed for irrigation scheduling using a web based application prabha et al 2019 developed a model to irrigate crops and reduce the cost of electricity labor and water they also established a system analyzing the symptoms shown on the leaves which can also recognize possible diseases in the plants therefore they sought to create a viable low cost implementable model using hc 05 modules building a wireless network the presently available methods and devices for scheduling irrigation have either become obsolete or limited to experimental laboratories and are seldom used by farmers to schedule irrigation especially in developing countries a device is required which should be handy and cost effective a real time telemetry sensors are available in markets however it would be difficult for a farmer to interpret the readings of the sensors to schedule irrigation ewfd developed interprets readings from the sensors and alarms the farmer of overirrigation or underirrigation based on the data received from the sensors the ewfd developed is new intervention since the device could be easily used by farmer to understand the soil water content and schedule irrigation with respect to crop needs by alarming the farming in the present study an electronic wetting front detector ewfd has been developed and tested which can easily determine the soil moisture content detect and alarm the need for irrigation if the soil moisture content in the root zone of the crop drops below or above a certain level the device was tested in the laboratory and the performance has been validated in the field conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 working principles and components the soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content by using the electrical resistance of the soil the electrical resistance in the soil increases with a decrease in the amount of water in the soil thus the relationship for the variation in the resistance between the two conducting plates of the soil moisture sensor due to the variation in the amount of moisture present in the soil is inverse in nature the proposed device consists of the components such as a soil moisture sensor controller board arduino uno circuit board 9 v battery and 20 mm led bulb the soil moisture sensor consists of a couple of conductive probes which is used to measure the volumetric content of water in the soil fig 1a the controller board consists of an lm393 ic voltage comparator connectors leds resistors etc to measure the soil moisture fig 1b the sensitivity of the module could be regulated with an aid of a potentiometer present in the controller board the controller board consists of four pins which are vcc voltage supply collector to collector gnd ground ao analog output and do digital output the voltage in the sensors and board is provided through vcc and gnd and depending on the analog output the wire is connected to ao and if the output is required in digital then it is connected to do the most important component of this device is arduino uno fig 1c arduino uno allows us to interpret the readings measured by the sensors and converts them into adc analog to digital converter output it is the microcomputer of the device which decides whether the soil moisture is sufficient in the soil or it is below the required level for the crops and thus indicates the low moisture content by turning the light emitting diode led bulb on which is connected with the circuit through jumper wires power to the circuit is provided through a 9 v battery or data cable connected to computers or through dc adapters arduino uno works on the programing command which is installed in the circuit through data cable from arduino uno s software arduino ide the programming language on which it works is similar to the c c programing language the programming code was uploaded in the arduino uno through a data cable from the arduino sketchbook software known as arduino ide from pc laptop and after completion of all the circuits and connections the device is ready to use the present moisture content of the soil in which the device is placed can be read through the serial monitor of arduino ide from a pc laptop however the moisture content which is displayed in the serial monitor is in adc analog to digital converter value form and not in percentage adc values are analog to digital converter values which is the output from the arduino uno interpreted from soil moisture sensors theoretically adc values range from 0 to 1023 is range with 0 means gravimetric soil moisture content is 100 and 1023 means gravimetric soil moisture content is 0 theoretically the adc value can be changed to soil volumetric moisture percentage through the following formula analog output adc value 1023 moisture in percentage 100 analog output 100 for zero moisture we get a maximum value of 10 bit adc as 1023 which gives a value of 0 moisture although this is not the actual volumetric water content percentage for any type of soil and hence the device needs to be calibrated before use in the field the conductivity in the soil moisture probe varies with the water content in the soil if the amount of water in the soil is high then the conductivity through the probe is also high and consequently the input to the comparator will be high this means that the output of the comparator is high therefore the led will be on fig 2 similarly when there is the moisture content is within the range as defined by the user and the conductivity of the soil moisture probe decreases and the output of the comparator becomes low the led then switches off this led on and off operation could be set so that led could be switched on if the soil moisture content falls outside the user defined range and switches off when soil moisture is within user defined range the board between the arduino and the probe is a controller which helps calibrate the sensor s sensing capabilities the basic principle on which electronic wetting front detector works is that soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content using electrical resistance of the soil to calculate the soil moisture content the electrical resistance in the soil nonetheless increases with decrease in the amount of water in the soil these electrical signals are received by arduino uno the board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input output pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards shields and other circuits the board has 14 digital input output pins six capable of pwm output 6 analog input output pins and is programmable with the arduino ide integrated development environment via a type b usb cable the arduino uno interprets the readings from the soil moisture sensors and gives output in adc analog to digital convertor values as defined by the user in case of ewfd the arduino uno is programmed to detect the signals from soil moisture sensors and warn the user that the soil moisture is above or below the desired level of soil moisture although the ewfd soil moisture sensors work on the same principle as electrical resistance gypsum blocks however the ewfd output and application is different as it would be used as a irrigation scheduling device rather than only measuring soil moisture sensor in case of ewfd soil moisture sensors measures the volumetric water content using electrical resistance of the soil to calculate the soil moisture content the electrical resistance in the soil nonetheless increases with decrease in the amount of water in the soil which helps to measure the soil moisture content at the root zone depth the soil moisture sensors probe has a shape of fork so that it can measure the electrical resistance between two tines of the fork shaped soil moisture probe 2 2 installation laboratory and field testing the device is very simple to install and use firstly the root zone depth of the crop is ascertained and then the percentage of moisture required by the crop is determined this information can be obtained from agricultural universities located in the area secondly the preprogrammed device is buried with the sensors at the root zone depth of the crop thirdly the calibrated device is turned on and if the led indicator lights up that means soil does not have enough moisture for the crop and thus it needs irrigation similarly during the process of irrigation if the led turns on again that means the moisture content has increased beyond the limit defined by the user and the user is overirrigating the field the front view of ewfd is shown in fig 3 the purpose of the testing was to measure the accuracy of the device the device was tested in the geotechnical laboratory at central university of jharkhand ranchi india where the setup was placed for testing the device fig 4 the setup consists of a box of dimensions 43 43 60 cm the box was filled up with soil collected from the campus premise to a height of 40 cm the grain size distribution of the soil was determined and the corresponding coefficient of uniformity cu and coefficient of curvature cc were estimated the device was placed at a 30 cm depth of soil from the top of the box now a calibrated tensiometer was inserted in the box to a depth of 30 cm the sample of soil was taken from the 30 cm depth from the box with the help of a long core cutter for measuring gravimetric soil water content the sample soil was weighed and then kept in the laboratory oven for 24 h at 110 c the sample was taken out after 24 h and then weighed again and noted the reading from the tensiometer was noted after 24 h from its placement in the soil to get a stable reading simultaneously the device was connected to a laptop via data cable and turned on and adc value soil moisture content was displayed through the serial monitor of arduino ide on the laptop readings from the tensiometer and electronic wetting front detector were noted then about 6 cm depth of water i e 11 094 litres applied to the soil in the box gradually at a set of 1 litre further the setup was left for 24 h so that the water could infiltrate till 40 cm depth and distribute evenly at that depth continuous reading was noted from the tensiometer and the electronic wetting front detector and the gravimetric soil water content was measured of the sample from 30 cm depth of soil for 27 days at an interval of 2 3 days the soil water content of the soil sample was measured from the well known following formula 1 moisture content initial weight oven dried weight oven dried weight 100 the moisture content recorded from the electronic wetting front detector was compared with the gravimetric soil moisture content and soil water potential from tensiometer measured at that particular time and consequently regression analysis was performed from the collected data which helped in determining the accuracy of the device the accuracy of the device was estimated by comparing it with the real time field data and the predicted data of the device the device was finally set by feeding the lower and upper limit of the soil moisture percentage in the program code required for a particular crop such as in the case of wheat crops the volumetric soil moisture content should be around 60 therefore the device was calibrated in such a way that the lower level of moisture to raise an indication should be 60 and the upper limit should be around 80 depending on the required settings for a particular type of soil and crop in the field the electronic wetting front detector was tested and validated for the data collected from the laboratory in the farmers field the device was tested for proper working and operation in the farmers field fig 5 the testing of the device was conducted in the farmers field located at the cheri near central university of jharkhand ranchi jharkhand further the device was tested in the farmer s field where similar procedures were carried out for the okra crop and the soil type was clayey sand the optimal gravimetric moisture content of soil for the okra plant was determined as 40 2 3 data analysis a simple linear regression analysis was carried out by using the data collected from the ewfd tensiometer and gravimetric soil water content of the soil sample in the laboratory the tensiometers measure the soil water tension in kpa bar and gravimetric water content is calculated in percentage ewfd measures soil moisture content in adc values though these devices and methods do not measure same parameter however there is a clear correlation between then a correlation needs to be established between soil water tension measured by tensiometer gravimetric soil water content and ewfd readings by carrying out a simple linear regression analysis since as established when soil moisture tension increases gravimetric water content percentage decreases and ewfd s adc value increases the coefficient of determination r 2 was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of regression which helps to determine how well a model fits the measured values the coefficient of determination is based on the sum of squares in which the total sum of squares is subdivided into the sum of squares and the sum of residual squares the coefficient of determination r 2 is determined by the following relationship 2 r 2 explained variation total variation regression sum of square ssr total sum of square sst where the regression sum of square is y ˆ y 2 the total sum of the square is y y 2 y ˆ isthe estimated dependent variable y isthe mean of the dependent variable y is the original dependent variable the r 2 often called the variation proportion and is explained by the regressor x it varies from 0 to 1 0 r 2 1 and values of r 2 close to 1 imply that most of the variability in y is elucidated by the regression model that means variation in the dependent variable will cause an immediate variation in the independent variable the adjusted r 2 value is adjusted according to the number of variables included in the regression equation this is used to determine the expected shrinkage in r 2 that might not generalize to the population as our solution is over fitted to the data set by inculcating several more independent variables if the adjusted r 2 value is much lesser than the r 2 value it is an indication that our regression equation may be over fitted to the sample and of limited generalization ability in regression analysis the most widely accepted p value which is used to indicate a good significance level is 95 the significance level for a given hypothesis test is a p value for which a value calculated value less than or equal to alpha is considered statistically significant typical α value levels are 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 pearson correlation coefficient indicates the extent to which dots in scatter plots lie in a straight line a correlation of 1 indicates that the two variables are perfectly negatively related a 0 value of correlation indicates that the two variables do not have any linear relation but non linear relation may exist a correlation of 1 indicates that the two variables a perfectly positively related the p p plot is a comparison of the observed cumulative distribution function cdf of the standardized residual to the expected cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution the p p plot has been plotted and it illustrates a comparison between the cdf of the observed and the predicted values of the dependent variable if the greatest number of points falls along the 45º straight line then the plot is best fitted and the relationship between the estimated and observed variable is good 3 results and discussions 3 1 grain size distribution analysis the grain size distribution of soil samples was carried out an oven dried soil sample of about 1 kg was taken and grinded thoroughly the grinded sample was sieved with different sizes of standard sieves arranged in decreasing order and sieved through a mechanical sieve shaker the result obtained from the grain size distribution of the soil sample is shown in fig 6 indian standard soil classification system is given in table 1 the gravel sand silt and clay are represented by group symbols g s m and c respectively since 71 695 passes through a 4 75 mm sieve and is retained in a 0 075 mm sieve therefore the soil is classified as sandy soil since it is greater than 50 the coefficient of uniformity cu and coefficient of curvature cc of the soil was determined as given below coefficient of uniformity cu d 60 d 10 13 33 coefficient of curvature cc d 30 2 d 60 d 10 0 83 d 10 d 60 and d 30 were determined from the graph shown in fig 6 from the above data it is deduced that the soil is a well graded sandy soil particle size analysis was carried out to determine the soil type for which the device was calibrated and tested with respect to gravimetric water content of the soil and soil water tension although the soil type change would also have an effect on ewfd reading and therefore ewfd needs to be calibrated for each type of soil in which the crops are grown and irrigation scheduling is required 3 2 calibration of ewfd under laboratory set up the ewfd was inserted in the sample box at a depth of 30 cm for calibration of the device along with the tensiometer the readings of soil moisture content of the soil from the tensiometer and ewfd were recorded at the regular interval of 24 h the observations are presented in table 2 soil water content and tensiometer reading kpa were taken as predictors and ewfd reading adc values was considered as the dependent variable in table 3 soil water content and tensiometer reading kpa were taken as predictors constant and ewfd reading adc values was considered as dependent variable the r2 from the regression analysis was found to be 0 967 the model was found to be significant because p value was lesser than 0 05 it can be seen that the significance value is 0 000 this means that there is 100 of chance that the model and the data to be true the coefficient table was obtained from spss multiple regression analysis which defines the relationship between variables such as ewfd reading tensiometer reading and soil moisture reading along with their standard deviation and significance the unstandardized coefficient b contains a constant value multiples of tensiometer reading and soil moisture reading in order to relate with ewfd value the standard error is the extent to which the constant and the multiple variables are accurate standard coefficient measures the strength of each independent variable to the dependent variable irrespective of the positive or negative sign a simple linear regression analysis resulted in the coefficient table tables 4 and 5 which is required to establish correlation between ewfd reading gravimetric soil moisture content and tensiometer reading resulting in eqs 3 and 4 from the coefficient table 4 an equation can be formed as 3 y 2 597 x 2 697 z 556 442 u where y ewfd reading adc value x tensiometer reading kpa z soil water content in percentage u error in estimate from the coefficient table 5 an equation can be formed as 4 y 700 922 7 454 z u where y ewfd reading adc value z soil water content in percentage u error in estimate eq 3 defines the correlation between soil water tension recorded by tensiometer gravimetric soil water content and ewfd readings adc values however eq 4 defines direct correlation between gravimetric water content in percentage with respect to ewfd reading the eq 4 is important since gravimetric water content calculation is independent of any device reading and is the actual water content in the soil sample the above two equations were used to predict and validate the data collected from the field test from table 6 obtained from spss multiple regression analysis it is observed that ewfd reading is positively 0 960 times related to tensiometer reading and 0 805 times negatively related to soil water content i e ewfd reading increases then soil water content decreases the significance of the soil water content and the ewfd reading is 0 002 which means that there is a 99 8 chance of their relation and data to be true also the significance of the tensiometer reading and ewfd reading is 0 000 which implies that there is a 100 chance of their relation and data to be true normal p p plot demonstrates the two functions of cumulative distribution i e observed cumulative probability and expected cumulative probability against each other which help to access how closely two sets of data agree in fig 7 it is seen that points are along the diagonal line thus it is established that the residual values have a normal distribution it is clear from table 7 of casewise diagnostics of the ewfd reading that the difference between the observed and the predicted ewfd reading adc values is not more than 20 from the regression model and the maximum chances of error are 8 hence the model is significant in table 7 case numbers are serial numbers since spss statistics software considered each ewfd reading as a case and established a comparison based on predicted ewfd readings calculated from correlation eqs 3 and 4 and the ewfd reading recorded from field this signifies that the predicted values do not differ much from the observed values hence this model can be validated by comparing the data collected from the field test with the data estimated from this model and thus determining the accuracy of the ewfd device 3 3 validation of ewfd in field condition the ewfd along with the tensiometer was installed in the okra field for proper testing and validation of the device the soil moisture content of the soil from the tensiometer and ewfd were recorded at an interval of about 5 days ewfd contains two soil moisture sensor and same was deployed in field in an optimum location so that it can monitor change in soil moisture content experienced by okra plants the okra plants grows in sandy loamy soil and since the soil sample for which the grain size distribution analysis was carried out was taken from a location not farther away from the field therefore it was assumed that soil type in the field was a sandy soil as per grain size distribution analysis as mentioned however more field trials are needed the ewfd was tested and calibrated in both laboratory and field in sandy soil as mentioned from the grain size distribution analysis of the soil and it should be noted that soil parameters changes with the soil type such as water and air holding capacity of the soil therefore the device needs to be calibrated for use for different soil type the analysis and validation of the data provided in table 8 were checked for accuracy and proper working by placing these sets of data in the calibrated eq 3 for this validation the estimated value of ewfd reading tensiometer in kpa and gravimetric soil water content was determined by using the eq 3 this was further compared with the observed value from the device in the field and checked for the percentage of error in estimated and observed values are presented in table 9 furthermore the data sets acquired from the field were analyzed by using eq 4 and compared with the observed value from the device in the field and again checked for the percentage of error in estimated and observed value from this equation are shown in table 10 from tables 9 and 10 this was observed that the ewfd value predicted from the eq 3 table 9 has a much greater difference from the ewfd value observed from the field therefore it has a larger percentage of error due to that difference moreover we can observe that the ewfd value predicted from the eq 4 has a much lower difference than that of the observed ewfd value from the field therefore it has a much lower percentage of error the observed ewfd value collected from the field had a much higher difference than the predicted ewfd value calculated from eq 3 where tensiometer reading from the field was also one of the variables along with soil moisture reading from the field however the observed ewfd value collected from the field had a very low difference was much similar value to the predicted ewfd value calculated from eq 4 where only soil moisture reading was variable therefore it is inferred that the predicted ewfd value is not much accurate when tensiometer reading was used as a variable furthermore it also means that tensiometer reading is not much reliable for determining soil moisture as the tensiometer reading deviates from soil moisture reading from field and ewfd is much more reliable for determining soil moisture on further investigation and comparing the two equations the data sets collected from the field and the estimated and observed value of ewfd from tables 9 and 10 it can be deduced that there was an error in the tensiometer reading recorded from the field the error in readings of tensiometer in the field may have arisen due to three main reasons such as i poor contact between the ceramic tip and the soil ii the tensiometer has a lower range of measurements from 0 kpa to 100 kpa of soil water potential thus it couldn t measure negative pressure iii the device is not being properly calibrated and filled with field solution without removal of air bubble it should be noted that ewfd is calibrated to be used for irrigation scheduling for vegetable plants and rabi crops cereal crops in india which generally requires soil water tension of 0 1 0 6 bars 10 60 kpa and soil water tension any greater or less than the above range would cause over or under irrigation hence from the above deduction it is clear that both the device and the equations derived would help to schedule irrigation almost perfectly from table 10 as it does not contain error due to tensiometer reading the accuracy of the device comes out as 99 by looking into the maximum percentage of error in table 9 and worst possible case it can be assumed to be 95 90 several advantages of this device are it easily determines the soil moisture content in the root zone of the crop and detects whether to indicate or not for the irrigation process the upper limit and lower limit of soil moisture content to indicate can easily be changed depending on the type of soil and crop present one can conveniently access the soil moisture content in the root zone of the soil by connecting the device with a computer system through a usb one can easily understand the need for irrigation and start the irrigation process as this device detects soil moisture and immediately indicate it through its led bulb indicator this device doesn t require much maintenance as the sensor can last more than one year and also the cost of this device is very low therefore it is farmer friendly it can be used as many in the field as it increases the accuracy through installing the device in the field in a distributed manner which can help to determine the part of the field which needs to be irrigated the device could be used to detect wetting front by installing two ewfd at two separate depths of the soil at a certain distance 1 2 m apart this setup will not only detect the depth of wetting front but will also measure the soil moisture content 4 conclusions this study was an attempt to develop calibrate and validate a new irrigation scheduling device that will not only replace obsolete irrigation scheduling methods and devices but also help the growers and farmers to control crop water consumption effectively this new device will only work in a fully efficient manner if it is configured properly and calibrated with the particular type of crop for which it is to be used the electronic wetting front detector provides a better alternative than the hit and trial methods used by irrigators or growers at a very affordable price furthermore in this study a relation was also established between the gravimetric soil water content soil water potential and electronic wetting front detector adc values with almost 96 of accuracy also a statistical analysis of the device calibration readings with gravimetric soil moisture content and soil water potential readings was carried out which confirmed the relevancy of the device in the laboratory test the proposed electronic wetting front detector can schedule irrigation almost perfectly with maximum chances of error would be around 1 the electronic wetting front detector could be used as a scientific instrument that can measure soil moisture content with almost 99 accuracy greater than the tensiometer which requires maintenance and servicing while in use and also tensiometer has a range of 100 kpa to 0 kpa i e it cannot measure negative pressure generated for different soil type due to the lower range of measurement whereas ewfd doesn t require any field servicing as long as it is installed in the field and it has a larger range of measurement as it measures in adc values from 0 to 1000 tending to increased sensitivity in fluctuations of soil water content these several features make ewfd more versatile than the tensiometer and other expensive devices available to be used as a scientific instrument for measuring soil moisture content and also to schedule irrigation further planning to develop and increase the versatility of the ewfd is in the process by increasing the sensitivity to measure the soil water content through more advanced sensors such as capacitive soil moisture sensors declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9271,water is an important for plants growth development and generating good crop yield the rate of consumption of water by the crops depends on the type of crop stage soil characteristics and local climatic conditions irrigation scheduling takes care of when and how much water is to be applied to a crop during the entire the growing period this calls for optimal water management equipment and labor in developing countries an electronic wetting front detector was developed for irrigation scheduling by estimating the optimum soil moisture content present at the root zone depth of the crops the device measures the volumetric water content using electrical resistance of the soil and alarms the growers for the need of irrigation through its led indicator installed in the device the device was further calibrated and validated in the laboratory as well as in the farmer s field near central university of jharkhand ranchi india the device was tested and calibrated in the laboratory with the soil present in a container along with the tensiometer fixed in the same container of soil and the data of the gravimetric soil moisture content was compared for accuracy by using regression analysis similarly validation was also performed in the farmer s field and the result showed that it has a higher accuracy for measuring the soil water content the developed device interprets readings from the sensors and alarms the farmer of overirrigation or underirrigation based on the sensors data the ewfd developed is new intervention since the device could be easily used by farmer to understand the soil water content and schedule irrigation with respect to crop needs by alarming the farming therefore the device may prove a valuable contribution to the list of other scientific instruments used for measuring the soil water content the device can be used perfectly for scheduling irrigation keywords electronic wetting front detector electrical resistance irrigation scheduling regression analysis tensiometer light emitting diode data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is consumed by the growing crops continuously and its rate of consumption is affected by the type of crop crop stage soil characteristics and atmospheric conditions irrigation is provided as a supplemental water application to land for agricultural production when crop water requirement is not met with normal rainfall the key to maximize the irrigation performance is uniformity and timely application of irrigation water poor irrigation management results in either over or under irrigation and it can cause reduced crop yields poor crop quality increased vulnerability for disease increased costs of pumping and soluble nutrients leaching from the root zone excess water application leads to the nitrogen levels reductions within the crop root zone ashley et al 1997 the time interval of irrigation water application affects the crop yields and operating costs timely application of water in required quantity throughout the agricultural field helps in deriving the maximum benefits from water managing and irrigation scheduling to schedule the irrigation for utilizing the water efficiently and to optimize the production of the crops it is important to check the soil moisture conditions of the crop root zone of at regular intervals several methods for irrigation scheduling are in practice and used for specific purpose with varying degrees of success the aim of irrigation scheduling is to ensure the optimum water supply and maintain the soil moisture close to field capacity jones 2004 present methods devices and equipment used for scheduling irrigation and precisely to determine the water availability in the soil and the irrigation requirement has become either obsolete or are not handy to be used by farmers the various methods adopted to schedule irrigation are water balance method soil water potential measurement using tensiometer soil water potential measurement using electrical resistance gypsum blocks plant moisture content measurement using turgor pressure sensor soil water content measurement employing neutron probe and soil water content measurement by using time domain reflectrometry the water balance method maintains a record of incoming and outgoing soil water and ensure that adequate water is available for the plant growth the method is tedious and difficult to determine the data of input and output in a certain region or cropland grabow et al 2008 a tensiometer measures the soil water tension and is receptive to soil water tensions of 0 100 centibars cbars practically the tensiometer operates in the range of 0 75 cbars for a particular type of soil tensiometer is calibrated to constitute a relationship between soil water tension and soil water content tensiometers are normally used in coarse textured soils or where the soil moisture is kept at higher levels such as drip or centre pivot irrigation systems moa 2015 further a tensiometer is not appropriate for fruit trees due to more negative soil water tensions than a tensiometer can read sharma 2019 for example 100 kpa soil water tension can be considered as dry condition for vegetable crops but that can still be considered as wet moisture condition for fruit tress an analog tensiometer generally cost around inr 6000 8000 and the price of digital tensiometer starts from inr 9000 the developed electronic wetting front detector cost around the inr 7000 however it should be noted that the developed device is a prototype and the development cost include trial and error wear and tear of components used during developing the device electrical resistance block measures the soil water potential and cannot be used at soil water potential at which most of the available water is held by soils as the resistance blocks do not directly show the soil water content deciding the depth of irrigation water application is difficult a neutron probe is the most advanced accurate and complex equipment that measures the moisture content in the soil this is non destructive and directly measure the moisture content without disturbing the soil the main disadvantage is to follow the safety rules for operation transportation and storing the probe the neutron probes are usually used by large organizations or consultants running a service for smaller operators due to high cost and the need for a licensed operator time domain reflectometry tdr measure soil water content indirectly and works on the principle of time taken to travel by a high frequency electromagnetic pulse through the soil this travel time is used to determine the dielectric constant permittivity of the material the permittivity of the soil is firmly related to the water content due to the exclusive properties of the water molecule topp 1987 the time domain reflectometry is beyond the range of equipment affordable by farmers apart from the existing instruments many research works have been carried out to ease the scheduling of irrigation cary and fisher 1983 developed an irrigation scheduling system with electronic and soil water sensors the device used electrical resistance to determine irrigation water application these devices were based on a microprocessor circuit with a programmable calculator to predict the time for the next irrigation and detect wetting front and indicate with a mechanical flag the mechanical flag may not work at night plant et al 1992 developed a program shell of experts called calex to promote decision making in crop management the methods employs irrigation scheduling based on leaf water capacity increasing degree days water budgeting process final irrigation based on the planned cutout date and last irrigation based on the optimum dates observed torres 1998 designed and tested a visual apparatus in the form of a plastic container to schedule irrigation of sugarcane the developed irrigation scheduling system was also patented by the us patent office this device use centre pivot and drip irrigation systems to automate water management upchurch and wanjura 1996 testezlaf et al 1997 developed an integrated system for managing greenhouse container plants using a device to control irrigation the development consisted of three distinctive steps selection of appropriate water application control hardware development of a convenient software interface that allows for simple control of system operation and testing of the control system s reliability george et al 2000 developed an irrigation scheduling model consisting of a database management system model base and graphical user interface to perform irrigation scheduling for single and multiple fields under various management options the model focused on a regular approach to water management and records climate crop and soil information as data stirzaker and hutchinson 2005 used a simple wetting front detector fullstop wetting front detector to check the accuracy of scheduling irrigation to turf by sprinkler which shut off the water automatically after the wetting front had approached a required depth in the soil the detector was a funnel shaped tube buried in the earth once a wetting front enters the detector it distorts the unsaturated flow lines such that the water content at the funnel base approaches saturation the free water generated was electronically detected and that gave the signal to stop irrigation fullstop wetting front detector is a mechanical device that detect the depth of the wetting front and when the wetting front occurs but the fullstop wetting front detector would not be able to measure the soil moisture content however the electronic wetting front detector can not only detect and alarm the farmer of the wetting front but can also measure the soil moisture content before and after the wetting front is detected munoz carpena et al 2008 developed an irrigation controller and used dielectric soil water probe the developed model was tested in the field conditions and compared with other traditional automated scheduling methods on tomato crop under drip irrigation system and plastic mulch in south florida ouda et al 2013 provided an evaluation of the use of gpr technology to compute soil water content they further suggested the gpr technique to be used in the study region of eastern province saudi arabia to measure agricultural field soil water content as a precise accurate and alternative approach to traditional measurement methods a new irrigation scheduling program was suggested based on the gpr methodology which was tested and revised to apply to the crops in the intended region several soil moisture sensors are gaining popularity in the suite of irrigation equipment with advancements in microcomputer and communication technology the telemetry system provides a continuous and real time data which is transmitted through portable communication devices to the irrigation manager with the development in design and electronic components sector smaller soil moisture sensors can be installed at multiple depths aguilar et al 2015 kore et al 2017 conducted a study to evaluate crop water requirements and developed irrigation scheduling for selected crops for the khadakwasla dam in pune district of maharashtra katsoulas et al 2017 developed a knowledge based framework for online precise irrigation scheduling opiris an algorithm was developed for irrigation scheduling using a web based application prabha et al 2019 developed a model to irrigate crops and reduce the cost of electricity labor and water they also established a system analyzing the symptoms shown on the leaves which can also recognize possible diseases in the plants therefore they sought to create a viable low cost implementable model using hc 05 modules building a wireless network the presently available methods and devices for scheduling irrigation have either become obsolete or limited to experimental laboratories and are seldom used by farmers to schedule irrigation especially in developing countries a device is required which should be handy and cost effective a real time telemetry sensors are available in markets however it would be difficult for a farmer to interpret the readings of the sensors to schedule irrigation ewfd developed interprets readings from the sensors and alarms the farmer of overirrigation or underirrigation based on the data received from the sensors the ewfd developed is new intervention since the device could be easily used by farmer to understand the soil water content and schedule irrigation with respect to crop needs by alarming the farming in the present study an electronic wetting front detector ewfd has been developed and tested which can easily determine the soil moisture content detect and alarm the need for irrigation if the soil moisture content in the root zone of the crop drops below or above a certain level the device was tested in the laboratory and the performance has been validated in the field conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 working principles and components the soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content by using the electrical resistance of the soil the electrical resistance in the soil increases with a decrease in the amount of water in the soil thus the relationship for the variation in the resistance between the two conducting plates of the soil moisture sensor due to the variation in the amount of moisture present in the soil is inverse in nature the proposed device consists of the components such as a soil moisture sensor controller board arduino uno circuit board 9 v battery and 20 mm led bulb the soil moisture sensor consists of a couple of conductive probes which is used to measure the volumetric content of water in the soil fig 1a the controller board consists of an lm393 ic voltage comparator connectors leds resistors etc to measure the soil moisture fig 1b the sensitivity of the module could be regulated with an aid of a potentiometer present in the controller board the controller board consists of four pins which are vcc voltage supply collector to collector gnd ground ao analog output and do digital output the voltage in the sensors and board is provided through vcc and gnd and depending on the analog output the wire is connected to ao and if the output is required in digital then it is connected to do the most important component of this device is arduino uno fig 1c arduino uno allows us to interpret the readings measured by the sensors and converts them into adc analog to digital converter output it is the microcomputer of the device which decides whether the soil moisture is sufficient in the soil or it is below the required level for the crops and thus indicates the low moisture content by turning the light emitting diode led bulb on which is connected with the circuit through jumper wires power to the circuit is provided through a 9 v battery or data cable connected to computers or through dc adapters arduino uno works on the programing command which is installed in the circuit through data cable from arduino uno s software arduino ide the programming language on which it works is similar to the c c programing language the programming code was uploaded in the arduino uno through a data cable from the arduino sketchbook software known as arduino ide from pc laptop and after completion of all the circuits and connections the device is ready to use the present moisture content of the soil in which the device is placed can be read through the serial monitor of arduino ide from a pc laptop however the moisture content which is displayed in the serial monitor is in adc analog to digital converter value form and not in percentage adc values are analog to digital converter values which is the output from the arduino uno interpreted from soil moisture sensors theoretically adc values range from 0 to 1023 is range with 0 means gravimetric soil moisture content is 100 and 1023 means gravimetric soil moisture content is 0 theoretically the adc value can be changed to soil volumetric moisture percentage through the following formula analog output adc value 1023 moisture in percentage 100 analog output 100 for zero moisture we get a maximum value of 10 bit adc as 1023 which gives a value of 0 moisture although this is not the actual volumetric water content percentage for any type of soil and hence the device needs to be calibrated before use in the field the conductivity in the soil moisture probe varies with the water content in the soil if the amount of water in the soil is high then the conductivity through the probe is also high and consequently the input to the comparator will be high this means that the output of the comparator is high therefore the led will be on fig 2 similarly when there is the moisture content is within the range as defined by the user and the conductivity of the soil moisture probe decreases and the output of the comparator becomes low the led then switches off this led on and off operation could be set so that led could be switched on if the soil moisture content falls outside the user defined range and switches off when soil moisture is within user defined range the board between the arduino and the probe is a controller which helps calibrate the sensor s sensing capabilities the basic principle on which electronic wetting front detector works is that soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content using electrical resistance of the soil to calculate the soil moisture content the electrical resistance in the soil nonetheless increases with decrease in the amount of water in the soil these electrical signals are received by arduino uno the board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input output pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards shields and other circuits the board has 14 digital input output pins six capable of pwm output 6 analog input output pins and is programmable with the arduino ide integrated development environment via a type b usb cable the arduino uno interprets the readings from the soil moisture sensors and gives output in adc analog to digital convertor values as defined by the user in case of ewfd the arduino uno is programmed to detect the signals from soil moisture sensors and warn the user that the soil moisture is above or below the desired level of soil moisture although the ewfd soil moisture sensors work on the same principle as electrical resistance gypsum blocks however the ewfd output and application is different as it would be used as a irrigation scheduling device rather than only measuring soil moisture sensor in case of ewfd soil moisture sensors measures the volumetric water content using electrical resistance of the soil to calculate the soil moisture content the electrical resistance in the soil nonetheless increases with decrease in the amount of water in the soil which helps to measure the soil moisture content at the root zone depth the soil moisture sensors probe has a shape of fork so that it can measure the electrical resistance between two tines of the fork shaped soil moisture probe 2 2 installation laboratory and field testing the device is very simple to install and use firstly the root zone depth of the crop is ascertained and then the percentage of moisture required by the crop is determined this information can be obtained from agricultural universities located in the area secondly the preprogrammed device is buried with the sensors at the root zone depth of the crop thirdly the calibrated device is turned on and if the led indicator lights up that means soil does not have enough moisture for the crop and thus it needs irrigation similarly during the process of irrigation if the led turns on again that means the moisture content has increased beyond the limit defined by the user and the user is overirrigating the field the front view of ewfd is shown in fig 3 the purpose of the testing was to measure the accuracy of the device the device was tested in the geotechnical laboratory at central university of jharkhand ranchi india where the setup was placed for testing the device fig 4 the setup consists of a box of dimensions 43 43 60 cm the box was filled up with soil collected from the campus premise to a height of 40 cm the grain size distribution of the soil was determined and the corresponding coefficient of uniformity cu and coefficient of curvature cc were estimated the device was placed at a 30 cm depth of soil from the top of the box now a calibrated tensiometer was inserted in the box to a depth of 30 cm the sample of soil was taken from the 30 cm depth from the box with the help of a long core cutter for measuring gravimetric soil water content the sample soil was weighed and then kept in the laboratory oven for 24 h at 110 c the sample was taken out after 24 h and then weighed again and noted the reading from the tensiometer was noted after 24 h from its placement in the soil to get a stable reading simultaneously the device was connected to a laptop via data cable and turned on and adc value soil moisture content was displayed through the serial monitor of arduino ide on the laptop readings from the tensiometer and electronic wetting front detector were noted then about 6 cm depth of water i e 11 094 litres applied to the soil in the box gradually at a set of 1 litre further the setup was left for 24 h so that the water could infiltrate till 40 cm depth and distribute evenly at that depth continuous reading was noted from the tensiometer and the electronic wetting front detector and the gravimetric soil water content was measured of the sample from 30 cm depth of soil for 27 days at an interval of 2 3 days the soil water content of the soil sample was measured from the well known following formula 1 moisture content initial weight oven dried weight oven dried weight 100 the moisture content recorded from the electronic wetting front detector was compared with the gravimetric soil moisture content and soil water potential from tensiometer measured at that particular time and consequently regression analysis was performed from the collected data which helped in determining the accuracy of the device the accuracy of the device was estimated by comparing it with the real time field data and the predicted data of the device the device was finally set by feeding the lower and upper limit of the soil moisture percentage in the program code required for a particular crop such as in the case of wheat crops the volumetric soil moisture content should be around 60 therefore the device was calibrated in such a way that the lower level of moisture to raise an indication should be 60 and the upper limit should be around 80 depending on the required settings for a particular type of soil and crop in the field the electronic wetting front detector was tested and validated for the data collected from the laboratory in the farmers field the device was tested for proper working and operation in the farmers field fig 5 the testing of the device was conducted in the farmers field located at the cheri near central university of jharkhand ranchi jharkhand further the device was tested in the farmer s field where similar procedures were carried out for the okra crop and the soil type was clayey sand the optimal gravimetric moisture content of soil for the okra plant was determined as 40 2 3 data analysis a simple linear regression analysis was carried out by using the data collected from the ewfd tensiometer and gravimetric soil water content of the soil sample in the laboratory the tensiometers measure the soil water tension in kpa bar and gravimetric water content is calculated in percentage ewfd measures soil moisture content in adc values though these devices and methods do not measure same parameter however there is a clear correlation between then a correlation needs to be established between soil water tension measured by tensiometer gravimetric soil water content and ewfd readings by carrying out a simple linear regression analysis since as established when soil moisture tension increases gravimetric water content percentage decreases and ewfd s adc value increases the coefficient of determination r 2 was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of regression which helps to determine how well a model fits the measured values the coefficient of determination is based on the sum of squares in which the total sum of squares is subdivided into the sum of squares and the sum of residual squares the coefficient of determination r 2 is determined by the following relationship 2 r 2 explained variation total variation regression sum of square ssr total sum of square sst where the regression sum of square is y ˆ y 2 the total sum of the square is y y 2 y ˆ isthe estimated dependent variable y isthe mean of the dependent variable y is the original dependent variable the r 2 often called the variation proportion and is explained by the regressor x it varies from 0 to 1 0 r 2 1 and values of r 2 close to 1 imply that most of the variability in y is elucidated by the regression model that means variation in the dependent variable will cause an immediate variation in the independent variable the adjusted r 2 value is adjusted according to the number of variables included in the regression equation this is used to determine the expected shrinkage in r 2 that might not generalize to the population as our solution is over fitted to the data set by inculcating several more independent variables if the adjusted r 2 value is much lesser than the r 2 value it is an indication that our regression equation may be over fitted to the sample and of limited generalization ability in regression analysis the most widely accepted p value which is used to indicate a good significance level is 95 the significance level for a given hypothesis test is a p value for which a value calculated value less than or equal to alpha is considered statistically significant typical α value levels are 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 pearson correlation coefficient indicates the extent to which dots in scatter plots lie in a straight line a correlation of 1 indicates that the two variables are perfectly negatively related a 0 value of correlation indicates that the two variables do not have any linear relation but non linear relation may exist a correlation of 1 indicates that the two variables a perfectly positively related the p p plot is a comparison of the observed cumulative distribution function cdf of the standardized residual to the expected cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution the p p plot has been plotted and it illustrates a comparison between the cdf of the observed and the predicted values of the dependent variable if the greatest number of points falls along the 45º straight line then the plot is best fitted and the relationship between the estimated and observed variable is good 3 results and discussions 3 1 grain size distribution analysis the grain size distribution of soil samples was carried out an oven dried soil sample of about 1 kg was taken and grinded thoroughly the grinded sample was sieved with different sizes of standard sieves arranged in decreasing order and sieved through a mechanical sieve shaker the result obtained from the grain size distribution of the soil sample is shown in fig 6 indian standard soil classification system is given in table 1 the gravel sand silt and clay are represented by group symbols g s m and c respectively since 71 695 passes through a 4 75 mm sieve and is retained in a 0 075 mm sieve therefore the soil is classified as sandy soil since it is greater than 50 the coefficient of uniformity cu and coefficient of curvature cc of the soil was determined as given below coefficient of uniformity cu d 60 d 10 13 33 coefficient of curvature cc d 30 2 d 60 d 10 0 83 d 10 d 60 and d 30 were determined from the graph shown in fig 6 from the above data it is deduced that the soil is a well graded sandy soil particle size analysis was carried out to determine the soil type for which the device was calibrated and tested with respect to gravimetric water content of the soil and soil water tension although the soil type change would also have an effect on ewfd reading and therefore ewfd needs to be calibrated for each type of soil in which the crops are grown and irrigation scheduling is required 3 2 calibration of ewfd under laboratory set up the ewfd was inserted in the sample box at a depth of 30 cm for calibration of the device along with the tensiometer the readings of soil moisture content of the soil from the tensiometer and ewfd were recorded at the regular interval of 24 h the observations are presented in table 2 soil water content and tensiometer reading kpa were taken as predictors and ewfd reading adc values was considered as the dependent variable in table 3 soil water content and tensiometer reading kpa were taken as predictors constant and ewfd reading adc values was considered as dependent variable the r2 from the regression analysis was found to be 0 967 the model was found to be significant because p value was lesser than 0 05 it can be seen that the significance value is 0 000 this means that there is 100 of chance that the model and the data to be true the coefficient table was obtained from spss multiple regression analysis which defines the relationship between variables such as ewfd reading tensiometer reading and soil moisture reading along with their standard deviation and significance the unstandardized coefficient b contains a constant value multiples of tensiometer reading and soil moisture reading in order to relate with ewfd value the standard error is the extent to which the constant and the multiple variables are accurate standard coefficient measures the strength of each independent variable to the dependent variable irrespective of the positive or negative sign a simple linear regression analysis resulted in the coefficient table tables 4 and 5 which is required to establish correlation between ewfd reading gravimetric soil moisture content and tensiometer reading resulting in eqs 3 and 4 from the coefficient table 4 an equation can be formed as 3 y 2 597 x 2 697 z 556 442 u where y ewfd reading adc value x tensiometer reading kpa z soil water content in percentage u error in estimate from the coefficient table 5 an equation can be formed as 4 y 700 922 7 454 z u where y ewfd reading adc value z soil water content in percentage u error in estimate eq 3 defines the correlation between soil water tension recorded by tensiometer gravimetric soil water content and ewfd readings adc values however eq 4 defines direct correlation between gravimetric water content in percentage with respect to ewfd reading the eq 4 is important since gravimetric water content calculation is independent of any device reading and is the actual water content in the soil sample the above two equations were used to predict and validate the data collected from the field test from table 6 obtained from spss multiple regression analysis it is observed that ewfd reading is positively 0 960 times related to tensiometer reading and 0 805 times negatively related to soil water content i e ewfd reading increases then soil water content decreases the significance of the soil water content and the ewfd reading is 0 002 which means that there is a 99 8 chance of their relation and data to be true also the significance of the tensiometer reading and ewfd reading is 0 000 which implies that there is a 100 chance of their relation and data to be true normal p p plot demonstrates the two functions of cumulative distribution i e observed cumulative probability and expected cumulative probability against each other which help to access how closely two sets of data agree in fig 7 it is seen that points are along the diagonal line thus it is established that the residual values have a normal distribution it is clear from table 7 of casewise diagnostics of the ewfd reading that the difference between the observed and the predicted ewfd reading adc values is not more than 20 from the regression model and the maximum chances of error are 8 hence the model is significant in table 7 case numbers are serial numbers since spss statistics software considered each ewfd reading as a case and established a comparison based on predicted ewfd readings calculated from correlation eqs 3 and 4 and the ewfd reading recorded from field this signifies that the predicted values do not differ much from the observed values hence this model can be validated by comparing the data collected from the field test with the data estimated from this model and thus determining the accuracy of the ewfd device 3 3 validation of ewfd in field condition the ewfd along with the tensiometer was installed in the okra field for proper testing and validation of the device the soil moisture content of the soil from the tensiometer and ewfd were recorded at an interval of about 5 days ewfd contains two soil moisture sensor and same was deployed in field in an optimum location so that it can monitor change in soil moisture content experienced by okra plants the okra plants grows in sandy loamy soil and since the soil sample for which the grain size distribution analysis was carried out was taken from a location not farther away from the field therefore it was assumed that soil type in the field was a sandy soil as per grain size distribution analysis as mentioned however more field trials are needed the ewfd was tested and calibrated in both laboratory and field in sandy soil as mentioned from the grain size distribution analysis of the soil and it should be noted that soil parameters changes with the soil type such as water and air holding capacity of the soil therefore the device needs to be calibrated for use for different soil type the analysis and validation of the data provided in table 8 were checked for accuracy and proper working by placing these sets of data in the calibrated eq 3 for this validation the estimated value of ewfd reading tensiometer in kpa and gravimetric soil water content was determined by using the eq 3 this was further compared with the observed value from the device in the field and checked for the percentage of error in estimated and observed values are presented in table 9 furthermore the data sets acquired from the field were analyzed by using eq 4 and compared with the observed value from the device in the field and again checked for the percentage of error in estimated and observed value from this equation are shown in table 10 from tables 9 and 10 this was observed that the ewfd value predicted from the eq 3 table 9 has a much greater difference from the ewfd value observed from the field therefore it has a larger percentage of error due to that difference moreover we can observe that the ewfd value predicted from the eq 4 has a much lower difference than that of the observed ewfd value from the field therefore it has a much lower percentage of error the observed ewfd value collected from the field had a much higher difference than the predicted ewfd value calculated from eq 3 where tensiometer reading from the field was also one of the variables along with soil moisture reading from the field however the observed ewfd value collected from the field had a very low difference was much similar value to the predicted ewfd value calculated from eq 4 where only soil moisture reading was variable therefore it is inferred that the predicted ewfd value is not much accurate when tensiometer reading was used as a variable furthermore it also means that tensiometer reading is not much reliable for determining soil moisture as the tensiometer reading deviates from soil moisture reading from field and ewfd is much more reliable for determining soil moisture on further investigation and comparing the two equations the data sets collected from the field and the estimated and observed value of ewfd from tables 9 and 10 it can be deduced that there was an error in the tensiometer reading recorded from the field the error in readings of tensiometer in the field may have arisen due to three main reasons such as i poor contact between the ceramic tip and the soil ii the tensiometer has a lower range of measurements from 0 kpa to 100 kpa of soil water potential thus it couldn t measure negative pressure iii the device is not being properly calibrated and filled with field solution without removal of air bubble it should be noted that ewfd is calibrated to be used for irrigation scheduling for vegetable plants and rabi crops cereal crops in india which generally requires soil water tension of 0 1 0 6 bars 10 60 kpa and soil water tension any greater or less than the above range would cause over or under irrigation hence from the above deduction it is clear that both the device and the equations derived would help to schedule irrigation almost perfectly from table 10 as it does not contain error due to tensiometer reading the accuracy of the device comes out as 99 by looking into the maximum percentage of error in table 9 and worst possible case it can be assumed to be 95 90 several advantages of this device are it easily determines the soil moisture content in the root zone of the crop and detects whether to indicate or not for the irrigation process the upper limit and lower limit of soil moisture content to indicate can easily be changed depending on the type of soil and crop present one can conveniently access the soil moisture content in the root zone of the soil by connecting the device with a computer system through a usb one can easily understand the need for irrigation and start the irrigation process as this device detects soil moisture and immediately indicate it through its led bulb indicator this device doesn t require much maintenance as the sensor can last more than one year and also the cost of this device is very low therefore it is farmer friendly it can be used as many in the field as it increases the accuracy through installing the device in the field in a distributed manner which can help to determine the part of the field which needs to be irrigated the device could be used to detect wetting front by installing two ewfd at two separate depths of the soil at a certain distance 1 2 m apart this setup will not only detect the depth of wetting front but will also measure the soil moisture content 4 conclusions this study was an attempt to develop calibrate and validate a new irrigation scheduling device that will not only replace obsolete irrigation scheduling methods and devices but also help the growers and farmers to control crop water consumption effectively this new device will only work in a fully efficient manner if it is configured properly and calibrated with the particular type of crop for which it is to be used the electronic wetting front detector provides a better alternative than the hit and trial methods used by irrigators or growers at a very affordable price furthermore in this study a relation was also established between the gravimetric soil water content soil water potential and electronic wetting front detector adc values with almost 96 of accuracy also a statistical analysis of the device calibration readings with gravimetric soil moisture content and soil water potential readings was carried out which confirmed the relevancy of the device in the laboratory test the proposed electronic wetting front detector can schedule irrigation almost perfectly with maximum chances of error would be around 1 the electronic wetting front detector could be used as a scientific instrument that can measure soil moisture content with almost 99 accuracy greater than the tensiometer which requires maintenance and servicing while in use and also tensiometer has a range of 100 kpa to 0 kpa i e it cannot measure negative pressure generated for different soil type due to the lower range of measurement whereas ewfd doesn t require any field servicing as long as it is installed in the field and it has a larger range of measurement as it measures in adc values from 0 to 1000 tending to increased sensitivity in fluctuations of soil water content these several features make ewfd more versatile than the tensiometer and other expensive devices available to be used as a scientific instrument for measuring soil moisture content and also to schedule irrigation further planning to develop and increase the versatility of the ewfd is in the process by increasing the sensitivity to measure the soil water content through more advanced sensors such as capacitive soil moisture sensors declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

flowering floweringdas and to maturity maturitydas the prior distribution of the parameters i e constraints on parameter values table 3 was assigned based on the recommendation by habekotté 1997 and followed a uniform distribution to avoid the effect of irrigation methods we used different irrigation efficiencies in simulations based on irrigation methods according to literature when calibrating the model we set irrigation efficiencies as 0 75 for simulation with sprinkling irrigation brouwer et al 1989 in 2014 and 0 90 for simulation with furrow irrigation rajan et al 2015 in 2015 respectively 2 4 scenario analysis to estimate the contribution of dt hybrid to yield increase we simulated yields of two hybrids under the same management practices in the model table 4 we simulated the yield of two hybrids with water fully satisfied the irrigation module in apsim was set to automatic irrigation first and then we set up irrigation schedules for the operations schedule module of model based on the irrigation dates and amounts under automatic irrigation conditions fig 2 maize yield under each irrigation treatment was simulated by decreasing the irrigation amount from 100 to 50 step by 5 based on evapotranspiration requirement the maize plants will experience more drought stress as irrigation level is decreased in this irrigated region noting that for these two hybrids the irrigated amounts and dates for meeting the full water satisfaction were different under automatic irrigation this has resulted in different irrigation schedules for two hybrids in the next simulations 2 5 data analysis for comparing the different growing responses of conventional hybrid and dt hybrid to water regimes and analyzing the water consumption difference in regional production under drought stress we calculated the crop water productivity wpc which indicates the total above ground biomass accumulating of per unit water consumption along the whole growing season and irrigation water productivity wpi which reflects the total above ground biomass accumulating of per unit irrigation water consumption wpc and wpi were computed using eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 wp c

conventional and dt hybrids from two aspects as shown in fig 2 1 under the same irrigation levels how much yield could be increased 2 at the same yield target how much irrigation water could be saved

used the same parameters in these two hybrids in the simulation of maize development fig 3a we evaluated model performance in two ways whether the simulations captured yield differences for different water regimes for each hybrid and whether the simulations captured yield differences between two hybrids under the same water regime we found that the model could reflect yield differences between i50 and i100 for both hybrids fig 3b left and middle at i50 less yield loss by dt hybrid compared with the conventional hybrid could be well captured in the model fig 3b the right we thus concluded that the model could be used to simulate the growth and development of these two maize hybrids under various irrigation treatments 3 2 simulated yield crop water productivity wpc irrigation water

fig 5 yield wpc and wpi of the dt hybrid were significantly higher than that of the conventional hybrid in the same irrigation treatment p 0 01 by anova increasing irrigation from 50 to 100 full irrigation gradually improved yield of conventional and dt hybrid from 2519 to 7111 kg ha 1 and from 4039 to 8287 kg ha 1 respectively fig 5a for the conventional hybrid wpc was improved with increasing irrigation fig 5b while for the dt hybrid wpc under 85 full irrigation was greater than others this indicates that dt hybrids may have more potential in water saving due to higher wpc under lower irrigation than conventional hybrid wpi decreased with the increasing of irrigation treatments for two hybrids fig 5c from 50 to 100 full irrigation the difference between wpi for the two hybrids narrowed suggesting that the dt hybrid had greater wpi improving space than that of conventional hybrid especially in low irrigation treatments 3 3 differences in yield increase and water savings between hybrids dt hybrids consistently had greater yields than the conventional hybrid in all water limited conditions particularly under low irrigation levels fig 6 when irrigation water was restrained to 90 80 70 60 and 50 of the irrigation under bs yds of the conventional hybrid were 11 24 38 51 and 64 while yds of dt hybrid was 7 1 12 27 and 43 respectively fig 7a dt hybrid yielded more than bs yd was 7 under i90 which is a slightly limited irrigation condition for the conventional hybrid for all irrigation levels dt hybrid yield loss was 18 25 less than that of conventional hybrid in thp differences of yd z between the two hybrids were higher in northwestern counties than that in southeastern counties when yield targets were set to 90 80 70 and 60 of the bs yield wss of the conventional hybrid were 10 18 26 and 33 respectively and wss of dt hybrid were 27 33 40 and 47 respectively fig 7b for the same target yield the dt hybrid saved more water under irrigation and differences in wsq between hybrids decreased with decreasing target yield in thp differences in wsq between two hybrids were higher in northwestern counties compared with southeastern counties demonstrating that the northwest thp should be prioritized for further extricating yield advantages of dt hybrids 3 4 contribution of dt hybrids to the total production increase and irrigation water saving across the texas high plains in the texas high plain irrigated maize was sown across an area of 211933 34 km2 averaged from 1981 to 2017 fig 8a we calculated the contribution of dt hybrid to total production increase fig 8b and water saving in irrigation fig 8c regionally based on irrigated areas of all counties in thp under limited irrigation conditions of i90 i80 i70 i60 i50 contributions of dt hybrid to total production improvement cdth tpi were 19 24 26 26 and 21 respectively for target yields of y90 y80 y70 y60 contributions of dt hybrid to total irrigation water saving cdth tws were 17 16 15 and 15 respectively 4 discussion in this study we quantified the regional contribution of a dt hybrid to yield improvement and water saving compared with a conventional hybrid based on the data from the field experiment of dt hybrid p1151am and conventional hybrids 33d53am in the thp we modified the apsim model to simulate maize yields in different irrigation treatments we next analyzed the different yield and irrigation responses of two hybrids to limited irrigation conditions and different yield targets and calculated the contribution of dt hybrid to total production increase and water saving in irrigation in this region the limits of process based crop simulation models csms can be seen in particular when crops are exposed to extreme weather events and or to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses which are characteristics of low input agricultural systems exposed to climate change muller and martre 2019 in our study the use of a simulation framework model that could capture drought influence was very important we conducted this partly by management control and partly by parameterization model parameter estimation problem is raised as an optimization problem and optimization algorithms could be used to solve it zúñiga et al 2014 various automated parameterisation approaches with apsim have been tested harrison et al 2019 differential evolution de algorithms can improve the efficiency and accuracy in modifying the dynamic crop model and have been applied in parameter optimization before zúñiga et al 2014 jiang et al 2018 li et al 2021b martínez et al 2021 for our calibration and validation of the crop model we combined deoptim and cross validation in r software to optimize parameters permitting subsequent use of apsim these ensured that the apsim could simulate growth and development of these two hybrids as accurate as possible moreover the water uptake parameters were contained in our modification of the model which made further sure that the model could reflect differences between the two hybrids in response to drought stress thus in our study the apsim model could capture the yield gap not only between the high and low irrigation conditions for each hybrid but also between two hybrids in low irrigation conditions these conclusions were by earlier studies of a variety of applications of the apsim model in simulating agricultural drought and the production of the crop in this environment jin et al 2016 jin et al 2017 li et al 2021a in semiarid areas increasing irrigation is generally perceived as a management option for improving the yield and stability of maize production however indiscriminately increasing the irrigation was not an appropriate practice to realize the advantage of dt hybrids in yield improvement under drought stress differences in yield decrease caused by limited irrigation between these two hybrids reached the maximum 25 when irrigation was controlled to 70 of bs this indicated that compared with the production of conventional hybrid under fully irrigated conditions applying only 70 of irrigated water would result in the greatest yield increase advantage of dt hybrid and reduce water consumption this result supports the conclusion from a field study which suggested that limited irrigation can save water and maintain maize yield in the thp zhao et al 2019 from our study we recommend the limited irrigation level i70 70 irrigation of bs as the best management practice that would realize the greatest contribution of the dt hybrid 26 to total production improvement under the lowest water consumption we also showed that dt hybrids performed better than conventional hybrids under more severe drought conditions fig 6 this simulation result is consistent with the previous experiment based study conclusions hao et al 2015a hao et al 2015b in general dt hybrids had higher water use efficiency which resulted from either greater shoot dry weight or lower reduction in dry weight reduction compared with the conventional hybrid under water stress zhao et al 2018b our simulation results show that if there was no irrigation limitation dt hybrids need more water input compared with conventional hybrids fig 4 this may be a key factor driving the invariance of wpc under high irrigation treatments fig 5b potentially limiting the advantage of dt hybrid in high water regimes some studies have shown that dt hybrids might contribute to reducing the yield loss caused by heat stress chukwudi et al 2021 selecting for dt hybrids may increase the output of maize to the greatest extent in the limited irrigation input for arid and semi arid regions all of which are warming under climate change we conducted our experiment in different locations in 2014 and 2015 the difference between two locations in soil and climate may have contributed to the difference between two hybrids in yield formation but this environmental difference was not directly considered in our parameterization of the model in actual maize production field management practices such as irrigation method and fertilization rates play an important role in fully exerting the yield advantage of dt hybrids these need to be determined based on more detailed experiment data to quantify the contribution of dt hybrids in yield increase and water saving more accurately in future research in different climate years wet or dry the resource input of water precipitation and irrigation to meet the physiological need of maize growth and development is different it may cause different yield responses for two hybrids and need more research combining field and climate control experiment in the future 5 conclusions under the same watering regime dt hybrids increase maize yield and water productivity especially at low irrigation levels this caused more yield improvement and water saving potential for dt hybrid the dt hybrids had greater yield under the same irrigation amount and saving water with the same target yield when irrigation was constrained to 90 80 70 60 and 50 of the irrigation required for the baseline scenario bs dt hybrid decreased total maize production loss caused by drought stress by 19 24 26 26 and 21 compared with the conventional hybrid which means the contribution of dt hybrid to total production improvement under different irrigation levels with drought stress above was 19 26 when the target yield was set to 90 80 70 and 60 of bs water applied could be reduced by 17 16 15 and 15 which means the contribution of the dt hybrid to total irrigation water saving in these four yield targets were 15 17 if the conventional hybrid was changed to dt hybrid in production funding this work was supported by the ministry of

9272,drought is an enduring abiotic constraint to stable and consistent maize productivity under climate change especially for low rainfall regions with limited irrigation one adaptation for severe drought is using drought tolerant dt hybrids here we characterize differences between conventional and dt hybrids in terms of yield and water use efficiency under drought conditions at a regional scale of the texas high plains thp using a validated version of apsim maize we simulated yields of conventional and dt hybrids across 11 water regimes and 25 counties in thp from 1984 to 2018 when irrigation amounts were constrained to 90 80 70 60 and 50 of total irrigation used for the baseline scenario bs a simulated scenario of conventional hybrid under full irrigation dt hybrids showed lower yield penalties under drought stress relative to conventional hybrids this improved total production by 19 24 26 26 and 21 for each of the above irrigation levels when the yield target was set as 90 80 70 and 60 of bs total regional irrigation applied to dt hybrid could be saved more than that to the conventional hybrid and therefore reduced more 17 16 15 and 15 of bs irrigation respectively we showed that dt hybrids had greater yield gain and water savings through improved water productivity under deficit irrigation highlighting the potential of deficit irrigation for increasing yield for the adoption of dt hybrid our quantitative evaluation of the yield advantage and water saving potential associated with dt hybrids also highlighted the regional benefits

and validation the apsim model http www apsim info apsim is a cropping systems software platform capable of simulating a range of crops grown under various climatic edaphic and management conditions gaydon et al 2017 holzworth et al 2014 apsim has been proven as an effective research and decision tool worldwide including in the midwestern us archontoulis et al 2014 field observations in 2014 and 2015 for the two hybrids including phenology aboveground biomass yield and management practices were used for the apsim maize calibration and validation based on the method of cross validation refaeilzadeh et al 2009 crop parameters calibrated for each hybrid in apsim maize are listed in table 1 the soil properties used as initial soil parameters in apsim maize were listed in table 2 the depth of the soil profile used in apsim maize is 150 cm to evaluate the performance of the calibrated apsim maize model statistical indices of the correlation coefficient r2 root mean square error

flowering floweringdas and to maturity maturitydas the prior distribution of the parameters i e constraints on parameter values table 3 was assigned based on the recommendation by habekotté 1997 and followed a uniform distribution to avoid the effect of irrigation methods we used different irrigation efficiencies in simulations based on irrigation methods according to literature when calibrating the model we set irrigation efficiencies as 0 75 for simulation with sprinkling irrigation brouwer et al 1989 in 2014 and 0 90 for simulation with furrow irrigation rajan et al 2015 in 2015 respectively 2 4 scenario analysis to estimate the contribution of dt hybrid to yield increase we simulated yields of two hybrids under the same management practices in the model table 4 we simulated the yield of two hybrids with water fully satisfied the irrigation module in apsim was set to automatic irrigation first and then we set up irrigation schedules for the operations schedule module of model based on the irrigation dates and amounts under automatic irrigation conditions fig 2 maize yield under each irrigation treatment was simulated by decreasing the irrigation amount from 100 to 50 step by 5 based on evapotranspiration requirement the maize plants will experience more drought stress as irrigation level is decreased in this irrigated region noting that for these two hybrids the irrigated amounts and dates for meeting the full water satisfaction were different under automatic irrigation this has resulted in different irrigation schedules for two hybrids in the next simulations 2 5 data analysis for comparing the different growing responses of conventional hybrid and dt hybrid to water regimes and analyzing the water consumption difference in regional production under drought stress we calculated the crop water productivity wpc which indicates the total above ground biomass accumulating of per unit water consumption along the whole growing season and irrigation water productivity wpi which reflects the total above ground biomass accumulating of per unit irrigation water consumption wpc and wpi were computed using eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 wp c

conventional and dt hybrids from two aspects as shown in fig 2 1 under the same irrigation levels how much yield could be increased 2 at the same yield target how much irrigation water could be saved we defined the simulation scenario of 33d53am with full irrigation as the baseline scenario bs yield decrease yd across five irrigation levels with irrigated water reaching 90 i90 80 i80 70 i70 60 i60

used the same parameters in these two hybrids in the simulation of maize development fig 3a we evaluated model performance in two ways whether the simulations captured yield differences for different water regimes for each hybrid and whether the simulations captured yield differences between two hybrids under the same water regime we found that the model could reflect yield differences between i50 and i100 for both hybrids fig 3b left and middle at i50 less yield loss by dt hybrid compared with the conventional hybrid could be well captured in the model fig 3b the right we thus concluded that the model could be used to simulate the growth and development of these two maize hybrids under various irrigation treatments 3 2 simulated yield crop water productivity wpc irrigation water productivity wpi in our simulation of irrigation treatments from i50 to i100 full irrigation total water irrigation plus precipitation during the simulated growing seasons applied for maize production was 392 410 428 445 463 498 516 533 551 and 569 mm for conventional hybrid and was 432 449 466 484 501 518 535 551 568 584 and 599 mm for dt hybrid respectively fig 4 for the conventional and dt hybrid from low irrigation to full irrigation the irrigation water amounts ranged from 136 to 282 mm and 143 and 291 mm respectively yield wpc and wpi in different irrigation treatments were shown in fig 5 yield wpc and wpi of the dt hybrid were significantly higher than that of the conventional hybrid in the same irrigation treatment p 0 01 by anova increasing irrigation from 50 to 100 full irrigation gradually improved yield of conventional and dt hybrid from 2519 to 7111 kg ha 1 and from 4039 to 8287 kg ha 1 respectively fig 5a for the conventional hybrid wpc was improved with increasing irrigation fig 5b while for the dt hybrid wpc under 85 full irrigation was greater than others this indicates that dt hybrids may have more potential in water saving due to higher wpc under lower irrigation than conventional hybrid wpi decreased with the increasing of irrigation treatments for two hybrids fig 5c from 50 to 100 full irrigation the difference between wpi for the two hybrids narrowed suggesting that the dt hybrid had greater wpi improving space than that of conventional hybrid especially in low irrigation treatments 3 3 differences in yield increase and water savings between hybrids dt hybrids consistently had greater yields than the conventional hybrid in all water limited conditions particularly under low irrigation levels fig 6 when irrigation water was restrained to 90 80 70 60 and 50 of the irrigation under bs yds of the conventional hybrid were 11 24 38 51 and 64 while yds of dt hybrid was 7 1 12 27 and 43 respectively fig 7a dt hybrid yielded more than bs yd was 7 under i90 which is a slightly limited irrigation condition for the conventional hybrid for all irrigation levels dt hybrid yield loss was 18 25 less than that of conventional hybrid in thp differences of yd z between the two hybrids were higher in northwestern counties than that in southeastern counties when yield targets were set to 90 80 70 and 60 of the bs yield wss of the conventional hybrid were 10 18 26 and 33 respectively and wss of dt hybrid were 27 33 40 and 47 respectively fig 7b for the same target yield the dt hybrid saved more water under irrigation and differences in wsq between hybrids decreased with decreasing target yield in thp differences in wsq between two hybrids were higher in northwestern counties compared with southeastern counties demonstrating that the northwest thp should be prioritized for further extricating yield advantages of dt hybrids 3 4 contribution of dt hybrids to the total production increase and irrigation water saving across the texas high plains in the texas high plain irrigated maize was sown across an area of 211933 34 km2 averaged from 1981 to 2017 fig 8a we calculated the contribution of dt hybrid to total production increase fig 8b and water saving in irrigation fig 8c regionally based on irrigated areas of all counties in thp under limited irrigation conditions of i90 i80 i70 i60 i50 contributions of dt hybrid to total production improvement cdth tpi were 19 24 26 26 and 21 respectively for target yields of y90 y80 y70 y60 contributions of dt hybrid to total irrigation water saving cdth tws were 17 16 15 and 15 respectively 4 discussion in this study we quantified the regional contribution of a dt hybrid to yield improvement and water saving compared with a conventional hybrid based on the data from the field experiment of dt hybrid p1151am and conventional hybrids 33d53am in the thp we modified the apsim model to simulate maize yields in different irrigation treatments we next analyzed the different yield and irrigation responses of two hybrids to limited irrigation conditions and different yield targets and calculated the contribution of dt hybrid to total production increase and water saving in irrigation in this region the limits of process based crop simulation models csms can be seen in particular when crops are exposed to extreme weather events and or to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses which are characteristics of low input agricultural systems exposed to climate change muller and martre 2019 in our study the use of a simulation

and low irrigation conditions for each hybrid but also between two hybrids in low irrigation conditions these conclusions were by earlier studies of a variety of applications of the apsim model in simulating agricultural drought and the production of the crop in this environment jin et al 2016 jin et al 2017 li et al 2021a in semiarid areas increasing irrigation is generally perceived as a management option for improving the yield and stability of maize production however indiscriminately increasing the irrigation was not an appropriate practice to realize the advantage of dt hybrids in yield improvement under drought stress differences in yield decrease caused by limited irrigation between these two hybrids reached the maximum 25 when irrigation was controlled to 70 of bs this indicated that compared with the production of conventional hybrid under fully irrigated conditions applying only 70 of irrigated water would result in the greatest yield increase advantage of dt hybrid and reduce water consumption this result supports the conclusion from a field study which suggested that limited irrigation can save water and maintain maize yield in the thp zhao et al 2019 from our study we recommend the limited irrigation level i70 70 irrigation of bs as the best management practice that would realize the greatest contribution of the dt hybrid 26 to total production improvement under the lowest water consumption we also showed that dt hybrids performed better than conventional hybrids under more severe drought conditions fig 6 this simulation result is consistent with the previous experiment based study conclusions hao et al 2015a hao et al 2015b in general dt hybrids had higher water use efficiency which resulted from either greater shoot dry weight or lower reduction in dry weight reduction compared with the conventional hybrid under water stress zhao et al 2018b our simulation results show that if there was no irrigation limitation dt hybrids need more water input compared with conventional hybrids fig 4 this may be a key factor driving the invariance of wpc under high irrigation treatments fig 5b potentially limiting the advantage of dt hybrid in high water regimes some studies have shown that dt hybrids might contribute to reducing the yield loss caused by heat stress chukwudi et al 2021 selecting for dt hybrids may increase the output of maize to the greatest extent in the limited irrigation input for arid and semi arid regions all of which are warming under climate change we conducted our experiment in different locations in 2014 and 2015 the difference between two locations in soil and climate may have contributed to the difference between two hybrids in yield formation but this environmental difference was not directly considered in our parameterization of the model in actual maize production field management practices such as irrigation method and fertilization rates play an important role in fully exerting the yield advantage of dt hybrids these need to be determined based on more detailed experiment data to quantify the contribution of dt hybrids in yield increase and water saving more accurately in future research in different climate years wet or dry the resource input of water precipitation and irrigation to meet the physiological need of maize growth and development is different it may cause different yield responses for two hybrids and need more research combining field and climate control experiment in the future 5 conclusions under the same watering regime dt hybrids increase maize yield and water productivity especially at low irrigation levels this caused more yield improvement and water saving potential for dt hybrid the dt hybrids had greater yield under the same irrigation amount and saving water with the same target yield when irrigation was constrained to 90 80 70 60 and 50 of the irrigation required for the baseline scenario bs dt hybrid decreased total maize production loss caused by drought stress by 19 24 26 26 and 21 compared with the conventional hybrid which means the contribution of dt hybrid to total production improvement under different irrigation levels with drought stress above was 19 26 when the target yield was set to 90 80 70 and 60 of bs water applied could be reduced by 17 16 15 and 15 which means the contribution of the dt hybrid to total irrigation water saving in these four yield targets were 15 17 if the conventional hybrid was changed to dt hybrid in production funding this work was supported by the ministry of

water and land resource availability for agriculture reddy et al 2022 severe water scarcity is expected to affect one billion people in india for future year highlighting the importance of efficient water resource development and management mandal et al 2020 rainfed farming systems in sat regions provide a diverse range of food supplies accounting for 51 of india s net sown area 143 mha and 60 of nutritive food grains for 20 35 of the country s undernourished population singh et al 2018 extreme weather events are becoming more common in india s sat regions which contribute to the production of cereals pulses oil seeds cotton and other crops under rainfed farming swaminathan and rengalakshmi 2016 because land and water resources are limited the global demand for cereals is expected to rise by 55 80 by 2050 which can be met by expanding cropland or increasing crop productivity kumar and sharma 2020 after rice and wheat maize zea mays l is india s third most important cereal crop and it is grown during the rainy and winter seasons reddy et al 2020 it is the country s most important crop accounting for 83 of total area 9 2 million ha under cultivation during the rainy season and 9 of total food grain production singh et al 2018 maize production in india has steadily increased from 1 73 million metric tonnes in 1950 51 27 8 million metric tonnes in 2018 19 with rainfed maize accounting for 70 of the crop and irrigation accounting for the remainder rainfed maize productivity on the other hand ranges from 0 89 t ha to 2 7 t ha tuti et al 2022 by 2025 the demand for maize production is expected to be around 50 million metric tonnes mt to meet the growing feed requirements of the poultry industry exports and starch industry sandhu and irmak 2019 because the majority of maize production occurs in rainfed ecosystems which are subjected to the most abiotic stresses as a result of rising temperatures and long dry spells paoletti et al 2020 the uncertainty of rainfall and its distribution within the crop season are the main constraints to high yields and this problem could be solved by using critical irrigation especially at critical crop growth stages to improve yield and water productivity significantly mandal et al 2020 drought impact on crop production in sat could be reduced by using critical irrigation through on farm reservoirs combined with sprinkler irrigation during dry spells sarangi and sekhar 2022 crop growth simulation models have become widely accepted tools for assessing the impact of climate change on crop production kadiyala et al 2021 these models need for their simulations multivariate weather series representing present and future climates to simulate crop growth on a daily time step diaa et al 2020 balvanshi and tiwari 2021 bwambale and mourad 2022 feng et al 2022 crop producers need to adapt to climate change through changes in farming practices cropping patterns and use of modern technology fawen et al 2022 the expected future changes in climatic conditions namely solar radiation air temperature precipitation and higher concentration of carbon dioxide co2 can be analyzed by using crop models alemayehu 2020 the aquacrop is a crop water productivity model developed by the land and water division of the food and agricultural organisation fao of the united nations kumar and sharma 2018 in comparison with other models it is more effective for areas where water is a limiting factor it requires fewer parameters and it is user friendly more accurate with lower error probabilities chisanga et al 2022 the representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios are initiated by the collaboration of different modelers sets such as integrated assessment modelers terrestrial ecosystem modelers climate modelers and also from the emission inventory experts which results in an comprehensive data set of high spatial tenacity for the period extending up to 2100 ahmadi et al 2021 srivastava et al 2021 one of the chief applications of these rcp can be understood in the ipcc 2013 reports on further elaborating these scenarios are given the marker representative concentration pathways rcps in which the word representative represents that each rcp offers only one out of many probable scenarios that results in exact radiative forcing structures and the term pathway emphases on the trajectory path taken over time to reach the required outcome radiative forcing is known as the disruption of the earth atmosphere system energy balance wm 2 ahmadi et al 202 many researchers ahmadi et al 2021 estimated the percentage change of maize yield under different rcps scenarios throughout the world their studies indicated that maize yield and water productivity is significnatly changed under each rcps under different locations of the world keeping these aspects in view the present investigation was carried out at icar central research institute for dryland agriculture hyderabad india to study the maize yield and water productivity under dryland agriecosystems in telangana state of india under different rcps scenarios 2 methodology 2 1 experimental details the field experiment was conducted at icar central research institute for dryland agricultural crida hyderabad telangana state the farm is located at 78º 40 18 n and 17º 2 5 e with mean sea level of 621 m the experiment was laid out in a split split plot statistical design with three replications there were five main treatments viz i0 i1 i2 i3 i4 two sub treatments viz m0 no mulching m1 mulching 5 t ha 1 with glyricidia and two sub sub treatments viz nf normal fertilizer and hf high fertilizer a recommended dose of fertilizer for maize crop under rainfed condition is 100 50 25 kg ha 1 n p k respectively full quantity of p and k were applied as basal application a quantity of 100 kg ha 1 under normal fertilizer and 125 kg ha 1 under higher fertilizer doze 25 extra n were applied under two split during sowing 50 and flowering stage 50 respectively maize crop was used as test crop and total plot size was 4050 m2 60 blocks with each block size 15 m x 4 5 m the experiment was conducted during kharif season of 2013 and 2014 2 2 weather data the daily climate data on rainfall maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were recorded from automated weather station aws during crop growth period the average annual and seasonal rainfall of the study area was 702 and 479 mm respectively the average temperature of study area was 25 5 ºc with average minimum and maximum of 8 94 and 42 06 ºc respectively 2 3 aquacrop model description and input data aquacrop version 3 1 was used in the present study and it consists of six input files for simulation climate file crop file soil file field management file irrigation file and initial soil water conditions all these are user specific however crop file contains both conservative parameters that do not change with location and non conservative user specific parameters the detailed information on aquacrop model can be found in feng et al 2022 2 3 1 climate data aquacrop model requires daily values of rainfall minimum and maximum air temperature reference crop evapotranspiration eto and mean annual carbon dioxide concentration co2 the fao eto calculator was used to calculate daily eto using the daily maximum and minimum temperature wind speed at 2 m above ground surface solar radiation and mean relative humidity rh the daily rainfall depths temperature variations and eto during the experiment of 2013 and 2014 are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively 2 3 2 crop parameters random sampling at regular intervals is used in the study for obtaining data on plant growth parameters such as aboveground biomass plant height root length leaf area index observation on plant height leaf area and root depth were recorded on 15 days interval 15 days after of sowing das to harvest stage and subsequently the days related to germination flowering maximum canopy maximum root depth senescence and maturity were also recorded the values for canopy decline coefficient crop coefficient for transpiration at full canopy cover soil water depletion thresholds for inhibition of leaf growth and stomatal conductance acceleration of canopy senescence were adopted from abedinpour et al 2012 relationship between lai and cc used for maize crop is presented in eq 1 roja et al 2020 feng et al 2022 1 cc 1 005 1 exp 0 6 lai 1 2 2 3 3 irrigation and field management parameters the input data required by aquacrop model on irrigation management are rainfed and irrigation in the present study no irrigation was applied under rainfed treatment however two supplemental irrigations were applied through sprinkler irrigation based on selected treatment viz i1 20 mm i2 30 mm i3 40 mm and i4 50 mm the field management consists of mulching and fertility levels in the present study two fertilizer levels and mulching with 5 t ha 1were adopted the water productivity under different depths of supplemental irrigation is calculated using below formula water productivity grain yield quantity o f water used kg ha 1 mm 1 2 4 aquacrop model calibration calibration is a process of adjusting the parameters of the model so that simulated results reach a pre determined level usually that of an observation in the present study the aquacrop model calibration was accomplished by using observed values from the field experiment conducted during kharif season of 2013 the field data of 2013 crop season were used as input to simulate maize grain yield and water productivity the prediction error between observed and model predicted values were reduced by trial and error method by taking one specific input variable as reference and adjusted only those parameters the same procedure was repeated for all selected treatment combination to arrive at the closet match between the observed and model simulated values 2 4 1 calibration of crop parameters the development of crop canopy is depends on crop parameters viz days to emergence days to full maturity maximum canopy cover days to senescence canopy growth coefficient cgc and canopy decline coefficient cdc in order to minimize the prediction error between measured and simulated values the coefficients were adjusted by trial and error approach the calibrated crop parameters are presented in the table 1 the calibrated values of cgc and cdc for the experiment were 15 5 day 1 and 4 2 day 1 respectively the maximum transpiration crop coefficient kcbx was calibrated to standardize eto during the growing season where the cc was equal to the maximum canopy cover ccx the kcbx value thus obtained was 1 05 under full irrigation and no fertilizer stress conditions the harvest index was obtained as 34 on a dry biomass basis and 39 on wet basis with grain moisture content of 15 5 at harvest subsequently under the crop water stress category factors pertaining to expansion stress were calibrated to have the upper threshold lower threshold and shape factor to be 0 14 0 72 and 2 9 respectively also the stomatal closure stress the upper threshold and shape factor were 0 69 and 2 7 respectively while the lower threshold was set at the permanent wilting point pwp moreover for the early senescence stress the upper threshold and shape factor were 0 19 and 1 3 respectively while the lower threshold was set at the permanent wilting point pwp all these eight calibrated coefficients were related to the crop water stress function in the aquacrop model which was used to simulate the yield from different experimental plots 2 5 validation of aquacrop model having calibrated aquacrop it was significant that the model be validated in order to evaluate its performance in simulating crop yields model validation is important in order to determine if the model has the ability to replicate the data to analyse the effectiveness of model calibration and compare synthetic data with those done in previous studies to effectively evaluate the performance of the model the use of ensemble statistical indicators is appropriate diaa et al 2021 feng et al 2022 in our analysis of performance of aquacrop the following lists of statistical indicators were used prediction error pe coefﬁcient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and model efﬁciency e e and r2 indicate the predictive power of the model whilst pe mae and rmse are used to signify the amount of error associated with the model prediction abedinpour et al 2012 2 6 development of climate change scenarios the climate change scenarios are developed for representative concentration pathways rcp of rcp 4 5 and 8 5 rcps are concentration pathways used in the ipcc ar5 climate researchers use the four rcps as inputs into climate models to determine likely global temperature rainfall and other climate possibilities the condition and charactristics of rcp 4 5 and 8 5 are suits to the indian condition and can be adopted for studying future climate change in india raju and phanindra 2020 bal et al 2022 gunawat et al 2022 therefore data on rcp 4 5 and 8 5 are downloaded from website http gismap ciat cgiar org marksimgcm climate change on agriculture and food security and used for study of impact of climate change on maize yield biomass and water productivity under rainfed and supplemental irrigation in rainfed alfisols for rangareddy district of telangana state the collected rainfall data is analyzed for weekly monthly seasonal and annual rainfall and variability in the mean maximum and minimum air temperature from 2010 to 2100 and compared with base period of 1960 2014 based on the variability changes in the rainfall and air temperatures three time scenarios have developed as near century 2010 2040 mid century 2041 2070 and end century 2071 2100 which represents the 2025 2050 and 2090 respectively the dry spells were identified by weekly rainfall analysis in the selected time scenarios the supplemental irrigations have given wherever the dry spells exceeds 20 days under both the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 in three time scenarios of 2025 2050 and 2090 according to contingency report of crida the rangareddy district receives the monsoon rainfall during second week of june and based on this 15th june is selected as sowing date for projection of maize grain biomass and water productivity in selected time scenarios 3 results and discussions 3 1 weather data analysis the total rainfall depths received during crop season of 2013 and 2014 were 775 and 249 mm respectively figs 1 and 2 due to drought condition in rainy season of 2014 there was a 68 per cent reduction in rainfall depth as compared to rainy season of 2013 with good rainfall distribution the maximum air temperature during crop growth period was observed on 19th october 33 2 ºc and 22nd of october 36 ºc and minimum air temperature was observed on 11th september 11 ºc and 18th september 14 3 ºc in 2013 and 2014 respectively the temperature regime during 2014 was warm as compared to 2013 during the growing season with large differences between the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures the statistical parameters viz mean standard deviation and coefficient variation cv was calculated for annual rainfall et0 and air temperatures it is observed that cv value 2 52 of 2013 annual rainfall is lesser than cv value 2 75 of 2014 annual rainfall and observed that the there was good uniformity in 2013 annual rainfall than 2014 it is due to fact that there was two long dry spell occurred during 2014 a similar trend was also obesrved for et0 and air temperatures during 2013 and 2014 3 2 yield and water productivity under supplementary irrigation mulching and fertilizer dose measured data from the field experiment for two years of 2013 and 2014 were pooled to study the effect of supplemental irrigation in rainfed maize production the average percentage increase in the grain yield due to application of supplemental irrigation during rainy season of 2013 and 2014 compared to rainfed condition is presented in table 2 the percentage increase in grain yield ranges from 34 88 in supplemental irrigation of 20 mm i1 under m0nf to 148 37 in supplemental irrigation of 50 mm i4 under m1hf the study clearly indicates that there is an increasing trend in percentage increase in the order of m0nf m0hf m1nf m1hf compared to rainfed condition the statistical analysis indicated that there is a significant increase in grain yield and water productivity by application of si mulching and higher dose of fertilizer however the interaction of si and mulching had positive effect on yield and there is no significant difference in interaction of si and higher fertilizer dose it was observed that application of si and incorporation of mulching in rainfed maize production improves the effectiveness of water utilization and the parallel results were also reported by reddy et al 2020 sarangi and sekhar 2022 application of organic mulch under rainfed condition can significantly increase the crop yield by enhancing soil moisture content for longer duration soothar et al 2021 srivastava et al 2021 also reported that shifting from exclusive rainfed agriculture to supplementary irrigation the average wp of maize can be increased substantially over rainfed and the maize yield improvement can be attributed to timely water application to crops to avoid water stress and availability of more soil water for the plant 3 3 aquacrop model performance 3 3 1 calibration of aquacrop model the performance of aquacrop model under calibration was assessed using statistical parameters viz model efficiency e root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae the model was calibrated for grain yield with model efficiency 5 and coefficient of determination r2 0 94 respectively fig 3 it was observed that the maximum and minimum error in grain yield prediction was in i3 m1nf and i0 m0hf treatments amounting to 16 51 and 0 19 respectively it is observed that the model was calibrated for simulation of yield for all treatment levels with the prediction error statistics 0 94 e 0 95 0 06 rmse 0 12 t ha 1 and 0 59 mae 0 82 t ha 1 aquacrop model predictions for grain yield were in line with the observed data with the values of e and r2 approaching one the calibration results on grain yield clearly indicated that the aquacrop model is able to simulate grain yield in acceptable range zhu et al 2021 it was possible to reduce the prediction error between measured and simulated grain yield by adjusting the values of basal crop coefficient 1 05 canopy growth coefficient 15 5 day 1 canopy decline coefficient 4 2 day 1 stomatal stress coefficient and expansion stress coefficient upper 0 14 and lower 0 72 over all the prediction error pe ranged between minimum 0 19 to maximum 16 51 in i0 m0hf and i3 m1nf respectively the similar results were also quoted by abedinpour et al 2012 roja et al 2020 surendran et al 2021 tuure et al 2021 for maize crop in different parts of the country 3 3 2 aquacrop model validation the experimental data of rainy season of 2014 were used for validation of aquacrop model to simulate grain yield and results are presented in fig 4 it was observed that the maximum and minimum error of grain yield prediction during model validation with the data of 2014 was in rainfed i0 under m1hf and supplemental irrigation of 30 mm i2 under m0hf treatments were 29 47 and 1 93 respectively results indicated that the grain yield predicted under validation were similar to measure under even drought conditions the model performance was evaluated with statistics using rmse root mean square error mae mean absolute error and model efficiency e and results are presented in fig 5 there was a good agreement between measured and simulated grain yield with r2 of 0 93 with an efficiency of 0 91 which is within the acceptable limits the rmse and mae values obtained during validation of aquacrp model for grain yield are 0 37 and 0 33 which is inacceptable range and deviations are more in 2014 due to 3 long dry spells of 30 days at various critical stages of maize out of three dry spells the first dry spell at vegetative stage was managed by one supplemental irrigation in the experiment as water available in farm pond was limited and there was no runoff collection in farm pond during crop growth period in 2014 the aquacrop model validation indicates that the model simulated maize grain values are in line with measured data even under severe drought condition during rainy season of 2014 however highest prediction error was obtained in rainfed for grain yield 29 47 this is due to fact that the water stress in the rainfed was significantly reduced the grain yield during the experiment moreover the model overestimated the grain yield in the rainfed treatment leading to higher prediction error as compared to calibration the performance of the model during the validation was low with model efficiency for grain yield 91 as compared to 94 in calibration the two long dry spells in crop growth period of rainy season 2014 was significantly reduced grain yield as compared rainy season 2013 which leads to higher percent of deviations as compared to measured data the similar results for maize abedinpour et al 2012 roja et al 2020 tuure et al 2021 and rice surendran et al 2021 reported in the different parts of the country 3 4 climate change impacts on maize yield and water productivity in time scenarios of 2025 2050 and 2090 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 in rangareddy district projected future potential rainfed maize yield with climate change and projected impacts of supplemental irrigation on are presented in this section for this purpose aquacrop used to estimate future potential of maize attributes under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 ipcc scenarios the maize yield under rainfed condition during kharif 2013 was 2 81 t ha 1 this value is considered as base for calculating climate change impacts in three time scenarios under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 figs 6 and 7 respectively showed the percentage changes in maize yield relative to the observed data of kharif 2013 in general the results suggest a decrease in maize yield for all the three time scenarios in rainfed farming without drought management strategies adopted the expected percentage reduction in maize yield for 2025 2050 and 2090 are 18 06 16 42 and 13 97 per cent under rcp 4 5 and 13 96 11 81 and 8 80 per cent under rcp 8 5 respectively in the rainfed figs 5 6 the application of supplemental irrigation during vegetative and grain development stages increases the average maize yield of 28 39 30 96 and 34 81 per cent under i1 34 77 37 46 and 41 50 per cent under i2 49 67 52 66 and 57 15 per cent under i3 and 66 46 69 79 and 74 79 per cent under i4 during 2025 2050 and 2090 under rcp 4 5 respectively there was an increase of grain yield by 34 81 38 18 and 42 90 per cent under i1 41 50 45 04 and 50 per cent under i2 57 15 61 08 and 66 58 per cent under i3 and 74 79 79 15 and 85 27 per cent under i4 during 2025 2050 and 2090 respectively under rcp 8 5 over observed rainfed maize yield of kharif 2013 however by adopting supplemental irrigation strategies will result in maize yield increase from 28 39 to 74 79 per cent in rcp 4 5 and 34 81 85 27 per cent in rcp 8 5 from near century 2025 to end century 2090 the water productivity projected under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 indicated that the wp was decreased by 18 02 16 22 and 13 51 per cent under rcp 4 5 and 13 92 12 03 and 9 19 per cent under rcp 8 5 during 2025 2050 and 2090 respectively under rainfed condition figs 7 and 8 however due to application of supplemental irrigation the wp increased by 22 52 24 77 and 27 48 per cent under i1 27 03 29 50 and 31 98 per cent under i2 36 71 39 41 and 41 89 per cent under i3 and 46 62 49 32 and 51 13 per cent under i4 during 2025 2050 and 2090 respectively under rcp 4 5 the wp further increased by 28 65 31 01 and 33 85 per cent under i1 33 38 35 98 and 38 58 per cent under i2 43 55 46 39 and 48 99 per cent under i3 and 53 95 56 79 and 58 68 per cent under i4 during 2025 2050 and 2090 respectively under rcp 8 5 the increasing frequency and severity of droughts the shift in onset of the rains increasing intensity of mid season wet and dry spells and variations in the cessation of the rains in the future years as a major consequence of climate change which reduces the crop yield kumar and sharma 2018 alemayehu 2020 balvanshi and tiwari 2021 srivastava et al 2021 bal et al 2022 many researchers have used aquacrop model to simulate maize yield and biomass under climate change scenarios throughout the world and present results are in line with gunawat et al 2022 he reported that the maize yield and biomass are decreased by 98 and 25 per cent under traditional practices in the projected period of 2046 2065 diaa et al 2021 and feng et al 2022 used aquacrop for projection of maize yield and showed that climate change will shift planting dates towards delayed planting in the period 2046 2065 the results further showed that using traditional static sowing practices in the period 2046 2065 will result in maize zea mays l yield reductions adopting dynamic planting strategies and supplemental irrigation will result in highest maize yields under rainfed ecosystem xiao et al 2020 projection of potato yield under climate change using aquacrop reported that the application of supplementary irrigation under the future climate increased potato yield as compared to rainfed pushpalatha et al 2021 roja et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 4 conclusion understanding future climate and its impact on dryland maize production in telangana state is very important for minimizing adverse effect of future climate through adopting climate

number of rainy days long dry spells and other factors affect crop productivity in semi arid tropical sat regions mahmood et al 2015 the management of natural resources such as soil and water would be impacted by global population growth and dynamic changes in eating habits raza et al 2019 by 2027 india will be the world s most populous country with extreme weather events having a direct impact on water and land resource availability for agriculture reddy et al 2022 severe water scarcity is expected to affect one billion people in india for future year highlighting the importance of efficient water resource development and management mandal et al 2020 rainfed farming systems in sat regions provide a diverse range of food supplies accounting for 51 of india s net sown area 143 mha and 60 of nutritive food grains for 20 35 of the country s undernourished population singh et al 2018 extreme weather events are becoming more common in india s sat regions which contribute to the production of cereals pulses oil seeds cotton and other crops under rainfed farming swaminathan and rengalakshmi 2016 because land and water resources are limited the global demand for cereals is expected to rise by 55 80 by 2050 which can be met by expanding cropland or increasing crop productivity kumar and sharma 2020 after rice and wheat maize zea mays l is india s third most important cereal crop and it is grown during the rainy and winter seasons reddy et al 2020 it is the country s most important crop accounting for 83 of total area 9 2 million ha under cultivation during the rainy season and 9 of total food grain production singh et al 2018 maize production in india has steadily increased from 1 73 million metric tonnes in 1950 51 27 8 million metric tonnes in 2018 19 with rainfed maize accounting for 70 of the crop and irrigation accounting for the remainder rainfed maize productivity on the other hand ranges from 0 89 t ha to 2 7 t ha tuti et al 2022 by 2025 the demand for maize production is expected to be around 50 million metric tonnes mt to meet the growing feed requirements of the poultry industry exports and starch industry sandhu and irmak 2019 because the majority of maize production occurs in rainfed ecosystems which are subjected to the most abiotic stresses as a result of rising temperatures and long dry spells paoletti et al 2020 the uncertainty of rainfall and its distribution within the crop season are the main constraints to high yields and this problem could be solved by using critical irrigation especially at critical crop growth stages to improve yield and water productivity significantly mandal et al 2020 drought impact on crop production in sat could be reduced by using critical irrigation through on farm reservoirs combined with sprinkler irrigation during dry spells sarangi and sekhar 2022 crop growth simulation models have become widely accepted tools for assessing the impact of climate change on crop production kadiyala et al 2021 these models need for their simulations multivariate weather series representing present and future climates to simulate crop growth on a daily time step diaa et al 2020 balvanshi and tiwari 2021 bwambale and mourad 2022 feng et al 2022 crop producers need to adapt to climate change through changes in farming practices cropping patterns and use of modern technology fawen et al 2022 the expected future changes in climatic conditions namely solar radiation air temperature precipitation and higher concentration of carbon dioxide co2 can be analyzed by using crop models alemayehu 2020 the aquacrop is a crop water productivity model developed by the land and water division of the food and agricultural organisation fao of the united nations kumar and sharma 2018 in comparison with other models it is more effective for areas where water is a limiting factor it requires fewer parameters and it is user friendly more accurate with lower error probabilities chisanga et al 2022 the representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios are initiated by the collaboration of different modelers sets such as integrated assessment modelers terrestrial ecosystem modelers climate modelers and also from the emission inventory experts which results in an comprehensive data set of high spatial tenacity for the period extending up to 2100 ahmadi et al 2021 srivastava et al 2021 one of the chief applications of these rcp can be understood in the ipcc 2013 reports on further elaborating these scenarios are given the marker representative concentration pathways rcps in which the word representative represents that each rcp offers only one out of many probable scenarios that results in exact radiative forcing structures and the term pathway emphases on the trajectory path taken over time to reach the required outcome radiative forcing is known as the disruption of the earth atmosphere system energy balance wm 2 ahmadi et al 202 many researchers ahmadi et al 2021 estimated the percentage change of maize yield under different rcps scenarios throughout the world their studies indicated that maize yield and water productivity is significnatly changed under each rcps under different locations of the world keeping these aspects in view the present investigation was carried out at icar central research institute for dryland agriculture hyderabad india to study the maize yield and water productivity under dryland agriecosystems in telangana state of india under different rcps scenarios 2 methodology 2 1 experimental details the field experiment was conducted at icar central research institute for dryland agricultural crida hyderabad telangana state the farm is located at 78º 40 18 n and 17º 2 5 e with mean sea level of 621 m the experiment was laid out in a split split plot statistical design with three replications there were five main treatments viz i0 i1 i2 i3 i4 two sub treatments viz m0 no mulching m1 mulching 5 t ha 1 with glyricidia and two sub sub

applied as basal application a quantity of 100 kg ha 1 under normal fertilizer and 125 kg ha 1 under higher fertilizer doze 25 extra n were applied under two split during sowing 50 and flowering stage 50 respectively maize crop was used as test crop and total plot size was 4050 m2 60 blocks with each block size 15 m x 4 5 m the experiment was conducted during kharif season of 2013 and 2014 2 2 weather data the daily climate data on rainfall maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were recorded from automated weather station aws during crop growth period the average annual and seasonal rainfall of the study area was 702 and 479 mm respectively the average temperature of study area was 25 5 ºc with average minimum and maximum of 8 94 and 42 06 ºc respectively 2 3 aquacrop model description and input data aquacrop version 3 1 was used in the present study and it consists of six input files for simulation climate file crop file soil file field management file irrigation file and initial soil water conditions all these are user specific however crop file contains both conservative parameters that do not change with location and non conservative user specific parameters the detailed information on aquacrop model can be found in feng et al 2022 2 3 1 climate data aquacrop model requires daily values of rainfall minimum and maximum air temperature reference crop evapotranspiration eto and mean annual carbon dioxide concentration co2 the fao eto calculator was used to calculate daily eto using the daily maximum and minimum temperature wind speed at 2 m above ground surface solar radiation and mean relative humidity rh the daily rainfall depths temperature variations and eto during the experiment of 2013 and 2014 are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively 2 3 2 crop parameters random sampling at regular intervals is used in the study for obtaining data on plant growth parameters such as aboveground biomass plant height root length leaf area index observation on plant height leaf area and root depth were recorded on 15 days interval 15 days after of sowing das to harvest stage and subsequently the days related to germination flowering maximum canopy maximum root depth senescence and maturity were also recorded the values for canopy decline coefficient crop coefficient for transpiration at full canopy cover soil water depletion thresholds for inhibition of leaf growth and stomatal conductance acceleration of canopy senescence were adopted from abedinpour et al 2012 relationship between lai and cc used

irrigation management are rainfed and irrigation in the present study no irrigation was applied under rainfed treatment however two supplemental irrigations were applied through sprinkler irrigation based on selected treatment viz i1 20 mm i2 30 mm i3 40 mm and i4 50 mm the field management consists of mulching and fertility levels in the present study two fertilizer levels and mulching with 5 t ha 1were adopted the water productivity under different depths of supplemental irrigation is calculated using below formula water productivity grain yield quantity o f water used kg ha 1 mm 1 2 4 aquacrop model calibration calibration is a process of adjusting the parameters of the model so that simulated results reach a pre determined level usually that of an observation in the present study the aquacrop model calibration was accomplished by using observed values from the field experiment conducted during kharif season of 2013 the field data of 2013 crop season were used as input to simulate maize grain yield and water productivity the prediction error between observed and model predicted values were reduced by trial and error method by taking one specific input variable as reference and adjusted only those parameters the same procedure was repeated for all selected treatment combination to arrive at the closet match between the observed and model simulated values 2 4 1 calibration of crop parameters the development of crop canopy is depends on crop parameters viz days to emergence days to full maturity maximum canopy cover days to senescence canopy growth coefficient cgc and canopy decline coefficient cdc in order to minimize the prediction error between measured and simulated values the coefficients were adjusted by trial and error approach the calibrated crop parameters are presented in the table 1 the calibrated values of cgc and cdc for the experiment were 15 5 day 1 and 4 2 day 1 respectively the maximum transpiration crop coefficient kcbx was calibrated to standardize eto during the growing season where the cc was equal to the maximum canopy cover ccx the kcbx value thus obtained was 1 05 under full irrigation and no fertilizer stress conditions the harvest index was obtained as 34 on a dry biomass basis and 39 on wet basis with grain moisture content of 15 5 at harvest subsequently under the crop water stress category factors pertaining to expansion stress were calibrated to have the upper threshold lower threshold and shape factor to be 0 14 0 72 and 2 9 respectively also the stomatal closure stress the upper threshold and shape factor were 0 69 and 2 7 respectively while the lower threshold was set at the permanent wilting point pwp moreover for the early senescence stress the upper threshold and shape factor were 0 19 and 1 3 respectively while the lower threshold was set at the permanent wilting point pwp all these eight calibrated coefficients were related to the crop water stress function in the aquacrop model which was used to simulate the yield from different experimental plots 2 5 validation of aquacrop model having calibrated aquacrop it was significant that the model be validated in order to evaluate its performance in simulating crop yields model validation is important in order to determine if the model has the ability to replicate the data to analyse the effectiveness of model calibration and compare synthetic data with those done in previous studies to effectively evaluate the performance of the model the use of ensemble statistical indicators is appropriate diaa et al 2021 feng et al 2022 in our analysis of performance of aquacrop the following lists of statistical indicators were used prediction error pe coefﬁcient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and model efﬁciency e e and r2 indicate the predictive power of the model whilst pe mae and rmse are used to signify the amount of error associated with the model prediction abedinpour et al 2012 2 6 development of climate change scenarios the climate change scenarios are developed for representative concentration pathways rcp of rcp 4 5 and 8 5 rcps are concentration pathways used in the ipcc ar5 climate researchers use the four rcps as inputs into climate models to determine likely global temperature rainfall and other climate possibilities the condition and charactristics of rcp 4 5 and 8 5 are suits to the indian condition and can be adopted for studying future climate change in india raju and phanindra 2020 bal et al 2022 gunawat et al 2022 therefore data on rcp 4 5 and 8 5 are downloaded from website http gismap ciat cgiar org marksimgcm climate change on agriculture and food security and used for study of impact of climate change on maize yield biomass and water productivity under rainfed and supplemental irrigation in rainfed alfisols for rangareddy district of telangana state the collected rainfall data is analyzed for weekly monthly seasonal and annual rainfall and variability in the mean maximum and minimum air temperature from 2010 to 2100 and compared with base period of 1960 2014 based on the variability changes in the rainfall and air temperatures three time scenarios have developed as near century 2010 2040 mid century 2041 2070 and end century 2071 2100 which represents the 2025 2050 and 2090 respectively the dry spells were identified by weekly rainfall analysis in the selected time scenarios the supplemental irrigations have given wherever the dry spells exceeds 20 days under both the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 in three time scenarios of 2025 2050 and 2090 according to contingency report of crida the rangareddy district receives the monsoon rainfall during second week of june and based on this 15th june is selected as sowing date for projection of maize grain biomass and water productivity in selected time scenarios 3 results and discussions 3 1 weather data analysis the total rainfall depths received during crop season of 2013 and 2014 were 775 and 249 mm respectively figs 1 and 2 due to drought condition in rainy season of 2014 there was a 68 per cent reduction in rainfall depth as compared to rainy season of 2013 with good rainfall distribution the maximum air temperature during crop growth period was observed on 19th october 33 2 ºc and 22nd of october 36 ºc and minimum air temperature was observed on 11th september 11 ºc and 18th september 14 3 ºc in 2013 and 2014 respectively the temperature regime during 2014 was warm as compared to 2013 during the growing season with large differences between the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures the statistical parameters viz mean standard deviation and coefficient variation cv was calculated for annual rainfall et0 and air temperatures it is observed that cv value 2 52 of 2013 annual rainfall is lesser than cv value 2 75 of 2014 annual rainfall and observed that the there was good uniformity in 2013 annual rainfall than 2014 it is due to fact that there was two long dry spell occurred during 2014 a similar trend was also obesrved for et0 and air temperatures during 2013 and 2014 3 2 yield and water productivity under supplementary irrigation mulching and fertilizer dose measured data from the field experiment for two years of 2013 and 2014 were pooled to study the effect of supplemental irrigation in rainfed maize production the average percentage increase in the grain yield due to application of supplemental irrigation during rainy season of 2013 and 2014 compared to rainfed condition is presented in table 2 the percentage increase in grain yield ranges from 34 88 in supplemental irrigation of 20 mm i1 under m0nf to 148 37 in supplemental irrigation of 50 mm i4 under m1hf the study clearly indicates that there is an increasing trend in percentage increase in the order of m0nf m0hf m1nf m1hf compared to rainfed condition the statistical analysis indicated that there is a significant increase in grain yield and water productivity by application of si mulching and higher dose of fertilizer however the interaction of si and mulching had positive effect on yield and there is no significant difference in interaction of si and higher fertilizer dose it was observed that application of si and incorporation of mulching in rainfed maize production improves the effectiveness of water utilization and the parallel results were also reported by reddy et al 2020 sarangi and sekhar 2022 application of organic mulch under rainfed condition can significantly increase the crop yield by enhancing soil moisture content for longer duration soothar et al 2021 srivastava et al 2021 also reported that shifting from exclusive rainfed agriculture to supplementary irrigation the average wp of maize can be increased substantially over rainfed and the maize yield improvement can be attributed to timely water application to crops to avoid water stress and availability of more soil water for the plant 3 3 aquacrop model performance 3 3 1 calibration of aquacrop model the performance of aquacrop model under calibration was assessed using statistical parameters viz model efficiency e root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae the model was calibrated for grain yield with model efficiency 5 and coefficient of determination r2 0 94 respectively fig 3 it was observed that the maximum and minimum error in grain yield prediction was in i3 m1nf and i0 m0hf treatments amounting to 16 51 and 0 19 respectively it is observed that the model was calibrated for simulation of yield for all treatment levels with the prediction error statistics 0 94 e 0 95 0 06 rmse 0 12 t ha 1 and 0 59 mae 0 82 t ha 1 aquacrop model predictions for grain yield were in line with the observed data with the values of e and r2 approaching one the calibration results on grain yield clearly indicated that the aquacrop model is able to simulate grain yield in acceptable range zhu et al 2021 it was possible to reduce the prediction error between measured and simulated grain yield by adjusting the values of basal crop coefficient 1 05 canopy growth coefficient 15 5 day 1 canopy decline coefficient 4 2 day 1 stomatal stress coefficient and expansion stress coefficient upper 0 14 and lower 0 72 over all the prediction error pe ranged between minimum 0 19 to maximum 16 51 in i0 m0hf and i3 m1nf respectively the similar results were also quoted by abedinpour et al 2012 roja et al 2020 surendran et al 2021 tuure et al 2021 for maize crop in different parts of the country 3 3 2 aquacrop model validation the experimental data of rainy season of 2014 were used for validation of aquacrop model to simulate grain yield and results are presented in fig 4 it was observed that the maximum and minimum error of grain yield prediction during model validation with the data of 2014 was in rainfed i0 under m1hf and supplemental irrigation of 30 mm i2 under m0hf treatments were 29 47 and 1 93 respectively results indicated that the grain yield predicted under validation were similar to measure under even drought conditions the model performance was evaluated with statistics using rmse root mean square error mae mean absolute error and model efficiency e and results are presented in fig 5 there was a good agreement between measured and simulated grain yield with r2 of 0 93 with an efficiency of 0 91 which is within the acceptable limits the rmse and mae values obtained during validation of aquacrp model for grain yield are 0 37 and 0 33 which is inacceptable range and deviations are more in 2014 due to 3 long dry spells of 30 days at various critical stages of maize out of three dry spells the first dry spell at vegetative stage was managed by one supplemental irrigation in the experiment as water available in farm pond was limited and there was no runoff collection in farm pond during crop growth period in 2014 the aquacrop model validation indicates that the model simulated maize grain values are in line with measured data even under severe drought condition during rainy season of 2014 however highest prediction error was obtained in rainfed for grain yield 29 47 this is due to fact that the water stress in the rainfed was significantly reduced the grain yield during the experiment moreover the model overestimated the grain yield in the rainfed treatment leading to higher prediction error as compared to calibration the performance of the model during the validation was low with model efficiency for grain yield 91 as compared to 94 in calibration the two long dry spells in crop growth period of rainy season 2014 was significantly reduced grain yield as compared rainy season 2013 which leads to higher percent of deviations as compared to measured data the similar results for maize abedinpour et al 2012 roja et al 2020 tuure et al 2021 and rice surendran et al 2021 reported in the different parts of the country 3 4 climate change impacts on maize yield and water productivity in time scenarios of 2025 2050 and 2090 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 in rangareddy district projected future potential rainfed maize yield with climate change and projected impacts of supplemental irrigation on are presented in this section for this purpose aquacrop used to estimate future potential of maize attributes under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 ipcc scenarios the maize yield under rainfed condition during kharif 2013 was 2 81 t ha 1 this value is considered as base for calculating climate change impacts in three time scenarios under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 figs 6 and 7 respectively showed the percentage changes in maize yield relative to the observed data of kharif 2013 in general the results suggest a decrease in maize yield for all the three time scenarios in rainfed farming without drought management strategies adopted the expected percentage reduction in maize yield for 2025 2050 and 2090 are 18 06 16 42 and 13 97 per cent under rcp 4 5 and 13 96 11 81 and 8 80 per cent under rcp 8 5 respectively in the rainfed figs 5 6 the application of supplemental irrigation during vegetative and grain development stages increases the average maize yield of 28 39 30 96 and 34 81 per cent under i1 34 77 37 46 and 41 50 per cent under i2 49 67 52 66 and 57 15 per cent under i3 and 66 46 69 79 and 74 79 per cent under i4 during 2025 2050 and 2090 under rcp 4 5 respectively there was an increase of grain yield by 34 81 38 18 and 42 90 per cent under i1 41 50 45 04 and 50 per cent under i2 57 15 61 08 and 66 58 per cent under i3 and 74 79 79 15 and 85 27 per cent under i4 during 2025 2050 and 2090 respectively under rcp 8 5 over observed rainfed maize yield of kharif 2013 however by adopting supplemental irrigation strategies will result in maize yield increase from 28 39 to 74 79 per cent in rcp 4 5 and 34 81 85 27 per cent in rcp 8 5 from near century 2025 to end century 2090 the water productivity projected under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 indicated that the wp was decreased by 18 02 16 22 and 13 51 per cent under rcp 4 5 and 13 92 12 03 and 9 19 per cent under rcp 8 5 during 2025 2050 and 2090 respectively under rainfed condition figs 7 and 8 however due to application of supplemental irrigation the wp increased by 22 52 24 77 and 27 48 per cent under i1 27 03 29 50 and 31 98 per cent under i2 36 71 39 41 and 41 89 per cent under i3 and 46 62 49 32 and 51 13 per cent under i4 during 2025 2050 and 2090 respectively under rcp 4 5 the wp further increased by 28 65 31 01 and 33 85 per cent under i1 33 38 35 98 and 38 58 per cent under i2 43 55 46 39 and 48 99 per cent under i3 and 53 95 56 79 and 58 68 per cent under i4 during 2025 2050 and 2090 respectively under rcp 8 5 the increasing frequency and severity of droughts the shift in onset of the rains increasing intensity of mid season wet and dry spells and variations in the cessation of the rains in the future years as a major consequence of climate change which reduces the crop yield kumar and sharma 2018 alemayehu 2020 balvanshi and tiwari 2021 srivastava et al 2021 bal et al 2022 many researchers have used aquacrop model to simulate maize yield and biomass under climate change scenarios throughout the world and present results are in line with gunawat et al 2022 he reported that the maize yield and biomass are decreased by 98 and 25 per cent under traditional practices in the projected period of 2046 2065 diaa et al 2021 and feng et al 2022 used aquacrop for projection of maize yield and showed that climate change will shift planting dates towards delayed planting in the period 2046 2065 the results further showed that using traditional static sowing practices in the period 2046 2065 will result in maize zea mays l yield reductions adopting dynamic planting strategies and supplemental irrigation will result in highest maize yields under rainfed ecosystem xiao et al 2020 projection of potato yield under climate change using aquacrop reported that the application of supplementary irrigation under the future climate increased potato yield as compared to rainfed pushpalatha et al 2021 roja et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 4 conclusion understanding future climate and its impact on dryland maize production in telangana state is very important for minimizing adverse effect of future climate through adopting climate resilient technologies like use of onfarm reservoirs farm ponds and other efficient water conservation technologies the study indicated that the highest average grain yield of 3 19 t ha 1 can be achieved through 50 mm supplemental irrigation during dry spell with average water productivity of 10 65 kg ha 1 mm 1 in maize crop under dryland ecosystem the aquacrop model was calibrated for simulation of grain yield and water productivity for all treatment levels and the prediction error statistics were 0 94 e 0 95 0 06 rmse 0 12 t ha 1 and 0 59 mae 0 82 t ha 1 the validation of aquacrop model performed well with model efficiency of 91 and 73 for grain yield and water productivity respectively and is within the acceptable limits under the changing rainfall and air temperature the maize grain yield under rainfed condition can be sustained by application of supplemental irrigation of 50 mm with expected increase in maize yield by 28 39 74 79 per cent in rcp 4 5 and 34 81 85 27

2020 barbosa et al 2017 sugarcane hard stalks and intensive growth easily lead to bending or clamping of surface drip laterals fig s1 as well as farm machine and rodent can damage fig s2 surface drip irrigation system reducing both irrigation and fertigation uniformity and therefore increasing the risk of irrigation system failure in sdi systems drip laterals are buried below the soil surface and directly deliver irrigation water and fertilizer nutrients to the crop root zone with high efficiency and uniformity rogers et al 2003 sdi allows a low amount application of various chemicals including fertilizers chlorine acids herbicides and pesticides at frequent intervals minimizing the risks to environmental hazards liu et al 2021 likewise sdi laterals are deep enough and are not affected by the action of farm machinery and having no effects on system performance puig bargues et al 2010 however sdi emitters have narrow sized 0 5 1 2 mm li et al 2019 labyrinth flow channels and outlet basin compartments lequette et al 2020 which are sensitive to fouling or clogging lamm et al 2021 in fact emitter clogging significantly reduce the irrigation uniformity lamm et al 2021 increase chemical injections peragón et al 2017 maintenance costs and inputs of plastics to the environmental pollution xiao et al 2020 2020 thus emitter clogging considerably hinders the application and popularization of sugarcane sdi in field level recently numerous studies identified different types of emitter clogging muhammad et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 yang et al 2019 in surface drip irrigation systems conversely sdi laterals are commonly buried 10 30 cm below the soil surface due to the environmental differences such as lower temperature and less or no evaporation the chemical biological and physical clogging of sdi would be greatly different from surface drip irrigation lamm et al 2012 lamm and trooien 2005 in addition zaccaria et al 2017 stated root intrusion in sdi emitters under some crops is also an important factor inducing emitter clogging some preventive measures have been suggested to minimize emitter clogging caused by roots intrusion such as emitter flow path optimization feng et al 2018 acidification chlorination or herbicides de jesus souza et al 2014 furthermore the strong interactions between fouling substances mostly led to the complex behaviors of composite fouling lin et al 2019 for instance caco3 precipitates and biofilms matrix provide nucleation sites for particulates e g silicate obst et al 2009 biofouling could serve as the active nucleation site for the initiation of fouling warren et al 2001 therefore to well manage the sugarcane sdi an in depth knowledge of the multi type emitter clogging and the responsible fouling mechanisms are imperative this study aims to understand the mechanism of emitter multi type clogging in sugarcane sdi by analyzing five year field operating sugarcane sdi to understand the dynamics of emitter roots intrusion physical chemical and biological clogging and their potential interactions in sugarcane sdi system and propose appropriate controlling strategies for sdi emitter clogging x ray

slight clogging and partial clogging were the predominant clogging fig 2b the number of severe clogged emitters increased noticeably particularly in the tail parts of laterals furthermore a total of 2135 emitters were carefully peeled off maintaining safe their internal structure as far as possible as shown in fig 3 the results showed that sugarcane roots invaded the sdi emitters outlet basins flow channel and even the inlet grid root intrusion was found in averaged 92 4 of severe clogged emitters and 99 7 of complete clogged emitters root intrusion contributed less 5 0 to total emitter clogging which explained the decline of sugarcane sdi dra and cu 3 2 variation of sdi emitter clogging dry weight and chemical components the variation of emitter clogging dw and chemical components with respect to sdi operating years are shown in fig 4 the x ray diffraction analysis showed silica sio2 calcite caco3 dolomite camgco3 chlorite serpentine mg al 6 si al 4o10 oh 8 kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 gibbsite al oh 3 and iron trioxide fe2o3 were the key mineral components in emitter clogging dw overall the variation of clogging dw and mineral components presented significant p 0 05 positive linear correlations with the sdi operating years the total dw was continuously increased ranging from 467 6 0 22 971 6 0 41 mg in five years fig 4c generally the mineral components were divided in three groups according to their chemical components including silica silicates and carbonate precipitates fig 4b both silicate and carbonate contents increased gradually with sdi operating years but silica showed an oscillatory trend the contents of silica silicates and carbonates during the sdy1 sdy5 ranged 10 7 32 4 48 5 67 1 and 5 13 13 7 respectively within the precipitates calcite and dolomite were the predominant minerals reaching 0 71 1 42 and 2 30 6 36 of total dw on the other hand kaolinite 44 4 63 6 fig 4i and chlorite serpentine 4 9 10 9 fig 4h and gibbsite 1 09 6 46 fig 4j were the predominant silicates minerals 3 3 variation and composition of sdi biological fouling microbial communities composition and variation of microbial communities were investigated by high

of taxa at phylum and genus levels a total of 37 phyla were identified in fouling substances proteobacteria 31 6 47 3 actinobacteria 21 5 45 1 firmicutes 3 31 22 1 bacteroidetes 1 07 6 26 and planctomycetes 0 76 3 30 were the dominant phylum fig 5d on other side pseudomonas 9 73 23 7 massilia 3 44 22 1 pseudarthrobacter 3 44 17 55 and others 39 6 60 8 were highly abundant in genus level fig 5e non metric dimensional scaling nmds analysis was applied to assess the dissimilarities of microbial communities among different operating years nmds visualized the differences in microbial

5 in sdy 4 and 4 in sdy 5 3 4 interaction of sdi physical chemical and biological fouling this study also conducted statistical analysis aimed to understand the correlation among multi type fouling substances fig 6 the spearmen s correlation results indicated more than 44 of significant correlations were found among precipitates particulate and biofouling these results were further evidenced by variance portioning analysis vpa whereas the ternary correlation among precipitates particulates and biofouling showed a higher contribution of 46 1 followed by the binary correlation precipitates and particulates which contributed 26 6 to decline the system dra the relative contribution of individual foulants including particulates precipitates and biofilm were 9 47 0 32 and 0 81 respectively to decline the system dra 4 discussion 4 1 roots intrusion and emitter clogging in sdi systems sdi technology could significantly save irrigation water while maintaining satisfactory production robles et al 2016 and prevent aerosol release to plants and environment liu et al 2021 emitter clogging however greatly affected the effective management and secure operation of sdi at field levels this study experimentally analyzed the emitter clogging issue in five year operational sugarcane sdi system our results demonstrated the cd of sdi gradually increased with number of operating years which caused the decreased of sdi performance yielding smaller dra and cu fig 2 previous studies postulated root intrusion in emitters posed a serious threat to the long term success of sdi systems de jesus souza et al 2014 suarez rey et al 2006 ruskin 1994 after several years of sdi research and observation concluded the number of clogged emitters due to root intrusion could reach 60 after 4 years operation coelho and faria 2003 reported root intrusion in 14 emitters types after 330 days of citrus and coffee plant experiments however present study obtained different results root intrusion in sugarcane sdi emitters were only found in 92 4 and 99 7 of severe and complete clogged emitters which accounted for 4 8 of total emitter clogging emitters the linear correlation analysis showed nonsignificant correlation between sdi performance dra and cu and the percentage of severe and complete clogging fig s9 the differences was might be due to different crops and field conditions the dynamics of sugarcane root distribution fig 7 demonstrated that the highest root volume of sugarcane was obtained at depth of 0 20 cm at 15 cm horizontal distance reaching 3 3 cm3 which was 25 4 35 7 higher when compared with 30 40 cm depth sugarcane root growth shows a large spatial variation toward soil surface 45 and 135 rather than the soil vertical depth 90 in guangxi the area has a subtropical monsoon climate with abundant water resources with the average annual precipitation ranging from 1300 to 1500 mm peng et al 2013 thus the soil water content was also higher at the upper soil layers which also affected the pattern of root distribution laclau and laclau 2009 therefore based on results of this study the root intrusion was not the primary factor to define the decline of dra and cu of sugarcane sdi systems fig 2 4 2 sdi emitter multi type fouling and potential interactions the emitter clogging distribution shows after five years of sdi operation slight 70 1 8 41 and partial clogged 20 0 6 99 emitters were the main cause declined the sugarcane sdi dra and cu fig 2b these results were much consistent with previous study of li et al 2008 where after 2 years of sdi operation slight clogging accounted for 2 7 reduced the emitter outflow for more than 25 in addition 4 5 2 12 of complete clogged emitters fig 2b were found after 5 year of operation the physical chemical and biological fouling were occurred simultaneously resulting in composite clogging in sugarcane sdi this could be attributed to the complex composition of surface water which contains minerals ca2 mg2 colloidal particles sio2 precipitates si and microorganisms muhammad et al 2022 zhangzhong et al 2018 the content of silicates were found predominant when compared with precipitates and biological fouling among silicates a higher quantity of kaolinites 44 4 63 6 which is a clay mineral was found and its chemical composition was homogeneous with the soil kaolinites was might be inhaled from the external soil with the sdi external negative pressure these results were opposite with the conclusions of zhou et al 2018 and li et al 2019 where the calcium magnesium carbonate were the key clogging substances in emitter flow channels using the reclaimed water yellow river water brackish water and their mixed water this was mainly due to difference between testing platform drip irrigation system and field sdi systems furthermore calcium silica clogging was also found dominant 32 4 13 7 in emitter clogging bozkurt ozekici 2006 reported ca and sulfate containing fertilizer would significantly aggravate emitter clogging vpa and spearman results quantitatively demonstrated the potential interactions among precipitate particulates and biofouling fig 6a b the ternary interactions among precipitates particulates and biofouling contributed 46 1 which suggested the synergistic impacts of clogging on system performance vieira and melo 1995 postulated the inorganic particles colloidal matter and sand could act as ideal sites for biological activity increasing the mechanical strength and biomass accumulation biofilm matrix could also help entrap inorganic ions and precipitates which made clogging more severe tijing et al 2015 besides biofilms usually contained high densities of ionizable functional groups e g hydroxy carboxy amide that easily triggered the adsorption capacities to metal ions and serve as the nucleation sites for precipitation beech and cheung 1995 mccutcheon et al 2016 the binary interactions of precipitates and particulates were relatively high contributing 26 6 to the dra decline these results were consistent with the significant correlations between precipitates and particulates reported by ma et al 2020 and li et al 2019 despite the physical depositions of colloidal matter in surface water chemical reactions could also form silicates such as magnesium silicate mgo3si calcium silicate ca2o4si lioliou et al 2007 as caco3 provide nucleation sites to form silicates in addition li and webb 2000 reported precipitate crystal clusters created irregular patterns which promoted the cavities on scale surfaces increasing the deposition of suspended particles therefore controlling the caco3 scaling would indirectly reduce the content of silicates besides the interactions among particulates biofilm could be due to biofilm matrix that are actively responsible for suspended particles sticking efficiency xiao et al 2020 therefore this study suggested that the interactions among the different clogging would result in even worse emitter clogging 4 3 practical implications following the current water fertigation schedules and operation management in this study the chemical physical biofouling and root intrusion occurred simultaneously in sugarcane sdi system after five years of operation slight and partial clogging were the main cause of emitter clogging chemical cleaning agents i e acidification and chlorination are usually available for clogging control hao et al 2018 song et al 2017 acid injection used to lower the water ph to 4 5 hao et al 2018 effectively control the precipitation however in this study a high quantity of kaolinite silicates was found in emitters which might be inhaled from the external red soil of planting area therefore in order avoid this issue it is strongly recommended to improve the emitter design properties such as using the non pressure compensating emitters with check valve the check valve seals off the emitters when the system is shut off reducing the water draining from sdi laterals and remaining the laterals fully charged this technique is also beneficial to save additional water fertilizer and other chemical applications to the agricultural lands moreover it reduces the energy consumption required for filling the drip laterals in the next irrigation event root intrusion was not the primary factor to decline sugarcane sdi performance as mentioned earlier in section 4 1 however previous studies such as coelho and faria 2003 found serious root issue in other crops therefore proper prevention measures are needed generally the roots intrusion is prevented by treating it with trifluralin and copper compounds schifris et al 2015 sheval et al 2008 however these herbicide and algaecides application carried potential risks to the environmental ecological and human health ahemad and khan 2009 thus we strongly suggest emitter design with physical root barrier such as large filtration bath area in conclusion following the clogging standard presented by the iso tc23 sc 2022 and china s industrial standard sl 103 1995 sdi could achieved cu i above the 75 or 80 with reasonable maintenance practices that would allow stable operation of sdi system for 6 8 years although couple of meaningful findings were acquired in this study to greater insight on sdi long term successful field operation research needs to carry out on different emitter types having different structural parameters and different irrigation water quality e g wastewater surface brackish water and saline water in sdi to further investigate the universality of these results and more suitable operation of sdi 5 conclusion overall performance average relative outflow dra and irrigation coefficient of uniformity cu of a subsurface drip irrigation sdi system decreased by less 25 during growth period of sugarcane which is acceptable as per iso 9261 2004 norms slight clogging 30 72 followed by partial clogging 20 with precipitates particulates and biofilm were the most prevalent in clogging of emitters root intrusion was observed in 92 4 and 99 7 of the severely clogged and completely clogged emitters respectively but contributed less 5 0 of total emitter clogging of sdi mineral

225 emitters in each sub plot were selected following a complete randomized pattern to test the emitter outflow fig s5 the outflow of first 200 emitters of sdi laterals were tested and the outflow collected for 5 min the distribution of cd of each emitter was calculated by dividing a single emitter s tested outflow by its initial outflow the percentages of cd were then assigned to a predetermined range and the number of emitters within different percentage ranges was then tabulated giving the proportion of emitters within each range these ranges were in agreement with the

key bacteria with fouling components 3 results 3 1 sdi performance emitter clogging and root intrusion the general profile of sdi performance such as single emitter discharge distribution of single emitter cd the dra and cu as well as the characteristics of root intrusion are depicted in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively emitter discharge decreased with the sdi operation time fig 2a indicated the sdi emitters cd was increased gradually the sdi system performance indices decreased with operating years i e dra 94 4 95 7 90 9 92 5 86 4 88 6 83 1 85 8 77 5 79 6 cu 93 7 94 3 90 6 92 0 87 1 89 6 86 8 89

slight clogging and partial clogging were the predominant clogging fig 2b the number of severe clogged emitters increased noticeably particularly in the tail parts of laterals furthermore a total of 2135 emitters were carefully peeled off maintaining safe their internal structure as far as possible as shown in fig 3 the results showed that sugarcane roots invaded the sdi emitters outlet basins flow channel and even the inlet grid root intrusion was found in averaged 92 4 of severe clogged emitters and 99 7 of complete clogged emitters root intrusion contributed less 5 0 to total emitter clogging which explained the decline of sugarcane sdi dra and cu 3 2 variation of sdi emitter clogging dry weight and chemical components the variation of emitter clogging dw and chemical components with respect to sdi operating years are shown in fig 4 the x ray diffraction analysis showed silica sio2 calcite caco3 dolomite camgco3 chlorite serpentine mg al 6 si al 4o10 oh 8 kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 gibbsite al oh 3 and iron trioxide fe2o3 were the key mineral components in emitter clogging dw overall the variation of clogging dw and mineral components presented significant p 0 05 positive linear correlations with the sdi operating years the total dw was continuously increased ranging from 467 6 0 22 971 6 0 41 mg in five years fig 4c generally the mineral components were divided in three groups according to their chemical components including silica silicates and carbonate precipitates fig 4b both silicate and carbonate contents increased gradually with sdi operating years but silica showed an oscillatory trend the contents of silica silicates and carbonates during the sdy1 sdy5 ranged 10 7 32 4 48 5 67 1 and 5 13 13 7 respectively within the precipitates calcite and dolomite were the predominant minerals reaching 0 71 1 42 and 2 30 6 36 of total dw on the other hand kaolinite 44 4 63 6 fig 4i and chlorite serpentine 4 9 10 9 fig 4h and gibbsite 1 09 6 46 fig 4j were the predominant silicates minerals 3 3 variation and composition of sdi biological fouling microbial communities composition and variation of microbial communities were investigated by high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing samples obtained 1705 984 high quality reads from all five treatments the rarefaction lines fig s7 demonstrated the sequence depths were sufficient total otus of

p 0 05 different finally the microbial diversities were significantly p 0 05 increased reaching 1947 3 1999 2 during sdy5 taxonomic assignments of the identified otus indicated a different composition of taxa at phylum and genus levels a total of 37 phyla were identified in fouling substances proteobacteria 31 6 47 3 actinobacteria 21 5 45 1 firmicutes 3 31 22 1 bacteroidetes 1 07 6 26 and planctomycetes 0 76 3 30 were the dominant phylum fig 5d on other side pseudomonas 9 73 23 7 massilia 3 44 22 1 pseudarthrobacter 3 44 17 55 and others 39 6 60 8 were highly abundant in genus level fig 5e non metric dimensional scaling nmds analysis was applied to assess the dissimilarities of microbial communities among different operating years nmds visualized the differences in microbial

using the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method fig s8 the lefse results indicated that a total of 30 bacteria clades were observed significantly different at lda threshold of 3 5 as shown in the lefse cladogram the p firmicutes and g massilia were the largest biomarker among all treatments according to the lda score 5 clades were enriched in sdy 1 8 clades in sdy 2 8 in sdy 3 5 in sdy 4 and 4 in sdy 5 3 4 interaction of sdi physical chemical and biological fouling this study also conducted statistical analysis aimed to understand the correlation among multi type fouling substances fig 6 the spearmen s correlation results indicated more than 44 of significant correlations were found among precipitates particulate and biofouling these results were further evidenced by variance portioning analysis vpa whereas the ternary correlation among precipitates particulates and biofouling showed a higher contribution of 46 1 followed by the binary correlation precipitates and particulates which contributed 26 6 to decline the system dra the relative contribution of individual foulants including particulates precipitates and biofilm were 9 47 0 32 and 0 81 respectively to decline the system dra 4 discussion 4 1 roots intrusion and emitter clogging in sdi systems sdi technology could significantly save irrigation water while maintaining satisfactory production robles et al 2016 and prevent aerosol release to plants and environment liu et al 2021 emitter clogging however greatly affected the effective management and secure operation of sdi at field levels this study experimentally analyzed the emitter clogging issue in five year operational sugarcane sdi system our results demonstrated the cd of sdi gradually increased with number of operating years which caused the decreased of sdi performance yielding smaller dra and cu fig 2 previous studies postulated root intrusion in emitters posed a serious threat to the long term success of sdi systems de jesus souza et al 2014 suarez rey et al 2006 ruskin 1994 after several years of sdi research and observation concluded the number of clogged emitters due to root intrusion could reach 60 after 4 years operation coelho and faria 2003 reported root intrusion in 14 emitters types after 330 days of citrus and coffee plant experiments however present study obtained different results root intrusion in sugarcane sdi emitters were only found in 92 4 and 99 7 of severe and complete clogged emitters which accounted for 4 8 of total emitter clogging emitters the linear correlation analysis showed nonsignificant correlation between sdi performance dra and cu and the percentage of severe and complete clogging fig s9 the differences was might be due to different crops and field conditions the dynamics of sugarcane root distribution fig 7 demonstrated that the highest root volume of sugarcane was obtained at depth of 0 20 cm at 15 cm horizontal distance reaching 3 3 cm3 which was 25 4 35 7 higher when compared with 30 40 cm depth sugarcane root growth shows a large spatial variation toward soil surface 45 and 135 rather than the soil vertical depth 90 in guangxi the area has a subtropical monsoon climate with abundant water resources with the average annual precipitation ranging from 1300 to 1500 mm peng et al 2013 thus the soil water content was also higher at the upper soil layers which also affected the pattern of root distribution laclau and laclau 2009 therefore based on results of this study the root intrusion was not the primary factor to define the decline of dra and cu of sugarcane sdi systems fig 2 4 2 sdi emitter multi type fouling and potential interactions the emitter clogging distribution shows after five years of sdi operation slight 70 1 8 41 and partial clogged 20 0 6 99 emitters were the main cause declined the sugarcane sdi dra and cu fig 2b these results were much consistent with previous study of li et al 2008 where after 2 years of sdi operation slight clogging accounted for 2 7 reduced the emitter outflow for more than 25 in addition 4 5 2 12 of complete clogged emitters fig 2b were found after 5 year of operation the physical chemical and biological fouling were occurred simultaneously resulting in composite clogging in sugarcane sdi this could be attributed to the complex composition of surface water which contains minerals ca2 mg2 colloidal particles sio2 precipitates si and microorganisms muhammad et al 2022 zhangzhong et al 2018 the content of silicates were found predominant when compared with precipitates and biological fouling among silicates a higher quantity of kaolinites 44 4 63 6 which is a clay mineral was found and its chemical composition was homogeneous with the soil kaolinites was might be inhaled from the external soil with the sdi external negative pressure these results were opposite with the conclusions of zhou et al 2018 and li et al 2019 where the calcium magnesium carbonate were the key clogging substances in emitter flow channels using the reclaimed water yellow river water brackish water and their mixed water this was mainly due to difference between testing platform drip irrigation system and field sdi systems furthermore calcium silica clogging was also found dominant 32 4 13 7 in emitter clogging bozkurt ozekici 2006 reported ca and sulfate containing fertilizer would significantly aggravate emitter clogging vpa and spearman results quantitatively demonstrated the potential interactions among precipitate particulates and biofouling fig 6a b the ternary interactions among precipitates particulates and biofouling contributed 46 1 which suggested the synergistic impacts of clogging on system performance vieira and melo 1995 postulated the inorganic particles colloidal matter and sand could act as ideal sites for biological activity increasing the mechanical strength and biomass accumulation biofilm matrix could also help entrap inorganic ions and precipitates which made clogging more severe tijing et al 2015 besides biofilms usually contained high densities of ionizable functional groups e g hydroxy carboxy amide that easily triggered the adsorption capacities to metal ions and serve as the nucleation sites for precipitation beech and cheung 1995 mccutcheon et al 2016 the binary interactions of precipitates and particulates were relatively high contributing 26 6 to the dra decline these results were consistent with the significant correlations between precipitates and particulates reported by ma et al 2020 and li et al 2019 despite the physical depositions of colloidal matter in surface water chemical reactions could also form silicates such as magnesium silicate mgo3si calcium silicate ca2o4si lioliou et al 2007 as caco3 provide nucleation sites to form silicates in addition li and webb 2000 reported precipitate crystal clusters created irregular patterns which promoted the cavities on scale surfaces increasing the deposition of suspended particles therefore controlling the caco3 scaling would indirectly reduce the content of silicates besides the interactions among particulates biofilm could be due to biofilm matrix that are actively responsible for suspended particles sticking efficiency xiao et al 2020 therefore this study suggested that the interactions among the different clogging would result in even worse emitter clogging 4 3 practical implications following the current water fertigation schedules and operation management in this study the chemical physical biofouling and root intrusion occurred simultaneously in sugarcane sdi system after five years of operation slight and partial clogging were the main cause of emitter clogging chemical cleaning agents i e acidification and chlorination are usually available for clogging control hao et al 2018 song et al 2017 acid injection used to lower the water ph to 4 5 hao et al 2018 effectively control the precipitation however in this study a high quantity of kaolinite silicates was found in emitters which might be inhaled from the external red soil of planting area therefore in order avoid this issue it is strongly recommended to improve the emitter design properties such as using the non pressure compensating emitters with check valve the check valve seals off the emitters when the system is shut off reducing the water draining from sdi laterals and remaining the laterals fully charged this technique is also beneficial to save additional water fertilizer and other chemical applications to the agricultural lands moreover it reduces the energy consumption required for filling the drip laterals in the next irrigation event root intrusion was not the primary factor to decline sugarcane sdi performance as mentioned earlier in section 4 1 however previous studies such as coelho and faria 2003 found serious root issue in other crops therefore proper prevention measures are needed generally the roots intrusion is prevented by treating it with trifluralin and copper compounds schifris et al 2015 sheval et al 2008 however these herbicide and algaecides application carried potential risks to the environmental ecological and human health ahemad and khan 2009 thus we strongly suggest emitter design with physical root barrier such as large filtration bath area in conclusion following the clogging standard presented by the iso tc23 sc 2022 and china s industrial standard sl 103 1995 sdi could achieved cu i above the 75 or 80 with reasonable maintenance practices that would allow stable operation of sdi system for 6 8 years although couple of meaningful findings were acquired in this study to greater insight on sdi long term successful field operation research needs to carry out on different emitter types having different structural parameters and different irrigation water quality e g wastewater surface brackish water and saline water in sdi to further investigate the universality of these results and more suitable operation of sdi 5 conclusion overall performance average relative outflow dra and irrigation coefficient of uniformity cu of a subsurface drip irrigation sdi system decreased by less 25 during growth period of sugarcane which is acceptable as per iso 9261 2004 norms slight clogging 30 72 followed by partial clogging 20 with precipitates particulates and biofilm were the most prevalent in clogging of emitters root intrusion was observed in 92 4 and 99 7 of the severely clogged and completely clogged emitters respectively but contributed less 5 0 of total emitter clogging of sdi mineral components increased with time r 0 87 silicates kaolinite 44 4 63 6 and chlorite serpentine 4 9 10 9 and gibbsite 1 09 6 46 were the predominant constituents dominant otus were proteobacteria 31 6 47
