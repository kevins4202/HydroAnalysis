16675,membrane capacitive deionization mcdi is an emerging electric field driven technology for brackish water desalination involving the removal of charged ions from saline source waters while the desalination performance of mcdi under different operational modes has been widely investigated most studies have concentrated on different charging conditions without considering discharging conditions in this study we investigate the effects of different discharging conditions on the desalination performance of mcdi electrode our study demonstrates that low current discharge 1 0 ma cm2 can increase salt removal by 20 and decrease volumetric energy consumption by 40 by improving electrode regeneration and increasing energy recovery respectively while high current discharge 3 0 ma cm2 can improve productivity by 70 at the expense of electrode regeneration and energy recovery whether discharging electrodes at the low current or high current is optimal depends on a trade off between productivity and energy consumption we also reveal that stopped flow discharge 85 can achieve higher water recovery than continuous flow discharge 35 59 however stopped flow discharge caused a 20 30 decrease in concentration reduction and a 25 50 increase in molar energy consumption possibly due to the higher ion concentration in the macropores at the end of discharging step these results reveal that an optimal discharging operation should be obtained from achieving a balance among productivity water recovery and energy consumption by varying discharging current and flow rate graphical

as a result of economic development population growth and climate change distefano and kelly 2017 greve et al 2018 most populations worldwide suffer from water shortage with 4 billion people facing severe water scarcity at least 1 month in a year and half a billion people living with severe water scarcity over the whole year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 as a result a variety of desalination technologies have been developed to produce freshwater from seawater or brackish water such as reverse osmosis ro qasim et al 2019 electrodialysis ed al amshawee et al 2020 membrane distillation md zhang et al 2015 and capacitive deionization cdi porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 conventional desalination technologies including ed and md requiring high capital cost and energy consumption cannot compete with ro which is the main technology for seawater desalination lin 2019 qasim et al 2019 however fouling and high pressure limit the application of ro especially when being used to treat high hardness waters because frequent ro membrane replacement and the need for use of high pressure pumps raise the capital and operational cost goh et al 2019 kim et al 2019 park et al 2020 membrane capacitive deionization mcdi is an emerging desalination technology for brackish water desalination and ion selective removal and recovery xing et al 2020 choi et al 2019 lee et al 2006 in mcdi ions are removed from feedwater under electrostatic force and temporarily stored in electrical double layers edls followed by electrode regeneration either by short circuiting the electrodes or applying a reverse potential suss et al 2015 almarzooqi et al 2014 porada et al 2013 compared with cdi mcdi is developed by placing ion exchange membranes at the surface of the electrodes in order to prevent co ion repulsion and allow reverse current desorption biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 kim and choi 2010 tang et al 2019 with ion exchange membranes mcdi can achieve higher salt adsorption and charge efficiency than cdi zhao et al 2012 kim and choi 2010 mcdi exhibits similar energy efficiency to ro when desalinating low salinity feedwater with low intrinsic energy for separation wang et al 2019 lin 2019 porada et al 2020 mcdi desalination performance will be largely affected by operational conditions such as use of constant current cc or constant voltage cv mode input current voltage flowrate etc extensive comparison of energy consumption between cc and cv modes has been undertaken with most of the results indicating that the cc charging mode is more energy efficient than the cv charging mode kang et al 2014 choi 2014 qu et al 2016 however kang et al 2014 and choi 2014 compared these two operational modes without maintaining identical desalination objectives or target adsorption while qu et al 2016 conducted the comparison by maintaining the same input charge and charging duration a fairer comparison was performed in two recent studies where an identical desalination objective was applied wang and lin 2018 demonstrated that it is the target adsorption average dilute solution salinity and dilute solution volume determining whether cc or cv is more energy efficient however dykstra et al 2018 showed that less energy is consumed by operation in cc mode with 50 energy recovery at the same salinity reduction and water recovery while similar energy is consumed when cc and cv modes are used without energy recovery from the studies mentioned above despite the discrepancies cc operation has a distinct advantage over cv operation with results of many studies indicating that a constant and controllable desalted effluent can be produced by adjusting charging current and flow rate zhao et al 2012 2013 qu et al 2016 wang and lin 2018 ramachandran et al 2018 for example ramachandran et al 2018 examined the effect of varying flow rate current and voltage thresholds on effluent dynamics in cc mode and showed that increasing the flowrate to current ratio resulted in better cycle efficiency productivity and volumetric energy consumption but poorer average concentration reduction also cc operation particularly when the electrodes are discharged by reversing the current provides the opportunity for energy recovery during discharge dlugolecki and van der wal 2013 chen et al 2018 tan et al 2020 however most studies of m cdi operation mode have been focused on varying charging conditions such as charging current or voltage and flow rate while the effects of discharge conditions on the charging stage have only been considered in a few cases for example zhao et al 2013 showed that increasing the discharging current density for an mcdi unit operated in cc mode resulted in decreased salt adsorption and charging time but increased water recovery however chen et al 2018 reported that similar salt adsorption and charging time were achieved with different discharging currents although the decrease of discharging current increased the discharging time and improved electrode regeneration ramachandran et al 2019 studied the effect of discharging flow rate on cdi desalination performance and showed that using a discharging flow rate lower than the charging flow rate resulted in an increase in water recovery volumetric energy consumption average concentration reduction and charge efficiency a high water recovery 87 was also achieved by using stopped flow discharge in a pilot scale mcdi test with the discharge flow rate set at 0 ml min tan et al 2020 the extent of adsorption of ions that can be achieved is generally determined by the charging current density flow rate and charging voltage window while the volume of effluent is controlled by charging time at a fixed charging current and flow rate when a certain value of effluent salinity is achieved a longer charging duration results in a larger volume of effluent in one cycle and less frequent switching between charging and discharging stages which is important in practice as frequent switching is likely to reduce the lifetime of the valves in the system tan et al 2020 it has been reported that charging time can be increased at constant charging conditions by changing the discharging conditions such as discharging current flow rate and voltage window zhao et al 2013 tan et al 2020 ramachandran et al 2019 however an increase of charging time does not necessarily increase water recovery if identical charging current and discharging current but flowing in opposite directions is applied with this arrangement resulting in a water recovery of 50 tan et al 2020 ramachandran et al 2019 water recovery could be increased to a value larger than 50 by decreasing the discharging duration or volume of brine with these outcomes achievable by changing discharging current or flow rate respectively therefore investigating how the variation of discharging conditions affects the charging stage is necessary since it could provide valuable insights into the optimization of mcdi operation as charging current and flow rate during the charging stage are generally unchanged when seeking to obtain an effluent with a certain salinity in this work an investigation was carried out to identify the effects of various discharging operations on the desalination performance at the charging stage specifically the charging current and flow rate were fixed in order to achieve a certain target adsorption while discharging current was changed under both continuous flow cf and stopped flow sf discharge operation with a much higher water recovery achieved by setting the discharge flow rate at zero fig 1 how different discharging conditions affect the charging stage was assessed by analyzing the variations of voltage our findings indicate that the open circuit voltage ocv which is the voltage measured without applied current after charging or discharging is indicative of the quantity of ions residing in the micropores of the electrodes therefore the degree to which the electrodes have been regenerated can be evaluated by measuring the ocv after discharge the mcdi performance at different discharging conditions was evaluated using the standardized performance metrics suggested by hawks et al 2019 the results of this investigation provide important insights into optimization of mcdi operation in engineering practice 2 materials

concentrations of dilute and brine streams are shown in fig 2 for a feed stream with salt concentration of 21 5 mm at different discharging current densities and discharging modes i e continuous flow cf and stopped flow sf discharging the concentration of the dilute stream was constant at different discharging current densities for both cf and sf modes as expected as theses parameters are mainly controlled by charging current and flow rate which were identical for all tests fig 2 however the choice of desorption current significantly affected the concentration of the brine and the voltage profiles during the discharge step figs 2 and s2 the concentration of the brine under cf mode increased by 25 when discharging current density increased from 1 0 to 3 0 ma cm2 fig 2 for the voltage response shown in fig s2b the voltage increased at a similar rate during the charging phase for both cf and sf but decreased more rapidly at larger discharging current densities it is worth noting that the open circuit voltage during standby stage 2 at the end of discharge which was also the charge start voltage of the next charge discharge cycle was higher with increasing desorption current the concentration of the brine stream with sf mode 35 45 mm was nearly two times higher than that with cf mode 20 30 mm the rate of decrease of voltage during the discharging stage was slower for sf mode than cf mode fig s2b also the open circuit voltage at the end of standby stage 2 following discharge in sf mode was lower than that in cf mode at the same discharging current density fig s2b the variation of voltage at different discharging current densities and with different discharging modes will be discussed in detail in section 3 1 2 the duration of a full cycle and each stage during the cycle changed with different desorption current densities and discharging modes as shown in fig 3 in agreement with the findings of zhao et al 2013 and chen et al 2018 the total cycle time and desorption time decreased with increasing desorption current for both cf and sf mode although charging duration also slightly decreased as the desorption current increased the decrease was less significant compared with discharging durations thus resulting in a larger proportion of the cycle time being used for adsorption fig s3 for instance the discharging time decreased by about 72 when discharging current density increased from 1 0 to 3 0 ma cm2 with cf mode while the charging time only decreased by around 16 fig 3 in addition because the standby time was set at a fixed value to flush the remaining dilute water or brine out of the spacer the proportion of cycle time spent in standby stage increased as the total cycle time decreased fig s3 the longer charging time and cycle time at lower discharging current resulted in less frequent transitions between charge and discharge stages with this likely to contribute to an increase in the lifespan of valves tan et al 2020 however a larger proportion of the total cycle time is used for desorption with lower discharging current reducing the proportion of charging duration and thus the overall water productivity discussed in section 3 2 compared with operation in cf mode the duration of each stage except for the standby stage was longer at all desorption currents for sf mode fig 3 this effect was more pronounced at higher discharging current densities for instance charging and discharging times with sf mode were 17 2 and 19 6 longer than those with cf mode at 3 0 ma cm2 respectively while they increased by only 13 1 and 14 5 at 1 0 ma cm2 the reason for the difference in charging time and discharging time for various discharging currents and between cf and sf modes will be discussed in section 3 1 2 3 1 2 charge discharge start voltage voltage jump drop and rate of change of voltage to explain the difference in charging time and discharging time the voltage response was analyzed in detail by extracting charge discharge start voltage voltage jump drop and rate of change of voltage from fig s2b the variation of voltage with a charging and discharging current density of 2 ma cm2 for cf mode is plotted in fig 4 as an example of how the voltage values and rate of change of voltage during the charging and discharging stages shown in fig 5 a and 5b respectively were obtained as shown in fig 4 the charge start voltage was obtained by measuring the open circuit voltage at the termination of standby stage 2 in the previous cycle a voltage jump occurs when charging current is applied the voltage then increases monotonically to 1 4 v where the charging stage ends followed by a 25 s standby stage where no current is applied the discharge start voltage was measured at the final time point of standby stage 1 as can be seen in fig 4 the discharging stage commences with a voltage drop occurring at the instant the discharge current is applied the voltage subsequently decreases slowly to 0 v as the discharging stage progresses and is followed by the second standby stage during which the brine stream is flushed from the system the average rate of change of charging and discharging voltages are calculated using eqs 12 and 13 respectively 12 rate of change of charging voltage mv s 1 4 v charge start voltage charging time 13 rate of change of discharging voltage mv s discharge start voltage 0 v discharging time as shown in fig 5 a the charge start voltage in cf mode is observed to increase with increasing discharging current density rising from 0 174 v at 1 ma cm2 to 0 410 v at 3 ma cm2 there are differences in the voltage jump in cf mode at various discharging currents with the largest difference less than 0 1 v similar rate of change of charging voltage was observed at different discharging current densities for cf mode fig 5 a the charge start voltage voltage jump and rate of change of charging voltage with sf mode showed similar trends to that for cf mode fig 5 a therefore it can be concluded that the decrease of charging time with increasing discharging current for both cf and sf modes mainly results from the increase of the charge start voltage the voltage jump and rate of change of charging voltage was found similar when electrode discharge at different currents this is possibly because the voltage jump at the beginning of charge and the rate of change of charging voltage were affected by charging current density and intrinsic properties of the electrode such as the ohmic resistance or series resistance and ion electro sorption rate dlugolecki and van der wal 2013 hemmatifar et al 2016 chen et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 a the charge start voltage is affected by the discharging current density the charge discharge start voltage which is the cell voltage when no current is applied can be used as an indicator of the charge remaining in the electrode pair with this charge neutralized by anions or cations therefore the charge discharge start voltage without applied current indirectly provides a measure of the ion concentration in the micropores of the electrodes after charge or discharge the higher charge start voltage may result from a less efficient electrode regeneration at higher discharging current which caused a decrease in the duration of the charging stage fig 3 if energy recovery is used this inefficient regeneration at a higher discharging current could be related to the larger energy loss during the discharging stage such that less energy would be used for electrode regeneration chen et al 2018 kang et al 2016 compared with cf discharging mode the lower charge start voltage for sf mode revealed that the electrodes can be regenerated more efficiently in sf mode fig 5 a this lower charge start voltage can be attributed to the decrease of resistance in the spacer channel in sf mode due to the higher salt concentration in the mcdi spacer channel during the discharge stage in sf mode fig 2 ramachandran et al 2019 tan et al 2020 recognizing that the resistance of a mcdi cell is mainly located in the spacer channel dykstra et al 2016 higher current resulted in larger energy loss as such the difference of charge start voltage between cf and sf modes became larger at higher discharging current as shown in fig 5 b the discharge start voltage in cf mode was constant at different discharging current densities while the voltage drop increased from 0 057 v at 1 ma cm2 to 0 165 v at 3 ma cm2 the rate of change of discharging voltage in cf mode increased significantly from 2 459 mv s at 1 ma cm2 to 8 129 mv s at 3 ma cm2 fig 5 b the increase of voltage drop was due to the threefold increase of the ohmic voltage drop with increasing discharging current density the discharge start voltage voltage drop and rate of the decrease of discharging voltage in sf mode showed similar trends to that in cf mode therefore it can be concluded that the shorter discharging time with increasing discharging current for both cf and sf modes resulted mainly from the increase of voltage drop and the faster decrease in discharging voltage the inefficient electrode regeneration at larger discharging current density may relate to the increase of the ohmic voltage drop caused by the higher discharging current and therefore the larger power dissipation it is worth noting that the difference in rate of change of discharging voltage between cf and sf modes increased with increasing discharging current density possibly as a result of the lower ionic resistance in the spacer channel with sf discharging mode 3 2 productivity concentration reduction and water recovery the influence of different discharging current densities for both cf and sf operational modes on productivity eq 1 and concentration reduction eq 4 is shown in fig 6 the productivity increased by 68 and 70 when the discharging current density increased from 1 0 to 3 0 ma cm2 for cf and sf modes respectively with this attributed to the significant reduction of discharging time and therefore the increasing proportion of charging time figs 3 and s3 at each discharging current density the productivity for sf operation was 10 lower than that with cf operation which is in agreement with tan et al 2020 who also reported lower daily production with sf mode than cf mode according to eq 1 the productivity for an mcdi stack is determined by the volume of dilute water and cycle time discharging in sf mode resulted in a longer cycle time fig 3 but produced a similar amount of product water fig s4 which resulted in a lower productivity it is worth noting that sf operation prolonged the charging time but only slightly increased the volume of product water compared with operation in cf discharging mode for instance discharging the electrode in sf mode resulted in an 14 increase in charging time fig 3 while the volume of product water only increased by 5 fig s4 as shown in fig s2 the charging stage in sf mode started at an influent concentration higher than feed concentration a certain amount of charging time was used to diluting brine rather than producing dilute water resulting in a lower productivity with sf discharge than cf discharge a possible reason for this phenomenon was the higher ion concentration in the macropores at the start of the charging stage due to the more highly concentrated brine produced in sf mode ion desorption during the discharging stage involves the transport of ions from micropores in the carbon particles to the macropores outside the particles followed by the transport of ions from the macropores to the spacer channel fig 7 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 according to the modified improved donnan model i md the ion concentration in the macropores is equal to the concentration in the spacer channel biesheuvel et al 2014 kim et al 2015 dykstra et al 2016 compared with continuous flow discharge a higher ion concentration was expected to exist in the macropores and spacer during stopped flow discharging porada et al 2020 during standby stage 2 although it took only a few seconds to flush the brine out of the spacer the transport of ions in the macropores to the spacer channel by crossing the ion exchange membranes was only driven by the concentration gradient it is expected that the ion concentration in the macropores for sf operation was larger than that in cf mode at the beginning of charge when the same standby stage duration was applied with this hypothesis supported by the higher effluent concentration at the start of charging with sf mode fig 2 the concentration reduction eq 4 did not change significantly at different discharging current density for cf or sf modes due to identical charging current and flow rate however the reduction in concentration was approximately 20 30 larger in cf mode than sf mode at each discharging current density when the electrodes were discharged in cf mode as shown in fig s2 the effluent concentration during the charging stage quickly reached an equilibrium concentration in cf mode while the effluent concentration decreased slowly after a sf discharging stage this can be attributed to the higher salt concentration in the macropores after the sf discharging operation additional ions in the macropore needed to be re adsorbed onto the electrode causing the slow decrease of effluent concentration during the charging stage in agreement with the study by zhao et al 2013 the water recovery defined in eq 2 increased from 35 at 1 0 ma cm2 to 59 at 3 0 ma cm2 for cf mode as a result of the significant decrease in the discharging duration fig 3 and therefore a decrease in the volume of brine fig s4 however the water recovery in sf mode at different discharging currents remained at approximately 85 which was significantly larger than that achieved when operating in cf mode a distinct advantage of sf discharge over cf discharge was the low brine volume produced over each cycle fig s4 as a result of the zero flow rate during the discharging stage ramachandran et al 2019 tan et al 2020 chen et al 2019 3 3 molar energy consumption and volumetric energy consumption the effect of varying discharge currents on the molar energy consumption and volumetric energy consumption was analyzed under the assumption of 1 no energy recovery and 2 100 energy recovery in both cf and sf modes as shown in fig 8 without energy recovery the molar energy consumption em eq 7 in either cf or sf modes only varied within 10 at different charging current fig 8a however 25 45 more energy was consumed to remove one mole of salt in sf mode compared to cf mode the charge efficiency eq 11 of cf mode is 20 30 higher than that of sf mode fig s6 as shown in fig s5 and s6 the energy input and charge input for operation in sf mode were 5 10 higher than that required for operation in cf mode but the salt removal for operation in cf mode was 20 40 larger than that for sf mode at each discharging current density this resulted in higher molar energy consumption and lower charge efficiency for operation in sf mode than that for operation in cf mode the higher energy input and charge input required for operation in sf mode also resulted from the longer charging time in sf mode compared to that in cf mode fig 3 while the lower salt removal was attributed to the lower concentration reduction discussed in section 3 2 fig 6 additionally because the salinity of the effluent was higher than that of the feed at the beginning of the charging stage with sf mode decreasing the flow efficiency defined as the ratio of the amount of salts removed to the amount of salts adsorbed hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2019 the energy input and charge input were consumed to adsorb this additional salt without contributing to salt removal from the influent which reduced charge and energy efficiency as well as increased the molar energy consumption if 100 energy recovery is assumed the molar energy consumption decreased significantly by 50 70 compared to that without energy recovery fig 8a b the molar energy consumption increased by 50 and 18 on increasing discharging current density from 1 0 to 3 0 ma cm2 for cf and sf mode respectively fig 8b the increase of em can be attributed to the lower total recoverable energy with increasing discharging current which caused a 10 lower energy recovery at a discharging current density of 3 0 ma cm2 compared with that at 1 0 ma cm2 fig s5 when energy recovery was considered the difference of em between cf and sf modes was smaller for instance the em for sf mode at a discharging current density of 3 0 ma cm2 was 15 and 26 higher than that for cf mode with and without energy recovery respectively fig 8a b the smaller difference in em between these two modes can be attributed to the higher total recoverable energy and the higher energy recovery in sf discharging mode compared with cf discharging mode fig s5 similar results were reported for a system incorporating energy recovery with operation in sf discharging mode exhibiting larger specific energy consumption kj mol than observed for operation in cf discharging mode tan et al 2020 without energy recovery different discharging current densities increased the volumetric energy consumption ev by 7 for either cf or sf modes with increasing discharging current from 1 0 to 3 0 ma cm2 fig 8c this is because both the energy input fig s5 and the volume of dilute water produced in one cycle fig s4 decreased with increasing discharging current density cf and sf discharging operation showed similar values of volumetric energy consumption with this attributed to the similar increasing scale of energy input fig s5 and volume of product water fig s4 for operation in sf mode compared to that for operation in cf mode however when 100 energy recovery was assumed the volumetric energy consumption increased by 40 and 30 for cf and sf modes respectively when discharging current increased from 1 0 to 3 0 ma cm2 fig 8d this is attributed to the lower energy recovery with the increase of discharging current fig s5 the energy recovery for sf mode was higher than that for cf mode fig s5 which resulted from the higher ion concentration in the macropores and spacer and thus the lower ionic resistance compared with that in cf mode the contribution of the lower ionic resistance in sf mode was more apparent at higher discharging current with the energy recovery in sf mode higher than that in cf mode when discharging current density was larger than 2 0 ma cm2 fig s5 with this resulting in a 3 lower ev in sf mode than that in cf fig 8d 3 4 discussion from the results reported above the discharging conditions can affect desalination performance of mcdi process even remains same charging condition specifically higher current discharge 3 0 ma cm2 can increase productivity by 70 at the expense of electrode regeneration and energy recovery while low current discharge 1 0 ma cm2 can improve energy recovery by 10 fig s5 and salt removal by 20 fig s6 since there is a trade off between productivity and energy consumption the optimum discharging current is often determined by the water treatment requirement for instance if the number of electrodes is sufficient to meet the productivity requirement low current discharge can be applied to prolong charging time and allow for higher energy recovery and greater salt adsorption in one cycle with this contributing to lower energy consumption and less frequent switching between the charge and discharge stages conversely if high productivity is required high current discharge is preferable as this leads to a shorter discharging time an energy recovery of 100 has been considered in this study in order to assess the best case in reality with electrode currents of 200a there will be significant additional ohmic losses and losses in the dc dc converter indeed tan et al 2020 reported that up to 40 of the energy can be dissipated in the converter and cables in a pilot scale mcdi unit tan et al 2020 as reported in this work and previous work by tan et al 2020 a higher water recovery up to 85 can be achieved by discharging in sf mode as a result of the greatly reduced brine volume unlike cf discharge the water recovery in sf mode does not change with discharging current which makes it possible to maintain a high water recovery when lowering the discharging current additionally electrode regeneration can be improved by using sf mode as indicated by the lower charge start voltage and longer charging time however the improved electrode regeneration did not contribute to higher production and larger salt removal in one cycle with productivity and concentration reduction being reduced by 10 and 37 respectively at each discharging current density consequently more energy is consumed during the charging stage in sf discharging mode compared to cf discharging mode but less salt is removed from the influent resulting in a lower energy efficiency as indicated by the larger molar energy consumption with or without energy recovery fig 8a b and lower charge efficiency fig s6 this shortcoming can be mitigated by prolonging the duration of standby stage 2 to allow the migration of ions from the macropores to the spacer as suggested by hawks et al 2018 as shown in fig s7 the effluent concentration at the beginning of the charging stage decreased with increasing duration of standby stage 2 with this contributing to the higher productivity and concentration reduction fig s8 the molar energy consumption fig s9 decreased and charge efficiency increased fig s11 due to the increase in salt removal fig s11 however the water recovery reduced with increasing standby stage duration as more brine is produced in one cycle fig s8 also increasing the duration of standby stage 2 to over 100 s cannot further increase concentration reduction and charge efficiency but rather results in a decreased in productivity therefore other approaches to solving this problem should be examined a possible method is to decrease the ionic resistance of the activated carbon electrodes as well as the ion exchange membrane to allow faster transport of ions from the macropores to the spacer channel the results obtained here demonstrate that varying discharging current density and flow rate can deliver different values of productivity water recovery and energy consumption during the charging stage these three parameters however cannot be improved simultaneously since there is a trade off between them as discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 as a result a balance should be achieved between these three parameters such that the optimal discharging operation can be obtained to maximize productivity and water recovery and minimize the energy consumption in engineering practice although our results provide insight into the relationship between different discharging operations and energy consumption during charging stage actual energy recovery during the discharging stage has not yet been applied with this expected to exert a large influence on the overall energy consumption kang et al 2016 chen et al 2019 oyarzun et al 2020 tan et al 2020 4 conclusion the effects of different discharging conditions on the charging performance in an mcdi process have been systematically examined in this work by discharging electrodes at different discharging currents for both continuous and stopped flow during discharge based on the results obtained we propose that the open circuit voltage of the electrode pair can be used as an indicator of the number of ions remaining in the micropores different discharging operations have been investigated and their effect on the charging stage probed by comprehensive analysis of voltage variations the results highlight the need for the optimization of operational parameters such as the discharge current magnitude necessary for a particular desalination requirement improved productivity is obtained with a higher current discharge as this decreases the discharge duration otherwise low current discharge can be used to improve energy recovery and lower energy consumption an optimum discharging current should be determined by considering the best trade off between productivity and energy consumption comparison between continuous flow and stopped flow discharge presented here reveal that operation in stopped flow mode is more desirable than operation in continuous flow mode due to its much higher water recovery 85 however the problem of lower concentration reduction and higher molar energy consumption for stopped flow discharge is an issue applying a longer standby stage duration when operated in stopped flow mode than that used in continuous flow mode may mitigate the problem despite the resultant decrease of productivity and water recovery the findings obtained in this study should contribute to the optimization in operation of the discharging stage in mcdi water treatment such that a balance between productivity water recovery and energy consumption is achieved such analyzes

16675,membrane capacitive deionization mcdi is an emerging electric field driven technology for brackish water desalination involving the removal of charged ions from saline source waters while the desalination performance of mcdi under different operational modes has been widely investigated most studies have concentrated on different charging conditions without considering discharging conditions in this study we investigate the effects of different discharging conditions on the desalination performance of mcdi electrode our study demonstrates that low current discharge 1 0 ma cm2 can increase salt removal by 20 and decrease volumetric energy consumption by 40 by improving electrode regeneration and increasing energy recovery respectively while high current discharge 3 0 ma cm2 can improve productivity by 70 at the expense of electrode regeneration and energy recovery whether discharging electrodes at the low current or high current is optimal depends on a trade off between productivity and energy consumption we also reveal that stopped flow discharge 85 can achieve higher water recovery than continuous flow discharge 35 59 however stopped flow discharge caused a 20 30 decrease in concentration reduction and a 25 50 increase in molar energy consumption possibly due to the higher ion concentration in the macropores at the end of discharging step these results reveal that an optimal discharging operation should be obtained from achieving a balance among productivity water recovery and energy consumption by varying discharging current and flow rate graphical

as a result of economic development population growth and climate change distefano and kelly 2017 greve et al 2018 most populations worldwide suffer from water shortage with 4 billion people facing severe water scarcity at least 1 month in a year and half a billion people living with severe water scarcity over the whole year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 as a result a variety of desalination technologies have been developed to produce freshwater from seawater or brackish water such as reverse osmosis ro qasim et al 2019 electrodialysis ed al amshawee et al 2020 membrane distillation md zhang et al 2015 and capacitive deionization cdi porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 conventional desalination technologies including ed and md requiring high capital cost and energy consumption cannot compete with ro which is the main technology for seawater desalination lin 2019 qasim et al 2019 however fouling and high pressure limit the application of ro especially when being used to treat high hardness waters because frequent ro membrane replacement and the need for use of high pressure pumps raise the capital and operational cost goh et al 2019 kim et al 2019 park et al 2020 membrane capacitive deionization mcdi is an emerging desalination technology for brackish water desalination and ion selective removal and recovery xing et al 2020 choi et al 2019 lee et al 2006 in mcdi ions are removed from feedwater under electrostatic force and temporarily stored in electrical double layers edls followed by electrode regeneration either by short circuiting the electrodes or applying a reverse potential suss et al 2015 almarzooqi et al 2014 porada et al 2013 compared with cdi mcdi is developed by placing ion exchange membranes at the surface of the electrodes in order to prevent co ion repulsion and allow reverse current desorption biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 kim and choi 2010 tang et al 2019 with ion exchange membranes mcdi can achieve higher salt adsorption and charge efficiency than cdi zhao et al 2012 kim and choi 2010 mcdi exhibits similar energy efficiency to ro when desalinating low salinity feedwater with low intrinsic energy for separation wang et al 2019 lin 2019 porada et al 2020 mcdi desalination performance will be largely affected by operational conditions such as use of constant current cc or constant voltage cv mode input current voltage flowrate etc extensive comparison of energy consumption between cc and cv modes has been undertaken with most of the results indicating that the cc charging mode is more energy efficient than the cv charging mode kang et al 2014 choi 2014 qu et al 2016 however kang et al 2014 and choi 2014 compared these two operational modes without maintaining identical desalination objectives or target adsorption while qu et al 2016 conducted the comparison by maintaining the same input charge and charging duration a fairer comparison was performed in two recent studies where an identical desalination objective was applied wang and lin 2018 demonstrated that it is the target adsorption average dilute solution salinity and dilute solution volume determining whether cc or cv is more energy efficient however dykstra et al 2018 showed that less energy is consumed by operation in cc mode with 50 energy recovery at the same salinity reduction and water recovery while similar energy is consumed when cc and cv modes are used without energy recovery from the studies mentioned above despite the discrepancies cc operation has a distinct advantage over cv operation with results of many studies indicating that a constant and controllable desalted effluent can be produced by adjusting charging current and flow rate zhao et al 2012 2013 qu et al 2016 wang and lin 2018 ramachandran et al 2018 for example ramachandran et al 2018 examined the effect of varying flow rate current and voltage thresholds on effluent dynamics in cc mode and showed that increasing the flowrate to current ratio resulted in better cycle efficiency productivity and volumetric energy consumption but poorer average concentration reduction also cc operation particularly when the electrodes are discharged by reversing the current provides the opportunity for energy recovery during discharge dlugolecki and van der wal 2013 chen et al 2018 tan et al 2020 however most studies of m cdi operation mode have been focused on varying charging conditions such as charging current or voltage and flow rate while the effects of discharge conditions on the charging stage have only been considered in a few cases for example zhao et al 2013 showed that increasing the discharging current density for an mcdi unit operated in cc mode resulted in decreased salt adsorption and charging time but increased water recovery however chen et al 2018 reported that similar salt adsorption and charging time were achieved with different discharging currents although the decrease of discharging current increased the discharging time and improved electrode regeneration ramachandran et al 2019 studied the effect of discharging flow rate on cdi desalination performance and showed that using a discharging flow rate lower than the charging flow rate resulted in an increase in water recovery volumetric energy consumption average concentration reduction and charge efficiency a high water recovery 87 was also achieved by using stopped flow discharge in a pilot scale mcdi test with the discharge flow rate set at 0 ml min tan et al 2020 the extent of adsorption of ions that can be achieved is generally determined by the charging current density flow rate and charging voltage window while the volume of effluent is controlled by charging time at a fixed charging current and flow rate when a certain value of effluent salinity is achieved a longer charging duration results in a larger volume of effluent in one cycle and less frequent switching between charging and discharging stages which is important in practice as frequent switching is likely to reduce the lifetime of the valves in the system tan et al 2020 it has been reported that charging time can be increased at constant charging conditions by changing the discharging conditions such as discharging current flow rate and voltage window zhao et al 2013 tan et al 2020 ramachandran et al 2019 however an increase of charging time does not necessarily increase water recovery if identical charging current and discharging current but flowing in opposite directions is applied with this arrangement resulting in a water recovery of 50 tan et al 2020 ramachandran et al 2019 water recovery could be increased to a value larger than 50 by decreasing the discharging duration or volume of brine with these outcomes achievable by changing discharging current or flow rate respectively therefore investigating how the variation of discharging conditions affects the charging stage is necessary since it could provide valuable insights into the optimization of mcdi operation as charging current and flow rate during the charging stage are generally unchanged when seeking to obtain an effluent with a certain salinity in this work an investigation was carried out to identify the effects of various discharging operations on the desalination performance at the charging stage specifically the charging current and flow rate were fixed in order to achieve a certain target adsorption while discharging current was changed under both continuous flow cf and stopped flow sf discharge operation with a much higher water recovery achieved by setting the discharge flow rate at zero fig 1 how different discharging conditions affect the charging stage was assessed by analyzing the variations of voltage our findings indicate that the open circuit voltage ocv which is the voltage measured without applied current after charging or discharging is indicative of the quantity of ions residing in the micropores of the electrodes therefore the degree to which the electrodes have been regenerated can be evaluated by measuring the ocv after discharge the mcdi performance at different discharging conditions was evaluated using the standardized performance metrics suggested by hawks et al 2019 the results of this investigation provide important insights into optimization of mcdi operation in engineering practice 2 materials

concentrations of dilute and brine streams are shown in fig 2 for a feed stream with salt concentration of 21 5 mm at different discharging current densities and discharging modes i e continuous flow cf and stopped flow sf discharging the concentration of the dilute stream was constant at different discharging current densities for both cf and sf modes as expected as theses parameters are mainly controlled by charging current and flow rate which were identical for all tests fig 2 however the choice of desorption current significantly affected the concentration of the brine and the voltage profiles during the discharge step figs 2 and s2 the concentration of the brine under cf mode increased by 25 when discharging current density increased from 1 0 to 3 0 ma cm2 fig 2 for the voltage response shown in fig s2b the voltage increased at a similar rate during the charging phase for both cf and sf but decreased more rapidly at larger discharging current densities it is worth noting that the open circuit voltage during standby stage 2 at the end of discharge which was also the charge start voltage of the next charge discharge cycle was higher with increasing desorption current the concentration of the brine stream with sf mode 35 45 mm was nearly two times higher than that with cf mode 20 30 mm the rate of decrease of voltage during the discharging stage was slower for sf mode than cf mode fig s2b also the open circuit voltage at the end of standby stage 2 following discharge in sf mode was lower than that in cf mode at the same discharging current density fig s2b the variation of voltage at different discharging current densities and with different discharging modes will be discussed in detail in section 3 1 2 the duration of a full cycle and each stage during the cycle changed with different desorption current densities and discharging modes as shown in fig 3 in agreement with the findings of zhao et al 2013 and chen et al 2018 the total cycle time and desorption time decreased with increasing desorption current for both cf and sf mode although charging duration also slightly decreased as the desorption current increased the decrease was less significant compared with discharging durations thus resulting in a larger proportion of the cycle time being used for adsorption fig s3 for instance the discharging time decreased by about 72 when discharging current density increased from 1 0 to 3 0 ma cm2 with cf mode while the charging time only decreased by around 16 fig 3 in addition because the standby time was set at a fixed value to flush the remaining dilute water or brine out of the spacer the proportion of cycle time spent in standby stage increased as the total cycle time decreased fig s3 the longer charging time and cycle time at lower discharging current resulted in less frequent transitions between charge and discharge stages with this likely to contribute to an increase in the lifespan of valves tan et al 2020 however a larger proportion of the total cycle time is used for desorption with lower discharging current reducing the proportion of charging duration and thus the overall water productivity discussed in section 3 2 compared with operation in cf mode the duration of each stage except for the standby stage was longer at all desorption currents for sf mode fig 3 this effect was more pronounced at higher discharging current densities for instance charging and discharging times with sf mode were 17 2 and 19 6 longer than those with cf mode at 3 0 ma cm2 respectively while they increased by only 13 1 and 14 5 at 1 0 ma cm2 the reason for the difference in charging time and discharging time for various discharging currents and between cf and sf modes will be discussed in section 3 1 2 3 1 2 charge discharge start voltage voltage jump drop and rate of change of voltage to explain the difference in charging time and discharging time the voltage response was analyzed in detail by extracting charge discharge start voltage voltage jump drop and rate of change of voltage from fig s2b the variation of voltage with a charging and discharging current density of 2 ma cm2 for cf mode is plotted in fig 4 as an example of how the voltage values and rate of change of voltage during the charging and discharging stages shown in fig 5 a and 5b respectively were obtained as shown in fig 4 the charge start voltage was obtained by measuring the open circuit voltage at the termination of standby stage 2 in the previous cycle a voltage jump occurs when charging current is applied the voltage then increases monotonically to 1 4 v where the charging stage ends followed by a 25 s standby stage where no current is applied the discharge start voltage was measured at the final time point of standby stage 1 as can be seen in fig 4 the discharging stage commences with a voltage drop occurring at the instant the discharge current is applied the voltage subsequently decreases slowly to 0 v as the discharging stage progresses and is followed by the second standby stage during which the brine stream is flushed from the system the average rate of change of charging and discharging voltages are calculated using eqs 12 and 13 respectively 12 rate of change of charging voltage mv s 1 4 v charge start voltage charging time 13 rate of change of discharging voltage mv s discharge start voltage 0 v discharging time as shown in fig 5 a the charge start voltage in cf mode is observed to increase with increasing discharging current density rising from 0 174 v at 1 ma cm2 to 0 410 v at 3 ma cm2 there are differences in the voltage jump in cf mode at various discharging currents with the largest difference less than 0 1 v similar rate of change of charging voltage was observed at different discharging current densities for cf mode fig 5 a the charge start voltage voltage jump and rate of change of charging voltage with sf mode showed similar trends to that for cf mode fig 5 a therefore it can be concluded that the decrease of charging time with increasing discharging current for both cf and sf modes mainly results from the increase of the charge start voltage the voltage jump and rate of change of charging voltage was found similar when electrode discharge at different currents this is possibly because the voltage jump at the beginning of charge and the rate of change of charging voltage were affected by charging current density and intrinsic properties of the electrode such as the ohmic resistance or series resistance and ion electro sorption rate dlugolecki and van der wal 2013 hemmatifar et al 2016 chen et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 a the charge start voltage is affected by the discharging current density the charge discharge start voltage which is the cell voltage when no current is applied can be used as an indicator of the charge remaining in the electrode pair with this charge neutralized by anions or cations therefore the charge discharge start voltage without applied current indirectly provides a measure of the ion concentration in the micropores of the electrodes after charge or discharge the higher charge start voltage may result from a less efficient electrode regeneration at higher discharging current which caused a decrease in the duration of the charging stage fig 3 if energy recovery is used this inefficient regeneration at a higher discharging current could be related to the larger energy loss during the discharging stage such that less energy would be used for electrode regeneration chen et al 2018 kang et al 2016 compared with cf discharging mode the lower charge start voltage for sf mode revealed that the electrodes can be regenerated more efficiently in sf mode fig 5 a this lower charge start voltage can be attributed to the decrease of resistance in the spacer channel in sf mode due to the higher salt concentration in the mcdi spacer channel during the discharge stage in sf mode fig 2 ramachandran et al 2019 tan et al 2020 recognizing that the resistance of a mcdi cell is mainly located in the spacer channel dykstra et al 2016 higher current resulted in larger energy loss as such the difference of charge start voltage between cf and sf modes became larger at higher discharging current as shown in fig 5 b the discharge start voltage in cf mode was constant at different discharging current densities while the voltage drop increased from 0 057 v at 1 ma cm2 to 0 165 v at 3 ma cm2 the rate of change of discharging voltage in cf mode increased significantly from 2 459 mv s at 1 ma cm2 to 8 129 mv s at 3 ma cm2 fig 5 b the increase of voltage drop was due to the threefold increase of the ohmic voltage drop with increasing discharging current density the discharge start voltage voltage drop and rate of the decrease of discharging voltage in sf mode showed similar trends to that in cf mode therefore it can be concluded that the shorter discharging time with increasing discharging current for both cf and sf modes resulted mainly from the increase of voltage drop and the faster decrease in discharging voltage the inefficient electrode regeneration at larger discharging current density may relate to the increase of the ohmic voltage drop caused by the higher discharging current and therefore the larger power dissipation it is worth noting that the difference in rate of change of discharging voltage between cf and sf modes increased with increasing discharging current density possibly as a result of the lower ionic resistance in the spacer channel with sf discharging mode 3 2 productivity concentration reduction and water recovery the influence of different discharging current densities for both cf and sf operational modes on productivity eq 1 and concentration reduction eq 4 is shown in fig 6 the productivity increased by 68 and 70 when the discharging current density increased from 1 0 to 3 0 ma cm2 for cf and sf modes respectively with this attributed to the significant reduction of discharging time and therefore the increasing proportion of charging time figs 3 and s3 at each discharging current density the productivity for sf operation was 10 lower than that with cf operation which is in agreement with tan et al 2020 who also reported lower daily production with sf mode than cf mode according to eq 1 the productivity for an mcdi stack is determined by the volume of dilute water and cycle time discharging in sf mode resulted in a longer cycle time fig 3 but produced a similar amount of product water fig s4 which resulted in a lower productivity it is worth noting that sf operation prolonged the charging time but only slightly increased the volume of product water compared with operation in cf discharging mode for instance discharging the electrode in sf mode resulted in an 14 increase in charging time fig 3 while the volume of product water only increased by 5 fig s4 as shown in fig s2 the charging stage in sf mode started at an influent concentration higher than feed concentration a certain amount of charging time was used to diluting brine rather than producing dilute water resulting in a lower productivity with sf discharge than cf discharge a possible reason for this phenomenon was the higher ion concentration in the macropores at the start of the charging stage due to the more highly concentrated brine produced in sf mode ion desorption during the discharging stage involves the transport of ions from micropores in the carbon particles to the macropores outside the particles followed by the transport of ions from the macropores to the spacer channel fig 7 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 according to the modified improved donnan model i md the ion concentration in the macropores is equal to the concentration in the spacer channel biesheuvel et al 2014 kim et al 2015 dykstra et al 2016 compared with continuous flow discharge a higher ion concentration was expected to exist in the macropores and spacer during stopped flow discharging porada et al 2020 during standby stage 2 although it took only a few seconds to flush the brine out of the spacer the transport of ions in the macropores to the spacer channel by crossing the ion exchange membranes was only driven by the concentration gradient it is expected that the ion concentration in the macropores for sf operation was larger than that in cf mode at the beginning of charge when the same standby stage duration was applied with this hypothesis supported by the higher effluent concentration at the start of charging with sf mode fig 2 the concentration reduction eq 4 did not change significantly at different discharging current density for cf or sf modes due to identical charging current and flow rate however the reduction in concentration was approximately 20 30 larger in cf mode than sf mode at each discharging current density when the electrodes were discharged in cf mode as shown in fig s2 the effluent concentration during the charging stage quickly reached an equilibrium concentration in cf mode while the effluent concentration decreased slowly after a sf discharging stage this can be attributed to the higher salt concentration in the macropores after the sf discharging operation additional ions in the macropore needed to be re adsorbed onto the electrode causing the slow decrease of effluent concentration during the charging stage in agreement with the study by zhao et al 2013 the water recovery defined in eq 2 increased from 35 at 1 0 ma cm2 to 59 at 3 0 ma cm2 for cf mode as a result of the significant decrease in the discharging duration fig 3 and therefore a decrease in the volume of brine fig s4 however the water recovery in sf mode at different discharging currents remained at approximately 85 which was significantly larger than that achieved when operating in cf mode a distinct advantage of sf discharge over cf discharge was the low brine volume produced over each cycle fig s4 as a result of the zero flow rate during the discharging stage ramachandran et al 2019 tan et al 2020 chen et al 2019 3 3 molar energy consumption and volumetric energy consumption the effect of varying discharge currents on the molar energy consumption and volumetric energy consumption was analyzed under the assumption of 1 no energy recovery and 2 100 energy recovery in both cf and sf modes as shown in fig 8 without energy recovery the molar energy consumption em eq 7 in either cf or sf modes only varied within 10 at different charging current fig 8a however 25 45 more energy was consumed to remove one mole of salt in sf mode compared to cf mode the charge efficiency eq 11 of cf mode is 20 30 higher than that of sf mode fig s6 as shown in fig s5 and s6 the energy input and charge input for operation in sf mode were 5 10 higher than that required for operation in cf mode but the salt removal for operation in cf mode was 20 40 larger than that for sf mode at each discharging current density this resulted in higher molar energy consumption and lower charge efficiency for operation in sf mode than that for operation in cf mode the higher energy input and charge input required for operation in sf mode also resulted from the longer charging time in sf mode compared to that in cf mode fig 3 while the lower salt removal was attributed to the lower concentration reduction discussed in section 3 2 fig 6 additionally because the salinity of the effluent was higher than that of the feed at the beginning of the charging stage with sf mode decreasing the flow efficiency defined as the ratio of the amount of salts removed to the amount of salts adsorbed hawks et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2019 the energy input and charge input were consumed to adsorb this additional salt without contributing to salt removal from the influent which reduced charge and energy efficiency as well as increased the molar energy consumption if 100 energy recovery is assumed the molar energy consumption decreased significantly by 50 70 compared to that without energy recovery fig 8a b the molar energy consumption increased by 50 and 18 on increasing discharging current density from 1 0 to 3 0 ma cm2 for cf and sf mode respectively fig 8b the increase of em can be attributed to the lower total recoverable energy with increasing discharging current which caused a 10 lower energy recovery at a discharging current density of 3 0 ma cm2 compared with that at 1 0 ma cm2 fig s5 when energy recovery was considered the difference of em between cf and sf modes was smaller for instance the em for sf mode at a discharging current density of 3 0 ma cm2 was 15 and 26 higher than that for cf mode with and without energy recovery respectively fig 8a b the smaller difference in em between these two modes can be attributed to the higher total recoverable energy and the higher energy recovery in sf discharging mode compared with cf discharging mode fig s5 similar results were reported for a system incorporating energy recovery with operation in sf discharging mode exhibiting larger specific energy consumption kj mol than observed for operation in cf discharging mode tan et al 2020 without energy recovery different discharging current densities increased the volumetric energy consumption ev by 7 for either cf or sf modes with increasing discharging current from 1 0 to 3 0 ma cm2 fig 8c this is because both the energy input fig s5 and the volume of dilute water produced in one cycle fig s4 decreased with increasing discharging current density cf and sf discharging operation showed similar values of volumetric energy consumption with this attributed to the similar increasing scale of energy input fig s5 and volume of product water fig s4 for operation in sf mode compared to that for operation in cf mode however when 100 energy recovery was assumed the volumetric energy consumption increased by 40 and 30 for cf and sf modes respectively when discharging current increased from 1 0 to 3 0 ma cm2 fig 8d this is attributed to the lower energy recovery with the increase of discharging current fig s5 the energy recovery for sf mode was higher than that for cf mode fig s5 which resulted from the higher ion concentration in the macropores and spacer and thus the lower ionic resistance compared with that in cf mode the contribution of the lower ionic resistance in sf mode was more apparent at higher discharging current with the energy recovery in sf mode higher than that in cf mode when discharging current density was larger than 2 0 ma cm2 fig s5 with this resulting in a 3 lower ev in sf mode than that in cf fig 8d 3 4 discussion from the results reported above the discharging conditions can affect desalination performance of mcdi process even remains same charging condition specifically higher current discharge 3 0 ma cm2 can increase productivity by 70 at the expense of electrode regeneration and energy recovery while low current discharge 1 0 ma cm2 can improve energy recovery by 10 fig s5 and salt removal by 20 fig s6 since there is a trade off between productivity and energy consumption the optimum discharging current is often determined by the water treatment requirement for instance if the number of electrodes is sufficient to meet the productivity requirement low current discharge can be applied to prolong charging time and allow for higher energy recovery and greater salt adsorption in one cycle with this contributing to lower energy consumption and less frequent switching between the charge and discharge stages conversely if high productivity is required high current discharge is preferable as this leads to a shorter discharging time an energy recovery of 100 has been considered in this study in order to assess the best case in reality with electrode currents of 200a there will be significant additional ohmic losses and losses in the dc dc converter indeed tan et al 2020 reported that up to 40 of the energy can be dissipated in the converter and cables in a pilot scale mcdi unit tan et al 2020 as reported in this work and previous work by tan et al 2020 a higher water recovery up to 85 can be achieved by discharging in sf mode as a result of the greatly reduced brine volume unlike cf discharge the water recovery in sf mode does not change with discharging current which makes it possible to maintain a high water recovery when lowering the discharging current additionally electrode regeneration can be improved by using sf mode as indicated by the lower charge start voltage and longer charging time however the improved electrode regeneration did not contribute to higher production and larger salt removal in one cycle with productivity and concentration reduction being reduced by 10 and 37 respectively at each discharging current density consequently more energy is consumed during the charging stage in sf discharging mode compared to cf discharging mode but less salt is removed from the influent resulting in a lower energy efficiency as indicated by the larger molar energy consumption with or without energy recovery fig 8a b and lower charge efficiency fig s6 this shortcoming can be mitigated by prolonging the duration of standby stage 2 to allow the migration of ions from the macropores to the spacer as suggested by hawks et al 2018 as shown in fig s7 the effluent concentration at the beginning of the charging stage decreased with increasing duration of standby stage 2 with this contributing to the higher productivity and concentration reduction fig s8 the molar energy consumption fig s9 decreased and charge efficiency increased fig s11 due to the increase in salt removal fig s11 however the water recovery reduced with increasing standby stage duration as more brine is produced in one cycle fig s8 also increasing the duration of standby stage 2 to over 100 s cannot further increase concentration reduction and charge efficiency but rather results in a decreased in productivity therefore other approaches to solving this problem should be examined a possible method is to decrease the ionic resistance of the activated carbon electrodes as well as the ion exchange membrane to allow faster transport of ions from the macropores to the spacer channel the results obtained here demonstrate that varying discharging current density and flow rate can deliver different values of productivity water recovery and energy consumption during the charging stage these three parameters however cannot be improved simultaneously since there is a trade off between them as discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 as a result a balance should be achieved between these three parameters such that the optimal discharging operation can be obtained to maximize productivity and water recovery and minimize the energy consumption in engineering practice although our results provide insight into the relationship between different discharging operations and energy consumption during charging stage actual energy recovery during the discharging stage has not yet been applied with this expected to exert a large influence on the overall energy consumption kang et al 2016 chen et al 2019 oyarzun et al 2020 tan et al 2020 4 conclusion the effects of different discharging conditions on the charging performance in an mcdi process have been systematically examined in this work by discharging electrodes at different discharging currents for both continuous and stopped flow during discharge based on the results obtained we propose that the open circuit voltage of the electrode pair can be used as an indicator of the number of ions remaining in the micropores different discharging operations have been investigated and their effect on the charging stage probed by comprehensive analysis of voltage variations the results highlight the need for the optimization of operational parameters such as the discharge current magnitude necessary for a particular desalination requirement improved productivity is obtained with a higher current discharge as this decreases the discharge duration otherwise low current discharge can be used to improve energy recovery and lower energy consumption an optimum discharging current should be determined by considering the best trade off between productivity and energy consumption comparison between continuous flow and stopped flow discharge presented here reveal that operation in stopped flow mode is more desirable than operation in continuous flow mode due to its much higher water recovery 85 however the problem of lower concentration reduction and higher molar energy consumption for stopped flow discharge is an issue applying a longer standby stage duration when operated in stopped flow mode than that used in continuous flow mode may mitigate the problem despite the resultant decrease of productivity and water recovery the findings obtained in this study should contribute to the optimization in operation of the discharging stage in mcdi water treatment such that a balance between productivity water recovery and energy consumption is achieved such analyzes

16676,persistent and mobile chemicals pm chemicals were searched for in surface waters by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography hilic and supercritical fluid chromatography sfc both coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry hrms a suspect screening was performed using a newly compiled list of 1310 potential pm chemicals to the data of 11 surface water samples from two river systems in total 64 compounds were identified by this approach the overlap between hilic and sfc hrms was limited 31 compounds confirming the complementarity of the two methods used the identified pm candidates are characterized by a high polarity median logd 0 4 at ph 7 5 a low molecular weight median 187 g mol are mostly ionic 54 compounds and contain a large number of heteroatoms one per four carbons on average among the most frequently detected novel or yet scarcely investigated water contaminants were cyanoguanidine 11 11 samples adamantan 1 amine 10 11 trifluoromethanesulfonate 9 11 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonate 10 11 and the inorganic anions hexafluorophosphate 11 11 and tetrafluoroborate 10 11 31 of the identified suspects are mainly used in ionic liquids a chemically diverse group of industrial chemicals with numerous applications that is so far rarely studied for their occurrence in the environment prioritization of the findings of pm candidates is hampered by the apparent lack of toxicity data hence precautionary principles and minimization approaches should be applied for the risk assessment and risk management of these substances the large share of novel water contaminants among these findings of the suspect screening indicates that the universe of pm chemicals present in the environment has so far only scarcely been explored dedicated analytical methods and screening lists appear essential to close the analytical gap for pm compounds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pmt substances wastewater groundwater drinking water water cycle lc ms 1 introduction persistent and mobile pm substances have recently gathered substantial scientific and regulatory interest reemtsma et al 2016 neumann and schliebner 2019 pm substances are difficult to analyze and to remove from water the european commission recently proposed to consider mobility as a critical molecular property in the risk assessment of chemicals ec 2020b this emphasizes the need for further investigation of pm substances in the aquatic environment the aquatic mobility of chemicals however is intrinsically tied to a high polarity which severely exacerbates the trace analysis of the most polar chemicals zahn et al 2020 pm chemicals thus fall into the analytical gap postulated by reemtsma et al 2016 until recently the analysis of very polar substances was mostly limited to only a few analytes of high priority such as ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonate or 1 4 dioxane using dedicated methods bergers and de groot 1994 song and shide 1997 bauer et al 1999 ghanem et al 2007 hanke et al 2008 in recent years however significant improvements in sample preparation e g evaporative concentration ec köke et al 2018 mechelke et al 2019 schulze et al 2020 solid phase extraction spe köke et al 2018 and separation techniques hydrophilic interaction chromatography hilic nováková et al 2014 jandera and hajek 2018 supercritical fluid chromatography sfc mechelke et al 2019 schulze et al 2020 mixed mode liquid chromatography mmlc montes et al 2019 2020 and capillary electrophoresis ce höcker et al 2020 facilitated the analysis of a wider range of pm substances by lc ms a recent target screening for pm candidates mainly reach registered chemicals ranked by their emission likelihood arp et al 2017 schulze et al 2018 using hilic mmlc and sfc resulted in more than 75 positive findings of all included compounds schulze et al 2019 implying a large knowledge gap for pm compounds in our environment also pharmaceuticals and personal care products may contribute to the pm burden huang et al 2021 a next step to narrow the knowledge gap on the occurrence of pm compounds in the aquatic environment are suspect screening approaches for pm compounds such dedicated screening approaches are still rare montes et al 2017 gago ferrero et al 2018 they require suitable analytical methods as well as dedicated suspect lists while on the one hand comprehensive suspect lists avoid to overlook compounds of interest excessively large suspect lists on the other hand lead to increasing numbers of false positive findings that need to be falsified manually and would render suspect screening approaches non productive suspect lists dedicated to the topic of interest and carefully curated are therefore essential for a successful suspect screening for pm chemicals this is exacerbated by the relative novelty of the concept and the yet incomplete understanding of which properties govern aquatic mobility a first goal of this study was to provide the tools required for an effective suspect screening for pm chemicals primarily by generating a comprehensive suspect list of pm candidates from diverse sources secondly this list in combination with dedicated analytical techniques three sample preparation techniques multi layer spe mlspe vacuum assisted ec and azeotropic ec aec and two chromatographic methods hilic and sfc were applied to screen for pm compounds in 11 surface water samples surface water was chosen for this study as higher concentrations and larger numbers of positive findings were expected than in groundwater this study explores to which extent suspect screening for pm candidates can narrow the analytical gap and contributes to extending the knowledge on the occurrence of pm chemicals in the water cycle 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples and standards a number of 11 grab samples of surface water of catchments of different size and impact of wastewater was chosen for analysis more details including the coordinates of sampling locations and sampling dates are given in table s1 six samples were from mulde elster neue luppe near leipzig and five from the rhein main rivers system both in germany all samples were taken in summer 2019 and stored in polypropylene pp bottles thermo scientific waltham massachusetts usa in the dark at 4 c less than 12 weeks until analysis a list of all standards is presented in table s6 2 2 analysis for pm candidates the suspect screening procedure was split into five steps analysis data treatment identification prioritization and confirmation fig 2 step 1 sample analysis sample enrichment sample preparation for hilic hrms was performed with mlspe and vacuum assisted ec in parallel while samples for sfc hrms were prepared with aec fig 2 the mlspe procedure and the cartridge was modified from köke et al 2018 but with twice the amount of solid phase material further details on cartridge packing and spe procedure are described in the supplementary information si section 1 2 1 for vacuum assisted ec ten milliliters of sample were dried at 50 c and reconstituted in acetonitrile water 95 5 v v to receive a concentration factor cf of 20 further details are described in the si section 1 2 2 enrichment by aec was conducted according to a slightly modified protocol by schulze et al 2020 four ml of sample mixed with 21 ml acetonitrile were evaporated at 40 c under a gentle stream of nitrogen and reconstituted in 200 µl acetonitrile water 90 10 to receive a cf of 20 the extract was centrifugated and the supernatant analyzed by sfc hrms further details are described in the si section 1 2 3 instrumental analysis all samples were analyzed in parallel in two different laboratories using either hilic or sfc hrms fig 2 hilic hrms analysis was performed using an agilent 1200 hplc consisting of a dad sl detector a thermostated column compartment an autosampler a binary pump sl and a degasser unit agilent technologies santa clara ca usa the orbitrap coupled to the hplc was an ltq orbitrap velos pro thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa all samples were analyzed in duplicate

on the gradient and eluent composition are given in table s4 further sfc hrms parameters are mentioned in the si step 2 data treatment for data processing and interpretation of the hilic hrms data two approaches were applied at first a suspect screening for all 1310 suspects was conducted using envimass v 4 1 parameters see table s3 besides sum formula and exact mass theoretical fragments were calculated in silico based on the smiles code of each suspect using parts of the metfrag v 2 4 2 r script ruttkies et al 2016 and automatically compared with hilic hrms measurements by envimass the results calculated by envimass were evaluated regarding their plausibility including retention time rt isotopic pattern fragments if present and proposed sum formula to verify the results from envimass the exact masses of potential suspects were manually revised a replicate filter eliminated features not detected in all replicates masses with less than threefold higher intensities in the extracts of environmental samples compared to the procedural blank were discarded for the suspect screening in sfc hrms data an automated peak picking for m h m na and m h ion species was performed using unifi version 1 8 2 169 waters mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm ms response 1000 isotope match m z root mean square rms to 5 ppm and isotope match intensity rms to 30 targetlynx version 4 2 waters was used to obtain a comprehensive list containing peak areas rts and s n values of all detected suspects in the extracts of the 11 water samples each analyzed in triplicate suspects that were not detected in all replicates with s n 10 or peak areas less than 10 fold areas in the extracts compared to the procedural blank were discarded before confirmation of plausible suspects with authentic reference standards step 3 tentative identification tentative identification of potential pm suspects was performed by evaluating the plausibility of the proposed suspect structure based on its exact mass and isotopic pattern the esi polarity used for ionization and its fragmentation pattern fig 2 obtained mass spectra were compared with the massbank library https massbank eu massbank if records were available step 4 selection of suspects for confirmation prioritization of tentatively identified suspects identification level 2 or 3 schymanski et al 2014 was based on their frequency of detection fod mean and maximum intensity novelty economical aspects availability and price of standards environmental human toxicology aspects and assumed environmental relevance reflected by the tonnage and the number and position of chemspider www chemspider com molecular formula hits fig 2 step 5 confirmation standards were purchased for the prioritized candidates for structure confirmation and determination of the final level of identification fig 2 fluctuating rts which were encountered for some analytes in hilic ms and non conclusive peaks with a low signal to noise ratio were confirmed by spiking the extracts with appropriate compound concentrations more detailed information on the methods is provided in the si 2 3 toxicological assessment the toxicological evaluation of identified suspects was carried out on the basis of a query from various international databases echa search for chemicals echa 2021a us epa comptox chemicals usepa 2021 german social accident insurance gestis substance database institut für arbeitsschutz der deutschen gesetzlichen unfallversicherung gestis stoffdatenbank and oecd echemportal oecd 2021 the endpoints genotoxicity reproductive toxicity acute toxicity and chronic toxicity were considered and the resulting values for a no observed adverse effect level noael or concentration noaec were used for the evaluation furthermore existing health based guidance values and health related indicator values in germany uba 2021 were considered these values are derived by the german environment agency for substances which are relevant regarding concentrations in drinking water greater than 0 1 µg l and their un known toxicology 3 results and discussion 3 1 suspect list of pm candidates suspect lists that match the respective research question are essential for any productive suspect screening for pm compounds comprehensive suspect lists are still scarce montes et al 2017 kiefer et al 2021 to widen the scope of screening approaches for pm chemicals an extensive suspect list of potential pm compounds was compiled from the outcomes of systematic approaches to identify potential pm chemicals from large chemical data sets arp et al 2017 schulze et al 2018 and a literature search on the chemically diverse group of ionic liquids table 1 inorganic salts and compounds judged not to be amenable to lc or esi ms were deleted moreover chemicals with a predicted logd of 6 ph 7 5 were excluded this comparatively high cut off value was selected based on the broadest of the current regulatory proposals neumann and schliebner 2019 and accounted for the error in logd prediction of approx 1 2 units arp et al 2017 schulze et al 2018 the final list consisted of 1310 pm candidates flawed sum formulas were revised manually and corrected per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in general were not specifically included in the suspect list since extensive screening approaches for pfas are already published kaboré et al 2018 wang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 and only some members of this substance class may be considered to be pm the inclusion of pfas in this study is thus limited to very short chain pfas like trifluoromethanesulfonate tfmsa that were prioritized as part of the identification efforts this suspect list is built upon also for pharmaceuticals and pesticides and their metabolites suspect lists have been compiled earlier kiefer et al 2021 the final list is available from doi 10 5281 zenodo 5503380 as there is ongoing debate on the physico chemical properties that characterize mobile chemicals the molecular weight and logd ph 7 5 were calculated marvinsketch v 19 16 chemaxon consensus method for all suspects for which an unequivocal smiles code was available 1181 of 1310 fig 1 the suspects span a wide range in both calculated logd 5 to 95 percentile 9 6 to 4 8 median 0 8 and molecular mass 5 to 95 percentile 74 to 718 g mol median 235 g mol compared to compounds that are monitored according to regulation european drinking water directive 98 83 eg ec 1998 and water framework directive 2000 60 ec ec 2000 their median logd value is 4 7 orders lower reflecting the higher polarity and mobility of the suspects in the context of chemicals regulation reach the european commission aims at including mobility and persistence as parameters for the classification of chemicals as substances of very high concern ec 2020b however no common understanding of parameters suitable to measure mobility and of appropriate cut off values for this parameter to distinguish between non mobile and mobile chemicals has been reached yet a proposal of the german environment agency indicates compounds with logd 4 ph range of 4 9 as mobile neumann and schliebner 2019 referring to this approach only a small fraction of chemicals yet regulated are mobile 3 2 pm specific adaptations of the suspect screening workflow a number of 11 samples of surface water were subjected to the pm suspect screening during this application some aspects became apparent that are considered specific for the screening for highly polar m compounds fig 2 procedural blanks it appeared that screening for very polar analytes is very prone to blank contaminations during data evaluation pronounced procedural blank contaminations were observed for some suspects e g 2 pyrrolidone p toluenesulfonate choline melamine 4 hydroxy 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 3 diphenylguanidine while the general exclusion of all signals detected in blanks avoids any false positive findings it also turned out to generate too many false negative findings therefore it appeared more appropriate to also consider the intensity of the blank signals relative to their intensity in the samples sample to blank intensity area ratio of 3 or to also include the relative standard deviation rsd of the blanks 3x rsd generally procedural blanks in pm chemical analysis appear to be a common problem the high share of chemicals in blanks associated to polymer production schulze et al 2019 implies caution against using polymer materials in the laboratory retention time while for most suspects within this study rt shifts were below 0 1 min between samples some suspects like methanesulfonate showed values 0 3 min in hilic it appears that the more complex interaction of ionic analytes with the stationary phase and the influence of diverse sample matrices hampers the full control of rt compared to rplc procedures consequently sufficient tolerance should be allowed for the rt during feature alignment if hilic is applied identification pm chemicals are only poorly represented in mass spectral databases and the availability of analytical standards is limited which hampers their identification in non target screening and their confirmation in suspect screening moreover the number of fragment ions is often limited for small molecules namely for those ionized in negative mode in several cases the loss of the acidic moiety is the only diagnostically valuable fragmentation e g so3 for sulfonates neutral loss of co2 for carboxylic acids however given the low molecular weight of many m chemicals 8 of suspects 100 g mol 20 150 g mol fig 1 the measured exact mass results in a limited number of possible molecular formulas also the number of structural isomers may be limited especially when the number of heteroatoms is large for the molecular formula c2hf6no4s2 for example only two corresponding chemicals were found in the chemspider database and only one of them bistriflimide is compatible with a negative ionization in esi see table 2 this is even more pronounced for the molecular formula cf3so3h for which only one meaningful structure was found tfmsa thus an assignment of confidence level 2 to these two compounds was deemed justified on the hrms full scan data alone for hexafluorophosphate pf6 only one structure exists in this case an unequivocal elemental composition is thus equivalent to a confidence level 1 identification these observations should be considered when reporting confidence levels or identification points in the analysis of pm chemicals generally for chemicals with indicative elemental compositions a matching rt may be considered sufficient for level 1 confirmation even if ms2 data is not available these aspects are likely equally relevant for non target screenings and for the target analysis of pm chemicals 3 3 evaluation of the analytical approaches three enrichment methods namely mlspe vacuum assisted ec and aec and two chromatographic methods hilic and sfc were applied for the suspect screening initially 232 suspects were tentatively identified in the 11 surface water samples by the three approaches using automated peak detection 135 by ec hilic 109 by mlspe hilic and 123 by aec sfc only 37 suspects about 16 of total number were detected with all three approaches however a reliable comparison of the findings made by hilic and by sfc hrms is hampered by different rts of the suspect peaks further comparison is therefore based on suspects with a confidence level of 1 or 2 table s6 the confirmation using 101 reference compounds revealed that 37 of the 232 suspects were false positive findings confidence level 4 table s7 while 30 suspects were classified as conclusive confidence level 2 and 34 suspects were fully confirmed confidence level 1 table s6 the identity of 135 suspects could not be verified due to a lack of available reference standards these suspects were thus assigned to confidence level 3 table s8 eventually a retrospective search in each of the data sets for the suspects confirmed by one of the other approaches was conducted according to this data set the two enrichment methods ec and mlspe used with hilic hrms show much agreement with 37 compounds 73 in common fig 3 this agrees to previous findings köke et al 2018 one advantage of the mlspe compared to ec is its tenfold higher enrichment factor this resulted in higher signal intensities and more pronounced fragment ion spectra which is advantageous in screening approaches for the confirmation of suspects or identification of unknowns agreement of the hilic approaches with aec sfc ms was much lower with only 31 analytes 48 fig 3 no clear difference could be found in the molecular properties molecular weight and charge logd functional groups of the pm candidates detected with either hilic or sfc hrms table s6 this suggests a high degree of complementarity of both chromatographic techniques in other words the coverage of polar chemicals is substantially widened if the analysis of water samples is based on hilic and sfc rather than on only one technique 3 4 occurrence properties and estimated concentrations of detected pm suspects a total of 64 suspects were detected and confirmed confidence level 1 and 2 with at least one method fig 4 table s6 detection frequencies ranged from 1 11 to 11 11 and estimated concentrations were between 1 and 10 000 ng l on average these 64 compounds occurred in 8 of the 11 samples considering the different catchment sizes extent of wastewater influence and locations of sampling this suggests a wide occurrence of these pm candidates among them are some well known substances such as metformin benzotriazole olmesartan gabapentin lactam melamine acesulfame venlafaxine and triphenylphosphine oxide all with an fod of 11 11 or diclofenac fod 8 11 these compounds were detected by all three approaches showing that all three are generally suitable for the screening for pm substances fig 4 of the 64 identified suspects the 10 most frequently detected novel or scarcely investigated are compiled in table 2 with their concentration ranges semiquantitative data annual production volumes application toxicity and fod many of these 64 pm candidates carry more than one heteroatom and various functional groups they include nitrogenous compounds 44 sulfonates 14 alcohols 8 ketones 7 ethers 5 carboxylates 5 and phosphonates 2 fig 4 table s6 the 64 pm candidates are distributed over a wide logd range 5 95 percentile 3 6 4 5 at ph 7 5 and molecular weight range 84 to 614 g mol fig 5 while the compounds on the pm suspect list were already quite polar median 0 8 fig 1 those finally detected are even more polar median logd 0 4 1 2 units also the molecular weight is another 20 lower median 187 g mol compared to 235 g mol the majority 85 of the pm candidates detected are charged at ph 7 5 with 22 occurring as cations and 32 as anions fig 5 moreover they show a marked trend to decreasing molecular weight with decreasing logd fig 5 with decreasing molecular mass the water solubility of molecules increases while binding interactions with surfaces by van der waals forces decrease both these factors increase the mobility of small organic molecules in the aqueous environment the logd values of pm candidates found in this suspect screening fig 5 fuel the debate on appropriate parameters and cut off values to describe the mobility of persistent chemicals intuitively a logd value as high as 5 4 of tris pentafluoroethyl trifluorophosphate appears too high for a mobile compound for example benz a pyrene has a logd of 5 3 and this compound would clearly not be considered a mobile chemical however one has to keep in mind that these logd values are predicted rather than measured with increasing uncertainty for potentially ionic compounds arp et al 2017 moreover the logd alone may simply not be a good descriptor of aqueous mobility further findings of pm compounds in surface water and groundwater will strengthen the database that can be utilized to find potentially more adequate parameter and cut off values for mobility the fact that these 64 pm candidates of which many are novel or yet scarcely investigated were detected and identified in this screening underlines that a screening for pm suspects is worthwhile however it is not a proof that all these 64 chemicals are indeed pm compounds i much of the data used for selecting the potential pm suspects are modelled data namely predictions on persistence are of limited reliability arp et al 2017 schulze et al 2018 ii in surface waters also non persistent compounds occur for example moderately biodegradable compounds that are not completely eliminated in wastewater treatment a continuation of the screening towards groundwater samples will be more indicative with respect to both their mobility and persistence subsequently the identification of the sources of pm substances is essential as a prerequisite to reduce their emission into the aquatic environment 3 5 important pm substance classes 3 5 1 sulfonates a total of 14 confirmed chemicals carries a sulfonic acid moiety from a chemical perspective this is not astonishing as the strongly acidic sulfonic acid group is dissociated at environmental ph values which drastically increases the polarity and mobility of a molecule benzene and naphthalene sulfonates have been studied in the 1990s based on dedicated lc ms methods using either ic or ion pair rplc ms bastian et al 1994 lange et al 1995 storm et al 1999 a few of them mainly naphthalene 1 5 and 2 7 disulfonate have been shown to be persistent in wastewater treatment reemtsma et al 2002 with the almost exclusive application of more generic rplc ms methods involving c18 stationary phases many very polar sulfonates were apparently overlooked in screening studies in the last two decades 3 nitrobenzenesulfonate is one of the ubiquitous compounds in surface waters in this study table 2 with estimated concentrations of up to 10 µg l fig 4 this compound is used in various industrial processes such as textile treatment and dyes metal wooden and plastic construction or chemical manufacturing although 3 nitrobenzenesulfonate was predicted being not readily biodegradable echa 2021b it has been shown to be degraded with acclimated sludge in industrial wastewater treatment plants kölbener et al 1994 methanesulfonate may well be of biogenic rather than of anthropogenic origin it has been reported to be formed in quantities of about 50 megatonnes per year globally as an intermediate in the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur kelly and murrell 1999 2 phenyl 1h benzimidazole 5 sulfonate is an industrial chemical that is registered under reach for the tonnage band of 100 1000 t a one of its uses is as uv b agent in personal care products it is known for its poor degradability inbaraj et al 2002 and advanced oxidation processes are required for its mineralization abdelraheem et al 2016 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonate table 2 fod 7 11 was only recently discovered in aquatic samples schulze et al 2019 although at much lower concentrations low ng l range than in this study up to 1 µg l fig 4 it has been proposed as a toxic pm chemical pmt by the german environment agency neumann and schliebner 2019 this industrial chemical is used in the european union in 1000 to 10000 t a quantity as an additive in polymer synthesis for over 40 years martin 1976 jamshidi and rabiee 2014 3 5 2 nitrogenous compounds a total of 44 of the 64 confirmed pm candidates are nitrogenous compounds this was unexpected as amines with their tendency to become protonated at neutral ph would hardly be mobile in aquatic environment where most surfaces are negatively charged and would trap such cations effectively for this reason the logd values were previously assumed to overestimate the mobility of cations and all cations were excluded in an earlier prioritization exercise for mobile compounds nödler et al 2021 of the 44 nitrogenous compounds identified 48 21 compounds are predicted to be positively charged at ph 7 5 table s6 most of the predicted cations are amines and imines only six of them carry oxygen thus it appears that a general exclusion of organic cations from suspect lists of pm chemicals is not justified a search for pm chemicals in groundwater will allow to clarify this further another 16 nitrogenous compounds were predicted to be negatively charged at ph 7 5 all of them carry at least one other heteroatom s o and comprise nitro compounds sulfonamides sulfonates carbamates and carboxylates table s6 one of the omnipresent cationic compounds is 1 4 diazabicyclo 2 2 2 octane fod 11 11 table 2 this chemical is used widely in adhesives and sealants and coating products in plastic materials adsorbents ph regulators and water treatment products for over 50 years in quantities of 1000 10000 t a in the eu salamone and snider 1970 echa 2021c it was first reported to occur in the aquatic environment in a recent suspect screening for pm candidates schulze et al 2019 a second frequently detected cationic nitrogenous compound is adamantan 1 amine table 2 fod 10 11 its emission potential was previously considered low as major industrial applications occur in closed systems arp et al 2017 schulze et al 2018 however adamantan 1 amine is also a pharmaceutical for the treatment of parkinson disease and viral infections also sars cov 2 danysz et al 2021 and as such released after administration into wastewater it was recently determined in the water cycle in europe schulze et al 2019 and in raw and drinking water in china xue et al 2020 cyanoguanidine table 2 fod 11 11 is a neutral compound to which a high emission score was ascribed previously schulze et al 2018 this was based on the fact that cyanoguanidine is used in high quantities in the eu 10000 100 000 t a and in very diverse applications in coating products textile treatment leather products plastic products and electrical equipment echa 2021d as well as a nitrification inhibitor in fertilizers used in agriculture as such it has already been detected in environmental water samples qiu et al 2015 4 hydroxy 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine fod 9 11 is also a high production volume chemical 1000 10000 t a echa 2021e used for the manufacture of chemicals and plastic products schulze et al 2019 and a frequent contaminant in the laboratory schulze et al 2020 3 5 3 ionic liquids moreover 20 cations and anions that are mainly used in ionic liquids ils were detected in this suspect screening ils are salts with a melting point at or below 100 c often consisting of an organic cation and an organic anion plechkova and seddon 2008 ils dissociate in contact with water so that in aqueous environment their cations or anions but not the intact ils may be found apart from two anions tris pentafluoroethyl trifluorophosphate neuwald et al 2020 and tfmsa zahn et al 2016 all other 18 confirmed suspects likely originating from ils have not been reported before as contaminants in the aqueous environment given the large number of ils marketed this is astonishing and another indication for a yet insufficient screening for pm compounds the most frequently detected anions and cations are pf6 fod 11 11 tetrafluoroborate bf4 fod 10 11 trimethylcetylammonium fod 11 11 and ethyltrimethylammonium fod 11 11 especially the two inorganic and fluorinated anions bf4 and pf6 were found in high estimated concentrations often exceeding 1 µg l and sometimes even 10 µg l fig 4 bf4 and pf6 are applied as counter ions in batteries mao 1996 zhai et al 2014 and have not yet been reported as environmental contaminant bf4 has been reported to hydrolyze slowly at a ph 1 with a half life of 3 years freire et al 2010 whereas pf6 did not show signs of hydrolysis freire et al 2010 plakhotnyk et al 2005 studies at environmental conditions are missing yet generally ils are often marketed as green solvents but their applications are diverse and it is estimated that the market for ils is increasing by 10 each year shiflett 2020 this trend raises concerns and suggests ils as a new environmental hazard class chatel et al 2017 it is assumed that the determining factor for toxicity of cationic ils is their hydrophobicity baseline toxicity but systematic toxicity assessments are only rarely available for ils kowalska et al 2021 based on these screening data and an extensive literature search it was inferred that a few widely used anions like pf6 and bf4 may be ubiquitously present in elevated concentrations while the majority is tied to specific industrial processes which would suggest more local contaminations interestingly il anions were detected more frequently and at higher concentrations in this screening exercise than il cations e g tetraalkylammonium cations fig 4 this may have several reasons i the cations are more diverse in structure so that the total amount of cationic ils used is distributed to a larger number each in lower concentration ii il cations are less persistent jordan and gathergood 2015 in the water cycle and may be transformed to yet mostly unknown transformation products or iii il cations are generally less mobile than il anions among the detected anions and cations mainly used in ils seven were perfluorinated pf6 bf4 tris pentafluoroethyl trifluoro phosphate bis trifluoromethylsulfonyl imide bis fluorosulfonyl imide tris trifluoromethylsulfonyl methanide and tfmsa fluorinated chemicals and particularly the anions are proposed to be more concerning towards the aquatic environment than their non fluorinated representatives due to their increased persistence and mobility cvjetko bubalo et al 2014 this further increases the potential for fluorinated ils to be pm chemicals thus ils in general and fluorinated il anions in particular warrant a more detailed investigation of their environmental occurrence fate and impacts 3 6 toxicological evaluation of identified chemicals experimental data on toxic effects of pm candidates is often missing berger et al 2018 as many of these compounds have been used for decades and were not subject to a health risk assessment at the time of approval or need not be approved previously today this lack of data hampers the risk assessment of drinking waters contaminated by pm compounds as well as the risk assessment of the pm candidate substances and thus their prioritization with respect to risk mitigation measures the available toxicological information of the detected and confirmed pm candidates is compiled in table s9 the us epa database comptox chemicals provides a tabular overview of specific points of departures e g noael loael and exposure limits e g tdi adi more detailed descriptions of the individual tests and the derivation of maximum values are listed on the echa reach website databases without data entries are not shown in germany single substances that occur in drinking water at levels 0 1 µg l and for which a complete toxicological data set with chronic or epidemiological study data is not available are assessed according to the concept of health related indicator values hriv dieter 2014 this concept provides five values from 0 01 to 3 0 µg l to assess substances in drinking water on a precautionary basis according to the respective lack of toxicological data for substances with sufficient toxicological data health based guide values can be derived for two substances of this study with high estimated concentrations fig 4 health based guide values for drinking water are available melamine 0 7 mg l and acesulfame 30 mg l uba in prep furthermore for three substances precautionary hrivs were derived earlier 3 µg l for benzotriazole 1 µg l for metformin and 0 3 µg l for olmesartan uba 2020 the other five substances of table 2 also exhibit toxicological data gaps but no hrivs have been derived so far if these compounds occurred in drinking water in concentrations 0 1 µg l the available toxicological data would result in the following hrivs 0 1 µg l for pf6 and dmbsa due to missing data on genotoxicity 0 3 µg l for dtbsa and venlafaxine due to missing data on neuro immunotoxicity and 3 0 µg l for p cumene sulfonate due to missing data on chronic toxicity to sum up only two of the ten most frequently detected and confirmed pm candidates found in high concentrations in this surface water screening have a full toxicological data set which allows their hazard based assessment in drinking water the fragmentary nature of the toxicity data is astonishing if one considers the partially high tonnage of the chemicals found in this study as a consequence a prioritization of the pm candidates found by this suspect screening based on their health risk is hardly possible in 2019 uba published a proposal to classify the toxicity of pm substances in the reach process neumann and schliebner 2019 these criteria include quite specific eco toxicological aspects and provide a good first step for the risk assessment and risk management of this group of chemicals its consideration in the reach process for newly developed chemicals by the registrants would support provision of a broader range of toxicity data besides the toxicological view drinking water regulation also aims at keeping the concentration of chemicals that can contaminate drinking water or adversely affect its quality as low as possible according to the generally recognized rules of technology with reasonable effort thus pm chemicals even if exhibiting low toxicity are generally undesirable in drinking water and due to their long lasting properties should be minimized at the sources of entry 4 conclusion hilic hrms and sfc hrms proved to be useful for the screening for pm chemicals in surface water with a complementary spectrum of compounds detected a comprehensive screening for pm chemicals may therefore require different enrichment and chromatographic approaches rather than one generic one by applying a newly compiled suspect list of 1310 potential pm chemicals to the lc hrms data 64 potential pm chemicals could be identified confirmation level 1 and 2 in the 11 surface water samples however the suspect screening for pm chemicals still faces limitations as i the quality of suspect lists is limited by the quality of data used for their selection ii there is no reliable information on transformation products of chemicals many of which can be expected to be more persistent and mobile than their parent compound the newly detected pm candidates have a high polarity median logd 0 4 at ph 7 5 and a low molecular weight median 187 u are mostly ionic and contain a large number of heteroatoms mean c heteroatom 4 1 mainly nitrogen mean c n 6 9 and sulfur mean c s 6 0 further screening data will help to better define the molecular properties that govern aquatic mobility among the newly detected pm candidates anions and cations mainly used in ils make up a prominent group with tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate other fluorinated compounds and a larger number of tetraalkylammonium cations being most prominent ils in general are so far scarcely recognized as environmental contaminants toxicological data appear to be missing for many of the newly detected compounds so that a risk assessment or prioritization of pm chemicals is hampered however the closure of the toxicological data gap is imminently important in order to move from a precautionary to a risk based assessment to protect the environment and the human health for newly developed substances with pm properties toxicological data should be supplied at the time of registration hilic ms sfc ms and the sample preparation techniques applied herein may also be used for the non target screening

16676,persistent and mobile chemicals pm chemicals were searched for in surface waters by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography hilic and supercritical fluid chromatography sfc both coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry hrms a suspect screening was performed using a newly compiled list of 1310 potential pm chemicals to the data of 11 surface water samples from two river systems in total 64 compounds were identified by this approach the overlap between hilic and sfc hrms was limited 31 compounds confirming the complementarity of the two methods used the identified pm candidates are characterized by a high polarity median logd 0 4 at ph 7 5 a low molecular weight median 187 g mol are mostly ionic 54 compounds and contain a large number of heteroatoms one per four carbons on average among the most frequently detected novel or yet scarcely investigated water contaminants were cyanoguanidine 11 11 samples adamantan 1 amine 10 11 trifluoromethanesulfonate 9 11 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonate 10 11 and the inorganic anions hexafluorophosphate 11 11 and tetrafluoroborate 10 11 31 of the identified suspects are mainly used in ionic liquids a chemically diverse group of industrial chemicals with numerous applications that is so far rarely studied for their occurrence in the environment prioritization of the findings of pm candidates is hampered by the apparent lack of toxicity data hence precautionary principles and minimization approaches should be applied for the risk assessment and risk management of these substances the large share of novel water contaminants among these findings of the suspect screening indicates that the universe of pm chemicals present in the environment has so far only scarcely been explored dedicated analytical methods and screening lists appear essential to close the analytical gap for pm compounds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pmt substances wastewater groundwater drinking water water cycle lc ms 1 introduction persistent and mobile pm substances have recently gathered substantial scientific and regulatory interest reemtsma et al 2016 neumann and schliebner 2019 pm substances are difficult to analyze and to remove from water the european commission recently proposed to consider mobility as a critical molecular property in the risk assessment of chemicals ec 2020b this emphasizes the need for further investigation of pm substances in the aquatic environment the aquatic mobility of chemicals however is intrinsically tied to a high polarity which severely exacerbates the trace analysis of the most polar chemicals zahn et al 2020 pm chemicals thus fall into the analytical gap postulated by reemtsma et al 2016 until recently the analysis of very polar substances was mostly limited to only a few analytes of high priority such as ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonate or 1 4 dioxane using dedicated methods bergers and de groot 1994 song and shide 1997 bauer et al 1999 ghanem et al 2007 hanke et al 2008 in recent years however significant improvements in sample preparation e g evaporative concentration ec köke et al

schulze et al 2018 using hilic mmlc and sfc resulted in more than 75 positive findings of all included compounds schulze et al 2019 implying a large knowledge gap for pm compounds in our environment also pharmaceuticals and personal care products may contribute to the pm burden huang et al 2021 a next step to narrow the knowledge gap on the occurrence of pm compounds in the aquatic environment are suspect screening approaches for pm compounds such dedicated screening approaches are still rare montes et al 2017 gago ferrero et al 2018 they require suitable analytical methods as well as dedicated suspect lists while on the one hand comprehensive suspect lists avoid to overlook compounds of interest excessively large suspect lists on the other hand lead to increasing numbers of false positive findings that need to be falsified manually and would render suspect screening approaches non productive suspect lists dedicated to the topic of interest and carefully curated are therefore essential for a successful suspect screening for pm chemicals this is exacerbated by the relative novelty of the concept and the yet incomplete understanding of which properties govern aquatic mobility a first goal of this study was to provide the tools required for an effective suspect screening for pm chemicals primarily by generating a comprehensive suspect list of pm candidates from diverse sources secondly this list in combination with dedicated analytical techniques three sample preparation techniques multi layer spe mlspe vacuum assisted ec and azeotropic ec aec and two chromatographic methods hilic and sfc were applied to screen for pm compounds in 11 surface water samples surface water was chosen for this study as higher concentrations and larger numbers of positive findings were expected than in groundwater this study explores to which extent suspect screening for pm candidates can narrow the analytical gap and contributes to extending the knowledge on the occurrence of pm chemicals in the water cycle 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples and standards a number of 11 grab samples of surface water of catchments of different size and impact of wastewater was chosen for analysis more details including the coordinates of sampling locations and sampling dates are given in table s1 six samples were from mulde elster neue luppe near leipzig and five from the rhein main rivers system both in germany all samples were taken in summer 2019 and stored in polypropylene pp bottles thermo scientific waltham massachusetts usa in the dark at 4 c less than 12 weeks until analysis a list of all standards is presented in table s6 2 2 analysis for pm candidates the suspect screening procedure was split into five steps analysis data treatment identification prioritization and confirmation fig 2 step 1 sample analysis sample enrichment sample preparation for hilic hrms was performed with mlspe and vacuum assisted ec in parallel while samples for sfc hrms were prepared with aec fig 2 the mlspe procedure and the cartridge was modified from köke et al 2018 but with twice the amount of solid phase material further details on cartridge packing and spe procedure are described in the supplementary information si section 1 2 1 for vacuum assisted ec ten milliliters of sample were dried at 50 c and reconstituted in acetonitrile water 95

four ml of sample mixed with 21 ml acetonitrile were evaporated at 40 c under a gentle stream of nitrogen and reconstituted in 200 µl acetonitrile water 90 10 to receive a cf of 20 the extract was centrifugated and the supernatant analyzed by sfc hrms further details are described in the si section 1 2 3 instrumental analysis all samples were analyzed in parallel in two different laboratories using either hilic or sfc hrms fig 2 hilic hrms analysis was performed using an agilent 1200 hplc consisting of a dad sl detector a thermostated column compartment an autosampler a binary pump sl and a degasser unit agilent technologies santa clara ca usa the orbitrap coupled to the hplc was an ltq orbitrap velos pro thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa all samples were analyzed in duplicate

on the gradient and eluent composition are given in table s4 further sfc hrms parameters are mentioned in the si step 2 data treatment for data processing and interpretation of the hilic hrms data two approaches were applied at first a suspect screening for all 1310 suspects was conducted using envimass v 4 1 parameters see table s3 besides sum formula and exact mass theoretical fragments were calculated in silico based on the smiles code of each suspect using parts of the metfrag v 2 4 2 r script ruttkies et al 2016 and automatically compared with hilic hrms measurements by envimass the results calculated by envimass were evaluated regarding their plausibility including retention time rt isotopic pattern fragments if present and proposed sum formula to verify the results from envimass the exact masses of potential suspects were manually revised a replicate filter eliminated features not detected in all replicates masses with less than threefold higher intensities in the extracts of environmental samples compared to the procedural blank were discarded for the suspect screening in sfc hrms data an automated peak picking for m h m na and m h ion species was performed using unifi version 1 8 2 169 waters mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm ms response 1000 isotope match m z root mean square rms to 5 ppm and isotope match intensity rms to 30 targetlynx version 4 2 waters was used to obtain a comprehensive list containing peak areas rts and s n values of all detected suspects in the extracts of the 11 water samples each analyzed in triplicate suspects that were not detected in all replicates with s n 10 or peak areas less than 10 fold areas in the extracts compared to the procedural blank were discarded before confirmation of plausible suspects with authentic reference standards step 3 tentative identification tentative identification of potential pm suspects was performed by evaluating the plausibility of the proposed suspect structure based on its exact mass and isotopic pattern the esi polarity used for ionization and its fragmentation pattern fig 2 obtained mass spectra were compared with the massbank library https massbank eu massbank if records were available step 4 selection of suspects for confirmation prioritization of tentatively identified suspects identification level 2 or 3 schymanski et al 2014 was based on their frequency of detection fod mean and maximum intensity novelty economical aspects availability and price of standards environmental human toxicology aspects and assumed environmental relevance reflected by the tonnage and the number and position of chemspider www chemspider com molecular formula hits fig 2 step 5 confirmation standards were purchased for the prioritized candidates for structure confirmation and determination of the final level of identification fig 2 fluctuating rts which were encountered for some analytes in hilic ms and non conclusive peaks with a low signal to noise ratio were confirmed by spiking the extracts with appropriate compound concentrations more detailed information on the methods is provided in the si 2 3 toxicological assessment the toxicological evaluation of identified suspects was carried out on the basis of a query from various international databases echa search for chemicals echa 2021a us epa comptox chemicals usepa 2021 german social accident insurance gestis substance database institut für arbeitsschutz der deutschen gesetzlichen unfallversicherung gestis stoffdatenbank and oecd echemportal oecd 2021 the endpoints genotoxicity reproductive toxicity acute toxicity and chronic toxicity were considered and the resulting values for a no observed adverse effect level noael or concentration noaec were used for the evaluation furthermore existing health based guidance values and health related indicator values in germany uba 2021 were considered these values are derived by the german environment agency for substances which are relevant regarding concentrations in drinking water greater than 0 1 µg l and their un known toxicology 3 results and discussion 3 1 suspect list of pm candidates suspect lists that match the respective research question are essential for any productive suspect screening for pm compounds comprehensive suspect lists are still scarce montes et al 2017 kiefer et al 2021 to widen the scope of screening approaches for pm chemicals an extensive suspect list of potential pm compounds was compiled from the outcomes of systematic approaches to identify potential pm chemicals from large chemical data sets arp et al 2017 schulze et al 2018 and a literature search on the chemically diverse group of ionic liquids table 1 inorganic salts and compounds judged not to be amenable to lc or esi ms were deleted moreover chemicals with a predicted logd of 6 ph 7 5 were excluded this comparatively high cut off value was selected based on the broadest of the current regulatory proposals neumann and schliebner 2019 and accounted for the error in logd prediction of approx 1 2 units arp et al 2017 schulze et al 2018 the final list consisted of 1310 pm candidates flawed sum formulas were revised manually and corrected per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in general were not specifically included in the suspect list since extensive screening approaches for pfas are already published kaboré et al 2018 wang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 and only some members of this substance class may be considered to be pm the inclusion of pfas in this study is thus limited to very short chain pfas like trifluoromethanesulfonate tfmsa that were prioritized as part of the identification efforts this suspect list is built upon also for pharmaceuticals and pesticides and their metabolites suspect lists have been compiled earlier kiefer et al 2021 the final list is available from doi 10 5281 zenodo 5503380 as there is ongoing debate on the physico chemical properties that characterize mobile chemicals the molecular weight and logd ph 7 5 were calculated marvinsketch v 19 16 chemaxon consensus method for all suspects for which an unequivocal smiles code was available 1181 of 1310 fig 1 the suspects span a wide range in both calculated logd 5 to 95 percentile 9 6 to 4 8 median 0 8 and molecular mass 5 to 95 percentile 74 to 718 g mol median 235 g mol compared to compounds that are monitored according to regulation european drinking water directive 98 83 eg ec 1998 and water framework directive 2000 60 ec ec 2000 their median logd value is 4 7 orders lower reflecting the higher polarity and mobility of the suspects in the context of chemicals regulation reach the european commission aims at including mobility and persistence as parameters for the classification of chemicals as substances of very high concern ec 2020b however no common understanding of parameters suitable to measure mobility and of appropriate cut off values for this parameter to distinguish between non mobile and mobile chemicals has been reached yet a proposal of the german environment agency indicates compounds with logd 4 ph range of 4 9 as mobile neumann and schliebner 2019 referring to this approach only a small fraction of chemicals yet regulated are mobile 3 2 pm specific adaptations of the suspect screening workflow a number of 11 samples of surface water were subjected to the pm suspect screening during this application some aspects became apparent that are considered specific for the screening for highly polar m compounds fig 2 procedural blanks it appeared that screening for very polar analytes is very prone to blank contaminations during data evaluation pronounced procedural blank contaminations were observed for some suspects e g 2 pyrrolidone p toluenesulfonate choline melamine 4 hydroxy 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 3 diphenylguanidine while the general exclusion of all signals detected in blanks avoids any false positive findings it also turned out to generate too many false negative findings therefore it appeared more appropriate to also consider the intensity of the blank signals relative to their intensity in the samples sample to blank intensity area ratio of 3 or to also include the relative standard deviation rsd of the blanks 3x rsd generally procedural blanks in pm chemical analysis appear to be a common problem the high share of chemicals in blanks associated to polymer production schulze et al 2019 implies caution against using polymer materials in the laboratory retention time while for most suspects within this study rt shifts were below 0 1 min between samples some suspects like methanesulfonate showed values 0 3 min in hilic it appears that the more complex interaction of ionic analytes with the stationary phase and the influence of diverse sample matrices hampers the full control of rt compared to rplc procedures consequently sufficient tolerance should be allowed for the rt during feature alignment if hilic is applied identification pm chemicals are only poorly represented in mass spectral databases and the availability of analytical standards is limited which hampers their identification in non target screening and their confirmation in suspect screening moreover the number of fragment ions is often limited for small molecules namely for those ionized in negative mode in several cases the loss of the acidic moiety is the only diagnostically valuable fragmentation e g so3 for sulfonates neutral loss of co2 for carboxylic acids however given the low molecular weight of many m chemicals 8 of suspects 100 g mol 20 150 g mol fig 1 the measured exact mass results in a limited number of possible molecular formulas also the number of structural isomers may be limited especially when the number of heteroatoms is large for the molecular formula c2hf6no4s2 for example only two corresponding chemicals were found in the chemspider database and only one of them bistriflimide is compatible with a negative ionization in esi see table 2 this is even more pronounced for the molecular formula cf3so3h for which only one meaningful structure was found tfmsa thus an assignment of confidence level 2 to these two compounds was deemed justified on the hrms full scan data alone for hexafluorophosphate pf6 only one structure exists in this case an unequivocal elemental composition is thus equivalent to a confidence level 1 identification these observations should be considered when reporting confidence levels or identification points in the analysis of pm chemicals generally for chemicals with indicative elemental compositions a matching rt may be considered sufficient for level 1 confirmation even if ms2 data is not available these aspects are likely equally relevant for non target screenings and for the target analysis of pm chemicals 3 3 evaluation of the analytical approaches three enrichment methods namely mlspe vacuum assisted ec and aec and two chromatographic methods hilic and sfc were applied for the suspect screening initially 232 suspects were tentatively identified in the 11 surface water samples by the three approaches using automated peak detection 135 by ec hilic 109 by mlspe hilic and 123 by aec sfc only 37 suspects about 16 of total number were detected with all three approaches however a reliable comparison of the findings made by hilic and by sfc hrms is hampered by different rts of the suspect peaks further comparison is therefore based on suspects with a confidence level of 1 or 2 table s6 the confirmation using 101 reference compounds revealed that 37 of the 232 suspects were false positive findings confidence level 4 table s7 while 30 suspects were classified as conclusive confidence level 2 and 34 suspects were fully confirmed confidence level 1 table s6 the identity of 135 suspects could not be verified due to a lack of available reference standards these suspects were thus assigned to confidence level 3 table s8 eventually a retrospective search in each of the data sets for the suspects confirmed by one of the other approaches was conducted according to this data set the two enrichment methods ec and mlspe used with hilic hrms show much agreement with 37 compounds 73 in common fig 3 this agrees to previous findings köke et al 2018 one advantage of the mlspe compared to ec is its tenfold higher enrichment factor this resulted in higher signal intensities and more pronounced fragment ion spectra which is advantageous in screening approaches for the confirmation of suspects or identification of unknowns agreement of the hilic approaches with aec sfc ms was much lower with only 31 analytes 48 fig 3 no clear difference could be found in the molecular properties molecular weight and charge logd functional groups of the pm candidates detected with either hilic or sfc hrms table s6 this suggests a high degree of complementarity of both chromatographic techniques in other words the coverage of polar chemicals is substantially widened if the analysis of water samples is based on hilic and sfc rather than on only one technique 3 4 occurrence properties and estimated concentrations of detected pm suspects a total of 64 suspects were detected and confirmed confidence level 1 and 2 with at least one method fig 4 table s6 detection frequencies ranged from 1 11 to 11 11 and estimated concentrations were between 1 and 10 000 ng l on average these 64 compounds occurred in 8 of the 11 samples considering the different catchment sizes extent of wastewater influence and locations of sampling this suggests a wide occurrence of these pm candidates among them are some well known substances such as metformin benzotriazole olmesartan gabapentin lactam melamine acesulfame venlafaxine and triphenylphosphine oxide all with an fod of 11 11 or diclofenac fod 8 11 these compounds were detected by all three approaches showing that all three are generally suitable for the screening for pm substances fig 4 of the 64 identified suspects the 10 most frequently detected novel or scarcely investigated are compiled in table 2 with their concentration ranges semiquantitative data annual production volumes application toxicity and fod many of these 64 pm candidates carry more than one heteroatom and various functional groups they include nitrogenous compounds 44 sulfonates 14 alcohols 8 ketones 7 ethers 5 carboxylates 5 and phosphonates 2 fig 4 table s6 the 64 pm candidates are distributed over a wide logd range 5 95 percentile 3 6 4 5 at ph 7 5 and molecular weight range 84 to 614 g mol fig 5 while the compounds on the pm suspect list were already quite polar median 0 8 fig 1 those finally detected are even more polar median logd 0 4 1 2 units also the molecular weight is another 20 lower median 187 g mol compared to 235 g mol the majority 85 of the pm candidates detected are charged at ph 7 5 with 22 occurring as cations and 32 as anions fig 5 moreover they show a marked trend to decreasing molecular weight with decreasing logd fig 5 with decreasing molecular mass the water solubility of molecules increases while binding interactions with surfaces by van der waals forces decrease both these factors increase the mobility of small organic molecules in the aqueous environment the logd values of pm candidates found in this suspect screening fig 5 fuel the debate on appropriate parameters and cut off values to describe the mobility of persistent chemicals intuitively a logd value as high as 5 4 of tris pentafluoroethyl trifluorophosphate appears too high for a mobile compound for example benz a pyrene has a logd of 5 3 and this compound would clearly not be considered a mobile chemical however one has to keep in mind that these logd values are predicted rather than measured with increasing uncertainty for potentially ionic compounds arp et al 2017 moreover the logd alone may simply not be a good descriptor of aqueous mobility further findings of pm compounds in surface water and groundwater will strengthen the database that can be utilized to find potentially more adequate parameter and cut off values for mobility the fact that these 64 pm candidates of which many are novel or yet scarcely investigated were detected and identified in this screening underlines that a screening for pm suspects is worthwhile however it is not a proof that all these 64 chemicals are indeed pm compounds i much of the data used for selecting the potential pm suspects are modelled data namely predictions on persistence are of limited reliability arp et al 2017 schulze et al 2018 ii in surface waters also non persistent compounds occur for example moderately biodegradable compounds that are not completely eliminated in wastewater treatment a continuation of the screening towards groundwater samples will be more indicative with respect to both their mobility and persistence subsequently the identification of the sources of pm substances is essential as a prerequisite to reduce their emission into the aquatic environment 3 5 important pm substance classes 3 5 1 sulfonates a total of 14 confirmed chemicals carries a sulfonic acid moiety from a chemical perspective this is not astonishing as the strongly acidic sulfonic acid group is dissociated at environmental ph values which drastically increases the polarity and mobility of a molecule benzene and naphthalene sulfonates have been studied in the 1990s based on dedicated lc ms methods using either ic or ion pair rplc ms bastian et al 1994 lange et al 1995 storm et al 1999 a few of them mainly naphthalene 1 5 and 2 7 disulfonate have been shown to be persistent in wastewater treatment reemtsma et al 2002 with the almost exclusive application of more generic rplc ms methods involving c18 stationary phases many very polar sulfonates were apparently overlooked in screening studies in the last two decades 3 nitrobenzenesulfonate is one of the ubiquitous compounds in surface waters in this study table 2 with estimated concentrations of up to 10 µg l fig 4 this compound is used in various industrial processes such as textile treatment and dyes metal wooden and plastic construction or chemical manufacturing although 3 nitrobenzenesulfonate was predicted being not readily biodegradable echa 2021b it has been shown to be degraded with acclimated sludge in industrial wastewater treatment plants kölbener et al 1994 methanesulfonate may well be of biogenic rather than of anthropogenic origin it has been reported to be formed in quantities of about 50 megatonnes per year globally as an intermediate in the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur kelly and murrell 1999 2 phenyl 1h benzimidazole 5 sulfonate is an industrial chemical that is registered under reach for the tonnage band of 100 1000 t a one of its uses is as uv b agent in personal care products it is known for its poor degradability inbaraj et al 2002 and advanced oxidation processes are required for its mineralization abdelraheem et al 2016 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonate table 2 fod 7 11 was only recently discovered in aquatic samples schulze et al 2019 although at much lower concentrations low ng l range than in this study up to 1 µg l fig 4 it has been proposed as a toxic pm chemical pmt by the german environment agency neumann and schliebner 2019 this industrial chemical is used in the european union in 1000 to 10000 t a quantity as an additive in polymer synthesis for over 40 years martin 1976 jamshidi and rabiee 2014 3 5 2 nitrogenous compounds a total of 44 of the 64 confirmed pm candidates are nitrogenous compounds this was unexpected as amines with their tendency to become protonated at neutral ph would hardly be mobile in aquatic environment where most surfaces are negatively charged and would trap such cations effectively for this reason the logd values were previously assumed to overestimate the mobility of cations and all cations were excluded in an earlier prioritization exercise for mobile compounds nödler et al 2021 of the 44 nitrogenous compounds identified 48 21 compounds are predicted to be positively charged at ph 7 5 table s6 most of the predicted cations are amines and imines only six of them carry oxygen thus it appears that a general exclusion of organic cations from suspect lists of pm chemicals is not justified a search for pm chemicals in groundwater will allow to clarify this further another 16 nitrogenous compounds were predicted to be negatively charged at ph 7 5 all of them carry at least one other heteroatom s o and comprise nitro compounds sulfonamides sulfonates carbamates and carboxylates table s6 one of the omnipresent cationic compounds is 1 4 diazabicyclo 2 2 2 octane fod 11 11 table 2 this chemical is used widely in adhesives and sealants and coating products in plastic materials adsorbents ph regulators and water treatment products for over 50 years in quantities of 1000 10000 t a in the eu salamone and snider 1970 echa 2021c it was first reported to occur in the aquatic environment in a recent suspect screening for pm candidates schulze et al 2019 a second frequently detected cationic nitrogenous compound is adamantan 1 amine table 2 fod 10 11 its emission potential was previously considered low as major industrial applications occur in closed systems arp et al 2017 schulze et al 2018 however adamantan 1 amine is also a pharmaceutical for the treatment of parkinson disease and viral infections also sars cov 2 danysz et al 2021 and as such released after administration into wastewater it was recently determined in the water cycle in europe schulze et al 2019 and in raw and drinking water in china xue et al 2020 cyanoguanidine table 2 fod 11 11 is a neutral compound to which a high emission score was ascribed previously schulze et al 2018 this was based on the fact that cyanoguanidine is used in high quantities in the eu 10000 100 000 t a and in very diverse applications in coating products textile treatment leather products plastic products and electrical equipment echa 2021d as well as a nitrification inhibitor in fertilizers used in agriculture as such it has already been detected in environmental water samples qiu et al 2015 4 hydroxy 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine fod 9 11 is also a high production volume chemical 1000 10000 t a echa 2021e used for the manufacture of chemicals and plastic products schulze et al 2019 and a frequent contaminant in the laboratory schulze et al 2020 3 5 3 ionic liquids moreover 20 cations and anions that are mainly used in ionic liquids ils were detected in this suspect screening ils are salts with a melting point at or below 100 c often consisting of an organic cation and an organic anion plechkova and seddon 2008 ils dissociate in contact with water so that in aqueous environment their cations or anions but not the intact ils may be found apart from two anions tris pentafluoroethyl trifluorophosphate neuwald et al 2020 and tfmsa zahn et al 2016 all other 18 confirmed suspects likely originating from ils have not been reported before as contaminants in the aqueous environment given the large number of ils marketed this is astonishing and another indication for a yet insufficient screening for pm compounds the most frequently detected anions and cations are pf6 fod 11 11 tetrafluoroborate bf4 fod 10 11 trimethylcetylammonium fod 11 11 and ethyltrimethylammonium fod 11 11 especially the two inorganic and fluorinated anions bf4 and pf6 were found in high estimated concentrations often exceeding 1 µg l and sometimes even 10 µg l fig 4 bf4 and pf6 are applied as counter ions in batteries mao 1996 zhai et al 2014 and have not yet been reported as environmental contaminant bf4 has been reported to hydrolyze slowly at a ph 1 with a half life of 3 years freire et al 2010 whereas pf6 did not show signs of hydrolysis freire et al 2010 plakhotnyk et al 2005 studies at environmental conditions are missing yet generally ils are often marketed as green solvents but their applications are diverse and it is estimated that the market for ils is increasing by 10 each year shiflett 2020 this trend raises concerns and suggests ils as a new environmental hazard class chatel et al 2017 it is assumed that the determining factor for toxicity of cationic ils is their hydrophobicity baseline toxicity but systematic toxicity assessments are only rarely available for ils kowalska et al 2021 based on these screening data and an extensive literature search it was inferred that a few widely used anions like pf6 and bf4 may be ubiquitously present in elevated concentrations while the majority is tied to specific industrial processes which would suggest more local contaminations interestingly il anions were detected more frequently and at higher concentrations in this screening exercise than il cations e g tetraalkylammonium cations fig 4 this may have several reasons i the cations are more diverse in structure so that the total amount of cationic ils used is distributed to a larger number each in lower concentration ii il cations are less persistent jordan and gathergood 2015 in the water cycle and may be transformed to yet mostly unknown transformation products or iii il cations are generally less mobile than il anions among the detected anions and cations mainly used in ils seven were perfluorinated pf6 bf4 tris pentafluoroethyl trifluoro phosphate bis trifluoromethylsulfonyl imide bis fluorosulfonyl imide tris trifluoromethylsulfonyl methanide and tfmsa fluorinated chemicals and particularly the anions are proposed to be more concerning towards the aquatic environment than their non fluorinated representatives due to their increased persistence and mobility cvjetko bubalo et al 2014 this further increases the potential for fluorinated ils to be pm chemicals thus ils in general and fluorinated il anions in particular warrant a more detailed investigation of their environmental occurrence fate and impacts 3 6 toxicological evaluation of identified chemicals experimental data on toxic effects of pm candidates is often missing berger et al 2018 as many of these compounds have been used for decades and were not subject to a health risk assessment at the time of approval or need not be approved previously today this lack of data hampers the risk assessment of drinking waters contaminated by pm compounds as well as the risk assessment of the pm candidate substances and thus their prioritization with respect to risk mitigation measures the available toxicological information of the detected and confirmed pm candidates is compiled in table s9 the us epa database comptox chemicals provides a tabular overview of specific points of departures e g noael loael and exposure limits e g tdi adi more detailed descriptions of the individual tests and the derivation of maximum values are listed on the echa reach website databases without data entries are not shown in germany single substances that occur in drinking water at levels 0 1 µg l and for which a complete toxicological data set with chronic or epidemiological study data is not available are assessed according to the concept of health related indicator values hriv dieter 2014 this concept provides five values from 0 01 to 3 0 µg l to assess substances in drinking water on a precautionary basis according to the respective lack of toxicological data for substances with sufficient toxicological data health based guide values can be derived for two substances of this study with high estimated concentrations fig 4 health based guide values for drinking water are available melamine 0 7 mg l and acesulfame 30 mg l uba in prep furthermore for three substances precautionary hrivs were derived earlier 3 µg l for benzotriazole 1 µg l for metformin and 0 3 µg l for olmesartan uba 2020 the other five substances of table 2 also exhibit toxicological data gaps but no hrivs have been derived so far if these compounds occurred in drinking water in concentrations 0 1 µg l the available toxicological data would result in the following hrivs 0 1 µg l for pf6 and dmbsa due to missing data on genotoxicity 0 3 µg l for dtbsa and venlafaxine due to missing data on neuro immunotoxicity and 3 0 µg l for p cumene sulfonate due to missing data on chronic toxicity to sum up only two of the ten most frequently detected and confirmed pm candidates found in high concentrations in this surface water screening have a full toxicological data set which allows their hazard based assessment in drinking water the fragmentary nature of the toxicity data is astonishing if one considers the partially high tonnage of the chemicals found in this study as a consequence a prioritization of the pm candidates found by this suspect screening based on their health risk is hardly possible in 2019 uba published a proposal to classify the toxicity of pm substances in the reach process neumann and schliebner 2019 these criteria include quite specific eco toxicological aspects and provide a good first step for the risk assessment and risk management of this group of chemicals its consideration in the reach process for newly developed chemicals by the registrants would support provision of a broader range of toxicity data besides the toxicological view drinking water regulation also aims at keeping the concentration of chemicals that can contaminate drinking water or adversely affect its quality as low as possible according to the generally recognized rules of technology with reasonable effort thus pm chemicals even if exhibiting low toxicity are generally undesirable in drinking water and due to their long lasting properties should be minimized at the sources of entry 4 conclusion hilic hrms and sfc hrms proved to be useful for the screening for pm chemicals in surface water with a complementary spectrum of compounds detected a comprehensive screening for pm chemicals may therefore require different enrichment and chromatographic approaches rather than one generic one by applying a newly compiled suspect list of 1310 potential pm chemicals to the lc hrms data 64 potential pm chemicals could be identified confirmation level 1 and 2 in the 11 surface water samples however the suspect screening for pm chemicals still faces limitations as i the quality of suspect lists is limited by the quality of data used for their selection ii there is no reliable information on transformation products of chemicals many of which can be expected to be more persistent and mobile than their parent compound the newly detected pm candidates have a high polarity median logd 0 4 at ph 7 5 and a low molecular weight median 187 u are mostly ionic and contain a large number of heteroatoms mean c heteroatom 4 1 mainly nitrogen mean c n 6 9 and sulfur mean c s 6 0 further screening data will help to better define the molecular properties that govern aquatic mobility among the newly detected pm candidates anions and cations mainly used in ils make up a prominent group with tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate other fluorinated compounds and a larger number of tetraalkylammonium cations being most prominent ils in general are so far scarcely recognized as environmental contaminants toxicological data appear to be missing for many of the newly detected compounds so that a risk assessment or prioritization of pm chemicals is hampered however the closure of the toxicological data gap is imminently important in order to move from a precautionary to a risk based assessment to protect the environment and the human health for newly developed substances with pm properties toxicological data should be supplied at the time of registration hilic ms sfc ms and the sample preparation techniques applied herein may also be used for the non target screening for pm chemicals and yet unknown pm transformation products and build the basis for an effective monitoring of pm chemicals in the aquatic environment declaration of competing interest the authors

16677,pool water is continuously circulated and reused after an extensive treatment including disinfection by chlorination ozonation or uv treatment in germany these methods are regulated by din standard 19643 recently the din standard has been extended by a new disinfection method using hypobromous acid as disinfectant formed by introducing ozone into water with naturally or artificially high bromide content during water treatment in this study we tested the disinfection efficacy of the ozone bromine treatment in comparison to hypochlorous acid in a flow through test rig using the bacterial indicator strains escherichia coli enterococcus faecium pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and the viral indicators phage ms2 and phage prd1 furthermore the formation of disinfection by products and their potential toxic effects were investigated in eight pool water samples using different disinfection methods including the ozone bromine treatment our results show that the efficacy of hypobromous acid depending on its concentration and the tested organism is comparable to that of hypochlorous acid hypobromous acid was effective against five of six tested indicator organisms however using pseudomonas aeruginosa and drinking water as test water both tested disinfectants 0 6 mg l 1 as cl2 hypobromous acid as well as 0 3 mg l 1 as cl2 hypochlorous acid did not achieve a reduction of four log10 levels within 30 s as required by din 19643 the formation of brominated disinfection by products depends primarily on the bromide concentration of the filling water with the treatment method having a smaller effect the eight pool water samples did not show critical values in vitro for acute cytotoxicity or genotoxicity in the applied assays in real pool water samples the acute toxicological potential was not higher than for conventional disinfection methods however for a final assessment of toxicity all single substance toxicities of known dbps present in pool water treated by the ozone bromine treatment have to be analyzed additionally graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dbps hypobromous acid disinfection test rig din 19643 cytotoxicity genotoxicity 1 introduction swimming pools are associated with numerous leisure and sportive activities and importantly with clear water to minimize the risk of infection caused by microbial hazards released into pool water water treatment including filtration and disinfection is of great importance in germany approved treatment methods are regulated in the din standard 19643 1 treatment of water of swimming pools and baths they include the disinfection by active chlorine released from either chlorine gas sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite and disinfection by chlorine in combination with a prior ozone dosage during the treatment process din 19643 3 in addition din 19643 5 covers process combinations using bromine as disinfectant which is produced by ozonation of bromide rich or bromide enriched water for the ozone bromine treatment ozone is introduced into water with high bromide content the ozone reacts completely with bromide to hypobromous acid which forms the actual disinfectant von gunten 2003 1 o3 br h2o hobr o2 oh when reacting with organic compounds in the pool hypobromous acid is reduced and bromide is released resulting in bromide being available again for the formation of hypobromous acid hoffmann 2015 von gunten 2003 a minimum content of bromide has to be present in the water 20 mg l 1 for indoor and 40 mg l 1 for outdoor pools to ensure a complete ozone consumption before the water enters the pool din 19643 5 a sufficient bromide concentration has to be ensured and if too low increased by the addition of sodium bromide no bromide has to be added to sea water pools which use the natural bromide content of sea water ranging from 65 to 71 mg kg 1 flury and papritz 1993 likewise brine baths can have natural bromide concentrations greater than 20 mg l 1 hoffmann 2015 even in pools where chlorinated disinfectants are used hypobromous acid is formed in the presence of high bromide concentrations due to the reaction of hypochlorous acid with bromide 2 hocl br cl hobr apart from the release of bromide disinfection by products dbps such as bromoform and bromate are formed during ozone bromine treatment hoffmann 2015 von gunten 2003 brominated dbps can be formed during all oxidative water treatments of drinking and pool water including chlorination and ozonation as long as bromide is present heeb et al 2014 more than 600 dbps have been identified in pool water most of them halogenated yeh et al 2014 they include numerous chlorinated and brominated haloacids halomethanes haloacetonitriles haloaldehydes haloketones halonitromethanes haloamides haloalcohols and halophenols manasfi et al 2016 richardson et al 2010 zwiener et al 2007 due to the high input of precursors such as nitrogen containing substances from bathers urine sweat and skin cells and in the case of outdoor pools natural organic matter the number and quantity of dbps formed in pool water have been shown to be much higher compared to those found in drinking water treated by disinfection richardson et al 2010 zwiener et al 2007 accordingly many studies focus on possible adverse health effects associated with the exposure to pool water as well as on the toxicity and mutagenicity of pool water and selected dbps daiber et al 2016 winid 2015 the comparison of different halogenated dbps has shown that brominated dbps are more toxic than analogous chlorinated compounds muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008 a study on the toxicity of nitrogen containing dbps revealed that brominated haloacetonitriles have higher cytotoxic and genotoxic potency than analogous chlorinated dbps muellner et al 2007 furthermore the examination of enriched water samples has shown higher genotoxic potencies of brominated than of chlorinated pool waters treated by 1 bromo 3 chloro 5 5 dimethylhydantoin forming hypobromous and hypochlorous acid as disinfectants daiber et al 2016 liviac et al 2010 in contrast a study by richardson et al 2010 shows comparable mutagenic potencies of pool water treated with bromine versus chlorine due to the high levels of bromide present in barcelona source waters the dbps formed in brominated and chlorinated pools and their concentrations were very similar with the exception of bromoform concentrations being much higher in brominated pools richardson et al 2010 apart from the toxicological evaluation the efficacy of recently standardized treatment processes compared to established chemicals and techniques has to be assessed since the efficacy is the decisive factor for the application concentration and correlating formation of dbps for the assessment of pool disinfectant efficacies the organization for economic co operation and development oecd has published guidance for demonstrating efficacy of pool and spa disinfectants in laboratory and field testing oecd 2012 the oecd guidance recommends laboratory tests in flow through mode and sets efficacy criteria for specific bacteria viruses and protozoa as test organisms oecd 2012 in germany the din standard 19643 1 sets an efficacy criterion concerning the germ killing of pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa according to the echa guidance on biocidal products regulation efficacy assessment and evaluation echa 2018 the oecd guidance has to be applied for efficacy tests as part of the european biocide regulation european parliament and council 2012 to our knowledge the efficacy of the ozone bromine treatment has not yet been tested in accordance with the oecd guidance in our study we investigated the disinfectant efficacy of the ozone bromine treatment in a flow through test rig using the bacterial indicator strains escherichia coli e coli enterococcus faecium e faecium p aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus s aureus and the corresponding performance characteristics according to the oecd guidance instead of pathogenic human viruses adenoviruses and rotaviruses non pathogenic surrogate viruses bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 were tested as viral indicators the efficacy of the ozone bromine treatment was compared to that of hypochlorous acid determined by control tests in addition random pool water samples were taken from eight different pools in germany which use ozone bromine and conventional chlorine disinfection we identified brominated and chlorinated dbps and tested cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the pool water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 efficacy tests 2 1 1 disinfectant test rig efficacy tests were performed in a flow through test rig based on the test specification for the quantitative determination of the efficacy of drinking water disinfectants of the german environment agency umweltbundesamt uba umweltbundesamt 2010 for a detailed description of the setup and characteristic properties of the semi technical test rig see grunert et al 2018 the test rig consists of a pvc pipe with a steady volumetric flow of 400 l h 1 test organisms bacteria bacteriophages and disinfectants were injected into the water with the addition of the disinfectant marking the starting point of disinfection to determine the concentration of the disinfectant and to investigate the reduction of test organisms samples were taken at the sampling taps along the pipe after defined contact times between disinfectant and test organisms during sampling the disinfection process in the microbiological samples of 50 ml was stopped by adding 40 µl of 10 sodium thiosulphate for an immediate reduction of the present disinfectant 2 1 2 test water treated groundwater with drinking water quality treated by the waterworks of the uba in berlin marienfelde germany was used as test water and was stored in a 20 m3 tank the ph was adjusted to 7 0 7 2 by the addition of hydrochloric acid hcl and the temperature was set to 28 c by the heating cooling unit lauda integral xt 1850 w lauda königshofen germany the doc was set to 2 mg l 1 by dilution with deionized water initial doc of 3 0 3 4 mg l 1 doc was measured using the toc measurement system gröger obst go toc 100 wolfratshausen germany 2 1 3 test organisms ideal indicator organisms are non pathogenic while their presence points to a fecal contamination and thus a potential health risk in accordance with the oecd guidance the reduction of the bacterial strains e coli e faecium p aeruginosa and s aureus was investigated oecd 2012 due to safety reasons it was not possible to carry out tests with legionella adenoviruses and rotaviruses as recommended by the guidance instead the efficacy against viruses was tested using the bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 as surrogate viruses with prd1 showing properties very similar to human adenoviruses bamford et al 1991 poranenet al 2015 without being infectious for humans the sensitivities of the bacteriophages do not necessarily have to coincide with those of the viruses since evaluation of efficacy is based on the direct comparison of hypochlorous acid and hypobromous acid the bacterial strains e coli a3 gram negative dsm 110652 e faecium teltow 11 gram positive dsm 110643 p aeruginosa atcc 15442 a standard indicator for bacteria in pool water din 19643 1 and s aureus atcc 6538 were used as test organisms the bacteriophages ms2 atcc 15597 b f specific rna phage dsm 13767 and prd1 somatic dna phage dsm 19107 were used as viral indicators the bacterial strains e coli a3 and e faecium teltow 11 were isolated from sludge of the teltow canal in berlin germany working cultures of p aeruginosa and s aureus stored at 80 c 10 c were streaked out on tryptic soy agar tsa and transferred to bouillon tryptic soy broth tsb the cultures were incubated for 20 h at 36 c all cultures except for s aureus were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min the pellet was rinsed twice with water and afterwards resuspended as s aureus aggregates easily which can reduce the efficacy of the disinfectant s aureus suspension was added without prior centrifugation and washing to the test water together with the nutrient medium resulting in a higher doc of the test water 2 3 mg l 1 instead of 1 9 mg l 1 the test organisms were added into a receiver tank of the test rig e coli e faecium and ms2 were added together whereas tests with p aeruginosa s aureus and prd1 were each conducted separately the suspensions of test organisms were added to the test water in a ratio of 1 1000 resulting in concentrations of 105 106 cfu 100 ml 1 for the bacteria and 106 108 pfu 100 ml 1 for the bacteriophages the standardized methods used for the analysis of test organisms are shown in table a1 supporting information enrichment by membrane filtration as described in iso 16266 was not used for p aeruginosa due to the high bacteria concentration instead samples were dispersed onto a solid selective cetrimide containing culture media using a cell spreader for s aureus a coagulase test according to iso 6888 1 was not necessary since the bacteria strain was known 2 1 4 disinfectants for the ozone bromine treatment bromine was generated in situ by introducing ozone into a bromide solution ozone was produced on site from ambient air by silent electrical discharge by a standard commercial ozone generator ozone was continuously added into a circular flow of bromide containing water 290 mg l 1 nabr in excess by factor 5 for complete ozone consumption to prevent ozone leakage until a bromine concentration of approx 40 mg l 1 measured as cl2 equivalent was reached the ph of the stock solution was stabilized in a range of 6 5 6 8 by continuous addition of 0 05 molar sulphuric acid bromate formation inside the stock solution could be kept low with concentrations in the range of 120 to 250 µg l 1 the bromine stock solution was dosed into the test rig with concentrations of 0 4 mg l 1 as cl2 equivalent for e coli e faecium bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 treatment and 0 6 mg l 1 as cl2 equivalent for p aeruginosa and s aureus treatment the concentration of free bromine in the samples was determined photometrically after addition of n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine dpd according to iso 7393 2 the measured values are given as chlorine equivalents indicated as mg l 1 as cl2 for control tests with hypochlorous acid a stock solution of sodium hypochlorite naocl 2 3 g l 1 as cl2 was dosed into the disinfectant test rig with a concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 as cl2 the exact concentration of the stock solution was determined by titration according to iso 7393 3 the concentration of cl2 in the samples was determined photometrically with dpd according to iso 7393 2 2 2 pool water analysis 2 2 1 pool water sampling and concentration pool water samples were taken from the fill water and the pool water of eight pools located in several german states one random sample per pool in accordance with the quality management system of iso 17025 the pools differed in the bromide concentrations of the fill water and the disinfection methods pools 1 and 2 had low bromide concentrations and used chlorine disinfection in the form of chlorine gas pools 3 6 used ozone bromine treatment and pools 7 and 8 used sea water with high bromide concentrations and used chlorine disinfection chlorine gas for pool 7 and chlorine generation by direct electrolysis of seawater for pool 8 samples were transported cooled to the laboratory and were analyzed as soon as possible the on site parameters active disinfectant measured as cl2 ph and redox potential orp were monitored by the electronic surveillance systems of the

samples could only be performed once in duplicates with metabolic activation 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfectant efficacy the efficacy of hypobromous acid formed by ozone bromine treatment against indicator organisms was investigated according to the efficacy criteria of the oecd guidance and compared to that of hypochlorous acid the efficacy criteria of the oecd guidance provide numbers of log10 reductions for the test organisms which have to be achieved within a stated time of exposure to the tested disinfectant oecd 2012 based on these criteria slightly modified for viral indicators the efficacy of hypobromous acid was evaluated table 1 hypobromous acid was used with a concentration of 0 4 mg l 1 as cl2 except against p aeruginosa and s aureus where 0 6 mg l 1 as cl2 were used in comparative measurements of efficacy with hypochlorous acid a concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 as cl2 was used this concentration is in line with din 19643 1 which states that a chlorine content of at least 0 3 mg l 1 as cl2 has to be maintained in pools a concentration of 0 6 mg l 1 as cl2 represents the upper value of the disinfectant concentration in pools in germany accordingly chlorine was applied with the lowest possible concentration which is expected to be sufficient while bromine was dosed in higher concentrations to ensure a sufficient efficacy in the first evaluation of the disinfectant depending on the ph bromine and chlorine are present in varying proportions in the state of hypobromous acid and hypobromite pka 8 8 haag and hoigne 1983 and of hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite pka 7 5 von gunten 2003 respectively with increasing ph the proportion of hypobromite and hypochlorite increases resulting in decreasing disinfectant efficacies brugger 2014 at ph 7 0 7 2 hypobromous acid and hypochlorous acid are mainly present in their undissociated state with only small amounts of hypobromite and hypochlorite in comparison to hypobromite the quantity of hypochlorite is higher due to the lower pka value implying that similar concentrations of bromine and chlorine disinfectants result in higher concentrations of hypobromous acid than of hypochlorous acid hypobromous acid and hypochlorous acid are effective against e coli and e faecium in accordance with the oecd guidance as well as against the bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 fig 1 the ct value an important parameter for disinfectant efficacy is the product of the concentration of a disinfectant and the contact time the ct99 value defines a reduction of the test organisms by two log10 levels considering the ct99 value e coli e faecium and bacteriophages prd1 show similar sensitivity to hypobromous acid as to hypochlorous acid whereas bacteriophages ms2 are more sensitive to hypobromous acid than to hypochlorous acid table 1 regarding p aeruginosa neither hypobromous acid nor hypochlorous acid reached a reduction of four log10 levels within 30 s as defined by the oecd guidance and din 19643 1 furthermore the tests with p aeruginosa showed higher standard deviations compared to the tests with other organisms the low disinfectant efficacy and high standard deviation of the tests could be due to an aggregation and shielding of the bacteria however no aggregation was recognizable under the microscope regarding s auerus 0 6 mg l 1 as cl2 hypobromous acid met the criteria while using 0 3 mg l 1 as cl2 hypochlorous acid resulted in a very low reduction of less than one log10 level within 30 s fig 1 it is likely that s auerus in contrast to the other tested organisms is capable of neutralizing and repairing oxidative damage caused by hypochlorous acid maalej et al 2006 found four members of the perr regulon encoding proteins with antioxidant properties for s auerus which were strongly induced as a response to hypochlorous acid exposure however to our knowledge potential differences in the response of s auerus to hypochlorous acid and to hypobromous acid have not been investigated yet apart from process parameters such as temperature and ph the doc represents a decisive factor of a disinfectant s efficacy the doc and its composition strongly contribute to the consumption of a disinfectant in pools the doc originates from filling water as well as from human body fluids introduced by swimmers kanan and karanfil 2011 it can be assumed that the fresh doc originating from swimmers causes high consumption of the disinfectants in contrast the doc of the filling water is continuously circulated and oxidized in the pool and its treatment system reaching a steady state composition of circulated oxidized doc and fresh doc from newly added filling water however a comprehensive evaluation concerning the amount of doc and its reactivity is difficult since the doc strongly depends on the filling water quality and origin the number of swimmers as well as on the pool water treatments for instance kanan 2010 reported an average toc concentration of 7 4 mg l 1 investigating 23 public swimming pools in the us with calcium hypochlorite disinfection and electrolysis of sodium chloride the din criterion of the inactivation of p aeruginosa is based on a study of seidel et al 1991 which does not provide any details on the doc of the pool water used in the experiments for our tests drinking water with a doc of 1 9 to 2 3 mg l 1 was used which can be classified as moderate filling water regarding the concentration composition and expected reactivity however the test water was not pre oxidized as is the case for circulated pool water leading to a higher consumption of the disinfectants the log10 reduction over the ct value allows a direct comparison of the efficacies of the tested disinfectants regardless of their consumption and initial concentrations hypobromous acid showed an efficacy similar to that of hypochlorous acid against e coli e faecium and bacteriophages prd1 and even higher efficacies against s aureus and bacteriophages ms2 fig a1 supporting information regarding p aeruginosa and s aureus it is questionable whether the minimum disinfectant concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 as cl2 as required in din 19463 1 is sufficient since the reduction of four log10 levels within 30 s could not be achieved under the given conditions for hypochlorous acid 3 2 occurrence of brominated disinfection by products the presence of dissolved bromide in pool water leads to the formation of bromine containing dbps bromine is formed by the reaction of bromide with oxidizing disinfectants such as ozone and chlorine resulting in the formation of brominated dbps furthermore in pools using chlorinated disinfectants hypobromous acid can be formed by the reaction with bromide and functions as the actual disinfectant pool 7 and 8 our results show that low bromide contents of the fill water as in pool 1 and 2 lead to a minor contribution of brominated species to thm while high bromide contents pool 3 8 result mainly or entirely in the formation of bromoform table 2 and fig 2 absolute concentrations shown in fig a2 supporting information in a previous study investigating dbp formation with a focus on thm in bromide containing sea water pools disinfected with chlorine a tendency towards brominated dbp species at bromide levels above 10 mg l 1 was shown as well jentsch and matthiessen 1998 hence despite applying chlorine as disinfectant dbp forming reactions are determined by the participation of bromine and the formation of hypobromous acid organic compounds such as nitrogen containing substances from bathers and in the case of outdoor pools natural organic matter are the main precursors of dbp formation their concentration in pool water as well as the concentration of organic dbps is determined as total organic carbon toc the investigated pools showed toc concentrations ranging from 0 8 to 4 3 mg l 1 table 2 by measuring selected dbps a positive relationship between dbps and toc concentration could be shown for most pools despite the dbps only representing a small part of the toc fig 3 thus the results indicate that organic precursors as a part of the toc have a great impact on dbp formation for pool water quality monitoring thm concentrations are commonly measured and often used as sole indicator compounds for the evaluation of dbps din 19643 haloacetonitriles and haloacetic acids are both precursors of thm contributing by hydrolysis and or decarboxylation to the formation of thm glezer et al 1999 verhoek 1934 our results show an almost linear correlation of the sum concentration of dbps investigated in this study thm haloacetic acids trichloroacetic acid tribromoacetic acid dichloroacetic acid and dibromoacetic acid and haloacetonitriles dichloroacetonitrile and dibromoacetonitrile and the thm concentration fig 4 as an exception pool 6 which had the highest thm concentration 40 7 µg l 1 shows an unexpectedly high dbp concentration fig 4 this example indicates that thm are not in all cases representative for the total concentration of dbp comparing the sum concentration of trihaloacetic acids as tca equivalents with the thm concentration shows an almost linear correlation as well fig a3 supporting information our results show that despite the very heterogenous samples of pools differing in the filling water quality the disinfection method and the bather load correlations between different dbp groups are apparent din standard 19643 1 defines a concentration of 20 µg l 1 24 µg l 1 considering a tolerance of 20 as an upper value for chloroform equivalents which is very low compared to current drinking water standards e g 50 µg l 1 by the german drinking water ordinance hence five four considering the tolerance factor of the eight investigated pools have thm concentrations which are too high according to the requirements of the technical standard these enhanced thm concentrations are not necessarily caused by high bromide concentrations but might be the result of an increased input of organic precursors to the respective pools interestingly the bromide concentration of pool 4 is unexpectedly low table 2 considering its application of the ozone bromine treatment its chlorate content suggests a temporary malfunction of the treatment system and the addition of a chlorine containing disinfectant regarding chlorate and bromate inorganic dbps of toxicological relevance the measured concentrations of all pools are below the upper values of the current din standard 19643 1 30 mg l 1 for the sum of chlorite and chlorate and 2 mg l 1 for bromate except for pool 8 which uses sea water treated with chlorine table 2 while the chlorate concentration of pool 8 is still below 30 mg l 1 the bromate concentration exceeds the value of 2 mg l 1 almost by factor 5 the echa guidance on biocidal products regulation guidance on disinfection by products even defines a limit value of only 0 1 mg l 1 for bromate echa 2017 thus according to the echa guidance pool 3 and 6 showed elevated bromate concentrations as well technologically it is possible to keep the bromate concentration of bromide containing and ozone treated pool waters at very low concentrations by strict ph regulation at 6 8 7 2 or if necessary by sufficient dilution via addition of accurately treated fresh water umweltbundesamt 2014 overall our findings showed that the presence of bromide in filling water leads to higher formation of brominated dbps compared to that of chlorinated analogous dbps thus we conclude that the treatment method plays a secondary role in the dbp formation however when applying the ozone bromine treatment chlorine containing dbps were completely absent 3 3 toxicity of ozone bromine treated pool water cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were tested as composite toxicities of the whole pool water samples diluted by the nutrient solution cytotoxicity which was tested based on intracellular ros was not detected for any of the pool water samples using either dhe or dcfh da assays table 3 genotoxicity which was tested by the ames test in the salmonella tester strains ta 98 and ta 100 and a micronucleus test in the cell line hepg2 did not show any positive result for the samples concentrated by factor 1 000 in contrast the native samples of the sea water pools pool 7 and 8 showed slight toxicity reaching values above 2 0 since the genotoxicity was detected for both pool water and filling water samples it can be assumed that it was not caused by the disinfection process but rather by the high salt concentrations of the filling water this is further confirmed by the negative test results of the concentrated water samples where the salts are permanently restrained by the xad resins resulting in low salt concentrates thus the pool water and the filling water samples of the eight pools did not show either cytotoxicity or genotoxicity using the listed assays surprisingly not even pool 8 with an elevated bromate concentration of 9 95 mg l 1 table 2 showed toxicity after subtraction of the value of the filling water usually the toxicological evaluation of single substances by the ames test and the micronucleus test is conducted at concentrations of up to 5 g per test plate 5 g l 1 or up to the solubility concentration the measured bromate concentration was about one magnitude lower than 5 g l 1 thus the toxicity of the substance mixture in the pool water could have been too low to detect differences in the toxicological effects between the pool water samples therefore it is recommended that in future studies a final toxicity assessment should be based on the toxicity evaluation of the single dbps to achieve higher sensitivity such single substance toxicity assessments should be based on data of several in vitro as wells as of in vivo studies 4 conclusion the ozone bromine treatment is a newly standardized disinfection method for pool water according to the din standard 19643 ozone is introduced into water with high bromide content and reacts with bromide to hypobromous acid the actual active disinfectant with depot effect in the pool the efficacy of chemicals used as disinfectants for pool and spa water as well as for drinking water has to be assessed with regard to compliance with hygienic requirements in this study the disinfectant efficacy of hypobromous acid against the indicator organisms e coli e faecium p aeruginosa s aureus ms2 and prd1 was tested in comparison to hypochlorous acid the efficacy of hypobromous acid was comparable to that of hypochlorous acid or in case of s aureus and bacteriophages ms2 even higher hypobromous acid dosed with a concentration of 0 4 and 0 6 mg l 1 as cl2 met the conditions defined in the oecd guidance for demonstrating efficacy of pool and spa disinfectants in laboratory and field testing for a concentration of 1 mg l 1 disinfectant as cl2 for all organisms except p aeruginosa for p aeruginosa a reduction of only 3 5 instead of 4 log10 levels was reached within 30 s under the test conditions even hypochlorous acid did not meet the reduction criterion for p aeruginosa the sole indicator organism of din 19643 1 further investigations taking the doc concentration composition and reactivity into account are necessary to evaluate whether the minimum disinfectant concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 as cl2 required in din 19463 1 is sufficient to reach the reduction criterion water samples of pools with high bromide concentrations in the fill water showed the predominant formation of brominated thm species mainly bromoform in contrast the treatment method had a smaller effect on the formation of chlorinated or of brominated thms being favored regarding the total amount of all investigated dbps the toc of the water representing organic precursors with a specific dbp forming potential was shown to be the predominant factor of dbp formation the investigated pool water samples did not show critical values in vitro for cytotoxicity or genotoxicity however the applied methods for the assessment of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity have been established and optimized for the evaluation of single compounds therefore their sensitivity might be not high enough to ultimately assess the composite toxicity of whole water samples in conclusion the disinfection efficacy of the ozone bromine treatment is comparable to that of conventional disinfection methods using hypochlorous acid in vitro toxicity tests with whole pool water samples disinfected by the ozone bromine treatment showed no increased toxicological potential despite literature data on the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of single brominated vs chlorinated compounds suggesting otherwise for a final toxicity assessment of the treatment method

16677,pool water is continuously circulated and reused after an extensive treatment including disinfection by chlorination ozonation or uv treatment in germany these methods are regulated by din standard 19643 recently the din standard has been extended by a new disinfection method using hypobromous acid as disinfectant formed by introducing ozone into water with naturally or artificially high bromide content during water treatment in this study we tested the disinfection efficacy of the ozone bromine treatment in comparison to hypochlorous acid in a flow through test rig using the bacterial indicator strains escherichia coli enterococcus faecium pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and the viral indicators phage ms2 and phage prd1 furthermore the formation of disinfection by products and their potential toxic effects were investigated in eight pool water samples using different disinfection methods including the ozone bromine treatment our results show that the efficacy of hypobromous acid depending on its concentration and the tested organism is comparable to that of hypochlorous acid hypobromous acid was effective against five of six tested indicator organisms however using pseudomonas aeruginosa and drinking water as test water both tested disinfectants 0 6 mg l 1 as cl2 hypobromous acid as well as 0 3 mg l 1 as cl2 hypochlorous acid did not achieve a reduction of four log10 levels within 30 s as required by din 19643 the formation of brominated disinfection by products depends primarily on the bromide concentration of the filling water with the treatment method having a smaller effect the eight pool water samples did not show critical values in vitro for acute cytotoxicity or genotoxicity in the applied assays in real pool water samples the acute toxicological potential was not higher than for conventional disinfection methods however for a final assessment of toxicity all single substance toxicities of known dbps present in pool water treated by the ozone bromine treatment have to be analyzed additionally graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dbps hypobromous acid disinfection test rig din 19643 cytotoxicity genotoxicity 1 introduction swimming pools are associated with numerous leisure and sportive activities and importantly with clear water to minimize the risk of infection caused by microbial hazards released into pool water water treatment including filtration and disinfection is of great importance in germany approved treatment methods are regulated in the din standard 19643 1 treatment of water of swimming pools and baths they include the disinfection by active chlorine released from either chlorine gas sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite and disinfection by chlorine in combination with a prior ozone dosage during the treatment process din 19643 3 in addition din 19643 5 covers process combinations using bromine as disinfectant which is produced by ozonation of bromide rich or bromide enriched water for the ozone bromine treatment ozone is introduced into water with high bromide content the ozone reacts completely with bromide to hypobromous acid which forms the actual disinfectant von gunten 2003 1 o3 br h2o hobr o2 oh when reacting with organic compounds in the pool hypobromous acid is reduced and bromide is released resulting in bromide being available again for the formation of hypobromous acid hoffmann 2015 von gunten 2003 a minimum content of bromide has to be present in the water 20 mg l 1 for indoor and 40 mg l 1 for outdoor pools to ensure a complete ozone consumption before the water enters the pool din 19643 5 a sufficient bromide concentration has to be ensured and if too low increased by the addition of sodium bromide no bromide has to be added to sea water pools which use the natural bromide content of sea water ranging from 65 to 71 mg kg 1 flury and papritz 1993 likewise brine baths can have natural bromide concentrations greater than 20 mg l 1 hoffmann 2015 even in pools where chlorinated disinfectants are used hypobromous acid is formed in the presence of high bromide concentrations due to the reaction of hypochlorous acid with bromide 2 hocl br cl hobr apart from the release of bromide disinfection by products dbps such as bromoform and bromate are formed during ozone bromine treatment hoffmann 2015 von gunten 2003 brominated dbps can be formed during all oxidative water treatments of drinking and pool water including chlorination and ozonation as long as bromide is present heeb et al 2014 more than 600 dbps have been identified in pool water most of them halogenated yeh et al 2014 they include numerous chlorinated and brominated haloacids halomethanes haloacetonitriles haloaldehydes haloketones halonitromethanes haloamides haloalcohols and halophenols manasfi et al 2016 richardson et al 2010 zwiener et al 2007 due to the high input of precursors such as nitrogen containing substances from bathers urine sweat and skin cells and in the case of outdoor pools natural organic matter the number and quantity of dbps formed in pool water have been shown to be much higher compared to those found in drinking water treated by disinfection richardson et al 2010 zwiener et al 2007 accordingly many studies focus on possible adverse health effects associated with the exposure to pool water as well as on the toxicity and mutagenicity of pool water and selected dbps daiber et al 2016 winid 2015 the comparison of different halogenated dbps has shown that brominated dbps are more toxic than analogous chlorinated compounds muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008 a study on the toxicity of nitrogen containing dbps revealed that brominated haloacetonitriles have higher cytotoxic and genotoxic potency than analogous chlorinated dbps muellner et al 2007 furthermore the examination of enriched water samples has shown higher genotoxic potencies of brominated than of chlorinated pool waters treated by 1 bromo 3 chloro 5 5 dimethylhydantoin forming hypobromous and hypochlorous acid as disinfectants daiber et al 2016 liviac et al 2010 in contrast a study by richardson et al 2010 shows comparable mutagenic potencies of pool water treated with bromine versus chlorine due to the high levels of bromide present in barcelona source waters the dbps formed in brominated and chlorinated pools and their concentrations were very similar with the exception of bromoform concentrations being much higher in brominated pools richardson et al 2010 apart from the toxicological evaluation the efficacy of recently standardized treatment processes compared to established chemicals and techniques has to be assessed since the efficacy is the decisive factor for the application concentration and correlating formation of dbps for the assessment of pool disinfectant efficacies the organization for economic co operation and development oecd has published guidance for demonstrating efficacy of pool and spa disinfectants in laboratory and field testing oecd 2012 the oecd guidance recommends laboratory tests in flow through mode and sets efficacy criteria for specific bacteria viruses and protozoa as test organisms oecd 2012 in germany the din standard 19643 1 sets an efficacy criterion concerning the germ killing of pseudomonas

the european biocide regulation european parliament and council 2012 to our knowledge the efficacy of the ozone bromine treatment has not yet been tested in accordance with the oecd guidance in our study we investigated the disinfectant efficacy of the ozone bromine treatment in a flow through test rig using the bacterial indicator strains escherichia coli e coli enterococcus faecium e faecium p aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus s aureus and the corresponding performance characteristics according to the oecd guidance instead of pathogenic human viruses adenoviruses and rotaviruses non pathogenic surrogate viruses bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 were tested as viral indicators the efficacy of the ozone bromine treatment was compared to that of hypochlorous acid determined by control tests in addition random pool water samples were taken from eight different pools in germany which use ozone bromine and conventional chlorine disinfection we identified brominated and chlorinated dbps and tested cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the pool water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 efficacy tests 2 1 1 disinfectant test rig efficacy tests were performed in a flow through test rig based on the test specification for the quantitative determination of the efficacy of drinking water disinfectants of the german environment agency umweltbundesamt uba umweltbundesamt 2010 for a detailed description of the setup and characteristic properties of the semi technical test rig see grunert et al 2018 the test rig consists of a pvc pipe with a steady volumetric flow of 400 l h 1 test organisms bacteria bacteriophages and disinfectants were injected into the water with the addition of the disinfectant marking the starting point of disinfection to determine the concentration of the disinfectant and to investigate the reduction of test organisms samples were taken at the sampling taps along the pipe after defined contact times between disinfectant and test organisms during sampling the disinfection process in the microbiological samples of 50 ml was stopped by adding 40 µl of 10 sodium thiosulphate for an immediate reduction of the present disinfectant 2 1 2 test water treated groundwater with drinking water quality treated by the waterworks of the uba in berlin marienfelde germany was used as test water and was stored in a 20 m3 tank the ph was adjusted to 7 0 7 2 by the addition of hydrochloric acid hcl and the temperature was set to 28 c by the heating cooling unit lauda integral xt 1850 w lauda königshofen germany the doc was set to 2 mg l 1 by dilution with deionized water initial doc of 3 0 3 4 mg l 1 doc was measured using the toc measurement system gröger obst go toc 100 wolfratshausen germany 2 1 3 test organisms ideal indicator organisms are non pathogenic while their presence points to a fecal contamination and thus a potential health risk in accordance with the oecd guidance the reduction of the bacterial strains e coli e faecium p aeruginosa and s aureus was investigated oecd 2012 due to safety reasons it was not possible to carry out tests with legionella adenoviruses and rotaviruses as recommended by the guidance instead the efficacy against viruses was tested using the bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 as surrogate viruses with prd1 showing properties very similar to human adenoviruses bamford et al 1991 poranenet al 2015 without being infectious for humans the sensitivities of the bacteriophages do not necessarily have to coincide with those of the viruses since evaluation of efficacy is based on the direct comparison of hypochlorous acid and hypobromous acid the bacterial strains e coli a3 gram negative dsm 110652 e faecium teltow 11 gram positive dsm 110643 p aeruginosa atcc 15442 a standard indicator for bacteria in pool water din 19643 1 and s aureus atcc 6538 were used as test organisms the bacteriophages ms2 atcc 15597 b f specific rna phage dsm 13767 and prd1 somatic dna phage dsm 19107 were used as viral indicators the bacterial strains e coli a3 and e faecium teltow 11 were isolated from sludge of the teltow canal in berlin germany working cultures of p aeruginosa and s aureus stored at 80 c 10 c were streaked out on tryptic soy agar tsa and transferred to bouillon tryptic soy broth tsb the cultures were incubated for 20 h at 36 c all cultures except for s aureus were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min the pellet was rinsed twice with water and afterwards resuspended as s aureus aggregates easily which can reduce the efficacy of the disinfectant s aureus suspension was added without prior centrifugation and washing to the test water together with the nutrient medium resulting in a higher doc of the test water 2 3 mg l 1 instead of 1 9 mg l 1 the test organisms were added into a receiver tank of the test rig e coli e faecium and ms2 were added together whereas tests with p aeruginosa s aureus and prd1 were each conducted separately the suspensions of test organisms were added to the test water in a ratio of 1 1000 resulting in concentrations of 105 106 cfu 100 ml 1 for the bacteria and 106 108 pfu 100 ml 1 for the bacteriophages the standardized methods used for the analysis of test organisms are shown in table a1 supporting information enrichment by membrane filtration as described in iso 16266 was not used for p aeruginosa due to the high bacteria concentration instead samples were dispersed onto a solid selective cetrimide containing culture media using a cell spreader for s aureus a coagulase test according to iso 6888 1 was not necessary since the bacteria strain was known 2 1 4 disinfectants for the ozone bromine treatment bromine was generated in situ by introducing ozone into a bromide solution ozone was produced on site from ambient air by silent electrical discharge by a standard commercial ozone generator ozone was continuously added into a circular flow of bromide containing water 290 mg l 1 nabr in excess by factor 5 for complete ozone consumption to prevent ozone leakage until a bromine concentration of approx 40 mg l 1 measured as cl2 equivalent was reached the ph of the stock solution was stabilized in a range of 6 5 6 8 by continuous addition of 0 05 molar sulphuric acid bromate formation inside the stock solution could be kept low with concentrations in the range of 120 to 250 µg l 1 the bromine stock solution was dosed into the test rig with concentrations of 0 4 mg l 1 as cl2 equivalent for e coli e faecium bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 treatment and 0 6 mg l 1 as cl2 equivalent for p aeruginosa and s aureus treatment the concentration of free bromine in the samples was determined photometrically after addition of n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine dpd according to iso 7393 2 the measured values are given as chlorine equivalents indicated as mg l 1 as cl2 for control tests with hypochlorous acid a stock solution of sodium hypochlorite naocl 2 3 g l 1 as cl2 was dosed into the disinfectant test rig with a concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 as cl2 the exact concentration of the stock solution was determined by titration according to iso 7393 3 the concentration of cl2 in the samples was determined photometrically with dpd according to iso 7393 2 2 2 pool water analysis 2 2 1 pool water sampling and concentration pool water samples were taken from the fill water and the pool water of eight pools located in several german states one random sample per pool in accordance with the quality management system of iso 17025 the pools differed in the bromide concentrations of the fill water and the disinfection methods pools 1 and 2 had low bromide concentrations and used chlorine disinfection in the form of chlorine gas pools 3 6 used ozone bromine treatment and pools 7 and 8 used sea water with high bromide concentrations and used chlorine disinfection chlorine gas for pool 7 and chlorine generation by direct electrolysis of seawater for pool 8 samples were transported cooled to the laboratory and were analyzed as soon as possible the on site parameters active disinfectant measured as cl2 ph and redox potential orp were monitored by the electronic surveillance systems of the

against indicator organisms was investigated according to the efficacy criteria of the oecd guidance and compared to that of hypochlorous acid the efficacy criteria of the oecd guidance provide numbers of log10 reductions for the test organisms which have to be achieved within a stated time of exposure to the tested disinfectant oecd 2012 based on these criteria slightly modified for viral indicators the efficacy of hypobromous acid was evaluated table 1 hypobromous acid was used with a concentration of 0 4 mg l 1 as cl2 except against p aeruginosa and s aureus where 0 6 mg l 1 as cl2 were used in comparative measurements of efficacy with hypochlorous acid a concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 as cl2 was used this concentration is in line with din 19643 1 which states that a chlorine content of at least 0 3 mg l 1 as cl2 has to be maintained in pools a concentration of 0 6 mg l 1 as cl2 represents the upper value of the disinfectant concentration in pools in germany accordingly chlorine was applied with the lowest possible concentration which is expected to be sufficient while bromine was dosed in higher concentrations to ensure a sufficient efficacy in the first evaluation of the disinfectant depending on the ph bromine and chlorine are present in varying proportions in the state of hypobromous acid and hypobromite pka 8 8 haag and hoigne 1983 and of hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite pka 7 5 von gunten 2003 respectively with increasing ph the proportion of hypobromite and hypochlorite increases resulting in decreasing disinfectant efficacies brugger 2014 at ph 7 0 7 2 hypobromous acid and hypochlorous acid are mainly present in their undissociated state with only small amounts of hypobromite and hypochlorite in comparison to hypobromite the quantity of hypochlorite is higher due to the lower pka value implying that similar concentrations of bromine and chlorine disinfectants result in higher concentrations of hypobromous acid than of hypochlorous acid hypobromous acid and hypochlorous acid are effective against e coli and e faecium in accordance with the oecd guidance as well as against the bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 fig 1 the ct value an important parameter for disinfectant efficacy is the product of the concentration of a disinfectant and the contact time the ct99 value defines a reduction of the test organisms by two log10 levels considering the ct99 value e coli e faecium and bacteriophages prd1 show similar sensitivity to hypobromous acid as to hypochlorous acid whereas bacteriophages ms2 are more sensitive to hypobromous acid than to hypochlorous acid table 1 regarding p aeruginosa neither hypobromous acid nor hypochlorous acid reached a reduction of four log10 levels within 30 s as defined by the oecd guidance and din 19643 1 furthermore the tests with p aeruginosa showed higher standard deviations compared to the tests with other organisms the low disinfectant efficacy and high standard deviation of the tests could be due to an aggregation and shielding of the bacteria however no aggregation was recognizable under the microscope regarding s auerus 0 6 mg l 1 as cl2 hypobromous acid met the criteria while using 0 3 mg l 1 as cl2 hypochlorous acid resulted in a very low reduction of less than one log10 level within 30 s fig 1 it is likely that s auerus in contrast to the other tested organisms is capable of neutralizing and repairing oxidative damage caused by hypochlorous acid maalej et al 2006 found four members of the perr regulon encoding proteins with antioxidant properties for s auerus which were strongly induced as a response to hypochlorous acid exposure however to our knowledge potential differences in the response of s auerus to hypochlorous acid and to hypobromous acid have not been investigated yet apart from process parameters such as temperature and ph the doc represents a decisive factor of a disinfectant s efficacy the doc and its composition strongly contribute to the consumption of a disinfectant in pools the doc originates from filling water as well as from human body fluids introduced by swimmers kanan and karanfil 2011 it can be assumed that the fresh doc originating from swimmers causes high consumption of the disinfectants in contrast the doc of the filling water is continuously circulated and oxidized in the pool and its treatment system reaching a steady state composition of circulated oxidized doc and fresh doc from newly added filling water however a comprehensive evaluation concerning the amount of doc and its reactivity is difficult since the doc strongly depends on the filling water quality and origin the number of swimmers as well as on the pool water treatments for instance kanan 2010 reported an average toc concentration of 7 4 mg l 1 investigating 23 public swimming pools in the us with calcium hypochlorite disinfection and electrolysis of sodium chloride the din criterion of the inactivation of p aeruginosa is based on a study of seidel et al 1991 which does not provide any details on the doc of the pool water used in the experiments for our tests drinking water with a doc of 1 9 to 2 3 mg l 1 was used which can be classified as moderate filling water regarding the concentration composition and expected reactivity however the test water was not pre oxidized as is the case for circulated pool water leading to a higher consumption of the disinfectants the log10 reduction over the ct value allows a direct comparison of the efficacies of the tested disinfectants regardless of their consumption and initial concentrations hypobromous acid showed an efficacy similar to that of hypochlorous acid against e coli e faecium and bacteriophages prd1 and even higher efficacies against s aureus and bacteriophages ms2 fig a1 supporting information regarding p aeruginosa and s aureus it is questionable whether the minimum disinfectant concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 as cl2 as required in din 19463 1 is sufficient since the reduction of four log10 levels within 30 s could not be achieved under the given conditions for hypochlorous acid 3 2 occurrence of brominated disinfection by products the presence of dissolved bromide in pool water leads to the formation of bromine containing dbps bromine is formed by the reaction of bromide with oxidizing disinfectants such as ozone and chlorine resulting in the formation of brominated dbps furthermore in pools using chlorinated disinfectants hypobromous acid can be formed by the reaction with bromide and functions as the actual disinfectant pool 7 and 8 our results show that low bromide contents of the fill water as in pool 1 and 2 lead to a minor contribution of brominated species to thm while high bromide contents pool 3 8 result mainly or entirely in the formation of bromoform table 2 and fig 2 absolute concentrations shown in fig a2 supporting information in a previous study investigating dbp formation with a focus on thm in bromide containing sea water pools disinfected with chlorine a tendency towards brominated dbp species at bromide levels above 10 mg l 1 was shown as well jentsch and matthiessen 1998 hence despite applying chlorine as disinfectant dbp forming reactions are determined by the participation of bromine and the formation of hypobromous acid organic compounds such as nitrogen containing substances from bathers and in the case of outdoor pools natural organic matter are the main precursors of dbp formation their concentration in pool water as well as the concentration of organic dbps is determined as total organic carbon toc the investigated pools showed toc concentrations ranging from 0 8 to 4 3 mg l 1 table 2 by measuring selected dbps a positive relationship between dbps and toc concentration could be shown for most pools despite the dbps only representing a small part of the toc fig 3 thus the results indicate that organic precursors as a part of the toc have a great impact on dbp formation for pool water quality monitoring thm concentrations are commonly measured and often used as sole indicator compounds for the evaluation of dbps din 19643 haloacetonitriles and haloacetic acids are both precursors of thm contributing by hydrolysis and or decarboxylation to the formation of thm glezer et al 1999 verhoek 1934 our results show an almost linear correlation of the sum concentration of dbps investigated in this study thm haloacetic acids trichloroacetic acid tribromoacetic acid dichloroacetic acid and dibromoacetic acid and haloacetonitriles dichloroacetonitrile and dibromoacetonitrile and the thm concentration fig 4 as an exception pool 6 which had the highest thm concentration 40 7 µg l 1 shows an unexpectedly high dbp concentration fig 4 this example indicates that thm are not in all cases representative for the total concentration of dbp comparing the sum concentration of trihaloacetic acids as tca equivalents with the thm concentration shows an almost linear correlation as well fig a3 supporting information our results show that despite the very heterogenous samples of pools differing in the filling water quality the disinfection method and the bather load correlations between different dbp groups are apparent din standard 19643 1 defines a concentration of 20 µg l 1 24 µg l 1 considering a tolerance of 20 as an upper value for chloroform equivalents which is very low compared to current drinking water standards e g 50 µg l 1 by the german drinking water ordinance hence five four considering the tolerance factor of the eight investigated pools have thm concentrations which are too high according to the requirements of the technical standard these enhanced thm concentrations are not necessarily caused by high bromide concentrations but might be the result of an increased input of organic precursors to the respective pools interestingly the bromide concentration of pool 4 is unexpectedly low table 2 considering its application of the ozone bromine treatment its chlorate content suggests a temporary malfunction of the treatment system and the addition of a chlorine containing disinfectant regarding chlorate and bromate inorganic dbps of toxicological relevance the measured concentrations of all pools are below the upper values of the current din standard 19643 1 30 mg l 1 for the sum of chlorite and chlorate and 2 mg l 1 for bromate except for pool 8 which uses sea water treated with chlorine table 2 while the chlorate concentration of pool 8 is still below 30 mg l 1 the bromate concentration exceeds the value of 2 mg l 1 almost by factor 5 the echa guidance on biocidal products regulation guidance on disinfection by products even defines a limit value of only 0 1 mg l 1 for bromate echa 2017 thus according to the echa guidance pool 3 and 6 showed elevated bromate concentrations as well technologically it is possible to keep the bromate concentration of bromide containing and ozone treated pool waters at very low concentrations by strict ph regulation at 6 8 7 2 or if necessary by sufficient dilution via addition of accurately treated fresh water umweltbundesamt 2014 overall our findings showed that the presence of bromide in filling water leads to higher formation of brominated dbps compared to that of chlorinated analogous dbps thus we conclude that the treatment method plays a secondary role in the dbp formation however when applying the ozone bromine treatment chlorine containing dbps were completely absent 3 3 toxicity of ozone bromine treated pool water cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were tested as composite toxicities of the whole pool water samples diluted by the nutrient solution cytotoxicity which was tested based on intracellular ros was not detected for any of the pool water samples using either dhe or dcfh da assays table 3 genotoxicity which was tested by the ames test in the salmonella tester strains ta 98 and ta 100 and a micronucleus test in the cell line hepg2 did not show any positive result for the samples concentrated by factor 1 000 in contrast the native samples of the sea water pools pool 7 and 8 showed slight toxicity reaching values above 2 0 since the genotoxicity was detected for both pool water and filling water samples it can be assumed that it was not caused by the disinfection process but rather by the high salt concentrations of the filling water this is further confirmed by the negative test results of the concentrated water samples where the salts are permanently restrained by the xad resins resulting in low salt concentrates thus the pool water and the filling water samples of the eight pools did not show either cytotoxicity or genotoxicity using the listed assays surprisingly not even pool 8 with an elevated bromate concentration of 9 95 mg l 1 table 2 showed toxicity after subtraction of the value of the filling water usually the toxicological evaluation of single substances by the ames test and the micronucleus test is conducted at concentrations of up to 5 g per test plate 5 g l 1 or up to the solubility concentration the measured bromate concentration was about one magnitude lower than 5 g l 1 thus the toxicity of the substance mixture in the pool water could have been too low to detect differences in the toxicological effects between the pool water samples therefore it is recommended that in future studies a final toxicity assessment should be based on the toxicity evaluation of the single dbps to achieve higher sensitivity such single substance toxicity assessments should be based on data of several in vitro as wells as of in vivo studies 4 conclusion the ozone bromine treatment is a newly standardized disinfection method for pool water according to the din standard 19643 ozone is introduced into water with high bromide content and reacts with bromide to hypobromous acid the actual active disinfectant with depot effect in the pool the efficacy of chemicals used as disinfectants for pool and spa water as well as for drinking water has to be assessed with regard to compliance with hygienic requirements in this study the disinfectant efficacy of hypobromous acid against the indicator organisms e coli e faecium p aeruginosa s aureus ms2 and prd1 was tested in comparison to hypochlorous acid the efficacy of hypobromous acid was comparable to that of hypochlorous acid or in case of s aureus and bacteriophages ms2 even higher hypobromous acid dosed with a concentration of 0 4 and 0 6 mg l 1 as cl2 met the conditions defined in the oecd guidance for demonstrating efficacy of pool and spa disinfectants in laboratory and field testing for a concentration of 1 mg l 1 disinfectant as cl2 for all organisms except p aeruginosa for p aeruginosa a reduction of only 3 5 instead of 4 log10 levels was reached within 30 s under the test conditions even hypochlorous acid did not meet the reduction criterion for p aeruginosa the sole indicator organism of din 19643 1 further investigations taking the doc concentration composition and reactivity into account are necessary to evaluate whether the minimum disinfectant concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 as cl2 required in din 19463 1 is sufficient to reach the reduction criterion water samples of pools with high bromide concentrations in the fill water showed the predominant formation of brominated thm species mainly bromoform in contrast the treatment method had a smaller effect on the formation of chlorinated or of brominated thms being favored regarding the total amount of all investigated dbps the toc of the water representing organic precursors with a specific dbp forming potential was shown to be the predominant factor of dbp formation the investigated pool water samples did not show critical values in vitro for cytotoxicity or genotoxicity however the applied methods for the assessment of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity have been established and optimized for the evaluation of single compounds therefore their sensitivity might be not high enough to ultimately assess the composite toxicity of whole water samples in conclusion the disinfection efficacy of the ozone bromine treatment is comparable to that of conventional disinfection methods using hypochlorous acid in vitro toxicity tests with whole pool water samples disinfected by the ozone bromine treatment showed no increased toxicological potential despite literature data on the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of single brominated vs chlorinated compounds suggesting otherwise for a final toxicity assessment of the treatment method

16678,the current lack of research on the evaluation of marine ecosystem services makes the value of marine protection development and restoration underestimated during the decision making process based on the non monetary ecosystem service evaluation framework a marine ecosystem service classification and accounting method has been established in this study and the world s coastal ecosystem services have been measured as an example the results show that 1 the world s coastal ecosystem service value is about 4 13e 23 sej yr of which asia and north america contribute about 55 of the total service value 2 the top ten countries in terms of the world s coastal ecosystem service values are canada indonesia australia the united states brazil the russian federation norway the philippines mexico and china which contribute about 60 of the total service value 3 estuaries have the highest ecosystem service values followed by mangroves seagrass beds tidal flats salt marshes and warm water coral reefs 4 developed countries can make better use of their coastal resources and pay more attention to the marine protection while the opposite is true in developing countries which means that developed countries still occupy an advantageous position in the process of marine protection development and utilization this study assesses the coastal ecosystem service values in various coastal countries from the perspective of ecosystem contributors emphasizes the importance of protecting them in marine management and provides a certain reference basis and theoretical support for decision makers in formulating marine related protection and development strategies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords coastal ecosystem ecosystem service emergy analysis non monetary accounting 1 introduction marine ecosystems have huge areas and complex structures representing one of the most developed ecosystems in the world it covers nearly three quarters of the earth s surface and occupies 99 of the earth s bio productive space measured by volume that sustains organisms life not only can they regulate the ecological environment of the earth but they also constitute a human life support system shen and mao 2019 coastal areas only account for 4 of the earth s total land area and 11 of the world s ocean area despite that they carry more than one third of the world s population and contribute about 90 of the global fisheries catchment and more than 60 of the total economic value provided by the global ecosystem barbier 2017 liquete et al 2013 coastal ecosystems can provide several services such as habitat provision pollution control floods and storms mitigation sediment maintaining coastline stability maintaining erosion control and carbon sequestration barbier 2017 however with the development of society and the continuous expansion of the scope of human activities the abuse of marine areas and unregulated pollutant discharge have threatened the marine ecosystem at present 50 of the world s salt marshes 35 of mangroves 30 of coral reefs and 29 of seagrass beds have degraded or disappeared in recent decades barbier 2017 in addition the acceleration of urbanization and rapid economic development also affect the sustainable development of marine ecosystems dobson et al 2006 halpern et al 2008 although the public s awareness of marine ecosystems protection is constantly increasing there is still a lack of plans and actions for marine protection compared with terrestrial ecosystems the data and methods for marine ecosystem service evaluation are relatively lacking barbier 2012 due to the complexity of the processes and functions of marine ecosystems and their highly dynamic characteristics galparsoro iza et al 2014 therefore the value of marine protection development and restoration is often underestimated during the decision making process camacho et al 2014 vassallo et al 2018 at present the conceptual framework indicators and metrics of marine ecosystem services assessment are still missing or controversial liquete et al 2013 most studies only focus on the marine area at small scale or only calculate the value of a single period and of a certain ecosystem services which makes it difficult to reflect the overall marine ecosystem service values sun et al 2018 the existing marine ecosystem service evaluation methods can be roughly divided into three categories economic methods invest model and emergy analysis methods yang et al 2019b the economic method uses economic value to measure ecosystem services which can be easily accepted by people and it is more suitable for accounting for values based on individual preferences and perceptions however when ecosystems provide some services that are not currently perceived by society are ambiguous or can only be expressed in the future economic method shows its own limitations liu and yang 2018 therefore costanza et al 2017 recognized that there were certain limitations in using economic method to assess ecosystem services and the calculated economic value was not equal to market value or transaction value the invest model can be used to evaluate marine ecosystem services spatial patterns and dynamics tallis and polasky 2009 yang et al 2018 but the model limitations consist in low simulation accuracy no basis for parameter setting and unclear service trade off mechanism wang et al 2015 the emergy analysis method is based on the perspective of ecosystem contributors considering that three renewable energy sources solar energy tidal energy and geothermal energy are ensuring the material circulation the energy flow and the sustainable development of the earth s biosphere those sources of renewable energy can be used to account for the value of ecosystem services liu and yang 2018 emergy is the amount of solar energy unit solar joule sej that is directly or indirectly required to produce a service or to manufacture a commodity it allows the measurement of different grades and types of substances and energy through a uniform scale thus solving the current difficulties in comparing different ecosystem services odum 1996 based on the laws of thermodynamics the emergy analysis method can minutely describe the resource flow including matter and energy in each system and evaluate the environmental cost of any production from the perspective of contributors rather than from human preferences thereby quantifying the cumulative available energy expenditure for the production and operation of any service or product odum 1996 this method has been applied to forests campbell and brown 2012 yang et al 2018 wetlands yang et al 2019a grasslands yang et al 2020 dams liu et al 2019 and other ecosystem service evaluation process the current researches on marine ecosystem service evaluation still have the following deficiencies 1 the conceptual connotation and ecological process of marine ecosystem services are still unclear the complexity of marine ecosystem structure makes it possible to provide a wide variety of services and there may exist some services that have not yet been identified besides some ecological process operating mechanism and dynamic evolution rules contained in them are still unclear so in depth research is needed 2 the current classification of marine ecosystem services is a little arbitrary millennium ecosystem assessment beaumont et al 2007 the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity kumar 2010 haines young and potschin young 2010 and common international classification for ecosystem services haines young and potschin young 2018 etc classify marine ecosystem services but these classifications still have some implementation problems such as double counting problem and failure to measure various services in a reasonable and comprehensive manner in addition there has not been a unified conclusion about the specific services provided by different types of marine ecosystems which also brings difficulties to the evaluation of marine ecosystem services 3 the theoretical framework and specific accounting methods for marine ecosystem service driven by ecological thermodynamics have not been fully established traditional economic methods are widely used but they mostly use substitute value however it is difficult to find alternative ways for the calculation of many services values especially the services of non marine fishery products therefore the results obtained by these methods implementations show large deviations so that new accounting methods need to be developed therefore based on the emergy analysis method this study provides a theoretical framework and method for marine ecosystem services evaluation from the perspective of ecosystem contributors focusing on the world s coastal wetlands case study so as to provide a certain reference basis and theoretical support for the management development and protection of the coastal and marine ecosystems in addition this study applies a regression model to verify the possible correlation between coastal ecosystem service and local socioeconomic growth of the region clustering the countries on the basis of their tradeoff between the flow of ecosystems services and the socioeconomic conditions 2 methods 2 1 description of study area the world s coastal wetlands are the study areas for this evaluation about half of the approximately 7 billion world population lives in coastal areas and more than 3 billion people rely on marine and coastal resources for their livelihoods for many coastal residents in developing countries fishery is the main life and business activities the market value of marine and coastal resources and industries is estimated to reach 3 trillion us dollars per year accounting for about 5 of global gdp patil et al 2016 in addition coastal and marine areas provide a large number of employment opportunities for mankind and marine fisheries directly or indirectly employ more than 200 million people what s more these areas not only have huge biodiversity but they are also rich in resources in fact there are currently nearly 200 000 species of marine organisms known but the actual number is assessed to be tens of millions more than 70 of the world s oil and gas resources are stored in the seabed at present the proven offshore oil reserves on the global offshore shelf account for 45 of the world s total reserves while the seabed natural gas reserves account for 1 3 of the world s total reserves besides the vast coastline has made many countries rich in coastal tourism resources currently the total number of international inbound and outbound tourism from major coastal countries in the world has exceeded 1 billion and international tourism revenue has reached 1381 1 billion us dollars 2 2 marine ecosystems and their services classification in function of specific characteristics of the environmental attributes functions and human influence marine ecosystems are divided into three main categories coastal ecosystems offshore ecosystems and pelagic ecosystems coastal ecosystem is a transitional ecosystem between the open water and the land which has the characteristics of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems the unique structure and function of the coastal ecosystem plays an irreplaceable role in climate regulation pollution control environment stabilization and ecological balance maintaining based on the natural characteristics of different types of coastal ecosystems and on data availability six types of natural coastal ecosystems are considered in this study see table 1 while artificial coastal wetlands are not considered the offshore ecosystem is the system between the outer boundary of the coastal ecosystems and the edge of the continental shelf of the 200 m isobath due to the varying degrees of interaction between continents and ocean circulations the changes of hydrological physical chemical and biological factors the different offshore areas also show deep regional differences in the offshore area close to the continent the changes in hydrological chemical and physical process are complex due to the relatively large impact of the continent contributions the offshore area where the water depth is greater than 150 m and human activities have little impact is mainly affected by various ocean circulations it has the characteristics of ocean water that has high transparency stable composition high salinity and poor biological species the pelagic ecosystem refers to the ocean area with a water depth of more than 200 m covering the entire body of water and the seabed beyond the continental shelf including continental slopes ocean ridges ocean basins trenches and cold water coral reefs compared with the offshore areas the pelagic environment is relatively stable since the current understanding and research on the pelagic area is still poor the pelagic ecosystems are not considered by this study as well as offshore ecosystem table 1 based on the non monetary ecosystem service evaluation framework ecosystem services are grouped into three categories direct indirect and existing services direct services refer to the amount of flows and storages in the studied ecosystems among them biomass increase refers to the total amount of living organic matter dry weight accounted per unit area at a certain moment including land and sea external input the carbon sequestration service includes the service of reducing ch4 emission as well as carbon fixation by photosynthesis soil sediments organic matter building account for vegetation litter underground dead roots and rhizomes the groundwater recharge consists in preventing seawater intrusion indirect services refer to the additional services produced by the ecological process while producing direct services among indirect services water purification deals with the absorption of water pollutants such as heavy mental and so on while air purification deals with the absorption of air pollutants such as so2 fluoride nox co o3 and pm10 pm2 5 and other particulate pollutants interception microclimate regulation is due to evapotranspiration of vegetation and water bodies renewable power generation is the potential power generation services of the offshore ecosystems comprising wind power generation and tidal power generation erosion control services are provided by the coverage of mangroves and salt marshes existing services are the local apportionment of global services and human preference oriented services liu and yang 2018 exiting services deal with global climate regulation services mitigating the impact of climate change biodiversity conservation services underline the role played by ecosystems in maintaining biodiversity richness the cultural and education value comprises the esthetic and artistic value as well as the pluralities of values inspiring and supporting the new knowledge development through scientific research despite the importance of this service value their calculation is not included in our study given the lacks of their systematic definition and of a unified quantitative calculation method the services provided by various types of marine ecosystems are shown in table 2 2 3 marine ecosystem service accounting methods based on the emergy analysis method this study establishes a theoretical framework and method for marine ecosystem services evaluation from the perspective of ecosystem contributors applied to the world s coastal wetlands in order to provide a certain reference basis and theoretical support for the management development and protection of the coastal and marine ecosystems the global emergy baseline geb used in this study is 12 0e 24 sej yr brown and ulgiati 2016 and all the uevs in this paper have been modified based on this geb the calculation process asses flows of services for direct indirect and existing services through the total coastal ecosystem service value t e s v that is precisely the sum of direct service value e m d s indirect service value e m i s and existing service value e m e s the specific calculation formula is

the coastal ecosystems evaluation in china enable us to understand the ecosystem services calculation method clearly also in the supplementary material 2 4 data source description this study implements gis geographical information system to evaluate ecosystems services by acquiring geospatial data data on the area covered by mangroves salt marshes tidal flats seagrass beds warm water coral reefs and estuaries area are provided by the united nations environment programme world conservation monitoring center unep wcmc website which provides the latest available spatial data on the global distribution of various ecosystems data on the mangroves is from giri et al 2011 both the global land survey gls data for 2000 and the landsat imagery available from the us geological survey usgs are used to prepare this first global map of the mangrove forests of the world the gls 2000 mosaics were prepared using images acquired from 1997 to 2000 landsat imagery is used if gls data were cloudy secondary data such as national and local mangrove database were also collected data on the salt marshes is from mcowen et al 2017 while that on the seagrass beds is from short et al 2007 both of the datasets were composed of data derived from peer reviewed articles and gray literature including reports and databases created by governmental and non governmental organizations universities institutes and researchers globally actually the dataset as a whole cannot be used for temporal analyses of change due to an incomplete systematic survey of ecosystems extent globally over time and they are just the combination of data from different sources overall the survey time span of world s salt marshes is 1973 2015 while that of seagrass beds is 1934 2015 as we showed in table 3 the tidal flats data is from murray et al 2019 the dataset contains global maps of tidal flat ecosystems produced via a supervised classification of 707 528 landsat archive images the map refers to a set of global training data and divides each pixel into tidal flats permanent waters or others the image collection started from 1984 to 2016 consisting of a time series of 11 global maps and only the 2014 2016 global extent data can be used directly therefore the time span of tidal flat data is 2014 2016 as we showed in table 3 the warm water coral reef database provides the global distribution of coral reefs in tropical and subtropical regions the data set is compiled by unep wcmc the worldfish center world resources institute wri and the nature conservancy tnc data sources include the millennium coral reef mapping project and the world atlas of coral reefs as in the case of salt marshes and seagrass beds data this dataset is also a combination of data from different sources and the survey time span is 1954 2018 table 4 the estuaries data is provided by the sea around us organization this data is the 2003 global estuary data showing the global distribution of more than 1300 estuaries in the world including some lagoon systems and fjords in table 4 physical data related to solar radiation comes from the global solar atlas provided by the world bank the precipitation data comes from the global precipitation data set provided by noaa the wind speed data comes from the global wind atlas global wind atlas provided by the technical university of denmark dtu the evapotranspiration data comes from the global high resolution soil water balance dataset provided by the consultative group for international agricultural research consortium for spatial information cgiar csi other various coefficients come from relevant literatures see supplementary material the emergy transformity data mainly comes from the research results of brown and ulgiati 2016 2018 odum 1996 and others the socioeconomic indicators comes from world bank food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao un esd database and organization for economic co operation and development oecd database the present study considers six kinds of socioeconomic indicators 1 seafood production is the sum of crustaceans cephalopods demersal fish molluscs other and marine fish other production this seafood classification is defined by fao 2 marine protected areas is the proportion of the territorial waters occupied by marine protected areas 3 gdp is the gross domestic product of the coastal countries 4 offshore wind power generation is the wind power capacities of coastal countries 5 inbound tourism is the number of tourists who travel to a country from a different country 6 coastal population is population resident within 10 km from the coast 3 results 3 1 global ecosystems renewables input and services output the emery based evaluation allows us to evaluate the services provision by each different marine ecosystems as shown in fig 1 the emergy of renewables that drives terrestrial and offshore pelagic ecosystems accounts for 52 54 and 46 57 of the global renewables respectively while the emergy of renewables that drives coastal ecosystems only accounts for 0 89 of the global renewables among them estuaries have the largest renewables emergy which accounts for about 0 39 of the global renewables the next are seagrass beds tidal flats warm water coral reefs mangroves and salt marshes of which the renewables emergy accounts for 0 15 0 14 0 073 0 066 and 0 065 of the global renewables as shown in fig 2 results on services provision by different types of coastal ecosystems indicates that estuaries have the highest total ecosystem services followed by mangroves seagrass beds tidal flats salt marshes and warm water coral reefs besides estuaries also have the largest local renewables input while mangroves have the largest net external organic matter input considering the components of ecosystem services separately estuaries have the largest direct services followed by mangroves seagrass beds tidal flats salt marshes and warm water coral reefs to be more specific estuaries mangroves and seagrass beds have greater biomass increase services while seagrass beds warm water coral reefs and mangroves have greater carbon sequestration services for soil sediment organic matter building services mangroves are the largest contributor followed by seagrass beds estuaries mangroves and tidal flats show larger groundwater recharge services however for indirect services estuaries are still the largest followed by mangroves salt marshes seagrass beds warm water coral reefs and tidal flats among them mangroves and estuaries play a major role in purifying air and water while mangroves and salt marshes contribute a lot to erosion control for microclimate regulation services seagrass beds and estuaries play a greater role it has to be noted that warm water coral reefs play the biggest role in regulating global climate followed by seagrass beds estuaries salt marshes mangroves and tidal flats 3 2 comparison of global coastal ecosystem services the results show that global coastal ecosystem service value is about 4 13e 23sej yr to be more specific asia ranks first among all continents with a service value of 1 23e 23sej yr which contributes about 29 66 of the world s coastal ecosystem service value north america ranks second with a service value of 1 07e 23sej yr contributing about 25 82 of the world s coastal ecosystem service value next are europe oceania south america and africa with the service value of 6 07e 22sej yr 4 90e 22sej yr 3 93e 22sej yr 3 50e 22sej yr of which the contribution is approximately 14 68 11 86 9 51 and 8 48 respectively although global and sub global estimates of coastal ecosystem service values are important it is at the national level that these results probably have the bigger utility among asian countries indonesia has the largest coastal ecosystem service value followed by philippines china bangladesh india japan malaysia myanmar saudi arabia and yemen among north american countries canada ranks first and the united states ranks second followed by mexico cuba panama nicaragua belize honduras haiti and jamaica comparing the coastal ecosystem service value in south american countries brazil ranks first followed by venezuela colombia chile ecuador argentina suriname uruguay and costa rica among european countries the coastal ecosystem service value of the russian federation is the largest while norway greece the united kingdom italy denmark france ukraine spain and sweden rank second to tenth respectively for african countries nigeria ranks first followed by guinea bissau guinea madagascar egypt mozambique cameroon gabon sierra leone and angola for oceanian countries australia has the largest coastal ecosystem service value followed by papua new guinea and new zealand the coastal ecosystem service value in various countries worldwide shows that canada has the largest service value of 5 77e 22sej yr while indonesia australia the united states brazil the russian federation norway philippines mexico and china rank second to tenth respectively with the service value of 4 47e 22sej yr 3 77e 22sej yr 2 68e 22sej yr 1 98e 22sej yr 1 47e 22sej yr 1 39e 22sej yr 1 32e 22sej yr 9 93e 21sej yr 8 37e 21sej yr indeed the top 10 coastal countries contribute approximately 60 of the world s coastal ecosystem service values and the top 26 countries just over 80 3 3 correlation analysis of coastal ecosystem services and indicators in order to explore the relationship between ecosystem services and some socioeconomic indicators especially in coastal field this study implements at country level the scatter plot of the ranking of coastal ecosystem service and the ranking of the key indicators performs linear fitting and analyzes the top 20 countries in both services and key indicators levels the red dots represent the best top 20 countries in terms of both services and socio economic indicators performances the blue dots represent the countries that rank in the best top 20 in terms of ecosystem services provision while the socioeconomic indicators rank below the top 20 the green dots represent the top 20 countries in terms of socioeconomic indicators while the services rank below 20 see fig 3 fig 3 from fig 4 a it can be found that for south korea kor morocco mar peru per pakistan pak etc the coastal ecosystem service is relatively small but a large number of people have gathered in the coastal area which may bring greater pressure to the coastal environment to some extent however for papua new guinea png norway nor cuba cub greece grc etc the situation is the opposite which means that these countries have large coastal ecosystem service provision while the coastal population is still small indicating that there is a potential carrying capacity for increasing inhabitants in the coastal areas for countries such as china chn india ind japan jpn and the united states usa etc the coastal population is roughly positively correlated with the coastal ecosystem service provision meaning that these countries have fully exploited the coastal area in terms of resident population without too much environmental load to the coastal area as shown in fig 4 b for countries such as south korea kor peru per iceland isl and spain esp etc although their coastal ecosystem services rank below 20 have fully utilized one of the most basic services of the ocean seafood production services in fact the seafood catchments of these countries rank among the top 25 in the world countries such as australia aus cuba cub greece grc nigeria nga etc have a higher rank of the coastal ecosystem services while their seafood production ranks lower china chn the united states usa russia rus and indonesia idn etc show both the coastal ecosystem service and the seafood production among the highest in the world fig 4 c shows that countries such as poland pol croatia hrv the netherlands nld and germany deu although ranked below 20 for the coastal ecosystem service have made full use of the tourism and leisure functions of the coastal areas attracting a large number of foreign tourists it has to be underlined that these countries are all european developed countries however for papua new guinea png bangladesh bgd myanmar mmr cuba cub etc the situation is the opposite accounting for a small number of tourists in the united states usa china chn mexico mex the united kingdom gbr coastal areas have played an important role in attracting international tourism and the coastal ecosystem services provision is relatively high the travel and tourism competitiveness index ttci calderwood and soshkin 2019 of these countries can help in explaining this situation the index consists of three sub indicators namely human cultural natural resources business environment infrastructure and regulatory framework for countries corresponding to the green points their ttci rankings are among the top in the world indicating that although these countries are not rich in coastal natural resources their coastal tourism business environment infrastructure and policies regulations are well developed and a safe and healthy tourism environment ensure competitiveness to such regions for most countries represented by the blue dots the ttci ranks at the bottom of the world meaning that although these countries have relatively rich coastal natural resources their backward infrastructure imperfect business environment regulatory framework and poor social security situations have hindered the development of the tourism sector as shown in fig 4 d countries such as poland pol germany deu netherlands nld south korea kor etc with coastal ecosystem services ranked below 20 have a fully developed marine economy enhancing domestic economic growth according to the eu blue economy report 2019 the contribution of the blue economy gross value added of eu countries to the gross value added gva in 2017 was poland 0 8 germany 0 8 netherlands 1 6 while the contribution of south korea s marine economy to its gdp growth in 2008 was 4 9 hwang 2011 however in countries such as papua new guinea png cuba cub myanmar mmr and bangladesh bgd etc the coastal ecosystem services rank relatively high while their gdp ranks relatively low therefore these countries should try to promote the development of the marine economy to stimulate domestic economic growth making full use of coastal resources and vigorously developing marine industries the united states usa china chn japan jpn the united kingdom gbr etc have made full use of the abundant domestic coastal resources to promote their national economic growth fig 4 e shows that european and american countries such as germany deu france fra belgium bel new zealand nzl etc are ranked below 20 for their coastal ecosystem service even if their marine protected areas accounts for a large proportion of the territorial waters the results indicate that awareness toward marine ecosystem protection is higher in those countries affected by ecosystem degradation and lower ecosystem service however in many asian countries such as japan jpn china chn bangladesh bgd indonesia idn etc while having a greater coastal ecosystem service the construction of marine protected areas has not received much attention the cluster of countries including united states usa australia aus the united kingdom gbr brazil bra mexico mex etc not only has a large coastal ecosystem service but also attaches great importance to the construction of marine protected areas to sum up european and american countries are more aware of marine protection and are in the forefront of the construction of marine protected areas however for most asian african and oceanian countries their marine protection awareness still needs for improvement in relation to wind generation as shown in fig 4 f some european countries such as germany deu spain esp france fra turkey tur etc with coastal ecosystem service ranked below 20 have fully utilized the potential of offshore wind power generation however indonesia idn bangladesh bgd the russian federation rus philippines phl show an opposite situation united states usa china chn the united kingdom gbr india ind etc despite a greater coastal ecosystem service they fully develop and utilize offshore wind resources generally speaking european and american countries have a competitive advantage in the international market of offshore wind power generation for their advanced technology and economic strength while the vast number of asian african and oceanian countries still have great unexplored potential in offshore wind power generation therefore the experience of those countries that are at the forefront of offshore wind power generation is worth learning the development of offshore wind power in the united kingdom germany the united states have some common features firstly those countries attach great importance to the development of the offshore wind power industry and some countries have listed it into the national strategy they strongly support the development of new technologies and the research efforts on large scale offshore wind power networking secondly they actively promote the international cooperation plan for offshore wind power and accelerate the strategic pace of the country s offshore wind power development finally they vigorously seek to reduce the cost of offshore wind power these experiences have enlightenment and reference significance for other countries to promote the full use of marine resources and the development of offshore wind power 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variability of marine ecosystem services townsend et al 2018 pointed out that due to the unique characteristics of marine ecosystems the assignment of ecosystem services to specific map grids has become complicated for marine ecosystems sea water and components can be driven to other places by wind tides and currents even for the relatively static submarine habitat the movement of seawater over it and the transportation of carbon oxygen nutrients and pollutants also increase the complexity to the quantification and space allocation of marine ecosystem services in addition identifying and protecting areas where ecosystem services are provided does not necessarily ensure provision of those services over the time failure to integrate important processes and locations in service generation the so called intermediate services may result in a loss of the final services generation haines young and potschin young 2018 for example if spawning grounds and nurseries are not protected the protection of fishing grounds alone may not be sufficient for the ecosystem service provision conservation according to börger et al 2014 not all marine ecosystem services are location specific for example although coral reefs are fixed in space many marine resources such as fish and mammal species and the ecosystem components which support them such as plankton can move in different seasons and different regions therefore some marine ecosystem services are not limited to single country which means that people in one country can benefit from the services provided by other countries this is an important factor for integrating the marine planning and policies of different country and needs to be further considered in subsequent studies 4 2 trade off and synergy between different types of marine ecosystem services due to the diversity of marine ecosystem services the heterogeneity of spatial distribution and the selectivity of human use there is a trade off or synergy relationship between ecosystem services li et al 2013 the trade off relationship refers to the situation in which the supply of certain ecosystem services decreases due to the increase in the use of other ecosystem services rodríguez et al 2006 the damage to marine biodiversity caused by excessive pursuit of seafood production services and the loss of biological habitat caused by the disorderly development of coastal tourism the synergy relationship refers to a situation where two or more ecosystem services are enhanced at the same time li et al 2013 for example mangroves and seagrass beds are breeding and nursery grounds for some marine fisheries and their existence greatly increases the organisms of coral reef fish communities mangroves and seagrass beds can absorb waste discharged into the ocean and serve as sinks of pollutants sediments and other organic materials this pollution and sediment control service can protect coral reefs and maintain their services coral reefs can protect coastal habitats by buffering waves and currents and slowing down periodic storm surges thereby supporting the ability of seagrass beds and mangroves to attenuate waves and buffer winds barbier 2017 therefore clarifying the trade offs and synergies between different types of marine ecosystem services is crucial both in the calculation and evaluation of ecosystem services and in the policy design and needs to be included in future researches 5 conclusion this research establishes a coastal ecosystem service evaluation framework and accounting method from the perspective of ecosystem contributors and calculates the world s coastal ecosystem services the results show that the total service value of coastal ecosystem in the world is about 4 13e 23sej yr to be more specific asia ranks first among all continents and north america ranks second followed by europe oceania south america africa the top ten countries in terms of total coastal ecosystem services in the world are canada indonesia australia the united states brazil the russian federation norway philippines mexico and china among all types of coastal ecosystems estuaries have the highest service value followed by mangroves seagrass beds tidal flats salt marshes and warm water coral reefs furthermore the scatter plots of the ranking of the coastal ecosystem service and of various indicators in different countries show that developed countries perform a better use of coastal resources and fully develop the coastal areas in terms of population carrying seafood production coastal tourism development offshore wind power generation and blue economy promotion besides they pay more attention to the marine protection however the vast number of developing countries may not make full use of their rich coastal resources or only pay attention to the coastal resources usage but ignore the marine protection therefore developed countries still occupy an advantageous position in the process of marine ecosystems protection development and utilization based on emergy analysis this research provides an innovative method for calculating the coastal ecosystem services which is different from the traditional monetary analysis however there are also some limitations in this study due to the lack of basic data and insufficient research on the ecological processes and operating mechanisms of some services the coastal ecosystem service in some countries such as singapore greenland namibia etc and the value of specific services such as biodiversity conservation and cultural and education value have not been calculated this may result in an underestimation of the global coastal ecosystem services in addition this study only calculates coastal ecosystem services involving only about 0 24 of the global area therefore the offshore and pelagic ecosystem services of which the area accounts for approximately 70 of the global area needs further consideration due to the lack of global data on the dynamic changes of coastal wetlands on the time scale only the multi year average ecosystem service value is calculated which may also lead to the deviation of accounting results to the real situation what s more the spatial variability of marine ecosystem services and the trade off and synergy between different types of services need to be further investigated finally dis services such as storm surges tsunamis seawater intrusion coastal ground subsidence and marine oil spills should also be considered in the future if data becomes available declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

16678,the current lack of research on the evaluation of marine ecosystem services makes the value of marine protection development and restoration underestimated during the decision making process based on the non monetary ecosystem service evaluation framework a marine ecosystem service classification and accounting method has been established in this study and the world s coastal ecosystem services have been measured as an example the results show that 1 the world s coastal ecosystem service value is about 4 13e 23 sej yr of which asia and north america contribute about 55 of the total service value 2 the top ten countries in terms of the world s coastal ecosystem service values are canada indonesia australia the united states brazil the russian federation norway the philippines mexico and china which contribute about 60 of the total service value 3 estuaries have the highest ecosystem service values followed by mangroves seagrass beds tidal flats salt marshes and warm water coral reefs 4 developed countries can make better use of their coastal resources and pay more attention to the marine protection while the opposite is true in developing countries which means that developed countries still occupy an advantageous position in the process of marine protection development and utilization this study assesses the coastal ecosystem service values in various coastal countries from the perspective of ecosystem contributors emphasizes the importance of protecting them in marine management and provides a certain reference basis and theoretical support for decision makers in formulating marine related protection and development strategies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords coastal ecosystem ecosystem service emergy analysis non monetary accounting 1 introduction marine ecosystems have huge areas and complex structures representing one of the most developed ecosystems in the world it covers nearly three quarters of the earth s surface and occupies 99 of the earth s bio productive space measured by volume that sustains organisms life not only can they regulate the ecological environment of the earth but they also constitute a human life support system shen and mao 2019 coastal areas only account for 4 of the earth s total land area and 11 of the world s ocean area despite that they carry more than one third of the world s population and contribute about 90 of the global fisheries catchment and more than 60 of the total economic value provided by the global ecosystem barbier 2017 liquete et al 2013 coastal ecosystems can provide several services such as habitat provision pollution control floods and storms mitigation sediment maintaining coastline stability maintaining erosion control and carbon sequestration barbier 2017 however with the development of society and the continuous expansion of the scope of human activities the abuse of marine areas and unregulated pollutant discharge have threatened the marine ecosystem at present 50 of the world s salt marshes 35 of mangroves 30 of coral reefs and 29 of seagrass beds have degraded or disappeared in recent decades barbier 2017 in addition the acceleration of urbanization and rapid economic development also affect the sustainable development of marine ecosystems dobson et al 2006 halpern et al 2008 although the public s awareness of marine ecosystems protection is constantly increasing there is still a lack of plans and actions for marine protection compared with terrestrial ecosystems the data and methods for marine ecosystem service evaluation are relatively lacking barbier 2012 due to the complexity of the processes and functions of marine ecosystems and their highly dynamic characteristics galparsoro iza et al 2014 therefore the value of marine protection development and restoration is often underestimated during the decision making process camacho et al 2014 vassallo et al 2018 at present the conceptual framework indicators and metrics of marine ecosystem services assessment are still missing or controversial liquete et al 2013 most studies only focus on the marine area at small scale or only calculate the value of a single period and of a certain ecosystem services which makes it difficult to reflect the overall marine ecosystem service values sun et al 2018 the existing marine ecosystem service evaluation methods can be roughly divided into three categories economic methods invest model and emergy analysis methods yang et al 2019b the economic method uses economic value to measure ecosystem services which can be easily accepted by people and it is more suitable for accounting for values based on individual preferences and perceptions however when ecosystems provide some services that are not currently perceived by society are ambiguous or can only be expressed in the future economic method shows its own limitations liu and yang 2018 therefore costanza et al 2017 recognized that there were certain limitations in using economic method to assess ecosystem services and the calculated economic value was not equal to market value or transaction value the invest model can be used to evaluate marine ecosystem services spatial patterns and dynamics tallis and polasky 2009 yang et al 2018 but the model limitations consist in low simulation accuracy no basis for parameter setting and unclear service trade off mechanism wang et al 2015 the emergy analysis method is based on the perspective of ecosystem contributors considering that three renewable energy sources solar energy tidal energy and geothermal energy are ensuring the material circulation the energy flow and the sustainable development of the earth s biosphere those sources of renewable energy can be used to account for the value of ecosystem services liu and yang 2018 emergy is the amount of solar energy unit solar joule sej that is directly or indirectly required to produce a service or to manufacture a commodity it allows the measurement of different grades and types of substances and energy through a uniform scale thus solving the current difficulties in comparing different ecosystem services odum 1996 based on the laws of thermodynamics the emergy analysis method can minutely describe the resource flow including matter and energy in each system and evaluate the environmental cost of any production from the perspective of contributors rather than from human preferences thereby quantifying the cumulative available energy expenditure for the production and operation of any service or product odum 1996 this method has been applied to forests campbell and brown 2012 yang et al 2018 wetlands yang et al 2019a grasslands yang et al 2020 dams liu et al 2019 and other ecosystem service evaluation process the current researches on marine ecosystem service evaluation still have the following deficiencies 1 the conceptual connotation and ecological process of marine ecosystem services are still unclear the complexity of marine ecosystem structure makes it possible to provide a wide variety of services and there may exist some services that have not yet been identified besides some ecological process operating mechanism and dynamic evolution rules contained in them are still unclear so in depth research is needed 2 the current classification of marine ecosystem services is a little arbitrary millennium ecosystem assessment beaumont et al 2007 the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity kumar 2010 haines young and potschin young 2010 and common international classification for ecosystem services haines young and potschin young 2018 etc classify marine ecosystem services but these classifications still have some implementation problems such as double counting problem and failure to measure various services in a reasonable and comprehensive manner in addition there has not been a unified conclusion about the specific services provided by different types of marine ecosystems which also brings difficulties to the evaluation of marine ecosystem services 3 the theoretical framework and specific accounting methods for marine ecosystem service driven by ecological thermodynamics have not been fully established traditional economic methods are widely used but they mostly use substitute value however it is difficult to find alternative ways for the calculation of many services values especially the services of non marine fishery products therefore the results obtained by these methods implementations show large deviations so that new accounting methods need to be developed therefore based on the emergy analysis method this study provides a theoretical framework and method for marine ecosystem services evaluation from the perspective of ecosystem contributors focusing on the world s coastal wetlands case study so as to provide a certain reference basis and theoretical support for the management development and protection of the coastal and marine ecosystems in addition this study applies a regression model to verify the possible correlation between coastal ecosystem service and local socioeconomic growth of the region clustering the countries on the basis of their tradeoff between the flow of ecosystems services and the socioeconomic conditions 2 methods 2 1 description of study area the world s coastal wetlands are the study areas for this evaluation about half of the approximately 7 billion world population lives in coastal areas and more than 3 billion people rely on marine and coastal resources for their livelihoods for many coastal residents in developing countries fishery is the main life and business activities the market value of marine and coastal resources and industries is estimated to reach 3 trillion us dollars per year accounting for about 5 of global gdp patil et al 2016 in addition coastal and marine areas provide a large number of employment opportunities for mankind and marine fisheries directly or indirectly employ more than 200 million people what s more these areas not only have huge biodiversity but they are also rich in resources in fact there are currently nearly 200 000 species of marine organisms known but the actual number is assessed to be tens of millions more than 70 of the world s oil and gas resources are stored in the seabed at present the proven offshore oil reserves on the global offshore shelf account for 45 of the world s total reserves while the seabed natural gas reserves account for 1 3 of the world s total reserves besides the vast coastline has made many countries rich in coastal tourism resources currently the total number of international inbound and outbound tourism from major coastal countries in the world has exceeded 1 billion and international tourism revenue has reached 1381 1 billion us dollars 2 2 marine ecosystems and their services classification in function of specific characteristics of the environmental attributes functions and human influence marine ecosystems are divided into three main categories coastal ecosystems offshore ecosystems and pelagic ecosystems coastal ecosystem is a transitional ecosystem between the open water and the land which has the characteristics of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems the unique structure and function of the coastal ecosystem plays an irreplaceable role in climate regulation pollution control environment stabilization and ecological balance maintaining based on the natural characteristics of different types of coastal ecosystems and on data availability six types of natural coastal ecosystems are considered in this study see table 1 while artificial coastal wetlands are not considered the offshore ecosystem is the system between the outer boundary of the coastal ecosystems and the edge of the continental shelf of the 200 m isobath due to the varying degrees of interaction between continents and ocean circulations the changes of hydrological physical chemical and biological factors the different offshore areas also show deep regional differences in the offshore area close to the continent the changes in hydrological chemical and physical process are complex due to the relatively large impact of the continent contributions the offshore area where the water depth is greater than 150 m and human activities have little impact is mainly affected by various ocean circulations it has the characteristics of ocean water that has high transparency stable composition high salinity and poor biological species the pelagic ecosystem refers to the ocean area with a water depth of more than 200 m covering the entire body of water and the seabed beyond the continental shelf including continental slopes ocean ridges ocean basins trenches and cold water coral reefs compared with the offshore areas the pelagic environment is relatively stable since the current understanding and research on the pelagic area is still poor the pelagic ecosystems are not considered by this study as well as offshore ecosystem table 1 based on the non monetary ecosystem service evaluation framework ecosystem services are grouped into three categories direct indirect and existing services direct services refer to the amount of flows and storages in the studied ecosystems among them biomass increase refers to the total amount of living organic matter dry weight accounted per unit area at a certain moment including land and sea external input the carbon sequestration service includes the service of reducing ch4 emission as well as carbon fixation by photosynthesis soil sediments organic matter building account for vegetation litter underground dead roots and rhizomes the groundwater recharge consists in preventing seawater intrusion indirect services refer to the additional services produced by the ecological process while producing direct services among indirect services water purification deals with the absorption of water pollutants such as heavy mental and so on while air purification deals with the absorption of air pollutants such as so2 fluoride nox co o3 and pm10 pm2 5 and other particulate pollutants interception microclimate regulation is due to evapotranspiration of vegetation and water bodies renewable power generation is the potential power generation services of the offshore ecosystems comprising wind power generation and tidal power generation erosion control services are provided by the coverage of mangroves and salt marshes existing services are the local apportionment of global services and human preference oriented services liu and yang 2018 exiting services deal with global climate regulation services mitigating the impact of climate change biodiversity conservation services underline the role played by ecosystems in maintaining biodiversity richness the cultural and education value comprises the esthetic and artistic value as well as the pluralities of values inspiring and supporting the new knowledge development through scientific research despite the importance of this service value their calculation is not included in our study given the lacks of their systematic definition and of a unified quantitative calculation method the services provided by various types of marine ecosystems are shown in table 2 2 3 marine ecosystem service accounting methods based on the emergy analysis method this study establishes a theoretical framework and method for marine ecosystem services evaluation from the perspective of ecosystem contributors applied to the world s coastal wetlands in order to provide a certain reference basis and theoretical support for the management development and protection of the coastal and marine ecosystems the global emergy baseline geb used in this study is 12 0e 24 sej yr brown and ulgiati 2016 and all the uevs in this paper have been modified based on this geb the calculation process asses flows of services for direct indirect and existing services through the total coastal ecosystem service value t e s v that is precisely the sum of direct service value e m d s indirect service value e m i s and existing service value e m e s the specific calculation formula is

the coastal ecosystems evaluation in china enable us to understand the ecosystem services calculation method clearly also in the supplementary material 2 4 data source description this study implements gis geographical information system to evaluate ecosystems services by acquiring geospatial data data on the area covered by mangroves salt marshes tidal flats seagrass beds warm water coral reefs and estuaries area are provided by the united nations environment programme world conservation monitoring center unep wcmc website which provides the latest available spatial data on the global distribution of various ecosystems data on the mangroves is from giri et al 2011 both the global land survey gls data for 2000 and the landsat imagery available from the us geological survey usgs are used to prepare this first global map of the mangrove forests of the world the gls 2000 mosaics were prepared using images acquired from 1997 to 2000 landsat imagery is used if gls data were cloudy secondary data such as national and local mangrove database were also collected data on the salt marshes is from mcowen et al 2017 while that on the seagrass beds is from short et al 2007 both of the datasets were composed of data derived from peer reviewed articles and gray literature including reports and databases created by governmental and non governmental organizations universities institutes and researchers globally actually the dataset as a whole cannot be used for temporal analyses of change due to an incomplete systematic survey of ecosystems extent globally over time and they are just the combination of data from different sources overall the survey time span of world s salt marshes is 1973 2015 while that of seagrass beds is 1934 2015 as we showed in table 3 the tidal flats data is from murray et al 2019 the dataset contains global maps of tidal flat ecosystems produced via a supervised classification of 707 528 landsat archive images the map refers to a set of global training data and divides each pixel into tidal flats permanent waters or others the image collection started from 1984 to 2016 consisting of a time series of 11 global maps and only the 2014 2016 global extent data can be used directly therefore the time span of tidal flat data is 2014 2016 as we showed in table 3 the warm water coral reef database provides the global distribution of coral reefs in tropical and subtropical regions the data set is compiled by unep wcmc the worldfish center world resources institute wri and the nature conservancy tnc data sources include the millennium coral reef mapping project and the world atlas of coral reefs as in the case of salt marshes and seagrass beds data this dataset is also a combination of data from different sources and the survey time span is 1954 2018 table 4 the estuaries data is provided by the sea around us organization this data is the 2003 global estuary data showing the global distribution of more than 1300 estuaries in the world including some lagoon systems and fjords in table 4 physical data related to solar radiation comes from the global solar atlas provided by the world bank the precipitation data comes from the global precipitation data set provided by noaa the wind speed data comes from the global wind atlas global wind atlas provided by the technical university of denmark dtu the evapotranspiration data comes from the global high resolution soil water balance dataset provided by the consultative group for international agricultural research consortium for spatial information cgiar csi other various coefficients come from relevant literatures see supplementary material the emergy transformity data mainly comes from the research results of brown and ulgiati 2016 2018 odum 1996 and others the socioeconomic indicators comes from world bank food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao un esd database and organization for economic co operation and development oecd database the present study considers six kinds of socioeconomic indicators 1 seafood production is the sum of crustaceans cephalopods demersal fish molluscs other and marine fish other production this seafood classification is defined by fao 2 marine protected areas is the proportion of the territorial waters occupied by marine protected areas 3 gdp is the gross domestic product of the coastal countries 4 offshore wind power generation is the wind power capacities of coastal countries 5 inbound tourism is the number of tourists who travel to a country from a different country 6 coastal population is population resident within 10 km from the coast 3 results 3 1 global ecosystems renewables input and services output the emery based evaluation allows us to evaluate the services provision by each different marine ecosystems as shown in fig 1 the emergy of renewables that drives terrestrial and offshore pelagic ecosystems accounts for 52 54 and 46 57 of the global renewables respectively while the emergy of renewables that drives coastal ecosystems only accounts for 0 89 of the global renewables among them estuaries have the largest renewables emergy which accounts for about 0 39 of the global renewables the next are seagrass beds tidal flats warm water coral reefs mangroves and salt marshes of which the renewables emergy accounts for 0 15 0 14 0 073 0 066 and 0 065 of the global renewables as shown in fig 2 results on services provision by different types of coastal ecosystems indicates that estuaries have the highest total ecosystem services followed by mangroves seagrass beds tidal flats salt marshes and warm water coral reefs besides estuaries also have the largest local renewables input while mangroves have the largest net external organic matter input considering the components of ecosystem services separately estuaries have the largest direct services followed by mangroves seagrass beds tidal flats salt marshes and warm water coral reefs to be more specific estuaries mangroves and seagrass beds have greater biomass increase services while seagrass beds warm water coral reefs and mangroves have greater carbon sequestration services for soil sediment organic matter building services mangroves are the largest contributor followed by seagrass beds estuaries mangroves and tidal flats show larger groundwater recharge services however for indirect services estuaries are still the largest followed by mangroves salt marshes seagrass beds warm water coral reefs and tidal flats among them mangroves and estuaries play a major role in purifying air and water while mangroves and salt marshes contribute a lot to erosion control for microclimate regulation services seagrass beds and estuaries play a greater role it has to be noted that warm water coral reefs play the biggest role in regulating global climate followed by seagrass beds estuaries salt marshes mangroves and tidal flats 3 2 comparison of global coastal ecosystem services the results show that global coastal ecosystem service value is about 4 13e 23sej yr to be more specific asia ranks first among all continents with a service value of 1 23e 23sej yr which contributes about 29 66 of the world s coastal ecosystem service value north america ranks second with a service value of 1 07e 23sej yr contributing about 25 82 of the world s coastal ecosystem service value next are europe oceania south america and africa with the service value of 6 07e 22sej yr 4 90e 22sej yr 3 93e 22sej yr 3 50e 22sej yr of which the contribution is approximately 14 68 11 86 9 51 and 8 48 respectively although global and sub global estimates of coastal ecosystem service values are important it is at the national level that these results probably have the bigger utility among asian countries indonesia has the largest coastal ecosystem service value followed by philippines china bangladesh india japan malaysia myanmar saudi arabia and yemen among north american countries canada ranks first and the united states ranks second followed by mexico cuba panama nicaragua belize honduras haiti and jamaica comparing the coastal ecosystem service value in south american countries brazil ranks first followed by venezuela colombia chile ecuador argentina suriname uruguay and costa rica among european countries the coastal ecosystem service value of the russian federation is the largest while norway greece the united kingdom italy denmark france ukraine spain and sweden rank second to tenth respectively for african countries nigeria ranks first followed by guinea bissau guinea madagascar egypt mozambique cameroon gabon sierra leone and angola for oceanian countries australia has the largest coastal ecosystem service value followed by papua new guinea and new zealand the coastal ecosystem service value in various countries worldwide shows that canada has the largest service value of 5 77e 22sej yr while indonesia australia the united states brazil the russian federation norway philippines mexico and china rank second to tenth respectively with the service value of 4 47e 22sej yr 3 77e 22sej yr 2 68e 22sej yr 1 98e 22sej yr 1 47e 22sej yr 1 39e 22sej yr 1 32e 22sej yr 9 93e 21sej yr 8 37e 21sej yr indeed the top 10 coastal countries contribute approximately 60 of the world s coastal ecosystem service values and the top 26 countries just over 80 3 3 correlation analysis of coastal ecosystem services and indicators in order to explore the relationship between ecosystem services and some socioeconomic indicators especially in coastal field this study implements at country level the scatter plot of the ranking of coastal ecosystem service and the ranking of the key indicators performs linear fitting and analyzes the top 20 countries in both services and key indicators levels the red dots represent the best top 20 countries in terms of both services and socio economic indicators performances the blue dots represent the countries that rank in the best top 20 in terms of ecosystem services provision while the socioeconomic indicators rank below the top 20 the green dots represent the top 20 countries in terms of socioeconomic indicators while the services rank below 20 see fig 3 fig 3 from fig 4 a it can be found that for south korea kor morocco mar peru per pakistan pak etc the coastal ecosystem service is relatively small but a large number of people have gathered in the coastal area which may bring greater pressure to the coastal environment to some extent however for papua new guinea png norway nor cuba cub greece grc etc the situation is the opposite which means that these countries have large coastal ecosystem service provision while the coastal population is still small indicating that there is a potential carrying capacity for increasing inhabitants in the coastal areas for countries such as china chn india ind japan jpn and the united states usa etc the coastal population is roughly positively correlated with the coastal ecosystem service provision meaning that these countries have fully exploited the coastal area in terms of resident population without too much environmental load to the coastal area as shown in fig 4 b for countries such as south korea kor peru per iceland isl and spain esp etc although their coastal ecosystem services rank below 20 have fully utilized one of the most basic services of the ocean seafood production services in fact the seafood catchments of these countries rank among the top 25 in the world countries such as australia aus cuba cub greece grc nigeria nga etc have a higher rank of the coastal ecosystem services while their seafood production ranks lower china chn the united states usa russia rus and indonesia idn etc show both the coastal ecosystem service and the seafood production among the highest in the world fig 4 c shows that countries such as poland pol croatia hrv the netherlands nld and germany deu although ranked below 20 for the coastal ecosystem service have made full use of the tourism and leisure functions of the coastal areas attracting a large number of foreign tourists it has to be underlined that these countries are all european developed countries however for papua new guinea png bangladesh bgd myanmar mmr cuba cub etc the situation is the opposite accounting for a small number of tourists in the united states usa china chn mexico mex the united kingdom gbr coastal areas have played an important role in attracting international tourism and the coastal ecosystem services provision is relatively high the travel and tourism competitiveness index ttci calderwood and soshkin 2019 of these countries can help in explaining this situation the index consists of three sub indicators namely human cultural natural resources business environment infrastructure and regulatory framework for countries corresponding to the green points their ttci rankings are among the top in the world indicating that although these countries are not rich in coastal natural resources their coastal tourism business environment infrastructure and policies regulations are well developed and a safe and healthy tourism environment ensure competitiveness to such regions for most countries represented by the blue dots the ttci ranks at the bottom of the world meaning that although these countries have relatively rich coastal natural resources their backward infrastructure imperfect business environment regulatory framework and poor social security situations have hindered the development of the tourism sector as shown in fig 4 d countries such as poland pol germany deu netherlands nld south korea kor etc with coastal ecosystem services ranked below 20 have a fully developed marine economy enhancing domestic economic growth according to the eu blue economy report 2019 the contribution of the blue economy gross value added of eu countries to the gross value added gva in 2017 was poland 0 8 germany 0 8 netherlands 1 6 while the contribution of south korea s marine economy to its gdp growth in 2008 was 4 9 hwang 2011 however in countries such as papua new guinea png cuba cub myanmar mmr and bangladesh bgd etc the coastal ecosystem services rank relatively high while their gdp ranks relatively low therefore these countries should try to promote the development of the marine economy to stimulate domestic economic growth making full use of coastal resources and vigorously developing marine industries the united states usa china chn japan jpn the united kingdom gbr etc have made full use of the abundant domestic coastal resources to promote their national economic growth fig 4 e shows that european and american countries such as germany deu france fra belgium bel new zealand nzl etc are ranked below 20 for their coastal ecosystem service even if their marine protected areas accounts for a large proportion of the territorial waters the results indicate that awareness toward marine ecosystem protection is higher in those countries affected by ecosystem degradation and lower ecosystem service however in many asian countries such as japan jpn china chn bangladesh bgd indonesia idn etc while having a greater coastal ecosystem service the construction of marine protected areas has not received much attention the cluster of countries including united states usa australia aus the united kingdom gbr brazil bra mexico mex etc not only has a large coastal ecosystem service but also attaches great importance to the construction of marine protected areas to sum up european and american countries are more aware of marine protection and are in the forefront of the construction of marine protected areas however for most asian african and oceanian countries their marine protection awareness still needs for improvement in relation to wind generation as shown in fig 4 f some european countries such as germany deu spain esp france fra turkey tur etc with coastal ecosystem service ranked below 20 have fully utilized the potential of offshore wind power generation however indonesia idn bangladesh bgd the russian federation rus philippines phl show an opposite situation united states usa china chn the united kingdom gbr india ind etc despite a greater coastal ecosystem service they fully develop and utilize offshore wind resources generally speaking european and american countries have a competitive advantage in the international market of offshore wind power generation for their advanced technology and economic strength while the vast number of asian african and oceanian countries still have great unexplored potential in offshore wind power generation therefore the experience of those countries that are at the forefront of offshore wind power generation is worth learning the development of offshore wind power in the united kingdom germany the united states have some common features firstly those countries attach great importance to the development of the offshore wind power industry and some countries have listed it into the national strategy they strongly support the development of new technologies and the research efforts on large scale offshore wind power networking secondly they actively promote the international cooperation plan for offshore wind power and accelerate the strategic pace of the country s offshore wind power development finally they vigorously seek to reduce the cost of offshore wind power these experiences have enlightenment and reference significance for other countries to promote the full use of marine resources and the development of offshore wind power 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variability of marine ecosystem services townsend et al 2018 pointed out that due to the unique characteristics of marine ecosystems the assignment of ecosystem services to specific map grids has become complicated for marine ecosystems sea water and components can be driven to other places by wind tides and currents even for the relatively static submarine habitat the movement of seawater over it and the transportation of carbon oxygen nutrients and pollutants also increase the complexity to the quantification and space allocation of marine ecosystem services in addition identifying and protecting areas where ecosystem services are provided does not necessarily ensure provision of those services over the time failure to integrate important processes and locations in service generation the so called intermediate services may result in a loss of the final services generation haines young and potschin young 2018 for example if spawning grounds and nurseries are not protected the protection of fishing grounds alone may not be sufficient for the ecosystem service provision conservation according to börger et al 2014 not all marine ecosystem services are location specific for example although coral reefs are fixed in space many marine resources such as fish and mammal species and the ecosystem components which support them such as plankton can move in different seasons and different regions therefore some marine ecosystem services are not limited to single country which means that people in one country can benefit from the services provided by other countries this is an important factor for integrating the marine planning and policies of different country and needs to be further considered in subsequent studies 4 2 trade off and synergy between different types of marine ecosystem services due to the diversity of marine ecosystem services the heterogeneity of spatial distribution and the selectivity of human use there is a trade off or synergy relationship between ecosystem services li et al 2013 the trade off relationship refers to the situation in which the supply of certain ecosystem services decreases due to the increase in the use of other ecosystem services rodríguez et al 2006 the damage to marine biodiversity caused by excessive pursuit of seafood production services and the loss of biological habitat caused by the disorderly development of coastal tourism the synergy relationship refers to a situation where two or more ecosystem services are enhanced at the same time li et al 2013 for example mangroves and seagrass beds are breeding and nursery grounds for some marine fisheries and their existence greatly increases the organisms of coral reef fish communities mangroves and seagrass beds can absorb waste discharged into the ocean and serve as sinks of pollutants sediments and other organic materials this pollution and sediment control service can protect coral reefs and maintain their services coral reefs can protect coastal habitats by buffering waves and currents and slowing down periodic storm surges thereby supporting the ability of seagrass beds and mangroves to attenuate waves and buffer winds barbier 2017 therefore clarifying the trade offs and synergies between different types of marine ecosystem services is crucial both in the calculation and evaluation of ecosystem services and in the policy design and needs to be included in future researches 5 conclusion this research establishes a coastal ecosystem service evaluation framework and accounting method from the perspective of ecosystem contributors and calculates the world s coastal ecosystem services the results show that the total service value of coastal ecosystem in the world is about 4 13e 23sej yr to be more specific asia ranks first among all continents and north america ranks second followed by europe oceania south america africa the top ten countries in terms of total coastal ecosystem services in the world are canada indonesia australia the united states brazil the russian federation norway philippines mexico and china among all types of coastal ecosystems estuaries have the highest service value followed by mangroves seagrass beds tidal flats salt marshes and warm water coral reefs furthermore the scatter plots of the ranking of the coastal ecosystem service and of various indicators in different countries show that developed countries perform a better use of coastal resources and fully develop the coastal areas in terms of population carrying seafood production coastal tourism development offshore wind power generation and blue economy promotion besides they pay more attention to the marine protection however the vast number of developing countries may not make full use of their rich coastal resources or only pay attention to the coastal resources usage but ignore the marine protection therefore developed countries still occupy an advantageous position in the process of marine ecosystems protection development and utilization based on emergy analysis this research provides an innovative method for calculating the coastal ecosystem services which is different from the traditional monetary analysis however there are also some limitations in this study due to the lack of basic data and insufficient research on the ecological processes and operating mechanisms of some services the coastal ecosystem service in some countries such as singapore greenland namibia etc and the value of specific services such as biodiversity conservation and cultural and education value have not been calculated this may result in an underestimation of the global coastal ecosystem services in addition this study only calculates coastal ecosystem services involving only about 0 24 of the global area therefore the offshore and pelagic ecosystem services of which the area accounts for approximately 70 of the global area needs further consideration due to the lack of global data on the dynamic changes of coastal wetlands on the time scale only the multi year average ecosystem service value is calculated which may also lead to the deviation of accounting results to the real situation what s more the spatial variability of marine ecosystem services and the trade off and synergy between different types of services need to be further investigated finally dis services such as storm surges tsunamis seawater intrusion coastal ground subsidence and marine oil spills should also be considered in the future if data becomes available declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

16679,struvite formed from digested poultry slurries can serve as an alternative to chemical fertilizers however the biological safety of such products is questionable therefore quantification and inactivation of foodborne pathogens existing in struvite are important herein the dynamics of foodborne pathogens streptococcus faecalis s typhimurium clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli living status whether culturable and viable but non culturable vbnc in struvite were quantified for the first time meanwhile inactivation technologies namely high humidity hot air impingement blanching hhaib cold plasma and hot air treatment were evaluated and compared for their potential to inactivate kill foodborne pathogens in struvite an increase in precipitation ph from 9 0 to 11 0 decreased the culturable count of pathogens in the struvite from 75 to 86 to 7 20 while the vbnc pathogen counts increased from 16 to 24 to 35 55 among the tested inactivation technologies the hhaib treatment at 130 c for 120 s killed approximately 68 79 of foodborne pathogens in struvite precipitated at ph 9 0 vbnc pathogens increased from 16 to 24 to 57 68 after hhaib treatment at 130 c for 120 s struvite treatment with different inactivation technologies did not change its crystalline structure however it reduced functional group abundance therefore further research on inactivation technologies is required to achieve better pathogen reduction efficiency in struvite to make it a biologically safe fertilizer for crop production graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords poultry slurry struvite foodborne pathogens hhaib cold plasma 1 introduction the intensification of global food production is currently one of the most significant challenges to achieving food security fróna et al 2019 as a result intensive agricultural production is constrained by increased nitrogenous fertilizer application and the depletion of rock phosphate stocks li et al 2019 on the other hand excessive leaching of reactive nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients to the environment is threatening the quality of air soil and water and harms ecosystems biodiversity and human health huang et al 2017 strokal et al 2016 it is estimated that in china up to 30 and 60 of nitrogen and phosphorus respectively are lost from the manure chain to the environment chadwick et al 2020 approximately 80 of european freshwaters now have nitrogen levels 1 5 mg of nitrogen per liter that surpass the threshold for a significant risk to biodiversity sutton et al 2011 nutrient recovery from wastewater is one way to close the nutrient cycle to alleviate the diminishing nitrogen and phosphate reservoirs and mitigate their negative environmental footprints struvite crystallization is a sustainable approach for recovering and recycling nutrients from wastewater of various origins darwish et al 2016 current struvite crystallization research mostly focuses on performance optimization and the effect of process variables ph foreign ions and molar ratios li et al 2019 wastewater especially those from livestock industries like poultry slurry has a substantial amount of nitrogen and phosphorus and has been well documented as a hotspot of foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli salmonella species and clostridium perfringens fu et al 2014 oh et al 2015 wang et al 2016 therefore struvite recovered from these types of wastewater is highly contaminated with foodborne pathogens bischel et al 2016 struvite fertilized crops may potentially expose humans to foodborne pathogens abel denee et al 2018 decrey et al 2011 however the hygienic quality and biological safety of struvite as an agricultural fertilizer are still unsolved the struvite formation usually requires alkaline conditions with a ph of 8 0 10 5 for better recovery of nutrients kim et al 2017a under these high ph conditions foodborne pathogens enter a viable but non culturable vbnc state oh et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 vbnc cells are not regarded as dead cells because they retain cellular integrity cellular viability and may regain culturability resuscitation under favorable conditions ayrapetyan et al 2015 fu et al 2014 moreover the total number of viable pathogens may be underestimated using the conventional plate count method because of the inherent non culturability of vbnc cells fu et al 2015 however if all pathogens in the sample are in the vbnc state the sample may be considered germ free owing to non detection li et al 2014 therefore underestimating viable foodborne pathogens in struvite may pose a serious risk to public health upon ingestion of crops grown in soil fertilized with high pathogen containing struvite so applying reliable detection methods is of the utmost importance to accurately quantify the population of viable foodborne pathogens including both culturable and vbnc cells in struvite formed from animal slurries a few studies have investigated the inactivation of pathogens in struvite for example bischel et al 2016 used hot air drying to inactivate culturable and viable salmonella typhimurium and enterococcus spp in struvite recently yee et al 2019 have reported substantial inactivation of e coli and enterococcus spp in struvite after drying treatment however these studies focused only on the count reduction of culturable and viable pathogens the pathogens investigated in the above studies may be induced into the vbnc state during hot air treatment beuchat and mann 2011 this possibility has not been considered in the obtained results it is reasonable to assume that foodborne pathogens have great potential to enter the vbnc state during struvite treatment with different inactivation technologies cooper et al 2010 dinu and bach 2013 however few studies have explored the change in pathogens from the culturable to non culturable vbnc state in struvite after treatment using different inactivation technologies therefore to fill this knowledge gap for the first time foodborne pathogens streptococcus faecalis s typhimurium clostridium perfringens and e coli were profiled into culturable and vbnc in the slurry before and after struvite formation and in struvite after precipitation at varying ph different inactivation treatment technologies including hot air treatment high humidity hot air impingement blanching hhaib and cold plasma treatment were evaluated the potential influence of the inactivation treatments on struvite quality was quantified using x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and semi quantitative ftir analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 struvite formation a series of batch struvite formation experiments was conducted at ph values of 9 0 10 0 and 11 using poultry slurry collected from the de qing yuan biogas plant in the suburbs of beijing china this biogas plant runs under mesophilic conditions 37 c with a hydraulic retention time of approximately 28 days the physicochemical characteristics of the digested poultry slurry are listed in table 1 the ammonium content in poultry slurry is very high compared to those of mg² and po₄³ therefore both mg² and po₄³ were supplemented using analytical grade mgcl₂ 6h₂o and nah₂po₄ with a purity of 99 sigma aldrich taufkirchen germany for struvite formation at all experimental ph values an equimolar ratio of mg² nh₄ and po₄³ was used the solutions were stirred at 150 rpm for 10 min and then allowed to react for 30 min the mixture was left for another 30 min to encourage the struvite to precipitate supernatant samples were collected and filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane for residual nutrients po₄³ and nh₄ after settlement the precipitate was filtered through a cellulose membrane filter with a pore size of 0 45 μm all experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 2 c and replicated three times to obtain reliable results 2 2 pathogens analysis the foodborne pathogens characterized in this study included e coli s typhimurium clostridium perfringens and streptococcus faecalis the selection of these pathogens is based on their prevalence in poultry litter and their subsequent involvement in foodborne outbreaks chen and jiang 2014 koziel et al 2017 pathogen counts in the culturable and the vbnc state in the slurry before and after struvite formation and in struvite precipitated at varying ph values were recorded the culturable count cc of e coli and streptococcus faecalis cells was quantified using chromo cult agar merck frankfurter germany following the method described by viancelli et al 2015 while the cc of s typhimurium and clostridium perfringens was determined using chromogenic media chromagar paris france following the manufacturer s instructions a technique consolidating the most probable number mpn and reverse transcription quantitative pcr rt qpcr was used to test the viable count of foodborne pathogens fu et al 2015 jiang et al 2013 briefly the total microbial rna of the slurry and struvite samples was extracted using the rna power soil total rna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s protocol then rna samples were stored immediately at 80 c for less than 1 month until use genes chosen for analysis were based on the interest in targeting anti resistance bacteria as outlined in the world health organization s who s list of public health concerns who 2017 accordingly uida inva cpn60 and enteral were targeted as a measure of e coli s typhimurium clostridium perfringens and streptococcus faecalis respectively using rt qpcr jacobsen and holben 2007 taskin et al 2011 toplak et al 2012 yee et al 2019 rt qpcr was performed using the sybr prime script rt pcr kit takara bio dalian china according to the manufacturer s instructions further details are given in table 2 qpcr assays were performed on an icycler iq 5 real time pcr detection system biorad laboratories watford hertfordshire uk with icycler iq pcr plates 96 well plates biorad closed with pcr sealer microseal b films biorad the reaction was performed in a final volume of 25 μl containing 5 μl of template 1 sybr green pcr master mix diagenode inc denville united states and 250 nm of each primer barbau piednoir et al 2013 all reactions were performed in triplicate to obtain reliable results to determine viable pathogens standard curves were constructed using the rt qpcr ct values and the corresponding logarithm of pathogen count using the culture method mpn the number of viable pathogens was accurately measured using the ct values obtained from the rt qpcr assay according to the constructed linear standard curves the number of culturable pathogens was then subtracted from the viable count to calculate the number of vbnc pathogens fu et al 2014 2 3 inactivation treatments to inactivate foodborne pathogens in struvite different techniques including hot air treatment hhaib and cold plasma treatment were employed and compared for the hot air treatment the struvite precipitates were treated at 35 c 45 c and 55 c for 24 h in a laboratory incubator biobase bov v125f biobase meihua jinan shangdong china the equipment used for hhaib consisted of round in line nozzles a steam generator to produce steam an electric heater to heat the air and a centrifugal fan to supply and circulate air flow a proportional integral derivative controller omron model e5cn tokyo japan was used to control the blanching temperature wang et al 2018 an air velocity of 14 0 5 ms ¹ and relative humidity from 35 40 were selected as the optimal treatment conditions based on previous studies bai et al 2014 wang et al 2017 according to the pre experiment hhaib was performed at 110 c 120 c and 130 c for a set time of 60 120 s cold plasma treatment was performed using ctd 2000s atmospheric cold plasma equipment suman plasma science and technology ltd nanjing city china which uses air for gas generation at atmospheric pressure the plasma flow was adjusted to 3 l min ¹ with a pulse frequency of 20 khz and power consumption of 750 w struvite samples were uniformly spread in a plate under the plasma nozzle the plate was placed under the plasma equipment at a constant working distance of 6 cm measured from the jet nozzle to the plate cold plasma treatment was performed for 30 45 60 75 and 90 s 2 4 precipitate characterization the potential influence of the inactivation treatments on struvite quality was investigated using different characterization techniques changes in the crystalline structure of the struvite precipitates were determined using x ray diffractometry xrd d8 advance bruker co yokohama shi kanagawa prefecture japan which was excited with cu kα at 45 kv and 100 ma potential changes in the inner structure of struvite were determined using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir varian excalibur 3100 varian inc palo alto ca usa moreover semi quantitative ftir analysis was performed to quantify changes in functional groups after struvite treatment morphological changes in struvite were examined using a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi 7700 tokyo japan at 100 kv coupled with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer the specific surface area was measured using the multipoint brunauer emmett teller bet method quadrasorb si mp florida united states at 77 k additionally a malvern master size laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern analytical malvern worcestershire uk was employed for particle distribution analysis 3 results 3 1 quantification of foodborne pathogens in the poultry slurry the presence of foodborne pathogens in viable culturable and vbnc states in the experimental digested poultry slurry was quantified before and after struvite precipitation under

ph 10 and 11 figures s3 and s4 moreover the vbnc count of foodborne pathogens in the struvite increased from initial 15 6 24 to 34 8 54 9 after hhaib at 130 c for 120 s fig 4 along with hot air treatment and hhaib cold plasma treatment was also employed to inactivate or kill foodborne pathogens in the struvite precipitated from digested poultry slurry figures s5 and 7 cold plasma treatment

application viau et al 2011 however digestate from ad treated poultry manure contains foodborne pathogens eikmeyer et al 2013 sheffield et al 2014 therefore digestate used as fertilizer inevitably involves health risks associated with pathogenic contamination of agricultural land johansen et al 2013 in this study approximately 91 8 94 0 of the total viable foodborne pathogens in the digested slurry were culturable while a small proportion 5 5 8 2 was detected as vbnc fig 1 the detection of vbnc pathogens in the digestate is due to the absence of oxygen during ad oliver 2010 furthermore the accumulated volatile fatty acids vfas during ad also induce pathogens to enter the vbnc state jiang et al 2013 puchajda and oleszkiewicz 2006 likewise fu et al 2015 have observed a positive correlation between the vfa content and the induction of salmonella sp and shigella sp into the vbnc state during ad with an increase in precipitation ph the foodborne pathogen cc decreased and the number of vbnc pathogens increased the foodborne pathogen cc in the digested poultry slurry decreased from 91 8 to 94 0 to 14 19 after struvite precipitation under varying ph conditions fig 1 this was likely due to the unavailability of divalent cations during precipitation at high ph under high ph conditions divalent cations such as ca² mg² zn² and fe² form insoluble carbonates making them inaccessible to microorganisms to perform their enzymatic activities jarvis et al 2001 the adsorption or co precipitation of foodborne pathogens onto or with struvite is also responsible for the decline in pathogen count in digested poultry slurry after struvite precipitation at varying ph values moreover various chemically and environmentally unfavorable conditions such as high ph trigger foodborne pathogens to change their living form from culturable to a vbnc state cunningham et al 2009 oliver 2010 vbnc pathogens in the digested slurry after struvite precipitation were due to precipitation under highly alkaline conditions toxr regulates the expression of more than 150 genes involved in energy metabolism cellular transport iron absorption survival and dormancy and motility in pathogens as a positive regulator of virulence bina et al 2003 toxr degradation occurred in alkaline conditions inducing pathogens to enter the vbnc state almagro moreno et al 2015 likewise alkaline environments facilitated pathogen entrance into vbnc by inactivating osmotic pressure sensor proteins such as envz proteins darcan et al 2009 furthermore the precipitation of struvite s constituent ions that are n and po₄³ make them unavailable for foodborne pathogens this nutrient deficient condition in the digested slurry may prompt the entry of foodborne pathogens into the vbnc state 4 2 struvite became a shelter for foodborne pathogens foodborne pathogens precipitate or adsorb to the surface of struvite and pose a threat to public health like severe illness and in extreme instances may potentially cause death following the application of struvite fertilizer abel denee et al 2018 manyi loh et al 2016 therefore the foodborne pathogen count in struvite was determined to evaluate the hygienic quality and biological safety of land application fig 2 approximately 75 86 of the total viable pathogens were detected as culturable in struvite after precipitation at ph 9 0 usually struvite particles are negatively charged in struvite saturated solutions at ph 9 0 10 however an increase in mg² content in the bulk solution reduces the negative surface charge or eventually turns it into a positive charge if the mg² content is more than 18 mm bouropoulos and koutsoukos 2000 while pathogens typically have negative charges under alkaline conditions they adsorb on struvite in the presence of higher mg² contents michen and graule 2010 likewise in this study the pathogens might be removed by binding with mg² chemical adsorption because of the higher mg² contents approximately 0 3 m used for struvite formation process surface area is one of the important factors influencing adsorption capacity for the pure physisorption process the adsorption capacity increases with an increase in surface area gedam and dongre 2015 while for the chemical adsorption process through electrostatic attraction binding surface area aid in adsorption by affecting the availability of functional groups on the surface of the adsorbent ouyang et al 2019 moreover although a little higher particle size and lower surface area were observed for the struvite precipitated at lower ph figure s8 table s1 the adsorption of pathogens was more prominent on the surface of the struvite obtained after precipitation a lower ph figures s6 and s7 it was due to the slow speed of struvite precipitation that allows pathogens to adsorb on the surface of struvite with a bigger particle size while co precipitation might be the main mechanism of pathogen removal during the high ph struvite precipitation process possibly because of the greater supersaturation matabola et al 2010 ronteltap et al 2010 additionally with an increase in precipitation ph culturable pathogens decreased while more pathogens entered the vbnc state the pathogen cc decreased from 75 to 86 to 27 1 35 4 after struvite precipitation at ph 11 fig 2 the predominance of ammonia at elevated ph is likely the reason for the lower pathogen count at high ph because it enters through bacterial cell walls and causes their cytoplasm to become alkaline thereby killing them bujoczek 2001 viancelli et al 2015 the n content in the digested slurry used in this study is very high 5236 152 mg l ¹ and at ph 10 11 most of this n exists as ammonia as confirmed by a previously published study muhmood et al 2018 therefore the higher ammonia content was responsible for a lower pathogen count in the struvite precipitated at high ph in the current study foodborne pathogens change their living state from culturable to vbnc as a survival strategy under adverse environmental conditions such as high ph erkan and sanin 2013 oh et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 in this study the pathogen count in the vbnc state increased from 15 6 to 24 to 27 35 when the ph of the struvite precipitation increased from 9 to 11 fig 2 alkaline conditions cause bacterial cells to enter the vbnc state by reducing their cell activity nyström 2003 moreover alkaline conditions also lead to a decrease in porin proteins in the pathogen outer membrane responsible for their survival in the natural environment this situation also induces cells to enter the vbnc state darcan et al 2009 vbnc pathogens also have adsorption ability for various surfaces and may change their adhesion properties for example clostridium jejuni retains its ability to attach to stainless steel whereas streptococcus faecalis cannot adsorb to plastic duffy and dykes 2009 therefore vbnc pathogens may also be adsorbed on the struvite surface in the current study upon struvite land application vbnc cells may pose a potential health risk because of quick resuscitation into culturable cells if conditions are favorable pinto et al 2011 however the success of resuscitation relies on many factors including the conditions that induce vbnc pathogen strain vbnc pathogen age and conditions required for resuscitation therefore these factors should be considered when applying struvite to the soil to avoid potential health risks upon ingestion of crops cultivated on struvite fertilized soils 4 3 performance of the tested inactivation technologies was unsatisfactory the potential use of struvite as a fertilizer calls for the inactivation of biological hazards that affect its quality previously only a few studies had evaluated the pathogen count in struvite and their subsequent inactivation particularly in the culturable and viable state for example yee et al 2019 characterized the culturable and viable pathogen count in commercially available wet and dried struvite and found a marked reduction in the pathogen count after drying however approximately 215 cfu g 1 enterococci remain in the dried struvite samples similarly bischel et al 2016 evaluated the inactivation of enterococcus spp and s typhimurium in struvite precipitated from human urine by air drying under controlled temperature 5 35 c and relative humidity 40 80 the authors concluded that the extent of inactivation performance ranged widely under different air drying conditions and was often incapable of achieving satisfactory results even after almost 200 h of drying by contrast in the current study advanced inactivation technologies such as hhaib and cold plasma treatment were evaluated for their potential to reduce pathogen counts in struvite among tested inactivation technologies hhaib was observed to be more efficient in inactivating foodborne pathogens while cold plasma treatment was found to be least effective in inactivating foodborne pathogens an approximate 62 94 and 68 79 reduction in culturable and viable pathogen counts occurred after struvite treatment using these inactivation technologies respectively however complete inactivation of the detected pathogens in struvite was not achieved moreover the change in living pathogens from culturable to the vbnc state during struvite treatment 34 8 54 9 was demonstrated for the first time in this study these results propose a discussion on the reported reduction efficiency in the aforementioned studies which may be overestimated beuchat and mann 2011 under specific favourable conditions like increase or decrease in nutrient concentration increase or decrease in temperature and the presence of chemical stimuli the pathogens regain cultivability ayrapetyan et al 2015 fu et al 2014 the resuscitation condition differs for different pathogens for example e coli and salmonella spp were induced into the vbnc state during anaerobic digestion but resuscitated to the culturable state during sewage sludge storage at room temperature for 30 days fu et al 2015 similarly pinto et al 2011 observed amino acids could resuscitate vbnc cells of hemolytic e coli but not e coli o157 h7 so the favourable conditions for resuscitation not only vary with pathogen type and also for species of the same pathogen hence the presence of vbnc pathogens poses a potential risk that requires further examination the insufficient inactivation of the tested technology and the high vbnc mitigation rate require the identification of other inactivation technologies capable of achieving satisfactory inactivation performance without mitigating pathogens to enter the vbnc state furthermore the inactivation technologies employed in this study performed well in the food industry with almost 100 inactivation of foodborne pathogens under high treatment temperatures and exposure times grasso kelley et al 2021 kim et al 2017b kwon et al 2018 herein with an increase in treatment temperature or the exposure time the reduction in pathogen count increased for example increasing the hhaib temperature from 110 to 130 c increased the pathogen inactivation rate from 53 to 67 to 68 79 during high humidity hot air blanching hhib the high temperature steam passes through the sample at constant pressure that triggers protein denaturation which can disrupt the cell membrane intracellular electrolyte balance and cellular metabolism of the pathogens wang et al 2018 hhib inactivated killed pathogens by inhibiting their enzymatic activities and the rate of inactivation increases with an increase in treatment temperature and time xiao et al 2014 xiao et al 2012 hhaib has been reported to inactivate polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase enzymes thereby enhancing the inactivation of pathogens bai et al 2014 wang et al 2017 therefore based on the results it is reasonable to speculate that with a further increase in treatment temperature and duration the inactivation performance of these technologies would become satisfactory however treatment of struvite at temperatures 55 c leads to the deterioration of struvite fertilizer quality due to the loss of n as ammonia bhuiyan et al 2008 additionally an increase in temperature and exposure time would make these inactivation technologies uneconomical soils are known to harbor a variety of foodborne pathogens and generally contained around 10⁴ 10⁹ cfu gˉ¹ 10⁶ cfu gˉ¹ 10⁴ 10⁸ cfu gˉ¹ 10³ 10⁷ cfu gˉ¹ streptococcus faecalis e coli clostridium perfringens and s typhi respectively jechalke et al 2019 makino et al 2019 marteinsson et al 2015 although the inactivation methods utilized here could not completely inactivate all pathogens in the struvite the number of pathogens in the struvite was very low when compared to the number of pathogens that normally existed in the soils therefore the struvite obtained following inactivation treatment is biologically safe and may be utilized as fertilizer on agricultural land however to ensure product safety on a sustainable scale it is imperative to correctly understand the routes fate transport establishment and survival of pathogens in the soil after application of struvite struvite precipitation has been effectively used to recover nutrients from agricultural wastewaters at the laboratory pilot and commercial scale desmidt et al 2015 muhmood et al 2019a the potential of struvite formation for recovering nutrients from poultry slurry has been assessed and n and p recovery rates of 85 94 and 95 respectively have been reported muhmood et al 2019b muhmood et al 2018 yeti̇lmezsoy et al 2013 yilmazel and demirer 2013 from the perspective of environmental sustainability life cycle assessments have shown that struvite based fertilizer has a lower environmental impact than phosphate rock shaddel et al 2020 temizel sekeryan et al 2021 moreover the lack of heavy metals and biological hazards in struvite makes it even more favorable from a toxicity viewpoint than phosphate rock de boer et al 2018 regarding the economic viability of struvite precipitation the concept of using low cost magnesium sources and recycling recovered products can make struvite precipitation feasible both technically and economically muhmood et al 2019a shaddel et al 2020 so struvite precipitation is an environmentally friendly and economically viable technology that can facilitate nutrient cycling from agricultural wastewater and close the nutrient loop likewise more studies are required to evaluate inactivation technologies for foodborne pathogens in struvite to make it a biologically safe fertilizer for crop production similarly an economic assessment should be integrated 4 4 potential influence of inactivation technologies on struvite struvite treatment with different inactivation technologies may cause changes in the struvite for example the crystalline structure of struvite changes to amorphous after hot air treatment kurtulus and tas 2011 therefore struvite precipitates before and after the different treatments were evaluated using various characterization techniques for potential changes the struvite xrd diffractograms obtained at different ph values matched well with the struvite standard for peak intensities which suggested that no change in the crystalline structure occurred by precipitating struvite at varying ph conditions figure s9 similarly no change in the crystalline structure of struvite was observed after struvite treatment using different techniques ftir was performed to observe changes in the functional groups of the struvite precipitated at varying ph and after different inactivation technologies figures s10 and s11 a detailed description of the ftir analysis is provided in the supporting information the struvite ftir spectra obtained after different treatment technologies showed minor variations in functional groups to amplify these changes a semi quantitative method was conducted to analyze the ftir spectra figs 6 and s12 for this purpose the ftir spectra were divided into five regions 400 600 cmˉ¹ 700 800 cmˉ¹ 1000 1200 cmˉ¹ 1400 1700 cmˉ¹ and 2800 3000 cmˉ¹ which are attributed to a po₄³ˉ ion metal oxygen bonding po₄³ˉ ion nh bending and nh₄ ion respectively the peak area decreased with an increase in the precipitation ph figure s12 the area of the peaks at the previously mentioned wavenumbers was around approximately 9 34 88 4 cm² for the struvite precipitated at ph 9 0 with an increase in precipitation ph to 11 the peak area declined to 3 0 58 3 cm² the decrease in peak area with an increase in precipitation ph is attributed to proton dissociation or deprotonation of the functional groups omoike et al 2004 parikh et al 2008 moreover the peak area also decreased after struvite treatment and the lowest area of approximately 2 25 48 9 cm² for the peaks at the selected wavenumbers was observed in the struvite after hhaib at 130 c for 120 s compared to that of other treatment technologies fig 6 a decrease in the peak area is regarded as a variation in the functional group abundance chen et al 2015 therefore struvite treatment employing different technologies resulted in changes in functional group abundance without disturbing their arrangement which was responsible for maintaining the struvite crystalline structure ftir analysis confirmed that struvite contained nh₄ po₄³ nh and metal oxygen functional groups the decrease in the abundance of these functional groups may cause a reduction in the contents of these metals in the struvite as the fertilizer quality of the struvite relies upon its nutrient contents therefore decrease in the contents of nutrients may affect its quality however the exact mechanism of how a decrease in relative abundance influences fertilizer quality of struvite needs to be elucidated 5 conclusions this study quantified foodborne pathogens into culturable and viable but non culturable vbnc in struvite precipitated from anaerobically digested poultry slurry different inactivation technologies were tested for inactivation killing of pathogens in the struvite precipitated at varying ph values precipitating struvite at high ph resulted in a greater reduction in the culturable foodborne pathogen count than precipitation at lower ph more importantly high humidity hot air impingement blanching treatment was more efficient in killing foodborne pathogens among the tested treatments the same treatment however also induced more pathogens to enter a vbnc state furthermore struvite treatment with inactivation technologies reduced its functional group abundance although the crystalline structure remained unaffected based on these results further exploration of the biological risks associated with struvite recovered from strength wastewaters is necessary moreover proper storage of struvite following pathogen inactivation is required to avoid the resuscitation potential of

16679,struvite formed from digested poultry slurries can serve as an alternative to chemical fertilizers however the biological safety of such products is questionable therefore quantification and inactivation of foodborne pathogens existing in struvite are important herein the dynamics of foodborne pathogens streptococcus faecalis s typhimurium clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli living status whether culturable and viable but non culturable vbnc in struvite were quantified for the first time meanwhile inactivation technologies namely high humidity hot air impingement blanching hhaib cold plasma and hot air treatment were evaluated and compared for their potential to inactivate kill foodborne pathogens in struvite an increase in precipitation ph from 9 0 to 11 0 decreased the culturable count of pathogens in the struvite from 75 to 86 to 7 20 while the vbnc pathogen counts increased from 16 to 24 to 35 55 among the tested inactivation technologies the hhaib treatment at 130 c for 120 s killed approximately 68 79 of foodborne pathogens in struvite precipitated at ph 9 0 vbnc pathogens increased from 16 to 24 to 57 68 after hhaib treatment at 130 c for 120 s struvite treatment with different inactivation technologies did not change its crystalline structure however it reduced functional group abundance therefore further research on inactivation technologies is required to achieve better pathogen reduction efficiency in struvite to make it a biologically safe fertilizer for crop production graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords poultry slurry struvite foodborne pathogens hhaib cold plasma 1 introduction the intensification of global food production is currently one of the most significant challenges to achieving food security fróna et al 2019 as a result intensive agricultural production is constrained by increased nitrogenous fertilizer application and the depletion of rock phosphate stocks li et al 2019 on the other hand excessive leaching of reactive nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients to the environment is threatening the quality of air soil and water and harms ecosystems biodiversity and human health huang et al 2017 strokal et al 2016 it is estimated that in china up to 30 and 60 of nitrogen and phosphorus respectively are lost from the manure chain to the environment chadwick et al 2020 approximately 80 of european freshwaters now have nitrogen levels 1 5 mg of nitrogen per liter that surpass the threshold for a significant risk to biodiversity sutton et al 2011 nutrient recovery from wastewater is one way to close the nutrient cycle to alleviate the diminishing nitrogen and phosphate reservoirs and mitigate their negative environmental footprints struvite crystallization is a sustainable approach for recovering and recycling nutrients from wastewater of various origins darwish et al 2016 current struvite crystallization research mostly focuses on performance optimization and the effect of process variables ph foreign ions and molar ratios li et al 2019 wastewater especially those from livestock industries like poultry slurry has a substantial amount of nitrogen and phosphorus and has been well documented as a hotspot of foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli salmonella species and clostridium perfringens fu et al 2014 oh et al 2015 wang et al 2016 therefore struvite recovered from these types of wastewater is highly contaminated with foodborne pathogens bischel et al 2016 struvite fertilized crops may potentially expose humans to foodborne pathogens abel denee et al 2018 decrey et al 2011 however the hygienic quality and biological safety of struvite as an agricultural fertilizer are still unsolved the struvite formation usually requires alkaline conditions with a ph of 8 0 10 5 for better recovery of nutrients kim et al 2017a under these high ph conditions foodborne pathogens enter a viable but non culturable vbnc state oh et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 vbnc cells are not regarded as dead cells because they retain cellular integrity cellular viability and may regain culturability resuscitation under favorable conditions ayrapetyan et al 2015 fu et al 2014 moreover the total number of viable pathogens may be underestimated using the conventional plate count method because of the inherent non culturability of vbnc cells fu et al 2015 however if all pathogens in the sample are in the vbnc state the sample may be considered germ free owing to non detection li et al 2014 therefore underestimating viable foodborne pathogens in struvite may pose a serious risk to public health upon ingestion of crops grown in soil fertilized with high pathogen containing struvite so applying reliable detection methods is of the utmost importance to accurately quantify the population of viable foodborne pathogens including both culturable and vbnc cells in struvite formed from animal slurries a few studies have investigated the inactivation of pathogens in struvite for example bischel et al 2016 used hot air drying to inactivate culturable and viable salmonella typhimurium and enterococcus spp in struvite recently yee et al 2019 have reported substantial inactivation of e coli and enterococcus spp in struvite after drying treatment however these studies focused only on the count reduction of culturable and viable pathogens the pathogens investigated in the above studies may be induced into the vbnc state during hot air treatment beuchat and mann 2011 this possibility has not been considered in the obtained results it is reasonable to assume that foodborne pathogens have great potential to enter the vbnc state during struvite treatment with different inactivation technologies cooper et al 2010 dinu and bach 2013 however few studies have explored the change in pathogens from the culturable to non culturable vbnc state in struvite after treatment using different inactivation technologies therefore to fill this knowledge gap for the first time foodborne pathogens streptococcus faecalis s typhimurium clostridium perfringens and e coli were profiled into culturable and vbnc in the slurry before and after struvite formation and in struvite after precipitation at varying ph different inactivation treatment technologies including hot air treatment high humidity hot air impingement blanching hhaib and cold plasma treatment were evaluated the potential influence of the inactivation treatments on struvite quality was quantified using x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and semi quantitative ftir analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 struvite formation a series of batch struvite formation experiments was conducted at ph values of 9 0 10 0 and 11 using poultry slurry collected from the de qing yuan biogas plant in the suburbs of beijing china this biogas plant runs under mesophilic conditions 37 c with a hydraulic retention time of approximately 28 days the physicochemical characteristics of the digested poultry slurry are listed in table 1 the ammonium content in poultry slurry is very high compared to those of mg² and po₄³ therefore both mg² and po₄³ were supplemented using analytical grade mgcl₂ 6h₂o and nah₂po₄ with a purity of 99 sigma aldrich taufkirchen germany for struvite formation at all experimental ph values an equimolar ratio of mg² nh₄ and po₄³ was used the solutions were stirred at 150 rpm for 10 min and then allowed to react for 30 min the mixture was left for another 30 min to encourage the struvite to precipitate supernatant samples were collected and filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane for residual nutrients po₄³ and nh₄ after settlement the precipitate was filtered through a cellulose membrane filter with a pore size of 0 45 μm all experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 2 c and replicated three times to obtain reliable results 2 2 pathogens analysis the foodborne pathogens characterized in this study included e coli s typhimurium clostridium perfringens and streptococcus faecalis the selection of these pathogens is based on their prevalence in poultry litter and their subsequent involvement in foodborne outbreaks chen and jiang 2014 koziel et al 2017 pathogen counts in the culturable and the vbnc state in the slurry before and after struvite formation and in struvite precipitated at varying ph values were recorded the culturable count cc of e coli and streptococcus faecalis cells was quantified using chromo cult agar merck frankfurter germany following the method described by viancelli et al 2015 while the cc of s typhimurium and clostridium perfringens was determined using chromogenic media chromagar paris france following the manufacturer s instructions a technique consolidating the most probable number mpn and reverse transcription quantitative pcr rt qpcr was used to test the viable count of foodborne pathogens fu et al 2015 jiang et al 2013 briefly the total microbial rna of the slurry and struvite samples was extracted using the rna power soil total rna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s protocol then rna samples were stored immediately at 80 c for less than 1 month until use genes chosen for analysis were based on the interest in targeting anti resistance bacteria as outlined in the world health organization s who s list of public health concerns who 2017 accordingly uida inva cpn60 and enteral were targeted as a measure of e coli s typhimurium clostridium perfringens and streptococcus faecalis respectively using rt qpcr jacobsen and holben 2007 taskin et al 2011 toplak et al 2012 yee et al 2019 rt qpcr was performed using the sybr prime script rt pcr kit takara bio dalian china according to the manufacturer s instructions further details are given in table 2 qpcr assays were performed on an icycler iq 5 real time pcr detection system biorad laboratories watford hertfordshire uk with icycler iq pcr plates 96 well plates biorad closed with pcr sealer microseal b films biorad the reaction was performed in a final volume of 25 μl containing 5 μl of template 1 sybr green pcr master mix diagenode inc denville united states and 250 nm of each primer barbau piednoir et al 2013 all reactions were performed in triplicate to obtain reliable results to determine viable pathogens standard curves were constructed using the rt qpcr ct values and the corresponding logarithm of pathogen count using the culture method mpn the number of viable pathogens was accurately measured using the ct values obtained from the rt qpcr assay according to the constructed linear standard curves the number of culturable pathogens was then subtracted from the viable count to calculate the number of vbnc pathogens fu et al 2014 2 3 inactivation treatments to inactivate foodborne pathogens in struvite different techniques including hot air treatment hhaib and cold plasma treatment were employed and compared for the hot air treatment the struvite precipitates were treated at 35 c 45 c and 55 c for 24 h in a laboratory incubator biobase bov v125f biobase meihua jinan shangdong china the equipment used for hhaib consisted of round in line nozzles a steam generator to produce steam an electric heater to heat the air and a centrifugal fan to supply and circulate air flow a proportional integral derivative controller omron model e5cn tokyo japan was used to control the blanching temperature wang et al 2018 an air velocity of 14 0 5 ms ¹ and relative humidity from 35 40 were selected as the optimal treatment conditions based on previous studies bai et al 2014 wang et al 2017 according to the pre experiment hhaib was performed at 110 c 120 c and 130 c for a set time of 60 120 s cold plasma treatment was performed using ctd 2000s atmospheric cold plasma equipment suman plasma science and technology ltd nanjing city china which uses air for gas generation at atmospheric pressure the plasma flow was adjusted to 3 l min ¹ with a pulse frequency of 20 khz and power consumption of 750 w struvite samples were uniformly spread in a plate under the plasma nozzle the plate was placed under the plasma equipment at a constant working distance of 6 cm measured from the jet nozzle to the plate cold plasma treatment was performed for 30 45 60 75 and 90 s 2 4 precipitate characterization the potential influence of the inactivation treatments on struvite quality was investigated using different characterization techniques changes in the crystalline structure of the struvite precipitates were determined using x ray diffractometry xrd d8 advance bruker co yokohama shi kanagawa prefecture japan which was excited with cu kα at 45 kv and 100 ma potential changes in the inner structure of struvite were determined using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir varian excalibur 3100 varian inc palo alto ca usa moreover semi quantitative ftir analysis was performed to quantify changes in functional groups after struvite treatment morphological changes in struvite were examined using a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi 7700 tokyo japan at 100 kv coupled with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer the specific surface area was measured using the multipoint brunauer emmett teller bet method quadrasorb si mp florida united states at 77 k additionally a malvern master size laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern analytical malvern worcestershire uk was employed for particle distribution analysis 3 results 3 1 quantification of foodborne pathogens in the poultry slurry the presence of foodborne pathogens in viable culturable and vbnc states in the experimental digested poultry slurry was quantified before and after struvite precipitation under varying ph conditions fig 1 the total cc of streptococcus faecalis s typhimurium clostridium perfringens and e coli in the digested poultry slurry before struvite precipitation was approximately 5 35 10⁴ 1300 6 70 10³ 800 1 80 10³ 460 and 5 80 10³ 380 colony forming units cfu ml ¹ respectively moreover the cc was observed to be approximately 91 8 94 0 of the total viable foodborne pathogens while 5 5 8 2 of viable pathogens were observed to be in the vbnc state approximately 52 63 of foodborne pathogens in the digested samples were killed after struvite precipitation at ph 9 0 with an increase in ph to 11 the pathogen death rate further increased to 73 76 furthermore after struvite precipitation at ph 9 0 the foodborne pathogen cc in the digested poultry slurry decreased from 91 8 to 94 0 to 32 44 while the pathogens in the vbnc state increased from 5 5 to 8 2 to 13 8 22 fig 1 after struvite precipitation at ph 11 the cc decreased further to 14 19 while the vbnc pathogen count increased to 29 9 41 7 fig 1b d moreover the tested foodborne pathogens were statistically on par with each other for the cc reduction in the digested slurry after struvite precipitation at ph 9 0 p 0 05 among the tested foodborne pathogens streptococcus faecalis was susceptible with a reduction of 67 6 while clostridium perfringens was resistant to ph cc reduction of 56 3 2 quantification of foodborne pathogens in the struvite the quantified foodborne pathogens in the struvite precipitated under varying ph conditions are shown in fig 2 from the viable count of foodborne pathogens in the digested slurry approximately 19 7 24 1 were observed in struvite precipitates obtained after precipitation at ph 9 0 moreover the total cc of streptococcus faecalis s typhimurium clostridium perfringens and e coli in the struvite after precipitation at ph 9 0 was approximately 9 08 10³ 400 5 80 10² 60 3 64 10² 40 and 1 08 10³ 120 cfu gˉ¹ respectively similarly the pathogen cc was approximately 75 86 of the total viable foodborne pathogens in the struvite approximately 15 6 24 of the total viable foodborne pathogens changed their living form from culturable to the vbnc state after struvite precipitation at ph 9 0 after struvite precipitation at ph 11 the pathogen cc further decreased to 27 1 35 4 while pathogens in the vbnc state increased to 27 0 35 3 3 3 quantification of foodborne pathogens in the struvite after inactivation treatment after confirming the presence of pathogens in the struvite precipitated from digested poultry slurry different technologies including hhaib hot air treatment and cold plasma treatment were evaluated and compared for their potential to kill inactivate pathogens or change their living state from culturable to vbnc approximately 43 55 of foodborne pathogens in the struvite obtained after precipitation at ph 9 0 were killed after hot air treatment at 35 c for 24 h with an increase in treatment temperature from 35 to 55 c the pathogen killing rate increased to 57 68 fig 3 moreover the pathogen cc in the struvite precipitated at ph 9 0 decreased from 75 to 86 to 47 5 52 and the vbnc pathogens increased from 15 6 to 24 to 21 9 38 7 after hot air treatment of struvite at 35 c fig 3 with an increase in treatment temperature to 55 c the pathogen cc further decreased to 19 5 38 2 while vbnc pathogens increased to 24 0 45 5 a similar reduction in cc and increase in vbnc counts of foodborne pathogens in the struvite precipitated at ph 11 0 was observed after hot air treatment at varying temperatures figure s1 the efficacy of hhaib in reducing foodborne pathogen counts in struvite was also evaluated figure s2 it was found that both treatment temperature and time significantly influenced the pathogens inactivation p 0 05 hhaib at 110 c for 120 s killed approximately 54 5 67 6 of foodborne pathogens with an increase in treatment temperature to 130 c under constant treatment time of 120 s the foodborne pathogen death rate further increased to 67 8 78 9 when considering the treatment time it was found that the foodborne pathogen cc in the struvite precipitated at ph 9 declined from 75 to 86 to 33 3 45 6 after hhaib treatment at 110 c for 60 s with an increase in treatment duration to 120 s the foodborne pathogen cc decreased to 22 2 30 3 the foodborne pathogen cc further decreased to 5 5 12 5 with hhaib treatment at 130 c for 120 s a similar reduction trend in the foodborne pathogen cc with variation in hhaib temperature and treatment duration was observed for struvite precipitated at ph 10 and 11 figures s3 and s4 moreover the vbnc count of foodborne pathogens in the struvite increased from initial 15 6 24 to 34 8 54 9 after hhaib at 130 c for 120 s fig 4 along with hot air treatment and hhaib cold plasma treatment was also employed to inactivate or kill foodborne pathogens in the struvite precipitated from digested poultry slurry figures s5 and 7 cold plasma treatment for 30 s killed approximately 21 1 29 8 of foodborne pathogens however with an increase in treatment duration to 90 s the pathogen killing rate increased to 48 6 53 6 the foodborne pathogen cc in struvite obtained after precipitation at ph 9 0 declined from 75 to 86 to 72 9 83 7 after 30 s of cold plasma treatment with an increase in cold plasma treatment duration from 30 s to 90 s the pathogen cc decreased to 32 8 41 2 a similar decreased trend in the pathogen cc at incremented times of cold plasma treatment was recorded in the struvite obtained after precipitation at ph 10 and 11 with variation in values figure s5 furthermore the vbnc pathogen count increased from 15 6 to 24 to 24 8 46 1 with an increase in cold plasma treatment time from 30 s to 90 s fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 alkaline struvite precipitation reduced foodborne pathogens in poultry slurry anaerobic digestion ad is an effective strategy for improving the biological safety of poultry manure before land application viau et al 2011 however digestate from ad treated poultry manure contains foodborne pathogens eikmeyer et al 2013 sheffield et al 2014 therefore digestate used as fertilizer inevitably involves health risks associated with pathogenic contamination of agricultural land johansen et al 2013 in this study approximately 91 8 94 0 of the total viable foodborne pathogens in the digested slurry were culturable while a small proportion 5 5 8 2 was detected as vbnc fig 1 the detection of vbnc pathogens in the digestate is due to the absence of oxygen during ad oliver 2010 furthermore the accumulated volatile fatty acids vfas during ad also induce pathogens to enter the vbnc state jiang et al 2013 puchajda and oleszkiewicz 2006 likewise fu et al 2015 have observed a positive correlation between the vfa content and the induction of salmonella sp and shigella sp into the vbnc state during ad with an increase in precipitation ph the foodborne pathogen cc decreased and the number of vbnc pathogens increased the foodborne pathogen cc in the digested poultry slurry decreased from 91 8 to 94 0 to 14 19 after struvite precipitation under varying ph conditions fig 1 this was likely due to the unavailability of divalent cations during precipitation at high ph under high ph conditions divalent cations such as ca² mg² zn² and fe² form insoluble carbonates making them inaccessible to microorganisms to perform their enzymatic activities jarvis et al 2001 the adsorption or co precipitation of foodborne pathogens onto or with struvite is also responsible for the decline in pathogen count in digested poultry slurry after struvite precipitation at varying ph values moreover various chemically and environmentally unfavorable conditions such as high ph trigger foodborne pathogens to change their living form from culturable to a vbnc state cunningham et al 2009 oliver 2010 vbnc pathogens in the digested slurry after struvite precipitation were due to precipitation under highly alkaline conditions toxr regulates the expression of more than 150 genes involved in energy metabolism cellular transport iron absorption survival and dormancy and motility in pathogens as a positive regulator of virulence bina et al 2003 toxr degradation occurred in alkaline conditions inducing pathogens to enter the vbnc state almagro moreno et al 2015 likewise alkaline environments facilitated pathogen entrance into vbnc by inactivating osmotic pressure sensor proteins such as envz proteins darcan et al 2009 furthermore the precipitation of struvite s constituent ions that are n and po₄³ make them unavailable for foodborne pathogens this nutrient deficient condition in the digested slurry may prompt the entry of foodborne pathogens into the vbnc state 4 2 struvite became a shelter for foodborne pathogens foodborne pathogens precipitate or adsorb to the surface of struvite and pose a threat to public health like severe illness and in extreme instances may potentially cause death following the application of struvite fertilizer abel denee et al 2018 manyi loh et al 2016 therefore the foodborne pathogen count in struvite was determined to evaluate the hygienic quality and biological safety of land application fig 2 approximately 75 86 of the total viable pathogens were detected as culturable in struvite after precipitation at ph 9 0 usually struvite particles are negatively charged in struvite saturated solutions at ph 9 0 10 however an increase in mg² content in the bulk solution reduces the negative surface charge or eventually turns it into a positive charge if the mg² content is more than 18 mm bouropoulos and koutsoukos 2000 while pathogens typically have negative charges under alkaline conditions they adsorb on struvite in the presence of higher mg² contents michen and graule 2010 likewise in this study the pathogens might be removed by binding with mg² chemical adsorption because of the higher mg² contents approximately 0 3 m used for struvite formation process surface area is one of the important factors influencing adsorption capacity for the pure physisorption process the adsorption capacity increases with an increase in surface area gedam and dongre 2015 while for the chemical adsorption process through electrostatic attraction binding surface area aid in adsorption by affecting the availability of functional groups on the surface of the adsorbent ouyang et al 2019 moreover although a little higher particle size and lower surface area were observed for the struvite precipitated at lower ph figure s8 table s1 the adsorption of pathogens was more prominent on the surface of the struvite obtained after precipitation a lower ph figures s6 and s7 it was due to the slow speed of struvite precipitation that allows pathogens to adsorb on the surface of struvite with a bigger particle size while co precipitation might be the main mechanism of pathogen removal during the high ph struvite precipitation process possibly because of the greater supersaturation matabola et al 2010 ronteltap et al 2010 additionally with an increase in precipitation ph culturable pathogens decreased while more pathogens entered the vbnc state the pathogen cc decreased from 75 to 86 to 27 1 35 4 after struvite precipitation at ph 11 fig 2 the predominance of ammonia at elevated ph is likely the reason for the lower pathogen count at high ph because it enters through bacterial cell walls and causes their cytoplasm to become alkaline thereby killing them bujoczek 2001 viancelli et al 2015 the n content in the digested slurry used in this study is very high 5236 152 mg l ¹ and at ph 10 11 most of this n exists as ammonia as confirmed by a previously published study muhmood et al 2018 therefore the higher ammonia content was responsible for a lower pathogen count in the struvite precipitated at high ph in the current study foodborne pathogens change their living state from culturable to vbnc as a survival strategy under adverse environmental conditions such as high ph erkan and sanin 2013 oh et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 in this study the pathogen count in the vbnc state increased from 15 6 to 24 to 27 35 when the ph of the struvite precipitation increased from 9 to 11 fig 2 alkaline conditions cause bacterial cells to enter the vbnc state by reducing their cell activity nyström 2003 moreover alkaline conditions also lead to a decrease in porin proteins in the pathogen outer membrane responsible for their survival in the natural environment this situation also induces cells to enter the vbnc state darcan et al 2009 vbnc pathogens also have adsorption ability for various surfaces and may change their adhesion properties for example clostridium jejuni retains its ability to attach to stainless steel whereas streptococcus faecalis cannot adsorb to plastic duffy and dykes 2009 therefore vbnc pathogens may also be adsorbed on the struvite surface in the current study upon struvite land application vbnc cells may pose a potential health risk because of quick resuscitation into culturable cells if conditions are favorable pinto et al 2011 however the success of resuscitation relies on many factors including the conditions that induce vbnc pathogen strain vbnc pathogen age and conditions required for resuscitation therefore these factors should be considered when applying struvite to the soil to avoid potential health risks upon ingestion of crops cultivated on struvite fertilized soils 4 3 performance of the tested inactivation technologies was unsatisfactory the potential use of struvite as a fertilizer calls for the inactivation of biological hazards that affect its quality previously only a few studies had evaluated the pathogen count in struvite and their subsequent inactivation particularly in the culturable and viable state for example yee et al 2019 characterized the culturable and viable pathogen count in commercially available wet and dried struvite and found a marked reduction in the pathogen count after drying however approximately 215 cfu g 1 enterococci remain in the dried struvite samples similarly bischel et al 2016 evaluated the inactivation of enterococcus spp and s typhimurium in struvite precipitated from human urine by air drying under controlled temperature 5 35 c and relative humidity 40 80 the authors concluded that the extent of inactivation performance ranged widely under different air drying conditions and was often incapable of achieving satisfactory results even after almost 200 h of drying by contrast in the current study advanced inactivation technologies such as hhaib and cold plasma treatment were evaluated for their potential to reduce pathogen counts in struvite among tested inactivation technologies hhaib was observed to be more efficient in inactivating foodborne pathogens while cold plasma treatment was found to be least effective in inactivating foodborne pathogens an approximate 62 94 and 68 79 reduction in culturable and viable pathogen counts occurred after struvite treatment using these inactivation technologies respectively however complete inactivation of the detected pathogens in struvite was not achieved moreover the change in living pathogens from culturable to the vbnc state during struvite treatment 34 8 54 9 was demonstrated for the first time in this study these results propose a discussion on the reported reduction efficiency in the aforementioned studies which may be overestimated beuchat and mann 2011 under specific favourable conditions like increase or decrease in nutrient concentration increase or decrease in temperature and the presence of chemical stimuli the pathogens regain cultivability ayrapetyan et al 2015 fu et al 2014 the resuscitation condition differs for different pathogens for example e coli and salmonella spp were induced into the vbnc state during anaerobic digestion but resuscitated to the culturable state during sewage sludge storage at room temperature for 30 days fu et al 2015 similarly pinto et al 2011 observed amino acids could resuscitate vbnc cells of hemolytic e coli but not e coli o157 h7 so the favourable conditions for resuscitation not only vary with pathogen type and also for species of the same pathogen hence the presence of vbnc pathogens poses a potential risk that requires further examination the insufficient inactivation of the tested technology and the high vbnc mitigation rate require the identification of other inactivation technologies capable of achieving satisfactory inactivation performance without mitigating pathogens to enter the vbnc state furthermore the inactivation technologies employed in this study performed well in the food industry with almost 100 inactivation of foodborne pathogens under high treatment temperatures and exposure times grasso kelley et al 2021 kim et al 2017b kwon et al 2018 herein with an increase in treatment temperature or the exposure time the reduction in pathogen count increased for example increasing the hhaib temperature from 110 to 130 c increased the pathogen inactivation rate from 53 to 67 to 68 79 during high humidity hot air blanching hhib the high temperature steam passes through the sample at constant pressure that triggers protein denaturation which can disrupt the cell membrane intracellular electrolyte balance and cellular metabolism of the pathogens wang et al 2018 hhib inactivated killed pathogens by inhibiting their enzymatic activities and the rate of inactivation increases with an increase in treatment temperature and time xiao et al 2014 xiao et al 2012 hhaib has been reported to inactivate polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase enzymes thereby enhancing the inactivation of pathogens bai et al 2014 wang et al 2017 therefore based on the results it is reasonable to speculate that with a further increase in treatment temperature and duration the inactivation performance of these technologies would become satisfactory however treatment of struvite at temperatures 55 c leads to the deterioration of struvite fertilizer quality due to the loss of n as ammonia bhuiyan et al 2008 additionally an increase in temperature and exposure time would make these inactivation technologies uneconomical soils are known to harbor a variety of foodborne pathogens and generally contained around 10⁴ 10⁹ cfu gˉ¹ 10⁶ cfu gˉ¹ 10⁴ 10⁸ cfu gˉ¹ 10³ 10⁷ cfu gˉ¹ streptococcus faecalis e coli clostridium perfringens and s typhi respectively jechalke et al 2019 makino et al 2019 marteinsson et al 2015 although the inactivation methods utilized here could not completely inactivate all pathogens in the struvite the number of pathogens in the struvite was very low when compared to the number of pathogens that normally existed in the soils therefore the struvite obtained following inactivation treatment is biologically safe and may be utilized as fertilizer on agricultural land however to ensure product safety on a sustainable scale it is imperative to correctly understand the routes fate transport establishment and survival of pathogens in the soil after application of struvite struvite precipitation has been effectively used to recover nutrients from agricultural wastewaters at the laboratory pilot and commercial scale desmidt et al 2015 muhmood et al 2019a the potential of struvite formation for recovering nutrients from poultry slurry has been assessed and n and p recovery rates of 85 94 and 95 respectively have been reported muhmood et al 2019b muhmood et al 2018 yeti̇lmezsoy et al 2013 yilmazel and demirer 2013 from the perspective of environmental sustainability life cycle assessments have shown that struvite based fertilizer has a lower environmental impact than phosphate rock shaddel et al 2020 temizel sekeryan et al 2021 moreover the lack of heavy metals and biological hazards in struvite makes it even more favorable from a toxicity viewpoint than phosphate rock de boer et al 2018 regarding the economic viability of struvite precipitation the concept of using low cost magnesium sources and recycling recovered products can make struvite precipitation feasible both technically and economically muhmood et al 2019a shaddel et al 2020 so struvite precipitation is an environmentally friendly and economically viable technology that can facilitate nutrient cycling from agricultural wastewater and close the nutrient loop likewise more studies are required to evaluate inactivation technologies for foodborne pathogens in struvite to make it a biologically safe fertilizer for crop production similarly an economic assessment should be integrated 4 4 potential influence of inactivation technologies on struvite struvite treatment with different inactivation technologies may cause changes in the struvite for example the crystalline structure of struvite changes to amorphous after hot air treatment kurtulus and tas 2011 therefore struvite precipitates before and after the different treatments were evaluated using various characterization techniques for potential changes the struvite xrd diffractograms obtained at different ph values matched well with the struvite standard for peak intensities which suggested that no change in the crystalline structure occurred by precipitating struvite at varying ph conditions figure s9 similarly no change in the crystalline structure of struvite was observed after struvite treatment using different techniques ftir was performed to observe changes in the functional groups of the struvite precipitated at varying ph and after different inactivation technologies figures s10 and s11 a detailed description of the ftir analysis is provided in the supporting information the struvite ftir spectra obtained after different treatment technologies showed minor variations in functional groups to amplify these changes a semi quantitative method was conducted to analyze the ftir spectra figs 6 and s12 for this purpose the ftir spectra were divided into five regions 400 600 cmˉ¹ 700 800 cmˉ¹ 1000 1200 cmˉ¹ 1400 1700 cmˉ¹ and 2800 3000 cmˉ¹ which are attributed to a po₄³ˉ ion metal oxygen bonding po₄³ˉ ion nh bending and nh₄ ion respectively the peak area decreased with an increase in the precipitation ph figure s12 the area of the peaks at the previously mentioned wavenumbers was around approximately 9 34 88 4 cm² for the struvite precipitated at ph 9 0 with an increase in precipitation ph to 11 the peak area declined to 3 0 58 3 cm² the decrease in peak area with an increase in precipitation ph is attributed to proton dissociation or deprotonation of the functional groups omoike et al 2004 parikh et al 2008 moreover the peak area also decreased after struvite treatment and the lowest area of approximately 2 25 48 9 cm² for the peaks at the selected wavenumbers was observed in the struvite after hhaib at 130 c for 120 s compared to that of other treatment technologies fig 6 a decrease in the peak area is regarded as a variation in the functional group abundance chen et al 2015 therefore struvite treatment employing different technologies resulted in changes in functional group abundance without disturbing their arrangement which was responsible for maintaining the struvite crystalline structure ftir analysis confirmed that struvite contained nh₄ po₄³ nh and metal oxygen functional groups the decrease in the abundance of these functional groups may cause a reduction in the contents of these metals in the struvite as the fertilizer quality of the struvite relies upon its nutrient contents therefore decrease in the contents of nutrients may affect its quality however the exact mechanism of how a decrease in relative abundance influences fertilizer quality of struvite needs to be elucidated 5 conclusions this study quantified foodborne pathogens into culturable and viable but non culturable vbnc in struvite precipitated from anaerobically digested poultry slurry different inactivation technologies were tested for inactivation killing of pathogens in the struvite precipitated at varying ph values precipitating struvite at high ph resulted in a greater reduction in the culturable foodborne pathogen count than precipitation at lower ph more importantly high humidity hot air impingement blanching treatment was more efficient in killing foodborne pathogens among the tested treatments the same treatment however also induced more pathogens to enter a vbnc state furthermore struvite treatment with inactivation technologies reduced its functional group abundance although the crystalline structure remained unaffected based on these results further exploration of the biological risks associated with struvite recovered from strength wastewaters is necessary moreover proper storage of struvite following pathogen inactivation is required to avoid the resuscitation potential of
