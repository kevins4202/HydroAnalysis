18035,this paper presents a pilot scale study of an algal based sewage treatment and resource recovery starr system capable of treating municipal sewage and recovering its nitrogen and phosphorous content as fertilizer core components of the starr system include i mixotrophic cultivation of algal biomass in settled sewage ii hydrothermal liquefaction htl of the resulting algal biomass and iii processing of the products of htl to recover energy in the form of biocrude and nutrients in the form of struvite performance of a pilot scale starr system in recovering nitrogen n and phosphorus p from settled sewage as struvite is documented and compared with that of existing and emerging technologies nutrient removal per unit energy input in the starr system is estimated as 257 1 g n kwh and 36 6 g p kwh while that in eight full scale sewage treatment plants stps averaged 74 3 g n kwh and 135 1 g p kwh energy required to treat primary effluent in the starr system 531 5 kwh mg is estimated to be lower than the average in the 8 stps 1 037 9 503 3 kwh mg while existing technologies had been originally designed for removal of nutrients rather than any recovery a review of the literature revealed 12 emerging technologies for nutrient recovery nutrient recovery performance of the starr system 5 9 n and 71 6 p is shown to be superior to that of those 12 emerging technologies recoveries recorded in the starr system translate to a yield of 2 4 kg struvite per 100 m3 of primary effluent results of this study imply that the starr system deserves due consideration as a greener and sustainable pathway for nutrient removal and recovery from sewage graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrogen removal phosphorus removal nitrogen recovery phosphorus recovery energy demand algal systems 1 introduction traditionally sewage treatment plants stp have been designed and operated with the singular goal of meeting the discharge standards for the primary pollutants in sewage i e suspended solids organic carbon ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n phosphate phosphorus po4 p and pathogens to meet the respective discharge standards for these pollutants stps have relied on a sequence of processes each with its own dedicated reactor and detention time where the said pollutants are separated stabilized or converted to benign end products although such processes have served well in protecting public health and the ecosystem they are now being viewed as resource inefficient and unsustainable due to their energy demand and ecological footprint mccarty et al 2011 while concerns about climate change global warming and resource depletion are contemporary issues they were not given due recognition during the development of stps for instance water and wastewater utilities across the us account for 3 4 of the nation s electrical energy load in rendering this service u s epa 2014 indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with the fossil fuel based energy consumption at stps have been reported to be 54 3 tg of co2 additionally direct greenhouse gas emissions associated with stps are estimated at 14 8 tg co2 equivalent of methane and 5 0 tg co2 equivalent of nitrous oxide us epa 2018 with rapidly growing interest in greener infrastructures and sustainable cities there is a paradigm shift where instead of viewing sewage as a human health concern and environmental burden it is now being regarded as a reliable and renewable resource from which water energy and valuable commodities could be recovered puchongkawarin et al 2015 converting stps as resource recovery centers could be a promising pathway for sustainable sewage treatment and resource conservation guest et al 2009 treated sewage for example is now widely re used affording ecological benefits reducing potable water demand and augmenting of freshwater supplies mo and zhang 2013 processes for recuperation and production of energy at stps are well established in this vein recovery of nitrogen n and phosphorus p from sewage can render stps greener and sustainable van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 recovery of p is of particular importance because i it is vital for plants animals and humans ii global needs of p are provided by mining limited natural sources and iii there are no known substitutes for p de bashan and bashan 2004 recovering p for reuse can minimize the resources currently used for its removal and reduce waste sludge volume alleviating the regulatory burden relating to its disposal de bashan and bashan 2004 also of concern is the exponential rise of the price of the global supply of p which has increased 10 fold from 1950 to 2000 by 200 in 2007 alone and by 700 800 between 2007 and 2008 in less than 14 months cieślik and konieczka 2017 the goal of this study is to document the energy performance of a pilot scale algal based sewage treatment and resource recovery starr system removing and recovering n and p from settled sewage an overview of the fate of n and p in traditional stps is presented first followed by a summary of emerging approaches for removal and or recovery of n and p from sewage removal rates and recoveries of n and p recorded in this pilot scale starr system are then presented and compared with the results from 12 emerging processes in terms of energy input 1 1 fate of n and p in traditional sewage treatment plants until the early 1970s stps had focused only on the reduction of 1 colloidal suspended and floating material 2 biodegradable organics and 3 pathogenic organisms since the promulgation of the clean water act in 1972 new discharge standards were set for nutrients metcalf and eddy 2003 the activated sludge process that had been deployed for secondary treatment at most stps is not capable of meeting the discharge standards for nutrients due to the mismatch of c n p ratios between the activated sludge biomass and settled sewage yeoman et al 1988b as such stps are being required to add energy intensive tertiary processes to comply with the new discharge standards for nutrients for instance of the 656 major stps in the us capacity 10 mgd that handle 70 of the nation s sewage volume 353 had to be retrofitted with tertiary processes to remove nutrients incurring significant energy costs us epa 2013 currently biological processes are the favored ones for the removal of nitrogenous materials from sewage the most common one being the two step nitrification denitrification n d process itokawa et al 2001 the nitrification step in the n d process requires aeration 4 33 g o2 g δnh4 n and the denitrification step requires supplemental organic carbon 2 47 g ch3oh g no3 n eventually the n content in the sewage is destructively dissipated as gaseous n without any recovery phosphate in sewage is removed by taking advantage of its low solubility it is typically partitioned into a solid phase de bashan and bashan 2004 either by chemical precipitation as a salt of aluminum iron or magnesium or via bioaccumulation chemical precipitation is the most commonly adopted process de bashan and bashan 2004 wang et al 2006 yeoman et al 1988a but requires addition of precipitation agents e g 0 87g al g p 5 24 g fecl2 g p and 1 35 g mg g p increasing the cost of sewage treatment and the volume of sludge to be managed since the recovery of p from chemically precipitated sludge is not feasible de bashan and bashan 2004 the p rich sludge is currently disposed of in landfills in the biological approach p accumulated in the biomass offers an opportunity for its recovery for use as fertilizer table a 1 in appendix a summarizes technologies adopted by eight full scale stps located across north america that include nutrient removal data from the eight stps discussed in this report were extracted from epa 832 r 08 006 states et al 2008 1 2 emerging approaches for removal recovery of n and p several new approaches have evolved in recent years for nutrient control most of them continuing to focus on removal rather than on recovery while achieving the set standards for discharge is still the priority these approaches aim to reduce the resource and energy intensity of the overall sewage treatment process european researchers for example have developed approaches to minimize the formation of nitrate no3 in the nitrification step to reduce the oxygen demand of the classical n d process scherson et al 2013 the sharon process hellinga et al 1998 for instance is built on this concept of short circuiting the nitrification and denitrification pathways through nitrite no2 to reduce the need for oxygen and supplemental organic carbon the denitrification step has also been improved with the discovery of anammox bacteria van de graaf et al 1995 that can reduce no2 by oxidizing ammonia instead of organic carbon examples of processes that have adopted these concepts include the combined sharon anammox process siegrist et al 2008 canon process sliekers et al 2002 and oland process kuai and verstraete 1998 yet all these processes are designed to serve as follow up processes to the energy intensive activated sludge process and continue to focus only on the destructive removal of nitrogenous components of sewage dissipating them as gaseous nitrogen without any recovery recently scherson et al 2013 have introduced the cando process which enables the recovery of energy from nitrogenous components of anaerobic digester supernatant this approach comprises of i partial oxidation of nh4 n to no2 ii partial reduction of no2 to n2o and iii reduction of n2o to n2 gas theoretically the cando process can reduce the oxygen requirement by 20 while recovering 60 more energy from the feed scherson et al 2013 a novel process entailing accelerated hydrothermal deamination and air stripping has been investigated recently for the removal and recovery of n from anaerobic digester sludge he et al 2015 removal and recovery of 51 93 kg n ton of dry sludge and 37 27 kg n ton of dry sludge respectively are claimed to be possible in this approach he et al 2015 as pointed out earlier the traditional chemical precipitation approaches using al fe or mg are not amenable to recovery of p however precipitation of p as struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate enables removal and recovery of p from sewage for beneficial use as fertilizer de bashan and bashan 2004 this approach offers the dual benefit of recovering both n and p from sewage yielding a commercially valuable product de bashan and bashan 2004 le corre et al 2009 patented processes airprex and ostara pearl are already implemented in stps to recover nutrients as struvite feasibility of using seawater as a source of magnesium has been suggested to avoid using manufactured magnesium salts e g magnesium chloride as precipitating agents nur et al 2018 1 3 algal based sewage treatment and resource recovery our laboratory studies henkanatte gedera et al 2015 selvaratnam et al 2014a b had demonstrated for the first time the ability of a mixotrophic algal strain galdieria sulphuraria in simultaneous removal of dissolved organics and nutrients from primary effluent based on the above studies a pilot scale version of the starr system has been developed and deployed at the local sewage treatment plant in contrast to the multiple steps involving dedicated units for the removal of each pollutant as in conventional stps the starr system has been shown to achieve discharge standards in a single step details of this pilot scale system and its performance in reducing dissolved organic carbon measured as biochemical oxygen demand bod n p and pathogenic bacteria to levels exceeding secondary discharge standards have been presented delanka pedige et al 2019 munasinghe arachchige et al 2019 nirmalakhandan et al 2019 tchinda et al 2019 downstream processes to recover energy cheng et al 2019 2018 li et al 2019 and nutrients karbakhshravari 2017 from the algal biomass cultivated in the starr system have also been demonstrated in the current study nutrient removal performance of the starr system is compared against that of current technologies states et al 2008 in terms of nutrient removal per unit energy input g kwh additionally performance of the emerging technologies stand alone side stream dedicated for recovery of n and p was assessed as follows first a reference stp consisting of the conventional activated sludge based secondary process was formulated each of the emerging technologies was then added to the reference stp as a tertiary process the fate of nutrients in each combination and the corresponding energy expenditure per unit mass of nutrient recovered were estimated for comparison with the respective values measured in the pilot scale starr system 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage treatment and resource recovery starr system a schematic of the starr system is shown in fig 1 detailed descriptions of materials and methods used for algal cultivation hydrothermal liquefaction htl of the biomass and nutrient recovery from the products of htl have been reported previously and are included in the supplementary information section 2 2 calculation of energy input for nutrient removal the energy input for the removal of n and p in eight full scale stps was obtained from epa 832 r 08 006 states et al 2008 since the starr system removed all three pollutants n p and bod simultaneously the energy input per unit volume kwh m3 was split between that for removal of p e p and that for n e n as follows 1 e n 1 3 p w t n 2 e p 1 3 p w t n 1 2 p w t b o d t n p w t p t b o d where ti is the time hr to reach the discharge limit of pollutant i i n p or bod and pw is the power input to mix unit volume of algal broth kw m3 unlike the traditional systems the starr is capable of reducing all three pollutants n bod and p to the discharge standards in a single step therefore the energy input to the starr system has to be split among the three pollutants for comparison with the traditional systems where each pollutant is removed in a separate dedicated reactor the approach followed by us to estimate this energy split is based on our field results abeysiriwardana arachchige and nirmalakhandan 2019 where of the three pollutants n is reduced to the discharge standard first followed by bod and finally p thus tn tbod tp where ti is the time taken to reach the discharge standard for pollutant i as such the energy input is assumed to be equally split between the three pollutants during 0 t tn thereafter the energy input is assumed to be split equally between the two remaining pollutants bod and p during tn t tbod similarly the energy input during tbod t tp is allocated to the removal of p removal of pollutants in the starr system has been reported to follow first order kinetics in our previous study abeysiriwardana arachchige and nirmalakhandan 2019 hence the time t i for removing each pollutant to its discharge standard was calculated from 3 t i 1 k i ln s i s t d s i 0 where k i is the first order rate constant for i 1 hr i n p or bod obtained from our previous report abeysiriwardana arachchige and nirmalakhandan 2019 s i 0 is the initial concentration g m3 of i and s i std is the discharge standard g m3 for i thus the mass of contaminant removed per unit energy consumption g kwh was calculated as 4 m i s i 0 s i s t d e i 2 3 mass balance analysis two mass flow diagrams were developed for a flow of 1 million gallons mg of primary settled wastewater to assess the fate of n and p one for the starr system and one for the reference stp the starr system considered in this analysis comprised of algal wastewater treatment hydrothermal liquefaction and struvite precipitation operational data of the pilot scale system and from our previous reports cheng et al 2019 2018 li et al 2019 nirmalakhandan et al 2019 tchinda et al 2019 were used to complete the mass balance for the starr system the reference stp was designed to produce treated wastewater with a quality equivalent to the average discharge quality achieved by the pilot scale starr system it comprised of anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process for biological n and p removal secondary settling sludge thickening anaerobic digestion and sludge dewatering by a belt press mass flows in this case were calculated based either on literature data egle et al 2016 evangelisti et al 2014 speece 1983 or by following metcalf and eddy 2003 and epa 2010 chemical formula of sludge was assumed as c5h7no2 metcalf and eddy 2003 evaporation losses during wastewater treatment were assumed negligible the calculations and the assumptions made in developing the mass balance are detailed in the supplementary information si section 2 4 energy analysis data required for the energy analysis of the two systems were collected from literature bond et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 dalrymple et al 2013 dammel and schroeder 1991 drewnowski et al 2019 evangelisti et al 2014 füreder et al 2017 hadała et al 2017 karbakhshravari 2017 li et al 2019 metcalf and eddy 2003 mikron instrument company 2014 missouri department of natural resources 2019 szepessy and thorwid 2018 technology 2019 the raceway type bioreactors in the pilot scale starr system were fitted with off the shelf paddlewheel assemblies that are not optimized for the reactor volume as such energy input in the starr system was estimated assuming the power required to keep algal biomass in suspension 3 9 w m3 for full scale high rate algal ponds hrap eckenfelder 1989 ambient temperature for energy calculations was assumed as 25 c estimates of energy input for heating considered the initial energy required to raise the temperature of all elements of the process streams as well as the energy losses due to conduction heat loss from radiation was considered in the hydrothermal liquefaction process where the operating temperature is 300 c convectional heat losses were assumed negligible the mixing energy required by each process of the reference stp was estimated using the data reported by füreder et al 2017 aeration process was assumed to provide sufficient mixing in the aerobic tank wastewater flow through the plant was assumed to be under gravity with a negligible additional energy requirement for pumping except for internal recirculation ir and return activated sludge flow detailed calculations and the assumptions of the energy analysis are documented in the supplementary information section 3 results 3 1 energy input for nutrient removal the eight stps considered in this study states et al 2008 have utilized multi step processes to meet the standards for bod n and p whereas the starr system met all the standards in a single step of the eight stps p removals in stp 2 5 7 and 8 were by chemical precipitation using metal salt n removals in stp 1 2 and 7 were by n d using respectively 16 mg 5 mg and 48 mg of methanol per liter of sewage treated hydraulic detention time in the eight stps to reach the discharge requirements averaged 0 81days the starr system required 2 3 days to meet all the discharge standards fig 2 compares the performance of the eight full scale stps against the starr system in terms of the mass of n and p removed per unit energy input g kwh the highest p removal per unit energy input was in stp 7 which used chemical precipitation in these stps aeration energy for nitrification dominated 60 the total energy requirement for n removal details of the values plotted in fig 2 are tabulated in appendix a removals of n 12 15 g n kwh and p 1 73 g p kwh in the pilot scale starr system shown as starr a in fig 2 are based on the energy measurements in the pilot scale system instead based on typical energy input of full scale raceway ponds 3 9 w m3 eckenfelder 1989 the removals in the starr system are projected as 257 1 g n kwh and 36 6 g p kwh shown as starr b in fig 2 in comparison the average removals in the eight stps were 74 3 42 5 g n kwh and 135 13 115 34 g p kwh considering the 4 stps that used biological processes the removal was 81 1 75 2 g p kwh the starr system is compared with the 8 stps on the basis of energy consumed to treat 1 mg of primary effluent considering typical input concentrations of 23 37 mg nh3 n l and 4 6 mg po4 p l and the local discharge standards of 10 mg nh3 n l and 1 mg po4 p l again assuming the energy rating of full scale hraps 3 9 w m3 eckenfelder 1989 the energy consumption in the starr system is estimated as 531 5 kwh mg while the average for the eight stps is estimated as 1 037 9 503 3 kwh mg based on the above albeit limited results energy footprint of the starr system for nutrient removal can be seen to be smaller than that of the stps despite its longer hydraulic retention time 3 2 fate of nitrogen and phosphorus fig 3 a and 3b represent mass flows considering a flow of 1 mg of primary effluent for the reference stp and the starr system respectively as can be noted from fig 3a 77 1 of n in the wastewater is dissipated in the reference stp either through mineralization or via the final effluent a comparable value of 79 8 can be calculated from the data reported in a case study of the amsterdam west treatment plant netherlands van der hoek et al 2018 a large fraction 74 5 of the wasted n is mineralized into gaseous nitrogenous products including n2o typical rate of generation of n2o in the n d process has been reported as 0 006 0 253 kg n2o kg n denitrified foley et al 2010 this is a serious concern because global warming potential of n2o is almost 300 times that of carbon dioxide epa 2016 additionally considering that 37 45 mj kg n is expended to fix atmospheric n through the haber bosch process in the fertilizer manufacturing process van der hoek et al 2018 the loss of n in the reference stp is equivalent to about 700 850 kwh d ignoring any loss of ammonia by volatilization with the selected treatment approach a maximum of 7 4 of n and 13 2 of p in the primary effluent could be recovered in the reference stp if its anaerobic digester supernatant is processed further higher n and p 15 4 and 74 9 respectively could be recovered by processing the digested sludge since the mixotrophic cultivation step in the starr system operates under acidic conditions ph 4 loss of n by volatilization and removal of p by chemical precipitation and adsorption are minimal nirmalakhandan et al 2019 hence the fates of n and p in the starr system were assessed considering algal uptake as the only mechanism of nutrient removal this assumption is validated by the fact that the n and p contents in the algal biomass estimated from biomass growth curves and mass balance calculations 7 21 n and 1 44 p are comparable to the compositions determined through elemental analysis 6 80 n and 1 35 p cheng et al 2019 henkanatte gedara 2018 detailed calculations are shown in si section this mass balance validates the notion that nutrients removed in the starr system are concentrated in nutrient rich algal biomass that can serve as a valuable feedstock for fertilizer recovery the nutrient flow in fig 3b was developed considering htl process conditions of 350 c 20 solid content and holding time of 60 min section 3 3 the htl process partitioned 57 2 19 3 11 2 and 12 3 of n in processed algae respectively to the aqueous phase ap biocrude off gas and biochar this result is consistent with the study by cheng et al 2019 where the n content of ap ranged 53 72 on the other hand a majority of p in processed biomass partitioned to the biochar fraction 97 3 our related experimental studies karbakhshravari 2017 showed similar partitioning of p to biochar 95 based on our previous studies karbakhshravari 2017 it is assumed here that 90 of the p associated with the biochar can be readily extracted subsequently by mixing the aqueous phase and biochar extract with magnesium chloride mgcl2 6h2o at a molar ratio of mg p 1 5 1 more than 90 of p could be recovered as struvite karbakhshravari 2017 on a conservative basis recovery of p as struvite was taken in the current study as 90 the quality of the recovered struvite is detailed in the supplementary information section based on these considerations it is estimated that 5 9 of n and 71 6 of p in primary effluent could be recovered as struvite translating to a yield of 2 4 kg struvite 100 m3 of primary effluent 3 3 energy demand for recovery of n and p the starr system incorporates htl of the algal biomass to recover its energy and nutrient contents cheng et al 2019 and li et al 2019 have investigated htl of sewage grown biomass from the starr system under three different temperatures solid contents and holding times fig 4 summarizes the net energy yields of the htl process under these conditions for 1 mg of primary effluent a statistical t test to identify a correlation between the net energy in the htl process and the amount of struvite recovered concluded that there is no correlation between them at a significance level of 0 05 as such htl condition that used the lowest net energy can be considered the most viable option hence htl operating conditions were fixed in the current study at a temperature of 350 c solid content of 20 and holding time of 60 min as suggested by cheng et al 2018 engineering efforts such as including pretreating feedstock to improve biocrude yield increasing algal solid loading and modifying htl process conditions and reactor configuration are needed to improve the performance of the htl process a techno economic analysis must also be conducted to investigate if a low grade fuel to obtain heat for htl could offset the overall process costs since the energy from htl is recovered as a product with a high commercial value biocrude fig 5 a presents the energy demands and recoveries for the reference stp for a flow of 1 mg of primary effluent here the energy demand for aeration was estimated assuming a fine bubble diffuser drewnowski et al 2019 these energy calculations indicated that 70 7 of the total energy input is for aeration this is within the range of 50 90 reported in a review drewnowski et al 2019 the net energy consumption of the reference stp was estimated as 0 93 kwh m3 of primary effluent which is comparable to the reported range of 0 3 1 89 kwh m3 for activated sludge plants without sludge incineration mizuta and shimada 2010 fig 5b shows the energy flows across the starr system for a flow of 1 mg of primary effluent in this case the energy input for the sewage treatment step is solely for mixing and maintaining the algae in suspension as can be noted energy consumed in the sewage treatment step in the starr system is 0 49 kwh m3 while that in the reference stp is 0 93 kwh m3 downstream processes to recover energy and nutrients in the starr system consume additional energy 0 13 kwh m3 for separation of algae by centrifugation 0 20 kwh m3 for heating in the htl process and 0 11 kwh m3 for heating in the p extraction process to reduce the energy demand of the starr system feasibility of alternate dewatering processes needs to be investigated with the current struvite recovery approach in the starr system an additional energy input 4 58 kwh kg struvite recovered is required to extract p from the biochar to minimize this energy demand extraction efficiency of p needs to be investigated for more energy favorable conditions such as biochar contents 5 wt 3 4 recovery of n and p fig 6 compares the starr system against the 12 emerging nutrient recovery technologies in terms of percentage nutrient recovery from primary effluent and the nutrient recovery per unit energy input here the twelve emerging nutrient recovery technologies are evaluated one at a time as an add on to the reference stp details of the technologies considered in this evaluation are tabulated in table b 1 in appendix b of these technologies eleven were selected based on the availability of data and technology readiness as suggested in the study by egle et al 2016 considering the availability of data for nutrient recovery from stps a novel integrated system of accelerated hydrothermal deamination and air stripping htd as was also selected as an n recovery technology he et al 2015 as can be noted from this comparison in fig 6 the starr system recovered the highest amount of p 71 6 from primary effluent as struvite with the exception of htd as the starr system recovered the highest n 5 9 as well nevertheless it should be noted that 46 7 of n in primary effluent is still unrecovered leaving the starr system in the supernatant from the struvite precipitation step it is suggested that follow up processes such as air stripping he et al 2015 or gas permeable hydrophobic membranes nagy et al 2019 be investigated to maximize recovery of n in contrast the maximum recovery of n from the reference stp using any technology is limited to 22 9 since most of the n is dissipated during treatment of the twelve technologies considered here the six that recovered nutrients from anaerobic digester supernatant ad supernatant recovered a higher percentage of nutrients from the feed compared to technologies that recovered nutrients from anaerobic digester sludge ad sludge however since the partitioning of p to ad supernatant was lower 15 technologies that recovered p from ad sludge recovered a significantly higher mass of p compared to the others at a significance level of 0 05 p 1 except for htd as all other technologies recovered n in the form of struvite consequently the n recovery technologies fed with ad sludge also recovered a significantly higher mass of n at a significance level of 0 05 p 1 the following approach was used to compare the energy demand for nutrient recovery via the starr system and the emerging technologies as indicated earlier energy input in the case of the starr system was estimated based on literature value 3 9 w m3 eckenfelder 1989 and nutrients recovered were quantified based on pilot scale data and mass balance in the case of the emerging technologies each technology was added on to the hypothetical reference stp one at a time and the corresponding energy input and the nutrients recovered were estimated the overall energy consumption of the plant was split in half and allocated to n and p recovery for those processes that recovered both results tabulated in appendix b based on the results of these estimations summarized in fig 6b the starr system is seen to be an energy efficient approach for nutrient recovery 2 93 g n kwh and 6 50 g p kwh compared to the emerging technologies 1 04 0 69 g n kwh and 1 96 1 22 g p kwh again technologies that recovered p and or n from ad sludge achieved significantly higher nutrient recovery per unit energy input than from ad supernatant at a significance level of 0 05 p 0 998 and p 1 respectively for p and n it is worth noting that the average energy required by the reference stp to treat wastewater and recover nutrients with each of the twelve technologies 0 95 kwh m3 of primary effluent was similar to that of the starr system 0 93 kwh m3 of primary effluent hence the lower energy expenditure per mass of nutrients recovered in the starr system can be attributed to the higher nutrient recovery compared to the reference stp with the 12 technologies 3 5 preliminary cost analysis a preliminary cost analysis was done based on the pilot scale data collected in this study to identify areas to improve system performance the following direct costs were included in this analysis sulfuric acid kootstra et al 2019 used to acidify the bioreactors calcium hydroxide kemcore 2020 used to neutralize the final effluent sodium hydroxide huang et al 2014 used for extracting biochar magnesium oxide huang et al 2014 to precipitate struvite electricity in new mexico eia 2019 for total energy input to the integrated system details included in si on this basis operating cost for wastewater treatment was estimated as 0 20 m3 and that for the downstream recovery processes as 0 13 m3 resulting in the overall cost of wastewater treatment and fertilizer recovery as 0 33 m3 value of biocrude estimated from its calorific value assuming 30 fuel to electricity conversion efficiency was 0 02 m3 and that of struvite munir et al 2017 was 0 01 m3 yielding total revenue of 0 03 m3 while this preliminary analysis may indicate that the starr system is not economically attractive a comprehensive life cycle analysis needs to be undertaken to quantify its environmental benefits such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions eutrophication and conservation of natural resources as pointed out earlier several processes in the starr system remain to be intensified and optimized for example the net energy input in the htl process can be reduced by about 50 by incorporating heat recovery cheng et al 2019 lowering the cost of the downstream processing to 0 09 m3 residual n in the supernatant of the struvite precipitation step may be recovered by a gas permeable membrane process for example to yield ammonium sulfate a high value fertilizer garcia gonzález and vanotti 2015 on going studies have shown n recoveries up to 95 translating to additional revenue errico et al 2018 estimated at 0 01 m3 details in si customized design of the paddlewheel assembly can reduce the cost of sewage treatment alternate processes for harvesting the algal biomass can further reduce the energy costs in downstream processing on the other hand value of struvite will continue to increase as the phosphate supplies dwindle and population grows results of this study indicate that the starr system holds promise as a sustainable alternative to the current and emerging sewage treatment and nutrient recovery technologies and warrants due consideration 4 conclusion an algal based sewage treatment and resource recovery system starr capable of energy efficient nutrient removal and recovery was demonstrated in this study results from a pilot scale version of the starr system confirmed that it is more energy efficient than eight full scale wastewater treatment plants in removing nutrients from sewage further comparison of the starr system with hypothetical activated sludge based systems integrated with 12 emerging nutrient recovery technologies indicated that it is capable of achieving higher recoveries of nutrients per unit energy input mass balance considerations showed that the starr system is capable of recovering 2 4 kg struvite from 100 m3 of settled sewage based on the energy efficient recovery of nutrients documented here the starr system can potentially be a greener alternative for

18035,this paper presents a pilot scale study of an algal based sewage treatment and resource recovery starr system capable of treating municipal sewage and recovering its nitrogen and phosphorous content as fertilizer core components of the starr system include i mixotrophic cultivation of algal biomass in settled sewage ii hydrothermal liquefaction htl of the resulting algal biomass and iii processing of the products of htl to recover energy in the form of biocrude and nutrients in the form of struvite performance of a pilot scale starr system in recovering nitrogen n and phosphorus p from settled sewage as struvite is documented and compared with that of existing and emerging technologies nutrient removal per unit energy input in the starr system is estimated as 257 1 g n kwh and 36 6 g p kwh while that in eight full scale sewage treatment plants stps averaged 74 3 g n kwh and 135 1 g p kwh energy required to treat primary effluent in the starr system 531 5 kwh mg is estimated to be lower than the average in the 8 stps 1 037 9 503 3 kwh mg while existing technologies had been originally designed for removal of nutrients rather than any recovery a review of the literature revealed 12 emerging technologies for nutrient recovery nutrient recovery performance of the starr system 5 9 n and 71 6 p is shown to be superior to that of those 12 emerging technologies recoveries recorded in the starr system translate to a yield of 2 4 kg struvite per 100 m3 of primary effluent results of this study imply that the starr system deserves due consideration as a greener and sustainable pathway for nutrient removal and recovery from sewage graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrogen removal phosphorus removal nitrogen recovery phosphorus recovery energy demand algal systems 1 introduction traditionally sewage treatment plants stp have been designed and operated with the singular goal of meeting the discharge standards for the primary pollutants in sewage i e suspended solids organic carbon ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n phosphate phosphorus po4 p and pathogens to meet the respective discharge standards for these pollutants stps have relied on a sequence of processes each with its own dedicated reactor and detention time where the said pollutants are separated stabilized or converted to benign end products although such processes have served well in protecting public health and the ecosystem they are now being viewed as resource inefficient and unsustainable due to their energy demand and ecological footprint mccarty et al 2011 while concerns about climate change global warming and resource depletion are contemporary issues they were not given due recognition during the development of stps for instance water and wastewater utilities across the us account for 3 4 of the nation s electrical energy load in rendering this service u s epa 2014 indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with the fossil fuel based energy consumption at stps have been reported to be 54 3 tg of co2 additionally direct greenhouse gas emissions associated with stps are estimated at 14 8 tg co2 equivalent of methane and 5 0 tg co2 equivalent of nitrous oxide us epa 2018 with rapidly growing interest in greener infrastructures and sustainable cities there is a paradigm shift where instead of viewing sewage as a human health concern and environmental burden it is now being regarded as a reliable and renewable resource from which water energy and valuable commodities could be recovered puchongkawarin et al 2015 converting stps as resource recovery centers could be a promising pathway for sustainable sewage treatment and resource conservation guest et al 2009 treated sewage for example is now widely re used affording ecological benefits reducing potable water demand and augmenting of freshwater supplies mo and zhang 2013 processes for recuperation and production of energy at stps are well established in this vein recovery of nitrogen n and phosphorus p from sewage can render stps greener and sustainable van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 recovery of p is of particular importance because i it is vital for plants animals and humans ii global needs of p are provided by mining limited natural sources and iii there are no known substitutes for p de bashan and bashan 2004 recovering p for reuse can minimize the resources currently used for its removal and reduce waste sludge volume alleviating the regulatory burden relating to its disposal de bashan and bashan 2004 also of concern is the exponential rise of the price of the global supply of p which has increased 10 fold from 1950 to 2000 by 200 in 2007 alone and by 700 800 between 2007 and 2008 in less than 14 months cieślik and konieczka 2017 the goal of this study is to document the energy performance of a pilot scale algal based sewage treatment and resource recovery starr system removing and recovering n and p from settled sewage an overview of the fate of n and p in traditional stps is presented first followed by a summary of emerging approaches for removal and or recovery of n and p from sewage removal rates and recoveries of n and p recorded in this pilot scale starr system are then presented and compared with the results from 12 emerging processes in terms of energy input 1 1 fate of n and p in traditional sewage treatment plants until the early 1970s stps had focused only on the reduction of 1 colloidal suspended and floating material 2 biodegradable organics and 3 pathogenic organisms since the promulgation of the clean water act in 1972 new discharge standards were set for nutrients metcalf and eddy 2003 the activated sludge process that had been deployed for secondary treatment at most stps is not capable of meeting the discharge standards for nutrients due to the mismatch of c n p ratios between the activated sludge biomass and settled sewage yeoman et al 1988b as such stps are being required to add energy intensive tertiary processes to comply with the new discharge standards for nutrients for instance of the 656 major stps in the us capacity 10 mgd that handle 70 of the nation s sewage volume 353 had to be retrofitted with tertiary processes to remove nutrients incurring significant energy costs us epa 2013 currently biological processes are the favored ones for the removal of nitrogenous materials from sewage the most common one being the two step nitrification denitrification n d process itokawa et al 2001 the nitrification step in the n d process requires aeration 4 33 g o2 g δnh4 n and the denitrification step requires supplemental organic carbon 2 47 g ch3oh g no3 n eventually the n content in the sewage is destructively dissipated as gaseous n without any recovery phosphate in sewage is removed by taking advantage of its low solubility it is typically partitioned into a solid phase de bashan and bashan 2004 either by chemical precipitation as a salt of aluminum iron or magnesium or via bioaccumulation chemical precipitation is the most commonly adopted process de bashan and bashan 2004 wang et al 2006 yeoman et al 1988a but requires addition of precipitation agents e g 0 87g al g p 5 24 g fecl2 g p and 1 35 g mg g p increasing the cost of sewage treatment and the volume of sludge to be managed since the recovery of p from chemically precipitated sludge is not feasible de bashan and bashan 2004 the p rich sludge is currently disposed of in landfills in the biological approach p accumulated in the biomass offers an opportunity for its recovery for use as fertilizer table a 1 in appendix a summarizes technologies adopted by eight full scale stps located across north america that include nutrient removal data from the eight stps discussed in this report were extracted from epa 832 r 08 006 states et al 2008 1 2 emerging approaches for removal recovery of n and p several new approaches have evolved in recent years for nutrient control most of them continuing to focus on removal rather than on recovery while achieving the set standards for discharge is still the priority these approaches aim to reduce the resource and energy intensity of the overall sewage treatment process european researchers for example have developed approaches to minimize the formation of nitrate no3 in the nitrification step to reduce the oxygen demand of the classical n d process scherson et al 2013 the sharon process hellinga et al 1998 for instance is built on this concept of short circuiting the nitrification and denitrification pathways through nitrite no2 to reduce the need for oxygen and supplemental organic carbon the denitrification step has also been improved with the discovery of anammox bacteria van de graaf et al 1995 that can reduce no2 by oxidizing ammonia instead of organic carbon examples of processes that have adopted these concepts include the combined sharon anammox process siegrist et al 2008 canon process sliekers et al 2002 and oland process kuai and verstraete 1998 yet all these processes are designed to serve as follow up processes to the energy intensive activated sludge process and continue to focus only on the destructive removal of nitrogenous components of sewage dissipating them as gaseous nitrogen without any recovery recently scherson et al 2013 have introduced the cando process which enables the recovery of energy from nitrogenous components of anaerobic digester supernatant this approach comprises of i partial oxidation of nh4 n to no2 ii partial reduction of no2 to n2o and iii reduction of n2o to n2 gas theoretically the cando process can reduce the oxygen requirement by 20 while recovering 60 more energy from the feed scherson et al 2013 a novel process entailing accelerated hydrothermal deamination and air stripping has been investigated recently for the removal and recovery of n from anaerobic digester sludge he et al 2015 removal and recovery of 51 93 kg n ton of dry sludge and 37 27 kg n ton of dry sludge respectively are claimed to be possible in this approach he et al 2015 as pointed out earlier the traditional chemical precipitation approaches using al fe or mg are not amenable to recovery of p however precipitation of p as struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate enables removal and recovery of p from sewage for beneficial use as fertilizer de bashan and bashan 2004 this approach offers the dual benefit of recovering both n and p from sewage yielding a commercially valuable product de bashan and bashan 2004 le corre et al 2009 patented processes airprex and ostara pearl are already implemented in stps to recover nutrients as struvite feasibility of using seawater as a source of magnesium has been suggested to avoid using manufactured magnesium salts e g magnesium chloride as precipitating agents nur et al 2018 1 3 algal based sewage treatment and resource recovery our laboratory studies henkanatte gedera et al 2015 selvaratnam et al 2014a b had demonstrated for the first time the ability of a mixotrophic algal strain galdieria sulphuraria in simultaneous removal of dissolved organics and nutrients from primary effluent based on the above studies a pilot scale version of the starr system has been developed and deployed at the local sewage treatment plant in contrast to the multiple steps involving dedicated units for the removal of each pollutant as in conventional stps the starr system has been shown to achieve discharge standards in a single step details of this pilot scale system and its performance in reducing dissolved organic carbon measured as biochemical oxygen demand bod n p and pathogenic bacteria to levels exceeding secondary discharge standards have been presented delanka pedige et al 2019 munasinghe arachchige et al 2019 nirmalakhandan et al 2019 tchinda et al 2019 downstream processes to recover energy cheng et al 2019 2018 li et al 2019 and nutrients karbakhshravari 2017 from the algal biomass cultivated in the starr system have also been demonstrated in the current study nutrient removal performance of the starr system is compared against that of current technologies states et al 2008 in terms of nutrient removal per unit energy input g kwh additionally performance of the emerging technologies stand alone side stream dedicated for recovery of n and p was assessed as follows first a reference stp consisting of the conventional activated sludge based secondary process was formulated each of the emerging technologies was then added to the reference stp as a tertiary process the fate of nutrients in each combination and the corresponding energy expenditure per unit mass of nutrient recovered were estimated for comparison with the respective values measured in the pilot scale starr system 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage treatment and resource recovery starr system a schematic of the starr system is shown in fig 1 detailed descriptions of materials and methods used for algal cultivation hydrothermal liquefaction htl of the biomass and nutrient recovery from the products of htl have been reported previously and are included in the supplementary information section 2 2 calculation of energy input for nutrient removal the energy input for the removal of n and p in eight full scale stps was obtained from epa 832 r 08 006 states et al 2008 since the starr system removed all three pollutants n p and bod simultaneously the energy input per unit volume kwh m3 was split between that for removal of p e p and that for n e n as follows 1 e n 1 3 p w t n 2 e p 1 3 p w t n 1 2 p w t b o d t n p w t p t b o d where ti is the time hr to reach the discharge limit of pollutant i i n p or bod and pw is the power input to mix unit volume of algal broth kw m3 unlike the traditional systems the starr is capable of reducing all three pollutants n bod and p to the discharge standards in a single step therefore the energy input to the starr system has to be split among the three pollutants for comparison with the traditional systems where each pollutant is removed in a separate dedicated reactor the approach followed by us to estimate this energy split is based on our field results abeysiriwardana arachchige and nirmalakhandan 2019 where of the three pollutants n is reduced to the discharge standard first followed by bod and finally p thus tn tbod tp where ti is the time taken to reach the discharge standard for pollutant i as such the energy input is assumed to be equally split between the three pollutants during 0 t tn thereafter the energy input is assumed to be split equally between the two remaining pollutants bod and p during tn t tbod similarly the energy input during tbod t tp is allocated to the removal of p removal of pollutants in the starr system has been reported to follow first order kinetics in our previous study abeysiriwardana arachchige and nirmalakhandan 2019 hence the time t i for removing each pollutant to its discharge standard was calculated from 3 t i 1 k i ln s i s t d s i 0 where k i is the first order rate constant for i 1 hr i n p or bod obtained from our previous report abeysiriwardana arachchige and nirmalakhandan 2019 s i 0 is the initial concentration g m3 of i and s i std is the discharge standard g m3 for i thus the mass of contaminant removed per unit energy consumption g kwh was calculated as 4 m i s i 0 s i s t d e i 2 3 mass balance analysis two mass flow diagrams were developed for a flow of 1 million gallons mg of primary settled wastewater to assess the fate of n and p one for the starr system and one for the reference stp the starr system considered in this analysis comprised of algal wastewater treatment hydrothermal liquefaction and struvite precipitation operational data of the pilot scale system and from our previous reports cheng et al 2019 2018 li et al 2019 nirmalakhandan et al 2019 tchinda et al 2019 were used to complete the mass balance for the starr system the reference stp was designed to produce treated wastewater with a quality equivalent to the average discharge quality achieved by the pilot scale starr system it comprised of anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process for biological n and p removal secondary settling sludge thickening anaerobic digestion and sludge dewatering by a belt press mass flows in this case were calculated based either on literature data egle et al 2016 evangelisti et al 2014 speece 1983 or by following metcalf and eddy 2003 and epa 2010 chemical formula of sludge was assumed as c5h7no2 metcalf and eddy 2003 evaporation losses during wastewater treatment were assumed negligible the calculations and the assumptions made in developing the mass balance are detailed in the supplementary information si section 2 4 energy analysis data required for the energy analysis of the two systems were collected from literature bond et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 dalrymple et al 2013 dammel and schroeder 1991 drewnowski et al 2019 evangelisti et al 2014 füreder et al 2017 hadała et al 2017 karbakhshravari 2017 li et al 2019 metcalf and eddy 2003 mikron instrument company 2014 missouri department of natural resources 2019 szepessy and thorwid 2018 technology 2019 the raceway type bioreactors in the pilot scale starr system were fitted with off the shelf paddlewheel assemblies that are not optimized for the reactor volume as such energy input in the starr system was estimated assuming the power required to keep algal biomass in suspension 3 9 w m3 for full scale high rate algal ponds hrap eckenfelder 1989 ambient temperature for energy calculations was assumed as 25 c estimates of energy input for heating considered the initial energy required to raise the temperature of all elements of the process streams as well as the energy losses due to conduction heat loss from radiation was considered in the hydrothermal liquefaction process where the operating temperature is 300 c convectional heat losses were assumed negligible the mixing energy required by each process of the reference stp was estimated using the data reported by füreder et al 2017 aeration process was assumed to provide sufficient mixing in the aerobic tank wastewater flow through the plant was assumed to be under gravity with a negligible additional energy requirement for pumping except for internal recirculation ir and return activated sludge flow detailed calculations and the assumptions of the energy analysis are documented in the supplementary information section 3 results 3 1 energy input for nutrient removal the eight stps considered in this study states et al 2008 have utilized multi step processes to meet the standards for bod n and p whereas the starr system met all the standards in a single step of the eight stps p removals in stp 2 5 7 and 8 were by chemical precipitation using metal salt n removals in stp 1 2 and 7 were by n d using respectively 16 mg 5 mg and 48 mg of methanol per liter of sewage treated hydraulic detention time in the eight stps to reach the discharge requirements averaged 0 81days the starr system required 2 3 days to meet all the discharge standards fig 2 compares the performance of the eight full scale stps against the starr system in terms of the mass of n and p removed per unit energy input g kwh the highest p removal per unit energy input was in stp 7 which used chemical precipitation in these stps aeration energy for nitrification dominated 60 the total energy requirement for n removal details of the values plotted in fig 2 are tabulated in appendix a removals of n 12 15 g n kwh and p 1 73 g p kwh in the pilot scale starr system shown as starr a in fig 2 are based on the energy measurements in the pilot scale system instead based on typical energy input of full scale raceway ponds 3 9 w m3 eckenfelder 1989 the removals in the starr system are projected as 257 1 g n kwh and 36 6 g p kwh shown as starr b in fig 2 in comparison the average removals in the eight stps were 74 3 42 5 g n kwh and 135 13 115 34 g p kwh considering the 4 stps that used biological processes the removal was 81 1 75 2 g p kwh the starr system is compared with the 8 stps on the basis of energy consumed to treat 1 mg of primary effluent considering typical input concentrations of 23 37 mg nh3 n l and 4 6 mg po4 p l and the local discharge standards of 10 mg nh3 n l and 1 mg po4 p l again assuming the energy rating of full scale hraps 3 9 w m3 eckenfelder 1989 the energy consumption in the starr system is estimated as 531 5 kwh mg while the average for the eight stps is estimated as 1 037 9 503 3 kwh mg based on the above albeit limited results energy footprint of the starr system for nutrient removal can be seen to be smaller than that of the stps despite its longer hydraulic retention time 3 2 fate of nitrogen and phosphorus fig 3 a and 3b represent mass flows considering a flow of 1 mg of primary effluent for the reference stp and the starr system respectively as can be noted from fig 3a 77 1 of n in the wastewater is dissipated in the reference stp either through mineralization or via the final effluent a comparable value of 79 8 can be calculated from the data reported in a case study of the amsterdam west treatment plant netherlands van der hoek et al 2018 a large fraction 74 5 of the wasted n is mineralized into gaseous nitrogenous products including n2o typical rate of generation of n2o in the n d process has been reported as 0 006 0 253 kg n2o kg n denitrified foley et al 2010 this is a serious concern because global warming potential of n2o is almost 300 times that of carbon dioxide epa 2016 additionally considering that 37 45 mj kg n is expended to fix atmospheric n through the haber bosch process in the fertilizer manufacturing process van der hoek et al 2018 the loss of n in the reference stp is equivalent to about 700 850 kwh d ignoring any loss of ammonia by volatilization with the selected treatment approach a maximum of 7 4 of n and 13 2 of p in the primary effluent could be recovered in the reference stp if its anaerobic digester supernatant is processed further higher n and p 15 4 and 74 9 respectively could be recovered by processing the digested sludge since the mixotrophic cultivation step in the starr system operates under acidic conditions ph 4 loss of n by volatilization and removal of p by chemical precipitation and adsorption are minimal nirmalakhandan et al 2019 hence the fates of n and p in the starr system were assessed considering algal uptake as the only mechanism of nutrient removal this assumption is validated by the fact that the n and p contents in the algal biomass estimated from biomass growth curves and mass balance calculations 7 21 n and 1 44 p are comparable to the compositions determined through elemental analysis 6 80 n and 1 35 p cheng et al 2019 henkanatte gedara 2018 detailed calculations are shown in si section this mass balance validates the notion that nutrients removed in the starr system are concentrated in nutrient rich algal biomass that can serve as a valuable feedstock for fertilizer recovery the nutrient flow in fig 3b was developed considering htl process conditions of 350 c 20 solid content and holding time of 60 min section 3 3 the htl process partitioned 57 2 19 3 11 2 and 12 3 of n in processed algae respectively to the aqueous phase ap biocrude off gas and biochar this result is consistent with the study by cheng et al 2019 where the n content of ap ranged 53 72 on the other hand a majority of p in processed biomass partitioned to the biochar fraction 97 3 our related experimental studies karbakhshravari 2017 showed similar partitioning of p to biochar 95 based on our previous studies karbakhshravari 2017 it is assumed here that 90 of the p associated with the biochar can be readily extracted subsequently by mixing the aqueous phase and biochar extract with magnesium chloride mgcl2 6h2o at a molar ratio of mg p 1 5 1 more than 90 of p could be recovered as struvite karbakhshravari 2017 on a conservative basis recovery of p as struvite was taken in the current study as 90 the quality of the recovered struvite is detailed in the supplementary information section based on these considerations it is estimated that 5 9 of n and 71 6 of p in primary effluent could be recovered as struvite translating to a yield of 2 4 kg struvite 100 m3 of primary effluent 3 3 energy demand for recovery of n and p the starr system incorporates htl of the algal biomass to recover its energy and nutrient contents cheng et al 2019 and li et al 2019 have investigated htl of sewage grown biomass from the starr system under three different temperatures solid contents and holding times fig 4 summarizes the net energy yields of the htl process under these conditions for 1 mg of primary effluent a statistical t test to identify a correlation between the net energy in the htl process and the amount of struvite recovered concluded that there is no correlation between them at a significance level of 0 05 as such htl condition that used the lowest net energy can be considered the most viable option hence htl operating conditions were fixed in the current study at a temperature of 350 c solid content of 20 and holding time of 60 min as suggested by cheng et al 2018 engineering efforts such as including pretreating feedstock to improve biocrude yield increasing algal solid loading and modifying htl process conditions and reactor configuration are needed to improve the performance of the htl process a techno economic analysis must also be conducted to investigate if a low grade fuel to obtain heat for htl could offset the overall process costs since the energy from htl is recovered as a product with a high commercial value biocrude fig 5 a presents the energy demands and recoveries for the reference stp for a flow of 1 mg of primary effluent here the energy demand for aeration was estimated assuming a fine bubble diffuser drewnowski et al 2019 these energy calculations indicated that 70 7 of the total energy input is for aeration this is within the range of 50 90 reported in a review drewnowski et al 2019 the net energy consumption of the reference stp was estimated as 0 93 kwh m3 of primary effluent which is comparable to the reported range of 0 3 1 89 kwh m3 for activated sludge plants without sludge incineration mizuta and shimada 2010 fig 5b shows the energy flows across the starr system for a flow of 1 mg of primary effluent in this case the energy input for the sewage treatment step is solely for mixing and maintaining the algae in suspension as can be noted energy consumed in the sewage treatment step in the starr system is 0 49 kwh m3 while that in the reference stp is 0 93 kwh m3 downstream processes to recover energy and nutrients in the starr system consume additional energy 0 13 kwh m3 for separation of algae by centrifugation 0 20 kwh m3 for heating in the htl process and 0 11 kwh m3 for heating in the p extraction process to reduce the energy demand of the starr system feasibility of alternate dewatering processes needs to be investigated with the current struvite recovery approach in the starr system an additional energy input 4 58 kwh kg struvite recovered is required to extract p from the biochar to minimize this energy demand extraction efficiency of p needs to be investigated for more energy favorable conditions such as biochar contents 5 wt 3 4 recovery of n and p fig 6 compares the starr system against the 12 emerging nutrient recovery technologies in terms of percentage nutrient recovery from primary effluent and the nutrient recovery per unit energy input here the twelve emerging nutrient recovery technologies are evaluated one at a time as an add on to the reference stp details of the technologies considered in this evaluation are tabulated in table b 1 in appendix b of these technologies eleven were selected based on the availability of data and technology readiness as suggested in the study by egle et al 2016 considering the availability of data for nutrient recovery from stps a novel integrated system of accelerated hydrothermal deamination and air stripping htd as was also selected as an n recovery technology he et al 2015 as can be noted from this comparison in fig 6 the starr system recovered the highest amount of p 71 6 from primary effluent as struvite with the exception of htd as the starr system recovered the highest n 5 9 as well nevertheless it should be noted that 46 7 of n in primary effluent is still unrecovered leaving the starr system in the supernatant from the struvite precipitation step it is suggested that follow up processes such as air stripping he et al 2015 or gas permeable hydrophobic membranes nagy et al 2019 be investigated to maximize recovery of n in contrast the maximum recovery of n from the reference stp using any technology is limited to 22 9 since most of the n is dissipated during treatment of the twelve technologies considered here the six that recovered nutrients from anaerobic digester supernatant ad supernatant recovered a higher percentage of nutrients from the feed compared to technologies that recovered nutrients from anaerobic digester sludge ad sludge however since the partitioning of p to ad supernatant was lower 15 technologies that recovered p from ad sludge recovered a significantly higher mass of p compared to the others at a significance level of 0 05 p 1 except for htd as all other technologies recovered n in the form of struvite consequently the n recovery technologies fed with ad sludge also recovered a significantly higher mass of n at a significance level of 0 05 p 1 the following approach was used to compare the energy demand for nutrient recovery via the starr system and the emerging technologies as indicated earlier energy input in the case of the starr system was estimated based on literature value 3 9 w m3 eckenfelder 1989 and nutrients recovered were quantified based on pilot scale data and mass balance in the case of the emerging technologies each technology was added on to the hypothetical reference stp one at a time and the corresponding energy input and the nutrients recovered were estimated the overall energy consumption of the plant was split in half and allocated to n and p recovery for those processes that recovered both results tabulated in appendix b based on the results of these estimations summarized in fig 6b the starr system is seen to be an energy efficient approach for nutrient recovery 2 93 g n kwh and 6 50 g p kwh compared to the emerging technologies 1 04 0 69 g n kwh and 1 96 1 22 g p kwh again technologies that recovered p and or n from ad sludge achieved significantly higher nutrient recovery per unit energy input than from ad supernatant at a significance level of 0 05 p 0 998 and p 1 respectively for p and n it is worth noting that the average energy required by the reference stp to treat wastewater and recover nutrients with each of the twelve technologies 0 95 kwh m3 of primary effluent was similar to that of the starr system 0 93 kwh m3 of primary effluent hence the lower energy expenditure per mass of nutrients recovered in the starr system can be attributed to the higher nutrient recovery compared to the reference stp with the 12 technologies 3 5 preliminary cost analysis a preliminary cost analysis was done based on the pilot scale data collected in this study to identify areas to improve system performance the following direct costs were included in this analysis sulfuric acid kootstra et al 2019 used to acidify the bioreactors calcium hydroxide kemcore 2020 used to neutralize the final effluent sodium hydroxide huang et al 2014 used for extracting biochar magnesium oxide huang et al 2014 to precipitate struvite electricity in new mexico eia 2019 for total energy input to the integrated system details included in si on this basis operating cost for wastewater treatment was estimated as 0 20 m3 and that for the downstream recovery processes as 0 13 m3 resulting in the overall cost of wastewater treatment and fertilizer recovery as 0 33 m3 value of biocrude estimated from its calorific value assuming 30 fuel to electricity conversion efficiency was 0 02 m3 and that of struvite munir et al 2017 was 0 01 m3 yielding total revenue of 0 03 m3 while this preliminary analysis may indicate that the starr system is not economically attractive a comprehensive life cycle analysis needs to be undertaken to quantify its environmental benefits such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions eutrophication and conservation of natural resources as pointed out earlier several processes in the starr system remain to be intensified and optimized for example the net energy input in the htl process can be reduced by about 50 by incorporating heat recovery cheng et al 2019 lowering the cost of the downstream processing to 0 09 m3 residual n in the supernatant of the struvite precipitation step may be recovered by a gas permeable membrane process for example to yield ammonium sulfate a high value fertilizer garcia gonzález and vanotti 2015 on going studies have shown n recoveries up to 95 translating to additional revenue errico et al 2018 estimated at 0 01 m3 details in si customized design of the paddlewheel assembly can reduce the cost of sewage treatment alternate processes for harvesting the algal biomass can further reduce the energy costs in downstream processing on the other hand value of struvite will continue to increase as the phosphate supplies dwindle and population grows results of this study indicate that the starr system holds promise as a sustainable alternative to the current and emerging sewage treatment and nutrient recovery technologies and warrants due consideration 4 conclusion an algal based sewage treatment and resource recovery system starr capable of energy efficient nutrient removal and recovery was demonstrated in this study results from a pilot scale version of the starr system confirmed that it is more energy efficient than eight full scale wastewater treatment plants in removing nutrients from sewage further comparison of the starr system with hypothetical activated sludge based systems integrated with 12 emerging nutrient recovery technologies indicated that it is capable of achieving higher recoveries of nutrients per unit energy input mass balance considerations showed that the starr system is capable of recovering 2 4 kg struvite from 100 m3 of settled sewage based on the energy efficient recovery of nutrients documented here the starr system can potentially be a greener alternative for

18036,aerobic granular sludge ags was rapidly cultivated in an integrated oxidation ditch with two zone clarifiers by using a novel external sludge treatment and return mode to treat low concentrations of actual domestic sewage the selective pressure created by the two zone clarifiers can retain the well settling granules and discharge light flocs with poor settleability the granules stayed in the reactor which induced bacterial attachment to the granules that acted as nuclei while the discharged flocs can stimulate microorganisms to secrete large amounts of extracellular polymeric substances eps under the external conditioning of cacl2 and natural air drying then this surplus sludge was returned to the reactor to create more small granules that combined with each other through the action of hydraulic shear forces to achieve rapid granulation the results showed that ags was formed successfully in the reactor on day 18 and after 51 days of continuous operation the biomass concentration and settling ability were further improved the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and sludge volume index at 5 min svi5 were stable at approximately 3500 mg l and 40 0 ml g respectively during the whole experimental period the biological sludge activity was greatly improved and the eps and microbial community changed significantly including an enrichment of microbes with eps secretion and granule stabilization functions the study results reveal that the pollutant removal efficiency improved after granulation furthermore this approach required less energy and is eco friendly for potential full scale implementation graphical abstract image 10259 keywords rapid aerobic granulation integrated oxidation ditch with two zone clarifiers disposed surplus sludge selection pressure low concentration of domestic sewage 1 introduction the aerobic granular sludge ags process has been regarded as an emerging biotechnological approach for wastewater treatment due to its advantages over the conventional activated sludge system such as its better subsidence performance denser aggregate structure higher biomass concentration and ability to treat wastewater containing toxic substrates in only one aerobic reactor adav et al 2008a amorim et al 2014 bumbac et al 2015 although ags processes were first reported in a continuous upflow aerobic sludge blanket bioreactor mishima and nakamura 1991 the technology was developed mainly in column type sequencing batch reactors sbrs that are easily controlled to produce the ideal conditions for aerobic granulation such as the succession of feast famine conditions isanta et al 2012 high hydraulic shear forces show et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 and excellent sludge screening effects liu and tay 2004 as a result granular sbrs have been successfully used to treat various kinds of effluents at the lab scale wagner and da costa 2013 jungles et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 huang et al 2015 currently there are several pilot and full scale applications of this technology for municipal wastewater treatment giesen et al 2013 li et al 2014a pronk et al 2015 yang et al 2016 nevertheless most current large scale wastewater operations use continuous flow systems and it will be much simpler to directly implement ags in the existing infrastructure than to convert current operations to batch operations therefore it is more practically significant to study ags in cfrs cfrs have weak mass transfer impetuses low hydraulic shear forces and poor sludge screening mechanisms which causes difficulty in achieving granulation in addition any ags formed could be destroyed by the return sludge pumps which is why ags has not been established in traditional activated sludge processes for a hundred years although there are few studies on ags cultivation in cfrs at present an increasing number of researchers have begun to study this idea and have achieved aerobic sludge granulation by different strategies it is relatively common and efficient to separate sludge and water via three phase separators to achieve aerobic sludge granulation zhou et al 2014 cultivated ags with an average particle size of 0 51 mm in an airlift bioreactor alr by means of a three phase separator with a high hydrodynamic shear force yang et al 2014 carried out inoculation with a biofilm and cultivated ags with particle sizes of 0 6 0 9 mm in an alr by using a three phase separator and high dissolved oxygen do method the introduction of a settling velocity based selection pressure could generate ags in cfrs which is an extremely effective design strategy morales et al 2012 designed the continuous stirred tank reactor cstr to achieve granulation by sludge screening with a settling velocity of ags that is significantly greater than that of activated sludge li et al 2014b 2015 cultivated ags in a modified oxidation ditch with an adjustable volume intraclarifier for settling large particles and in a reverse flow baffled reactor rfbr by using feast famine conditions and selective settling pressure some cfrs function using selection pressures created by different sizes to cultivate ags liu et al 2014a studied the stability of ags in a continuous flow self forming dynamic membrane bioreactor sfdmbr and successfully cultivated ags by gradually increasing the aperture from 0 1 mm to 1 0 mm of sieves in the sludge selection tank membrane units that squeeze water from sludge can also be used in place of separators sajjad et al 2016 cultivated ags with an average particle size of 0 625 mm by inoculating aerobic granules and installing an internal settling tank in mbr corsino et al 2016 cultivated ags by creating feast famine conditions and ensuring high hydraulic shear forces in a granular continuous flow membrane bioreactor gcfmbr and studied the reactor stability according to the literature review the configurations of various cfrs are endless but there has been little success in mainstream treatment technology for wastewater treatment plants wwtps such as anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o technology anaerobic aerobic a o technology oxidation ditches etc li et al 2014b the main reasons for the low success rate are the weak sludge selection pressure of the actual wwtps and the mechanical sludge reflux pump being prone to breaking the formed aerobic granules therefore this problem can be solved effectively by introducing settling velocity based selection pressures into cfrs and using two zone clarifiers to eliminate the sludge reflux system recently reported findings provided a reliable approach to promote the formation of ags by using a two zone sedimentation tank zou et al 2018 however an airlift system was applied to return the sludge and these studies were performed in only a single aerobic tank conventional wwtps rarely use airlift pumps for sludge refluxing and oxidation ditches are the most widely used technology in the wwtps of china jin et al 2014 there have also been thousands of wwtps with oxidation ditch processes implemented in the united states and in europe wef 1998 us epa 2000 thus a simple and effective solid liquid separation method is needed and the feasibility of ags formation in oxidation ditch processes also needs further investigation most studies use artificial wastewater as the substrate and in this situation the formation of ags will take 20 40 days however if real wastewater is used the granulation process requires a longer time therefore the reduction of the start up time has become one of the main factors restricting the development of continuous flow ags technology a large number of studies about sbrs have shown that there are three main modes for the fast cultivation of ags namely the addition of metal ions such as ca2 mg2 etc into the feed water liu et al 2010 pijuan et al 2011 long et al 2016 dosing with inert carriers or a portion of ags sajjad and kim 2015 wan et al 2015 and inoculation with special strains jiang et al 2006 ivanov et al 2008 these methods of rapid cultivation are mainly concentrated on the sludge conditioning occurring inside the reactor a new effective method of accelerating the formation of aggregates can be formulated by adding metal ions to part of the surplus sludge air drying the sludge naturally and then returning the sludge to the reactor to achieve rapid granulation on one hand the adverse conditions created through external conditioning methods can improve the stability of sludge colloids stimulate the secretion of a large number of eps by microorganisms and complete the bridge bonding effect on the other hand the small particles formed in the reactor by the disposed and dewatered sludge can be used as induction nuclei to promote granulation in addition cultivating ags in cfrs using real and low concentrations of domestic sewage is still rarely reported zou et al 2018 therefore this study attempted to develop a novel method for the rapid granulation of ags by the process of external sludge treatment and return in a continuous flow integrated oxidation ditch with two zone clarifiers to treat real low concentrations of domestic sewage the aerobic granulation process was investigated by monitoring the sludge characteristics and activity microbial community and pollutant removal which allowed the evaluation of the effectiveness of this approach and revealed the mechanism of rapid granulation in the reactor the results of this study will help promote new ideas for practical engineering applications for the continuity of ags 2 methods and materials 2 1 wastewater and seed sludge the low concentrations of domestic sewage used in this study were taken from underground sewage inspection wells in a residential district in zhejiang china the water quality fluctuates greatly at this location the main parameters of the real wastewater were as follows chemical oxygen demand codcr 200 400 mg l total nitrogen tn 30 45 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 10 20 mg l total phosphorus tp 1 4 mg l and ph 6 8 7 6 the inoculated sludge was taken from the dewatered sludge with a water content of approximately 80 of a wwtp located in zhejiang china after removing filamentous and large particles through a 100 mesh sieve the inoculated sludge was sent to the reactor to restore the activity of the sludge it was allowed to undergo continuous aeration in the reactor for 3 days in which the initial sludge concentration of mixed liquid suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were 3067 mg l and 1490 mg l respectively and the sludge volume index at 5 min svi5 was 97 9 ml g 2 2 reactor and operation this study introduced selective pressure based on the settling velocity into the solid liquid separation to design an integrated oxidation ditch with two zone clarifiers which was used to cultivate ags as shown in fig 1 this separation always retained the heavy sludge in the reactor and washed away the light sludge the reactor had a total length of 1 68 m a width of 0 22 m 0 11 m width of each single ditch an effective water depth of 0 4 m and an effective volume of approximately 140 l it mainly included an aeration zone and two identical clarifier zones the first zone and second zone of the clarifier were denoted by clarifier 1 and clarifier 2 respectively and rotating mixing plates were used at both ends to circulate the mixture microporous aerated sand heads were uniformly arranged in the aeration zone to supply gas at the bottom with an airflow rate of 0 2 m3 h and the temperature during the whole experiment was in the range of 25 5 c inclined plates were placed at an angle of 60 under the liquid surface to include two clarifier zones each with an area of 242 cm2 and a settling time of 0 7 h the bottom of clarifier 1 was not closed set as an outlet with a width of 1 5 cm and the discharge pipe was connected outside clarifier 2 the effluent was discharged from the serrated overflow weir after settling in clarifier 2 a movable baffle was inserted midway between clarifier 1 and the aerated sand head nearby which not only guaranteed the stability of the flow state in the clarification zone but also created different selection pressures associated with the settling time the selection pressure was weakened by increasing the height of baffle relative to the liquid level the baffle was inserted 0 1 m below the liquid level at the start of the reactor operation 0 d to create a relatively high selection pressure the aeration zone was filled with wastewater flow rate 110 ml min by a peristaltic pump and the hydraulic retention time was controlled at approximately 16 h the organic loading rate olr was 0 27 0 53 kg m3 d during the experiment water samples of the influent and effluent were collected from the influent tank and effluent pipe respectively sludge samples from the aeration zone were collected by a siphon in the middle of the aeration zone at 4 h after returning the sludge from external treatment to obtain sludge samples from the clarifiers equal volume sludge samples from the surface layer middle layer and bottom layer of the sludge blanket were collected by a siphon and then they were completely mixed to produce the representative sludge samples 2 3 sludge external treatment and return method as seen in fig 1 the partial sludge floc discharged from clarifier 2 was collected by a gauze accumulator every day after the reactor was operated the sludge was conditioned and dewatered by adding 0 1 g calcium chloride cacl2 per gram of dry sludge as this dosage can highly improve the dewatering performance of the sludge kavitha et al 2015 and air dried naturally for 72 4 h then the disposed and dewatered sludge moisture content was 60 5 was placed in a glass container to obtain as many micro aggregates as possible after adding an appropriate amount of water an electric agitator was used to smash the sludge slowly for 1 2 min after discarding the upper flocs the crushed sludge was separated using a 4 mm sieve and sludge aggregates that were below 4 mm in size were used as the final product and returned to the aeration zone 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 analysis of the sludge properties and water quality the morphology of the aerobic granules was observed under an optical microscope cx31 olympus japan and the sizes of the aerobic granules were determined by image pro plus analysis 6 0 olympus soft imaging solution the codcr nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn suspended solids ss mlss mlvss and svi5 were measured according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2012 2 4 2 analysis of the sludge biological activity the specific oxygen uptake rate sour of the sludge was determined using the method described by wang et al 2009 dehydrogenase activity was determined by the ttc method ryssov nielsen 1975 2 4 3 eps extraction and analysis the formaldehyde sodium hydroxide method was used to extract eps from sludge liu and fang 2002 in this study the total amount of eps was the sum of the protein pn and polysaccharide ps contents the concentration of pn was determined by using coomassie brilliant blue g 250 with bovine serum albumin bsa as the standard frolund et al 1995 and the concentration of ps was determined by the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose solution as the standard dubois et al 1956 2 4 4 analysis of the sludge microbial community to explore the dynamics of the microbial community during the whole experimental period high throughput illumina miseq sequencing for sludge samples ags0 ags18 ags27 ags40 ags60 and ags80 digital representation of the reactor operation days from the aeration zone was conducted at zhejiang tianke hi tech inc hangzhou china the microbial dna in the sludge samples was extracted using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio usa according to the manufacturer s protocols a nanodrop2000 fluorospectrometer thermo scientific usa was used to quantify the samples and the dna quality was detected on a 1 w w agarose gel subsequently the v3 and v4 regions of the 16s rdna sequences of bacteria were amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr with the primers 341f 5 cctacgnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvggtatctaatcc 3 hugerth et al 2014 the pcr amplification was performed in triplicate in a 30 μl mixture containing 15 μl of 2 phusion master mix 1 5 μl of each prime 2 μmol l 10 μl of template dna 1 ng μl and 2 μl of h2o the thermal programme was as follows pre denaturation at 94 c for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation 94 c for 30 s annealing 45 c for 20 s extension 72 c for 30 s and a final extension at 72 c for 5 min the pcr products of the sample were sequenced by using the illumina miseq platform miseq pe300 illumina usa the original data generated by sequencing were filtered spliced and the chimaeras were removed by flash and qiime to obtain effective tags operational taxonomic units otus were clustered with a 97 identity threshold using uparse and then the rdp classifier version 11 4 method and silva database were used for species annotation analysis the bacterial diversity and community composition were analysed on this basis 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of the sludge characteristics in the early stage 0 3 days of reactor operation the sludge was in the form of irregular small particles and flocs fig 2 a with the particle size distribution psd mainly concentrated within 0 0 5 mm fig 2d accounting for 87 7 the average particle size was 0 28 mm and the mean settling velocity was 21 9 m h as shown in fig 3 a the mlss dropped to 2822 mg l and the svi5 increased to 108 0 ml g on day 3 the ss of the effluent was also high at 376 mg l although a certain amount of conditioned sludge aggregates was returned daily from day 3 onward the mlss did not increase significantly because only a small amount of the returned sludge aggregates finally stayed in the reactor under the joint action of the shear force and dual zone selection pressure furthermore it took time for the returned sludge aggregates to adapt to the new environment before they could grow and reproduce returning the sludge aggregates daily is a strategy that promptly discharges the suspended growth sludge with poor settleability and provides a good environment for adherent growth sludge the flocculent sludge in the reactor gradually decreased while the granular sludge gradually increased which effectively stopped the increasing trend of the svi5 the svi5 began to gradually decrease and dropped to 56 6 ml g on day 18 at this moment ags with relatively regular and complete shape appeared in the aeration zone fig 2b and the average particle size of the granules increased significantly to 0 37 mm with a mean settling velocity of 37 8 m h fig 2d the psd 0 2 mm decreased from 62 9 day 0 to 36 2 while those at 0 2 0 5 mm and 0 5 1 0 mm increased from 24 8 day 0 and 6 1 day 0 to 39 6 and 12 8 respectively as described by tiwari et al 2005 and bhunia and ghangrekar 2007 when more than half of the particle sizes were larger than 0 34 mm the aerobic granulation of sludge was realized afterwards the svi5 continued to decrease with slight fluctuations and after 51 days of continuous operation the value stabilized below 40 0 ml g the mlss in the reactor also slightly increased at this stage and reached 3611 mg l on day 51 after which it was maintained at approximately 3500 mg l until the end of the experiment compared with the results of zou et al 2018 who used only a two zone sedimentation tank to create the selection pressure and obtained an mlss that continuously dropped from 3000 mg l to 700 mg l during the first 17 days before gradually recovering to 2800 mg l on day 30 the present results indicated that returning the conditioned sludge aggregates can effectively reduce sludge loss and increase the sludge concentration in the reactor the effluent ss was also essentially stabilized below 100 mg l during this period as the operation proceeded denser and more rounded granular sludge appeared in the reactor fig 2c and the particle size also gradually increased on day 80 of operation the average particle size of the granules reached 0 66 mm with a mean settling velocity of 43 2 m h fig 2d compared with day 18 the psd 0 2 mm and 0 2 0 5 mm decreased to 20 8 and 26 3 while those at 0 5 1 0 mm and 1 0 1 5 mm increased to 29 6 and 12 3 and a large amount of small granular sludge appeared in clarifier 2 the ratio of mlvss mlss increased from 47 06 to 53 34 during the first 3 day as microbes began to adapt to the environment and grow the ratio continued to increase to 56 28 on day 6 indicating that the growth rate of the sludge retained in the reactor was relatively high however with the continuous development of the aerobic granulation of sludge the relatively low organic loading in this study caused slowing of the growth of microbes and the concentration of ca2 in the sludge increased constantly the mlvss mlss ratio was 48 99 49 12 and 49 04 on day 72 day 76 and day 80 respectively which remained stable until the end of the experiment the result was consistent with that of previous study reported by zou et al 2018 who also cultured ags under a low organic load 0 16 0 05 kg m3 d and added micro powder continuously to promote granulation from day 32 to day 72 which produced a slightly decreased mlvss mlss ratio compared with that in the initial stage 3 2 variation of the sludge biological activity sour is an important indicator used to evaluate the microbial metabolic activity of sludge similarly since the oxidation of many organics in organisms is mostly realized by dehydrogenation the dehydrogenase activity of a sludge mixture represents the ability of the microbes themselves to adapt to the external environment and it can also directly reflect the activity of the microbes wang et al 2016 according to fig 3b the trends of the sour and dehydrogenase activity were essentially the same during the process of granulation although the reactor was operated after continuous aeration for 3 days to reactivate the inoculated dehydrated sludge the initial sludge bioactivity in the reactor was still poor after 2 days of reactor operation the sour and dehydrogenase activity were 18 9 mg o2 g mlvss h and 7 97 mg g mlvss respectively however with the continuous operation of the reactor the sludge activity rapidly improved without being affected by the daily return of a certain amount of conditioned sludge aggregates as shown in fig 3d the sour of the returned conditioned sludge aggregates was only 8 0 mg o2 g mlvss h 72 h after 37 days of operation the sour and dehydrogenase activity increased to the maxima which were 46 1 mgo2 g mlvss h and 23 71 mg g mlvss respectively and then became steady this result implies that in addition to the conditioned sludge aggregates that were returned daily accelerating aerobic granulation by acting as nuclei they were also undergoing a transformation from physical aggregates to mature ags as there was a huge difference in the corresponding biological activity liu et al 2015 noted that the sour of granules decreased from 61 to 23 mg o2 g mlss h and attributed this change to the excessive precipitation of caco3 however such extreme precipitation was not observed in our case in addition the sour of activated sludge is usually 8 20 mg o2 g mlvss h wang et al 2012 the biological activity of the ags formed in this study was greatly improved and indirectly showed that its use was advantageous for the treatment capacity 3 3 variation of the eps component eps is one type of metabolic product that accumulates on the surfaces of bacterial cells it is mainly composed of ps and pn the content and proportion of which have an important influence on the formation and stability of ags tay et al 2001 as shown in fig 3c the eps decreased during the first 9 days as the ps decreased from 58 91 mg g mlvss to 46 71 mg g mlvss and the pn decreased from 68 42 mg g mlvss to 55 32 mg g mlvss this indicated that the relatively low olr led to a lack of nutrients in the initial sludge and that eps may have been consumed by microbes as a carbon source subsequently eps increased from day 9 to day 30 and reached a maximum value of 150 15 mg g mlvss thereafter the eps decreased in fluctuations and finally decreased to 52 17 mg g mlvss after 79 days of operation this phenomenon might be attributed to the fact that the skeleton structure and particle size of ags were relatively stable after formation which is consistent with the results observed in a number of studies showing that eps increased significantly during the granulation process but decreased slightly during the mature period mcswain et al 2005 adav et al 2008b the increase of the pn ps ratio is favourable to granulation because pn is hydrophobic and ps is hydrophilic in this study pn ps increased from the beginning of reactor operation and reached the maximum value of 2 78 on day 23 research has shown that pn in eps can improve the hydrophobicity and sedimentation ability of cells the increase of the pn content benefits the formation and stabilization of ags liu et al 2014b in this study the pn increased sharply from 55 32 mg g mlvss on day 9 99 05 mg g mlvss on day 30 while the ps during this period basically remained unchanged indicating that pn played a leading role in aerobic granulation which is also consistent with the findings of mcswain et al 2005 during conditioning which involves adding cacl2 and natural drying for 72 4 h of the light flocculent sludge discharged from clarifier 2 on day 9 the aggregates not only changed significantly in morphology loose irregular structure but also were enlarged in particle size with psd 1 0 mm 1 0 2 0 mm and 2 0 4 0 mm values of 24 7 33 6 and 41 7 the average particle size of 1 93 mm while before treatment the psd values at 0 2 mm 0 2 0 5 mm and 0 5 mm were 86 7 10 1 and 3 2 with an average particle size of 0 11 mm in addition the sour and eps also changed dramatically as shown in fig 3d the sour decreased sharply from 23 0 mg o2 g mlvss h 0 h to 11 6 mg o2 g mlvss h 36 h and then gradually dropped to 7 7 mg o2 g mlvss h 72 h the decrease in the sludge bioactivity indicated that no nutrients were provided and that a relatively hostile environment was created for microbes thus the community composition of the microbes changed the eps decreased from 94 18 mg g mlvss 0 h to 65 33 mg g mlvss 24 h during this period the pn decreased from 49 53 mg g mlvss 0 h to 40 20 mg g mlvss 24 h while the ps sharply decreased from 44 65 mg g mlvss 0 h to 25 13 mg g mlvss 24 h indicating a lack of nutrition in the environment accordingly eps mainly ps were consumed by microbes as a carbon source afterwards the eps increased rapidly from 65 33 mg g mlvss 24 h to 107 13 mg g mlvss 72 h indicating that the microbes retained by the selected pressure secreted more eps to protect themselves this was consistent with the study of sheng et al 2010 who observed that de watering and non nutritive environments cause microorganisms to secrete greater amounts of eps for self protection throughout the whole process pn ps showed an upward trend that was conducive to granulation thus the conditioned sludge could effectively accelerate the aerobic granulation in the reactor upon its return 3 4 pollutant removal performance since this study treated actual low concentrations of domestic sewage the influent cod and tn values fluctuated greatly between 200 and 400 mg l and 30 45 mg l respectively resulting in a certain fluctuation of the effluent tn was mainly composed of nh4 n and organic nitrogen almost no no2 n and no3 n were detected in the influent the performance in each type of pollutant removal is shown in fig 4 the cod removal rate in the first 4 days was 77 13 83 32 with the continuous and stable operation of the reactor the effluent cod was basically below 50 mg l and the removal rate of cod was 83 23 93 03 indicating that the aerobic granulation of sludge helped improve the treatment capacity which is consistent with the previous studies reported by zhang et al 2016 and zou et al 2018 the olr had a greater influence on the physiological properties and stability of the ags peyong et al 2012 it is worth noting that the olr in this study was 0 27 0 53 kg m3 d which was lower than the conventional ags culture conditions in the range of 1 5 15 kg m3 d moy et al 2002 liu et al 2003 and it was even lower than that of the ags cultivated by ni et al 2009 in low strength municipal wastewater 0 6 1 0 kg m3 d this indicates that the formation of ags is not directly correlated with the olr this result is not consistent with that of chen et al 2016 who speculated that aerobic granules should be maintained at much higher olrs e g 31 3 kg m3 d and with a good cod removal performance the increase of the olr may accelerate the growth of bacteria and increase the particle size gao et al 2011 as shown by liu et al 2003 when the olr was increased from 3 kg m3 d to 9 kg m3 d the average particle size of the ags increased by 0 3 mm this study was conducted under low olr conditions and the growth of microbes was slow resulting in small particle sizes of the ags during the whole experimental period the removal rate of nh4 n was 85 13 100 and the effluent nh4 n was stable below 3 mg l which is consistent with previously results in which aerobic granulation cfrs have achieved nh4 n removal through ammonia oxidation at efficiencies 90 li et al 2014c hou et al 2017 even approaching 100 removal in some cases jin et al 2008 li et al 2015 in addition the daily operation mode of the returning conditioned sludge aggregates had no actual influence on the effects of reactor operation which can also be explained by the biological activity of the sludge in fig 3b however tn removal depends on the operating conditions and the reactor in this study was operated with continuous aeration rather than anaerobic aerobic cycling which was the main reason for the low removal efficiency of tn the average tn removal efficiency was 12 4 3 1 during the first 18 days and then it increased to 22 0 2 9 with no no2 n but a large amount of no3 n detected in the effluent the certain improvement of the tn removal efficiency should be mainly attributed to the enhancement of simultaneous nitrification denitrfication snd in the aeration previous studies showed that the snd efficiency is largely dependent on the anoxic zones in the granules coma et al 2012 zou et al 2019 the small particle size of granules in this case the average particle size was 0 66 mm on day 80 impeded denitrification because it allowed for the penetration of do deep into the granule preventing the formation of an anoxic core in which denitrifiers can grow these findings were also confirmed by jin et al 2008 who produced larger sizes of granules 47 granules had a diameter 1 5 mm after 75 days that allowed an anoxic centre zone to become established 3 5 microbial community characterization the high throughput sequencing yielded high quality and effective reads from different days during the operation of the reactor all with 98 coverage including 38041 ags0 37015 ags18 37656 ags27 36543 ags40 33111 ags60 and 32253 ags80 this shows that the collected gene sequences can well represent the true distribution of sludge microorganisms the shannon value can describe the diversity of a microbial community the values of the samples were 8 37 ags0 8 33 ags18 7 89 ags27 7 73 ags40 7 47 ags60 and 7 45 ags80 which indicated that the microbial diversity in the ags was lower than that in the initial sludge this is consistent with the results of weissbrodt et al 2012 who showed that the microbial diversity of the initial flocculent sludge will be greatly reduced compared with that in the formation stage of ags and the diversity of bacteria in ags will decrease with the increase of the aerobic particle size the coexisting otus of ags18 ags27 ags40 ags60 and ags80 with ags0 were 1061 1009 972 924 and 897 respectively in addition the results of the cluster dendrogram based on the otu level showed that ags80 and ags0 were the most remote in the cluster fig 5 a indicating that the microbial communities had changed significantly in the process of granulation which was consistent with the results of previous studies reported by lv et al 2014 and zou et al 2019 as shown in fig 5a proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant and second most dominant phyla respectively in the six samples of ags0 ags18 ags27 ags40 ags60 and ags80 and their relative abundance accounted for 39 79 and 23 63 45 66 and 24 07 53 10 and 20 90 48 72 and 20 70 48 46 and 24 78 and 47 12 and 30 04 respectively this is consistent with the results of several scholars who found that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes are the predominant phyla in ags and activated sludge zhang et al 2012 zou et al 2019 and these phyla include a large number of important functional bacteria for the removal of organics nogueira et al 2002 in the process of granulation the relative abundance of proteobacteria was in a stable state before it greatly increased fig 5a this is consistent with the fact that the relative abundance of proteobacteria increases during the formation of ags which was found by seviour et al 2011 and it has been speculated that proteobacteria play an important role in granular sludge in addition as proteobacteria play an important part in the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles liu et al 2017 which indirectly shows that aerobic granulation was helpful for improving the treatment capacity of pollutants other phyla with lower relative abundance such as chloroflex 4 85 9 22 planctomycete 2 15 5 81 verrucomicrobia 2 14 4 04 and firmicutes 0 54 2 40 were also observed in ags reactors in previous studies zhang et al 2012 zou et al 2018 2019 it is worth noting that the relative abundance of actinobacteria continued to decline from 3 33 ags0 to 0 93 ags80 during granulation according to the research of seviour et al 2008 actinobacteria was correlated with the filamentous bulking of sludge indicating that the selective pressure produced by the two zone clarifiers had a great influence on this phylum at the genus level the top 10 species of each sample were selected to produce a cumulative cylindrical map of relative abundance as shown in fig 5b zoogloea is a flocculent bacterium that promotes eps secretion and binds cells together which is often found in ags treatment systems xia et al 2018 ren et al 2018 zou et al 2019 with the continuous operation of the reactor the relative abundances of zoogloea were 0 52 ags0 1 54 ags18 1 72 ags27 2 37 ags40 2 71 ags60 and 2 89 ags80 similarly rhodobacter showed almost the same growth pattern with the relative abundance increasing from 0 35 ags0 to 2 82 ags80 a large number of studies have shown that rhodobacter is the main microorganism that functions as a stabilizer in ags show et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 these results showed that the selective pressure generated by the two zone clarifiers can select more microorganisms related to eps secretion and the stabilization of aerobic granules thus promoting the rapid granulation of ags particular species that improve granule stability include flavobacteria zhou et al 2014 which is a widely reported genus that can characterize the maturity of granular sludge li et al 2008 in research on calcium precipitation induced aerobic granulation flavobacterium was found to attach to the core of sludge and promote eps through the expression of related genes wan et al 2015 in this study the relative abundance of flavobacterium increased from 0 27 ags0 to 2 75 ags80 which was related to the operation mode of the partial sludge floc discharged from clarifier 2 that was conditioned and dewatered by cacl2 and then returned to the reactor the increase of flavobacterium effectively promoted rapid granulation in the reactor thiothrix is a common filamentous bacterium li et al 2014 that was found in this study the relative abundance in ags0 was only 0 004 but fluctuated between 1 and 2 in ags18 to ags80 therefore the increase in the abundances of thiothrix during the granulation process suggested that filamentous bacteria may play an important role in sludge granulation similar findings were also reported by other researchers xia et al 2018 ordinary heterotrophic organisms including hydrogenophaga flavobacterium and planctomyces which function as organic removal bacteria showed an increasing tendency during the granulation process supporting the conclusion that the removal effect of carbon sources was improved through the process of granulation for n removal thiothrix zoogloea hyphomicrobium and dechloromonas were the dominant denitrifying bacteria in the reactor chen et al 2016 rubio rincón et al 2017 pishgar et al 2019 the abundance of each increased from 0 004 0 52 0 71 and 0 82 in ags0 to 1 99 2 89 2 30 and 2 56 in ags80 respectively these results confirmed that snd can be promoted during granulation which is closely related to the n removal capacity of the reactor non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds is a kind of sorting method suitable for ecological research that can reflect the degrees of sample differences according to the distances between points the nmds analysis of the otus of each sample points is shown in fig 5c in which nmds1 and nmds2 showed the two most significant differences ags0 and ags18 were far apart due to the selective pressures generated by the two zone clarifiers which made the sludge with good sedimentation performance remain in the reactor flocculating and agglomerating microbial communities in sludge are retained and continue to propagate and poorly settling flocs discharge as surplus sludge furthermore the cacl2 conditioning air drying returning mode of some floc surplus sludge created a relatively harsh environment for microorganisms and changed the abundance and composition under the continuous promotion of two such biological selective pressures the microbial community composition changed significantly and the sludge in the reactor transformed from the initial flocculent into granules with the formation of ags the gaps between other sample points such as those between ags18 and ags27 or ags40 and ags60 gradually narrowed this is consistent with the results of the cluster dendrogram in fig 5a indicating that the ags bacterial community composition changed slightly during the process of granule size growth compared with the ags formation process it is worth noting that ags0 and ags80 were the farthest apart which again proves that the microbial community experienced tremendous changes throughout the whole aerobic granulation process 3 6 mechanism analysis of the effect of returning disposed surplus sludge on accelerating aerobic sludge granulation the specific path for returning disposed surplus sludge to promote the rapid granulation of ags is shown in fig 6 in the processes of conditioning by adding cacl2 and natural drying of the light flocculent sludge discharged from clarifier 2 the eps rose from 94 18 mg g mlvss 0 h to 107 13 mg g mlvss 72 h the increased eps content could act as a bridge between microbes and promote bacteria bacteria and bacteria solid adhesion to promote cohesiveness liu et al 2014a caudan et al 2014 meanwhile sludge dewatering and drying greatly reduced the distances between microbes and might have significantly enhanced the material transfer process ca2 could neutralize the negative charge on the surface of eps compress the electrical double layer and reduce the hydration shell which would improve the effective collision and further promote the secretion of eps sajjad et al 2016 in this study under the bridging effect of eps ca2 eps the flocculent sludge can gather to form large aggregates that can be broken into small aggregates and granular sludge with certain strength and morphological activities the externally disposed small aggregates and granular sludge were returned to the reactor the returned sludge absorbed water and became larger and the increase in the moisture content caused the decrease of the sludge strength meanwhile under the effect of hydraulic shear forces the small aggregates with structures that were not compact or dense enough were broken down into large granules small granules and light flocs the large granules with good sedimentation performance always stayed in the aeration zone and the microorganisms that gradually adapted to the new environment and resumed activity experienced a transformation from physical granular sludge to mature ags which is consistent with the results of pijuan et al 2011 and long et al 2014 this was also shown in fig 3b due to the selection pressure created by the two zone clarifiers the small granules with good settleability settling in clarifier 1 that stayed in the reactor can act as nuclei for the microbes that gradually gathered and grew on their surfaces under the joint action of the cell hydrophobicity eps adsorption bridging and hydraulic shear force the granule morphology tended to become regular and the structure became more compact finally forming stable and mature ags the light flocs with poor settleability were discharged from the reactor under selective pressure settling in clarifier 2 and disposed by artificially creating unfavourable conditions that stimulated microorganisms to secrete large amounts of eps to induce microbial aggregation then this surplus sludge was returned to the reactor again until granulation was achieved moreover some microbes related to eps secretion and stabilization of the granules were enriched under the novel operation mode another benefit of using this novel approach was also concerned sludge dewatering being of great importance in sludge treatment and disposal on one hand the use of cacl2 as an inorganic agent commonly added in sludge dehydration in this study is also conducive to the subsequent treatment and disposal of sludge it was reported that sludge dewaterability was successfully and economically improved in cacl2 solution as ca2 could interact with the proteins phenols and o h functional group in the flocs guan et al 2012 on the other hand partial residual sludge was returned to the reactor to achieve sludge reduction which is expected to cut down a significant amount of energy use in practice 4 conclusion the rapid granulation of aerobic sludge in an integrated oxidation ditch with two zone clarifiers was realized by using a novel mode of external sludge treatment and a returning method to treat low concentrations of actual domestic sewage the two zone clarifiers created selection pressure in the reactor to retain small granules with good sedimentation performance while the light flocs with poor settleability can be discharged as surplus sludge under the external conditioning of cacl2 and natural air drying the discharged flocs can stimulate microorganisms to secrete large amounts of eps to then be returned to the reactor to form a large number of small granules which induced bacterial attachment by acting as nuclei during the whole process of aerobic granulation the biological activity of the sludge was greatly improved the eps and microbial community changed significantly microbes with the function of eps secretion were enriched and granulation was helpful for improving the treatment capacity of pollutants furthermore the method developed in this study required less energy and is eco friendly for potential full scale implementation declaration of

18036,aerobic granular sludge ags was rapidly cultivated in an integrated oxidation ditch with two zone clarifiers by using a novel external sludge treatment and return mode to treat low concentrations of actual domestic sewage the selective pressure created by the two zone clarifiers can retain the well settling granules and discharge light flocs with poor settleability the granules stayed in the reactor which induced bacterial attachment to the granules that acted as nuclei while the discharged flocs can stimulate microorganisms to secrete large amounts of extracellular polymeric substances eps under the external conditioning of cacl2 and natural air drying then this surplus sludge was returned to the reactor to create more small granules that combined with each other through the action of hydraulic shear forces to achieve rapid granulation the results showed that ags was formed successfully in the reactor on day 18 and after 51 days of continuous operation the biomass concentration and settling ability were further improved the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and sludge volume index at 5 min svi5 were stable at approximately 3500 mg l and 40 0 ml g respectively during the whole experimental period the biological sludge activity was greatly improved and the eps and microbial community changed significantly including an enrichment of microbes with eps secretion and granule stabilization functions the study results reveal that the pollutant removal efficiency improved after granulation furthermore this approach required less energy and is eco friendly for potential full scale implementation graphical abstract image 10259 keywords rapid aerobic granulation integrated oxidation ditch with two zone clarifiers disposed surplus sludge selection pressure low concentration of domestic sewage 1 introduction the aerobic granular sludge ags process has been regarded as an emerging biotechnological approach for wastewater treatment due to its advantages over the conventional activated sludge system such as its better subsidence performance denser aggregate structure higher biomass concentration and ability to treat wastewater containing toxic substrates in only one aerobic reactor adav et al 2008a amorim et al 2014 bumbac et al 2015 although ags processes were first reported in a continuous upflow aerobic sludge blanket bioreactor mishima and nakamura 1991 the technology was developed mainly in column type sequencing batch reactors sbrs that are easily controlled to produce the ideal conditions for aerobic granulation such as the succession of feast famine conditions isanta et al 2012 high hydraulic shear forces show et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 and excellent sludge screening effects liu and tay 2004 as a result granular sbrs have been successfully used to treat various kinds of effluents at the lab scale wagner and da costa 2013 jungles et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 huang et al 2015 currently there are several pilot and full scale applications of this technology for municipal wastewater treatment giesen et al 2013 li et al 2014a pronk et al 2015 yang et al 2016 nevertheless most current large scale wastewater operations use continuous flow systems and it will be much simpler to directly implement ags in the existing infrastructure than to convert current operations to batch operations therefore it is more practically significant to study ags in cfrs cfrs have weak mass transfer impetuses low hydraulic shear forces and poor sludge screening mechanisms which causes difficulty in achieving granulation in addition any ags formed could be destroyed by the return sludge pumps which is why ags has not been established in traditional activated sludge processes for a hundred years although there are few studies on ags cultivation in cfrs at present an increasing number of researchers have begun to study this idea and have achieved aerobic sludge granulation by different strategies it is relatively common and efficient to separate sludge and water via three phase separators to achieve aerobic sludge granulation zhou et al 2014 cultivated ags with an average particle size of 0 51 mm in an airlift bioreactor alr by means of a three phase separator with a high hydrodynamic shear force yang et al 2014 carried out inoculation with a biofilm and cultivated ags with particle sizes of 0 6 0 9 mm in an alr by using a three phase separator and high dissolved oxygen do method the introduction of a settling velocity based selection pressure could generate ags in cfrs which is an extremely effective design strategy morales et al 2012 designed the continuous stirred tank reactor cstr to achieve granulation by sludge screening with a settling velocity of ags that is significantly greater than that of activated sludge li et al 2014b 2015 cultivated ags in a modified oxidation ditch with an adjustable volume intraclarifier for settling large particles and in a reverse flow baffled reactor rfbr by using feast famine conditions and selective settling pressure some cfrs function using selection pressures created by different sizes to cultivate ags liu et al 2014a studied the stability of ags in a continuous flow self forming dynamic membrane bioreactor sfdmbr and successfully cultivated ags by gradually increasing the aperture from 0 1 mm to 1 0 mm of sieves in the sludge selection tank membrane units that squeeze water from sludge can also be used in place of separators sajjad et al 2016 cultivated ags with an average particle size of 0 625 mm by inoculating aerobic granules and installing an internal settling tank in mbr corsino et al 2016 cultivated ags by creating feast famine conditions and ensuring high hydraulic shear forces in a granular continuous flow membrane bioreactor gcfmbr and studied the reactor stability according to the literature review the configurations of various cfrs are endless but there has been little success in mainstream treatment technology for wastewater treatment plants wwtps such as anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o technology anaerobic aerobic a o technology oxidation ditches etc li et al 2014b the main reasons for the low success rate are the weak sludge selection pressure of the actual wwtps and the mechanical sludge reflux pump being prone to breaking the formed aerobic granules therefore this problem can be solved effectively by introducing settling velocity based selection pressures into cfrs and using two zone clarifiers to eliminate the sludge reflux system recently reported findings provided a reliable approach to promote the formation of ags by using a two zone sedimentation tank zou et al 2018 however an airlift system was applied to return the sludge and these studies were performed in only a single aerobic tank conventional wwtps rarely use airlift pumps for sludge refluxing and oxidation ditches are the most widely used technology in the wwtps of china jin et al 2014 there have also been thousands of wwtps with oxidation ditch processes implemented in the united states and in europe wef 1998 us epa 2000 thus a simple and effective solid liquid separation method is needed and the feasibility of ags formation in oxidation ditch processes also needs further investigation most studies use artificial wastewater as the substrate and in this situation the formation of ags will take 20 40 days however if real wastewater is used the granulation process requires a longer time therefore the reduction of the start up time has become one of the main factors restricting the development of continuous flow ags technology a large number of studies about sbrs have shown that there are three main modes for the fast cultivation of ags namely the addition of metal ions such as ca2 mg2 etc into the feed water liu et al 2010 pijuan et al 2011 long et al 2016 dosing with inert carriers or a portion of ags sajjad and kim 2015 wan et al 2015 and inoculation with special strains jiang et al 2006 ivanov et al 2008 these methods of rapid cultivation are mainly concentrated on the sludge conditioning occurring inside the reactor a new effective method of accelerating the formation of aggregates can be formulated by adding metal ions to part of the surplus sludge air drying the sludge naturally and then returning the sludge to the reactor to achieve rapid granulation on one hand the adverse conditions created through external conditioning methods can improve the stability of sludge colloids stimulate the secretion of a large number of eps by microorganisms and complete the bridge bonding effect on the other hand the small particles formed in the reactor by the disposed and dewatered sludge can be used as induction nuclei to promote granulation in addition cultivating ags in cfrs using real and low concentrations of domestic sewage is still rarely reported zou et al 2018 therefore this study attempted to develop a novel method for the rapid granulation of ags by the process of external sludge treatment and return in a continuous flow integrated oxidation ditch with two zone clarifiers to treat real low concentrations of domestic sewage the aerobic granulation process was investigated by monitoring the sludge characteristics and activity microbial community and pollutant removal which allowed the evaluation of the effectiveness of this approach and revealed the mechanism of rapid granulation in the reactor the results of this study will help promote new ideas for practical engineering applications for the continuity of ags 2 methods and materials 2 1 wastewater and seed sludge the low concentrations of domestic sewage used in this study were taken from underground sewage inspection wells in a residential district in zhejiang china the water quality fluctuates greatly at this location the main parameters of the real wastewater were as follows chemical oxygen demand codcr 200 400 mg l total nitrogen tn 30 45 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 10 20 mg l total phosphorus tp 1 4 mg l and ph 6 8 7 6 the inoculated sludge was taken from the dewatered sludge with a water content of approximately 80 of a wwtp located in zhejiang china after removing filamentous and large particles through a 100 mesh sieve the inoculated sludge was sent to the reactor to restore the activity of the sludge it was allowed to undergo continuous aeration in the reactor for 3 days in which the initial sludge concentration of mixed liquid suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were 3067 mg l and 1490 mg l respectively and the sludge volume index at 5 min svi5 was 97 9 ml g 2 2 reactor and operation this study introduced selective pressure based on the settling velocity into the solid liquid separation to design an integrated oxidation ditch with two zone clarifiers which was used to cultivate ags as shown in fig 1 this separation always retained the heavy sludge in the reactor and washed away the light sludge the reactor had a total length of 1 68 m a width of 0 22 m 0 11 m width of each single ditch an effective water depth of 0 4 m and an effective volume of approximately 140 l it mainly included an aeration zone and two identical clarifier zones the first zone and second zone of the clarifier were denoted by clarifier 1 and clarifier 2 respectively and rotating mixing plates were used at both ends to circulate the mixture microporous aerated sand heads were uniformly arranged in the aeration zone to supply gas at the bottom with an airflow rate of 0 2 m3 h and the temperature during the whole experiment was in the range of 25 5 c inclined plates were placed at an angle of 60 under the liquid surface to include two clarifier zones each with an area of 242 cm2 and a settling time of 0 7 h the bottom of clarifier 1 was not closed set as an outlet with a width of 1 5 cm and the discharge pipe was connected outside clarifier 2 the effluent was discharged from the serrated overflow weir after settling in clarifier 2 a movable baffle was inserted midway between clarifier 1 and the aerated sand head nearby which not only guaranteed the stability of the flow state in the clarification zone but also created different selection pressures associated with the settling time the selection pressure was weakened by increasing the height of baffle relative to the liquid level the baffle was inserted 0 1 m below the liquid level at the start of the reactor operation 0 d to create a relatively high selection pressure the aeration zone was filled with wastewater flow rate 110 ml min by a peristaltic pump and the hydraulic retention time was controlled at approximately 16 h the organic loading rate olr was 0 27 0 53 kg m3 d during the experiment water samples of the influent and effluent were collected from the influent tank and effluent pipe respectively sludge samples from the aeration zone were collected by a siphon in the middle of the aeration zone at 4 h after returning the sludge from external treatment to obtain sludge samples from the clarifiers equal volume sludge samples from the surface layer middle layer and bottom layer of the sludge blanket were collected by a siphon and then they were completely mixed to produce the representative sludge samples 2 3 sludge external treatment and return method as seen in fig 1 the partial sludge floc discharged from clarifier 2 was collected by a gauze accumulator every day after the reactor was operated the sludge was conditioned and dewatered by adding 0 1 g calcium chloride cacl2 per gram of dry sludge as this dosage can highly improve the dewatering performance of the sludge kavitha et al 2015 and air dried naturally for 72 4 h then the disposed and dewatered sludge moisture content was 60 5 was placed in a glass container to obtain as many micro aggregates as possible after adding an appropriate amount of water an electric agitator was used to smash the sludge slowly for 1 2 min after discarding the upper flocs the crushed sludge was separated using a 4 mm sieve and sludge aggregates that were below 4 mm in size were used as the final product and returned to the aeration zone 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 analysis of the sludge properties and water quality the morphology of the aerobic granules was observed under an optical microscope cx31 olympus japan and the sizes of the aerobic granules were determined by image pro plus analysis 6 0 olympus soft imaging solution the codcr nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn suspended solids ss mlss mlvss and svi5 were measured according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2012 2 4 2 analysis of the sludge biological activity the specific oxygen uptake rate sour of the sludge was determined using the method described by wang et al 2009 dehydrogenase activity was determined by the ttc method ryssov nielsen 1975 2 4 3 eps extraction and analysis the formaldehyde sodium hydroxide method was used to extract eps from sludge liu and fang 2002 in this study the total amount of eps was the sum of the protein pn and polysaccharide ps contents the concentration of pn was determined by using coomassie brilliant blue g 250 with bovine serum albumin bsa as the standard frolund et al 1995 and the concentration of ps was determined by the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose solution as the standard dubois et al 1956 2 4 4 analysis of the sludge microbial community to explore the dynamics of the microbial community during the whole experimental period high throughput illumina miseq sequencing for sludge samples ags0 ags18 ags27 ags40 ags60 and ags80 digital representation of the reactor operation days from the aeration zone was conducted at zhejiang tianke hi tech inc hangzhou china the microbial dna in the sludge samples was extracted using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio usa according to the manufacturer s protocols a nanodrop2000 fluorospectrometer thermo scientific usa was used to quantify the samples and the dna quality was detected on a 1 w w agarose gel subsequently the v3 and v4 regions of the 16s rdna sequences of bacteria were amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr with the primers 341f 5 cctacgnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvggtatctaatcc 3 hugerth et al 2014 the pcr amplification was performed in triplicate in a 30 μl mixture containing 15 μl of 2 phusion master mix 1 5 μl of each prime 2 μmol l 10 μl of template dna 1 ng μl and 2 μl of h2o the thermal programme was as follows pre denaturation at 94 c for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation 94 c for 30 s annealing 45 c for 20 s extension 72 c for 30 s and a final extension at 72 c for 5 min the pcr products of the sample were sequenced by using the illumina miseq platform miseq pe300 illumina usa the original data generated by sequencing were filtered spliced and the chimaeras were removed by flash and qiime to obtain effective tags operational taxonomic units otus were clustered with a 97 identity threshold using uparse and then the rdp classifier version 11 4 method and silva database were used for species annotation analysis the bacterial diversity and community composition were analysed on this basis 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of the sludge characteristics in the early stage 0 3 days of reactor operation the sludge was in the form of irregular small particles and flocs fig 2 a with the particle size distribution psd mainly concentrated within 0 0 5 mm fig 2d accounting for 87 7 the average particle size was 0 28 mm and the mean settling velocity was 21 9 m h as shown in fig 3 a the mlss dropped to 2822 mg l and the svi5 increased to 108 0 ml g on day 3 the ss of the effluent was also high at 376 mg l although a certain amount of conditioned sludge aggregates was returned daily from day 3 onward the mlss did not increase significantly because only a small amount of the returned sludge aggregates finally stayed in the reactor under the joint action of the shear force and dual zone selection pressure furthermore it took time for the returned sludge aggregates to adapt to the new environment before they could grow and reproduce returning the sludge aggregates daily is a strategy that promptly discharges the suspended growth sludge with poor settleability and provides a good environment for adherent growth sludge the flocculent sludge in the reactor gradually decreased while the granular sludge gradually increased which effectively stopped the increasing trend of the svi5 the svi5 began to gradually decrease and dropped to 56 6 ml g on day 18 at this moment ags with relatively regular and complete shape appeared in the aeration zone fig 2b and the average particle size of the granules increased significantly to 0 37 mm with a mean settling velocity of 37 8 m h fig 2d the psd 0 2 mm decreased from 62 9 day 0 to 36 2 while those at 0 2 0 5 mm and 0 5 1 0 mm increased from 24 8 day 0 and 6 1 day 0 to 39 6 and 12 8 respectively as described by tiwari et al 2005 and bhunia and ghangrekar 2007 when more than half of the particle sizes were larger than 0 34 mm the aerobic granulation of sludge was realized afterwards the svi5 continued to decrease with slight fluctuations and after 51 days of continuous operation the value stabilized below 40 0 ml g the mlss in the reactor also slightly increased at this stage and reached 3611 mg l on day 51 after which it was maintained at approximately 3500 mg l until the end of the experiment compared with the results of zou et al 2018 who used only a two zone sedimentation tank to create the selection pressure and obtained an mlss that continuously dropped from 3000 mg l to 700 mg l during the first 17 days before gradually recovering to 2800 mg l on day 30 the present results indicated that returning the conditioned sludge aggregates can effectively reduce sludge loss and increase the sludge concentration in the reactor the effluent ss was also essentially stabilized below 100 mg l during this period as the operation proceeded denser and more rounded granular sludge appeared in the reactor fig 2c and the particle size also gradually increased on day 80 of operation the average particle size of the granules reached 0 66 mm with a mean settling velocity of 43 2 m h fig 2d compared with day 18 the psd 0 2 mm and 0 2 0 5 mm decreased to 20 8 and 26 3 while those at 0 5 1 0 mm and 1 0 1 5 mm increased to 29 6 and 12 3 and a large amount of small granular sludge appeared in clarifier 2 the ratio of mlvss mlss increased from 47 06 to 53 34 during the first 3 day as microbes began to adapt to the environment and grow the ratio continued to increase to 56 28 on day 6 indicating that the growth rate of the sludge retained in the reactor was relatively high however with the continuous development of the aerobic granulation of sludge the relatively low organic loading in this study caused slowing of the growth of microbes and the concentration of ca2 in the sludge increased constantly the mlvss mlss ratio was 48 99 49 12 and 49 04 on day 72 day 76 and day 80 respectively which remained stable until the end of the experiment the result was consistent with that of previous study reported by zou et al 2018 who also cultured ags under a low organic load 0 16 0 05 kg m3 d and added micro powder continuously to promote granulation from day 32 to day 72 which produced a slightly decreased mlvss mlss ratio compared with that in the initial stage 3 2 variation of the sludge biological activity sour is an important indicator used to evaluate the microbial metabolic activity of sludge similarly since the oxidation of many organics in organisms is mostly realized by dehydrogenation the dehydrogenase activity of a sludge mixture represents the ability of the microbes themselves to adapt to the external environment and it can also directly reflect the activity of the microbes wang et al 2016 according to fig 3b the trends of the sour and dehydrogenase activity were essentially the same during the process of granulation although the reactor was operated after continuous aeration for 3 days to reactivate the inoculated dehydrated sludge the initial sludge bioactivity in the reactor was still poor after 2 days of reactor operation the sour and dehydrogenase activity were 18 9 mg o2 g mlvss h and 7 97 mg g mlvss respectively however with the continuous operation of the reactor the sludge activity rapidly improved without being affected by the daily return of a certain amount of conditioned sludge aggregates as shown in fig 3d the sour of the returned conditioned sludge aggregates was only 8 0 mg o2 g mlvss h 72 h after 37 days of operation the sour and dehydrogenase activity increased to the maxima which were 46 1 mgo2 g mlvss h and 23 71 mg g mlvss respectively and then became steady this result implies that in addition to the conditioned sludge aggregates that were returned daily accelerating aerobic granulation by acting as nuclei they were also undergoing a transformation from physical aggregates to mature ags as there was a huge difference in the corresponding biological activity liu et al 2015 noted that the sour of granules decreased from 61 to 23 mg o2 g mlss h and attributed this change to the excessive precipitation of caco3 however such extreme precipitation was not observed in our case in addition the sour of activated sludge is usually 8 20 mg o2 g mlvss h wang et al 2012 the biological activity of the ags formed in this study was greatly improved and indirectly showed that its use was advantageous for the treatment capacity 3 3 variation of the eps component eps is one type of metabolic product that accumulates on the surfaces of bacterial cells it is mainly composed of ps and pn the content and proportion of which have an important influence on the formation and stability of ags tay et al 2001 as shown in fig 3c the eps decreased during the first 9 days as the ps decreased from 58 91 mg g mlvss to 46 71 mg g mlvss and the pn decreased from 68 42 mg g mlvss to 55 32 mg g mlvss this indicated that the relatively low olr led to a lack of nutrients in the initial sludge and that eps may have been consumed by microbes as a carbon source subsequently eps increased from day 9 to day 30 and reached a maximum value of 150 15 mg g mlvss thereafter the eps decreased in fluctuations and finally decreased to 52 17 mg g mlvss after 79 days of operation this phenomenon might be attributed to the fact that the skeleton structure and particle size of ags were relatively stable after formation which is consistent with the results observed in a number of studies showing that eps increased significantly during the granulation process but decreased slightly during the mature period mcswain et al 2005 adav et al 2008b the increase of the pn ps ratio is favourable to granulation because pn is hydrophobic and ps is hydrophilic in this study pn ps increased from the beginning of reactor operation and reached the maximum value of 2 78 on day 23 research has shown that pn in eps can improve the hydrophobicity and sedimentation ability of cells the increase of the pn content benefits the formation and stabilization of ags liu et al 2014b in this study the pn increased sharply from 55 32 mg g mlvss on day 9 99 05 mg g mlvss on day 30 while the ps during this period basically remained unchanged indicating that pn played a leading role in aerobic granulation which is also consistent with the findings of mcswain et al 2005 during conditioning which involves adding cacl2 and natural drying for 72 4 h of the light flocculent sludge discharged from clarifier 2 on day 9 the aggregates not only changed significantly in morphology loose irregular structure but also were enlarged in particle size with psd 1 0 mm 1 0 2 0 mm and 2 0 4 0 mm values of 24 7 33 6 and 41 7 the average particle size of 1 93 mm while before treatment the psd values at 0 2 mm 0 2 0 5 mm and 0 5 mm were 86 7 10 1 and 3 2 with an average particle size of 0 11 mm in addition the sour and eps also changed dramatically as shown in fig 3d the sour decreased sharply from 23 0 mg o2 g mlvss h 0 h to 11 6 mg o2 g mlvss h 36 h and then gradually dropped to 7 7 mg o2 g mlvss h 72 h the decrease in the sludge bioactivity indicated that no nutrients were provided and that a relatively hostile environment was created for microbes thus the community composition of the microbes changed the eps decreased from 94 18 mg g mlvss 0 h to 65 33 mg g mlvss 24 h during this period the pn decreased from 49 53 mg g mlvss 0 h to 40 20 mg g mlvss 24 h while the ps sharply decreased from 44 65 mg g mlvss 0 h to 25 13 mg g mlvss 24 h indicating a lack of nutrition in the environment accordingly eps mainly ps were consumed by microbes as a carbon source afterwards the eps increased rapidly from 65 33 mg g mlvss 24 h to 107 13 mg g mlvss 72 h indicating that the microbes retained by the selected pressure secreted more eps to protect themselves this was consistent with the study of sheng et al 2010 who observed that de watering and non nutritive environments cause microorganisms to secrete greater amounts of eps for self protection throughout the whole process pn ps showed an upward trend that was conducive to granulation thus the conditioned sludge could effectively accelerate the aerobic granulation in the reactor upon its return 3 4 pollutant removal performance since this study treated actual low concentrations of domestic sewage the influent cod and tn values fluctuated greatly between 200 and 400 mg l and 30 45 mg l respectively resulting in a certain fluctuation of the effluent tn was mainly composed of nh4 n and organic nitrogen almost no no2 n and no3 n were detected in the influent the performance in each type of pollutant removal is shown in fig 4 the cod removal rate in the first 4 days was 77 13 83 32 with the continuous and stable operation of the reactor the effluent cod was basically below 50 mg l and the removal rate of cod was 83 23 93 03 indicating that the aerobic granulation of sludge helped improve the treatment capacity which is consistent with the previous studies reported by zhang et al 2016 and zou et al 2018 the olr had a greater influence on the physiological properties and stability of the ags peyong et al 2012 it is worth noting that the olr in this study was 0 27 0 53 kg m3 d which was lower than the conventional ags culture conditions in the range of 1 5 15 kg m3 d moy et al 2002 liu et al 2003 and it was even lower than that of the ags cultivated by ni et al 2009 in low strength municipal wastewater 0 6 1 0 kg m3 d this indicates that the formation of ags is not directly correlated with the olr this result is not consistent with that of chen et al 2016 who speculated that aerobic granules should be maintained at much higher olrs e g 31 3 kg m3 d and with a good cod removal performance the increase of the olr may accelerate the growth of bacteria and increase the particle size gao et al 2011 as shown by liu et al 2003 when the olr was increased from 3 kg m3 d to 9 kg m3 d the average particle size of the ags increased by 0 3 mm this study was conducted under low olr conditions and the growth of microbes was slow resulting in small particle sizes of the ags during the whole experimental period the removal rate of nh4 n was 85 13 100 and the effluent nh4 n was stable below 3 mg l which is consistent with previously results in which aerobic granulation cfrs have achieved nh4 n removal through ammonia oxidation at efficiencies 90 li et al 2014c hou et al 2017 even approaching 100 removal in some cases jin et al 2008 li et al 2015 in addition the daily operation mode of the returning conditioned sludge aggregates had no actual influence on the effects of reactor operation which can also be explained by the biological activity of the sludge in fig 3b however tn removal depends on the operating conditions and the reactor in this study was operated with continuous aeration rather than anaerobic aerobic cycling which was the main reason for the low removal efficiency of tn the average tn removal efficiency was 12 4 3 1 during the first 18 days and then it increased to 22 0 2 9 with no no2 n but a large amount of no3 n detected in the effluent the certain improvement of the tn removal efficiency should be mainly attributed to the enhancement of simultaneous nitrification denitrfication snd in the aeration previous studies showed that the snd efficiency is largely dependent on the anoxic zones in the granules coma et al 2012 zou et al 2019 the small particle size of granules in this case the average particle size was 0 66 mm on day 80 impeded denitrification because it allowed for the penetration of do deep into the granule preventing the formation of an anoxic core in which denitrifiers can grow these findings were also confirmed by jin et al 2008 who produced larger sizes of granules 47 granules had a diameter 1 5 mm after 75 days that allowed an anoxic centre zone to become established 3 5 microbial community characterization the high throughput sequencing yielded high quality and effective reads from different days during the operation of the reactor all with 98 coverage including 38041 ags0 37015 ags18 37656 ags27 36543 ags40 33111 ags60 and 32253 ags80 this shows that the collected gene sequences can well represent the true distribution of sludge microorganisms the shannon value can describe the diversity of a microbial community the values of the samples were 8 37 ags0 8 33 ags18 7 89 ags27 7 73 ags40 7 47 ags60 and 7 45 ags80 which indicated that the microbial diversity in the ags was lower than that in the initial sludge this is consistent with the results of weissbrodt et al 2012 who showed that the microbial diversity of the initial flocculent sludge will be greatly reduced compared with that in the formation stage of ags and the diversity of bacteria in ags will decrease with the increase of the aerobic particle size the coexisting otus of ags18 ags27 ags40 ags60 and ags80 with ags0 were 1061 1009 972 924 and 897 respectively in addition the results of the cluster dendrogram based on the otu level showed that ags80 and ags0 were the most remote in the cluster fig 5 a indicating that the microbial communities had changed significantly in the process of granulation which was consistent with the results of previous studies reported by lv et al 2014 and zou et al 2019 as shown in fig 5a proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant and second most dominant phyla respectively in the six samples of ags0 ags18 ags27 ags40 ags60 and ags80 and their relative abundance accounted for 39 79 and 23 63 45 66 and 24 07 53 10 and 20 90 48 72 and 20 70 48 46 and 24 78 and 47 12 and 30 04 respectively this is consistent with the results of several scholars who found that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes are the predominant phyla in ags and activated sludge zhang et al 2012 zou et al 2019 and these phyla include a large number of important functional bacteria for the removal of organics nogueira et al 2002 in the process of granulation the relative abundance of proteobacteria was in a stable state before it greatly increased fig 5a this is consistent with the fact that the relative abundance of proteobacteria increases during the formation of ags which was found by seviour et al 2011 and it has been speculated that proteobacteria play an important role in granular sludge in addition as proteobacteria play an important part in the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles liu et al 2017 which indirectly shows that aerobic granulation was helpful for improving the treatment capacity of pollutants other phyla with lower relative abundance such as chloroflex 4 85 9 22 planctomycete 2 15 5 81 verrucomicrobia 2 14 4 04 and firmicutes 0 54 2 40 were also observed in ags reactors in previous studies zhang et al 2012 zou et al 2018 2019 it is worth noting that the relative abundance of actinobacteria continued to decline from 3 33 ags0 to 0 93 ags80 during granulation according to the research of seviour et al 2008 actinobacteria was correlated with the filamentous bulking of sludge indicating that the selective pressure produced by the two zone clarifiers had a great influence on this phylum at the genus level the top 10 species of each sample were selected to produce a cumulative cylindrical map of relative abundance as shown in fig 5b zoogloea is a flocculent bacterium that promotes eps secretion and binds cells together which is often found in ags treatment systems xia et al 2018 ren et al 2018 zou et al 2019 with the continuous operation of the reactor the relative abundances of zoogloea were 0 52 ags0 1 54 ags18 1 72 ags27 2 37 ags40 2 71 ags60 and 2 89 ags80 similarly rhodobacter showed almost the same growth pattern with the relative abundance increasing from 0 35 ags0 to 2 82 ags80 a large number of studies have shown that rhodobacter is the main microorganism that functions as a stabilizer in ags show et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 these results showed that the selective pressure generated by the two zone clarifiers can select more microorganisms related to eps secretion and the stabilization of aerobic granules thus promoting the rapid granulation of ags particular species that improve granule stability include flavobacteria zhou et al 2014 which is a widely reported genus that can characterize the maturity of granular sludge li et al 2008 in research on calcium precipitation induced aerobic granulation flavobacterium was found to attach to the core of sludge and promote eps through the expression of related genes wan et al 2015 in this study the relative abundance of flavobacterium increased from 0 27 ags0 to 2 75 ags80 which was related to the operation mode of the partial sludge floc discharged from clarifier 2 that was conditioned and dewatered by cacl2 and then returned to the reactor the increase of flavobacterium effectively promoted rapid granulation in the reactor thiothrix is a common filamentous bacterium li et al 2014 that was found in this study the relative abundance in ags0 was only 0 004 but fluctuated between 1 and 2 in ags18 to ags80 therefore the increase in the abundances of thiothrix during the granulation process suggested that filamentous bacteria may play an important role in sludge granulation similar findings were also reported by other researchers xia et al 2018 ordinary heterotrophic organisms including hydrogenophaga flavobacterium and planctomyces which function as organic removal bacteria showed an increasing tendency during the granulation process supporting the conclusion that the removal effect of carbon sources was improved through the process of granulation for n removal thiothrix zoogloea hyphomicrobium and dechloromonas were the dominant denitrifying bacteria in the reactor chen et al 2016 rubio rincón et al 2017 pishgar et al 2019 the abundance of each increased from 0 004 0 52 0 71 and 0 82 in ags0 to 1 99 2 89 2 30 and 2 56 in ags80 respectively these results confirmed that snd can be promoted during granulation which is closely related to the n removal capacity of the reactor non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds is a kind of sorting method suitable for ecological research that can reflect the degrees of sample differences according to the distances between points the nmds analysis of the otus of each sample points is shown in fig 5c in which nmds1 and nmds2 showed the two most significant differences ags0 and ags18 were far apart due to the selective pressures generated by the two zone clarifiers which made the sludge with good sedimentation performance remain in the reactor flocculating and agglomerating microbial communities in sludge are retained and continue to propagate and poorly settling flocs discharge as surplus sludge furthermore the cacl2 conditioning air drying returning mode of some floc surplus sludge created a relatively harsh environment for microorganisms and changed the abundance and composition under the continuous promotion of two such biological selective pressures the microbial community composition changed significantly and the sludge in the reactor transformed from the initial flocculent into granules with the formation of ags the gaps between other sample points such as those between ags18 and ags27 or ags40 and ags60 gradually narrowed this is consistent with the results of the cluster dendrogram in fig 5a indicating that the ags bacterial community composition changed slightly during the process of granule size growth compared with the ags formation process it is worth noting that ags0 and ags80 were the farthest apart which again proves that the microbial community experienced tremendous changes throughout the whole aerobic granulation process 3 6 mechanism analysis of the effect of returning disposed surplus sludge on accelerating aerobic sludge granulation the specific path for returning disposed surplus sludge to promote the rapid granulation of ags is shown in fig 6 in the processes of conditioning by adding cacl2 and natural drying of the light flocculent sludge discharged from clarifier 2 the eps rose from 94 18 mg g mlvss 0 h to 107 13 mg g mlvss 72 h the increased eps content could act as a bridge between microbes and promote bacteria bacteria and bacteria solid adhesion to promote cohesiveness liu et al 2014a caudan et al 2014 meanwhile sludge dewatering and drying greatly reduced the distances between microbes and might have significantly enhanced the material transfer process ca2 could neutralize the negative charge on the surface of eps compress the electrical double layer and reduce the hydration shell which would improve the effective collision and further promote the secretion of eps sajjad et al 2016 in this study under the bridging effect of eps ca2 eps the flocculent sludge can gather to form large aggregates that can be broken into small aggregates and granular sludge with certain strength and morphological activities the externally disposed small aggregates and granular sludge were returned to the reactor the returned sludge absorbed water and became larger and the increase in the moisture content caused the decrease of the sludge strength meanwhile under the effect of hydraulic shear forces the small aggregates with structures that were not compact or dense enough were broken down into large granules small granules and light flocs the large granules with good sedimentation performance always stayed in the aeration zone and the microorganisms that gradually adapted to the new environment and resumed activity experienced a transformation from physical granular sludge to mature ags which is consistent with the results of pijuan et al 2011 and long et al 2014 this was also shown in fig 3b due to the selection pressure created by the two zone clarifiers the small granules with good settleability settling in clarifier 1 that stayed in the reactor can act as nuclei for the microbes that gradually gathered and grew on their surfaces under the joint action of the cell hydrophobicity eps adsorption bridging and hydraulic shear force the granule morphology tended to become regular and the structure became more compact finally forming stable and mature ags the light flocs with poor settleability were discharged from the reactor under selective pressure settling in clarifier 2 and disposed by artificially creating unfavourable conditions that stimulated microorganisms to secrete large amounts of eps to induce microbial aggregation then this surplus sludge was returned to the reactor again until granulation was achieved moreover some microbes related to eps secretion and stabilization of the granules were enriched under the novel operation mode another benefit of using this novel approach was also concerned sludge dewatering being of great importance in sludge treatment and disposal on one hand the use of cacl2 as an inorganic agent commonly added in sludge dehydration in this study is also conducive to the subsequent treatment and disposal of sludge it was reported that sludge dewaterability was successfully and economically improved in cacl2 solution as ca2 could interact with the proteins phenols and o h functional group in the flocs guan et al 2012 on the other hand partial residual sludge was returned to the reactor to achieve sludge reduction which is expected to cut down a significant amount of energy use in practice 4 conclusion the rapid granulation of aerobic sludge in an integrated oxidation ditch with two zone clarifiers was realized by using a novel mode of external sludge treatment and a returning method to treat low concentrations of actual domestic sewage the two zone clarifiers created selection pressure in the reactor to retain small granules with good sedimentation performance while the light flocs with poor settleability can be discharged as surplus sludge under the external conditioning of cacl2 and natural air drying the discharged flocs can stimulate microorganisms to secrete large amounts of eps to then be returned to the reactor to form a large number of small granules which induced bacterial attachment by acting as nuclei during the whole process of aerobic granulation the biological activity of the sludge was greatly improved the eps and microbial community changed significantly microbes with the function of eps secretion were enriched and granulation was helpful for improving the treatment capacity of pollutants furthermore the method developed in this study required less energy and is eco friendly for potential full scale implementation declaration of

18037,co infection with multiple pathogens especially the spread of giardia and cryptosporidium in source water among those with immunodeficiency is common worldwide which will result in an increase in overall risk in this study the quantitative microbial risk assessment model was used to estimate the cumulative risk of co infection with giardia and cryptosporidium promoted by hiv considering age sensitivity the sensitivity of population segments with different ages was estimated by the optimization method based on clinical data of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis with age structure the factors of co infection enhancement were used to quantify hiv synergism with the action of other pathogens the removal rates of giardia and cryptosporidium through water treatment were estimated by a model involving turbidity and particles the results showed that children 0 4 years were 17 911 fold more sensitive to infection with giardia than adults 15 64 years and that with cryptosporidium was 10 592 fold removal rates of these parasites in water treatment plants in major cities in china were estimated to be 2 03 log10 considering the hiv synergistic and age susceptibility effects the cumulative risk of exposure to giardia or cryptosporidium was about 38 781 10 6 dalys disability adjusted life years per person per year which was much higher than the reference risk level recommended by the world health organization 10 6 dalys the methodology and results of this study will be useful in better evaluating and reducing the burden due to infection of giardia and or cryptosporidium in china and other countries graphical abstract image 1 keywords giardia cryptosporidium co infection risk assessment age sensitivity synergistic effects removal rates 1 introduction worldwide about two billion cases of diarrhea occur every year with 499 000 deaths in 2015 ibrahim khalil 2018 the clearly evidenced pathogens for these illnesses include giardia and cryptosporidium globally an estimated 200 million people were infected with giardia certad et al 2017 and 44 8 million children had diarrhea due to cryptosporidium infection in 2016 ibrahim khalil 2018 which was one of the three aetiologies responsible for deaths in children younger than 5 years ibrahim khalil 2018 research shows that co infection is much more fatal to humans than a single infection where the death rate due to co infection in some developing countries is estimated to be one fifth to one third eisenstein et al 2008 rodríguez morales et al 2016 especially for those with hiv houpt et al 2005 liu et al 2014 it should be noted that the immunodeficiency population infected by hiv was up to 36 7 million at the end of 2016 unaids 2018 with an annual growth rate of 840 000 globally ritchie 2018 ignoring the effects of pathogenic co infection with hiv will result in health risk underestimation for giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis considering that giardia and cryptosporidium share the same invasive hosts and spreading routes the cumulative risk assessment of the population exposed to multiple pathogen co infection will give a more explicit health risk profile which will guide regulatory decision making on stricter control rules and strategies in the face of limited public resources there has been some research on waterborne pathogenic co infection focusing on the potency of giardia or cryptosporidium in immunodeficient people their oo cysts are more likely to be found in feces of the immunodeficient feitosa et al 2001 nkenfou et al 2013 while hiv spreads faster in patients with giardiasis or cryptosporidiosis bentwich et al 1995 the focus of this mechanism is on the description of the synergy between pathogens several models have been proposed to handle this problem an and chappell applied immunoglobulin g igg as an index to characterize the status of the immune system which was embedded into the dose response function to describe the co infection potency of cryptosporidium and hiv an et al 2011 chappell et al 1999 however it is very hard to obtain sufficient data on igg for use in risk assessment because of the complexity and expense of the detection methods sugiura et al 2001 another candidate method proposed by robinson is to define a factor to represent the degree of enhancement by hiv in pathogenic co infection robinson et al 1987 which can be estimated from clinical data feitosa et al 2001 tellevik et al 2015 yang et al 2017b on the other hand it is also necessary to refine the dose effect relationship for accurate evaluation of co infection in an experiment involving swallowing giardia or cryptosporidium in humans the sensitivity differences of the elderly and children to pathogenic microbial infections has been ignored and only adults were selected as volunteers due to legal and ethical constraints which will underestimate the health risks of the entire age population dupont et al 1995 okhuysen et al 1999 in fact age based infectivity sensitivity can be estimated based on the clinical data of giardiasis or cryptosporidiosis using age sensitivity coefficients which will increase the potency of pathogenic microbial infections in the elderly and children relative to adults what s more the removal rates of giardia or cryptosporidium are also critical for quantification of the qmra quantitative microbial risk assessment during the exposure assessment process which are estimated by particle count in the treatment process but this parameter may have been overestimated in previous studies lechevallier et al who as well as xiao et al pointed out that the recommended removal rate of giardia or cryptosporidium used in most studies is 2 2 5 log10 in conventional treatment while 4 4 5 log10 for advanced treatments lechevallier et al 1991 who 2009 xiao et al 2012b in fact its fluctuation can be up to 0 7 1 1 log10 in implementation of the experiments yasui et al 2016 which can lead to considerable uncertainty in qmra up to now this key parameter has been lacking essential statistical survey data or confirmation from chinese water plants fortunately fan morse et al provide a valid method of estimating the removal of pathogens from the changes in turbidity between raw and output water in drinking water plants fan et al 2014 morse et al 2002 swertfeger et al 1999 where the pathogens are regarded as particles in the water globally the immunodeficiency population infected by hiv was up to 36 7 million at the end of 2016 unaids 2018 with an annual growth rate of 840 000 ritchie 2018 of which over 400 000 chinese people had been infected with hiv cdc 2016 feng and xiao 2011 nhfpc 2015 according to recent large scale water quality surveys the concentrations of giardia and cryptosporidium in china are sometimes higher than those of the cities of pittsburgh and milwaukee when major infections broke out cummins et al 2010 rose et al 1991a who 2009 more than 40 million people have been suffering from diarrhea therefore it is necessary to conduct an in depth analysis of the cumulative risk of giardia and cryptosporidium co infection according to the concept of age sensitivity and hiv synergy in comparison with previous studies on risk assessment of co infection by pathogens this study has the following special considerations 1 quantitative description of the differences in susceptibility to giardia and cryptosporidium infection of different ages based on epidemiological survey data with the method of total population balance 2 consideration of the synergistic enhancement of hiv co infection with pathogens 3 estimation of the removal rates of giardia and cryptosporidium during the operation of the main water plants in key cities in china this study attempts to provide a more accurate method for estimating the cumulative risk of pathogen co infections to compensate for the neglect of age sensitivity and synergistic effects in previous studies in order to develop stricter treatment rules 2 materials and methods 2 1 framework for estimating the health risk of co infection to account for co infection in risk assessment a conceptual framework is developed on co infection of giardia cryptosporidium with hiv based on the classical qmra process fig s1 which can be divided into three parts i co infectivity estimation ii multiple route exposure assessment iii cumulative risk calculation the first part includes the estimation of age sensitivity and synergetic coefficients the second presents the zip model applied for excessive non detection and multiple exposure assessment and estimates the removal rates of pathogens the last conducts cumulative risk calculations using disability adjusted life years dalys the embedding relationship of the formula is as shown in fig s2 2 2 collection and detection water samples were collected from waterworks for a total of 183 samples covering 44 major cities in china during 2008 2018 using 20 l plastic containers as shown in fig s4 each container was placed on ice and immediately sent to the laboratory the densities of giardia and cryptosporidium in water samples were measured by the following steps including filtration air flotation monoclonal antibody marking and microscopic examination which was established as a standard method in japan hashimoto et al 2002 briefly water samples were filtered with a mixed cellulose ester membrane filter diameter 142 mm pore size 1 μm and then the membrane was dissolved in acetone solution followed by centrifugation at 1050 g for 10 min at 4 c the packed pellets were resuspended in a suitable volume 2 10 ml of distilled water half of the resuspension from each sample was used for protozoan enumeration and the other for dna extraction while 8 filters were damaged accidentally in this process the mean recoveries by this method were 41 25 for cryptosporidium and 38 32 for giardia within the standard range 24 100 set by usepa xiao et al 2012a 2 3 co infection exposure assessment zero inflated model exposure probability distribution function considering the excessive non detected data in the concentrations of giardia and cryptosporidium the zero inflated model was applied to fit their probability distribution which is a mixed function of bernoulli and another distribution using the maxlik package in r software the lowest chi square was applied to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model using the mass package in r eq 1 in table 1 removal rate estimation the recommended removal rate data of global public waterworks was not adopted directly in this study when calculating the exposure dose because these data are distinct for different treatments in treatments of major cities of china the turbidity of raw water varied from 3 to 300 while that of the drinking water output from treatment ranged from 0 1 to 1 considering the differences in treatment techniques and work status it is rather difficult to find a typical treatment to represent others due to a lack of particle count data it is practical to build a model to estimate the removal rate of giardia and cryptosporidium for each treatment plant based on turbidity online monitoring data the relationship model between turbidity and particles size over 1 μm was established according to the recommendations of fan morse et al where the giardia and cryptosporidium 1 2 μm were regarded as particles in water fan et al 2014 morse et al 2002 swertfeger et al 1999 in which modeling data was collected from the literature of global waterworks furthermore the robustness of this model was verified using continuously monitored data on turbidity and particles in a specific water plant in zhang s study zhang 2010 finally the removal efficiency of the particles was estimated based on the reduction in the online turbidity data from influent to effluent in key water plants in china more details are shown in supporting information si section i estimation of the removal rates of cryptosporidium giardia multiple exposure routes in this study waterborne exposure routes and ingestion volume were mainly divided into three parts direct drinking 0 349 1 547 l day wang and duan 2016 zhao and duan 2013 2016 residues from tooth brushing and food and dish washing 0 039 l day an et al 2011 and water swallowed in swimming pools 0 36 0 82 ml min dufour et al 2006 while contamination by secondary transmission was ignored for non host parasitism as shown in eq 2 in table 1 more details about parameters i e meaning and value was shown in table s1 the frequency of drinking and residual intake in the multi exposure routes was regarded as everyday per year but the frequency of swimming was assumed to be 96 times per year assumed to be visit swimming pools 8 times per month miranda et al 2001 sbarbaro and smith 2011 considering the investigation of chinese swimming habits in the yearbook wang and duan 2016 zhao and duan 2013 2016 the pathogen contamination in the pools was examined to be 0 30 0 79 oocysts 10 l and 0 27 0 71 cysts 10 l respectively which was mainly contributed by the shedding of pathogens by infected people during swimming xiao et al 2017 the ratio of swimming population swimming time etc are summarized in si table s13 2 4 co infectivity estimation dose response relationship the exponential model eq 3 in table 1 is used to fit the dose response curve for single dose exposure of giardia and cryptosporidium infections respectively gibson et al 1998 sales ortells and medema 2014 schets et al 2008 the infectivity constants r of oo cysts in this model was estimated based on experimental data of human infection by the nlstools packages in r software data of dose and response are listed in si table s2 then it was adjusted by age sensitivity and synergy with hiv eq 5a b in table 1 and annual risk of co infection was calculated with eq 6 infectivity sensitivity with age in the previous experiments on cryptosporidium and giardia infectivity toward humans the physical fitness of all ages was regarded as the same by default ignoring the different susceptibilities of the elderly adults and children anne alexander et al 2012 espelage et al 2010 in this study infectivity sensitivity parameters with age were represented by a constant s which is an infectivity adjustment factor for elderly or children relative to that of adults defined as one it can be estimated based on the distance between the age structure of patients and that of the normal population using eq 4a and eq 4b with the optimization method given in the optim function in r more details i e formula derivation and data used are summarized in si section ii model of estimating age sensitivity infected by giardia and cryptosporidium mode of co infection the waterborne pathogens giardia and cryptosporidium have similar spreading modes which is different from that of hiv in this study the infectivity modes between these pathogens were separated into single infection only cryptosporidium or giardia and co infection of cryptosporidium and giardia with hiv in single infection by cryptosporidiosis the prevalence rate of normal immunity is represented as p c and p c g in fig 1 calculated with eq 5a in table 1 where the co infection enhancement factor f was taken as 1 while f was set to 0 57 7 9 for immunodeficiency p c h and p c g h referring to eq 5b tellevik et al 2015 yang et al 2017b for giardiasis the factor f was assigned to 1 for immunocompetence and 1 23 3 59 for immunodeficiency feitosa et al 2001 in co infections the infectivity for all people was calculated as the sum of the infectivities of cryptosporidium and giardia removing the overlap p g with eq 5b 2 5 calculation of dalys gastroenteritis caused by pathogens may result in the reduction of survival time premature death and of quality in life or both which was divided into four severities slight symptoms i e no need to visit general practitioners no gp need to visit a general practitioner gp hospitalization hosp and severe symptoms i e fatal an et al 2012 havelaar et al 2012 severe symptoms was represented by years of life lost yll while others were converted to disability loss yld which constitute the cumulative health loss evaluated by disability adjusted life years dalys murray and lopez 1997 in this study the cumulative health risk calculated with eq 7 was divided into two parts immunocompetence and immunodeficiency respectively shown as the former or latter cumulative value in this equation 2 6 variability and sensitivity analysis to account for variability of the input parameters summarized in table 1 such as infectivity parameters and swimming times a monte carlo simulation 1000 trials was used to characterize its fluctuations in r an analysis was also performed to evaluate the sensitivity of model inputs parameters and assumptions 3 results and discussion 3 1 exposure assessment of giardia and cryptosporidium the density profiles of giardia and cryptosporidium were plotted by the columns and lines in fig 2 the concentration of cryptosporidium was up to 6 oocysts 10 l with 123 instances of non detection and the mean value was 0 50 oocysts 10 l the average concentration of giardia was 0 39 cysts 10 l 131 non detected maximum 5 cysts 10l these concentration levels are much lower than those of two outbreaks of giardia and cryptosporidium in the aragon region of spain during 2013 2015 6 7 3 8 cysts 10 l and 12 5 24 1 oocysts 10 l ramo et al 2017 it should be noted that the concentration of cryptosporidium in some cities of china was even higher than that of milwaukee 0 67 1 3 oocysts 10 l when large scale diarrhea occurred in 1993 mac kenzie et al 1994 but the risk and infections of cryptosporidium are expected to be less than what was observed during the milwaukee outbreak because a large proportion of the population boils their water in china the contamination status in source water were consistent with the infection level for humans but not significant with animal infectious sources as shown in fig s5 and surveyed by feng and gong feng and xiao 2017 gong et al 2017 li et al 2017 different functions poisson lognormal neg binomial exponential were used to fit the concentration distributions and the poisson function showed the lowest chi square for giardia and cryptosporidium then the zip model eq 1 in table 1 was employed to fit the true value obey the poisson function considering the presence of a large number of zero value detection cases with the result shown in table s3 which is similar to the results of he and cui cui and henry s 2014 he et al 2012 subsequently the concentration expectation was corrected by the recovery rate c 41 25 g 38 32 and the rationality of this model was indicated by reduction of the chi square values from 10 6 to 8 2 to 1 3 6 8 for giardia and cryptosporidium and the parameter p the exponential in influent and quadratic in effluent function were selected by msc model selection criteria to represent the best fitting relationship as shown in table s4 subsequently this model was corrected by the existing paired data of turbidity and particles from zhang s 500 day observation experiment zhang 2010 as shown in fig si3 the removal rates of giardia and cryptosporidium were estimated to be 2 03 log10 95 ci 2 15 2 27 under conventional treatment using the changes of turbidity from 54 04 ntu in influent 0 63 187 35 to effluent 0 35 ntu 0 07 0 87 in the source water of 72 water plants during 2008 18 which was within the normal range of 2 2 5 log10 recommended by who lechevallier et al 1991 who 2009 xiao et al 2012b this data fills the gap in knowledge of the efficiency of the removal rate of giardia and cryptosporidium during the operation of water plants in china after statistics and model deduction 3 2 hazard characterization and susceptibility parameter estimation the exponential dose response curves for giardia and cryptosporidium are shown in fig s3 and the values of the parameter r in eq 3 are 0 059 0 033 mean sd p value 0 117 for giardia and 0 025 0 009 p value 0 008 for cryptosporidium respectively the value is higher than 0 024 for the cryptosporidium dose effect lapen et al 2016 and also higher than 0 004 or 0 05 betancourt et al 2014 ryu et al 2007 schets et al 2008 but lower than 0 09 sales ortells and medema 2014 similarly the parameter r for giardia is higher than 0 020 0 026 0 036 betancourt et al 2014 ryu et al 2007 schets et al 2008 however its lower bound 0 026 is within the range that is tolerable by some of the population so the parameters of the exponential distribution of cryptosporidium were in the normal range but were slightly higher for giardia data from an epidemiological survey and the age structure of the population of the netherlands were used mainly because of the availability of data on patient rates in all ages in rivm reports in the netherlands in contrast with other studies from china the united states spain and europe this report also includes the proportion of patients with various symptoms of all ages in order to facilitate the calculation of the end point of dalys the results show that the age structures s tag in eq 4b of clinical patients in the netherlands according to five age groups 4 5 9 5 14 15 64 65 were 0 424 0 069 0 04 0 446 0 020 for cryptosporidiosis and 0 476 0 16 0 05 0 296 0 017 for giardiasis collected from a clinical report smc et al 2008 and as shown in table 2 detailed calculation in si table s5 table s8 among them the number of child patients is much higher than in other studies listed in table s9 but the prevalence of elderly over 65y is significantly lower than not only other groups but also than that in the united states spain and other countries using the proportion of patients with various symptoms in all age groups the sensitivity rates with age for giardia and cryptosporidium infection were estimated using a numerical iterative method more details of the method are shown in section i 2 4 in the sub section on infectivity sensitivity with age the susceptibility parameters for giardia infection in the five age groups 4 5 9 5 14 15 64 65 were 17 911 5 959 1 873 1 000 0 259 and 10 592 1 709 0 996 1 000 0 201 for cryptosporidium in which the parameters for adults aged 15 64 was set to 1 taking into account the fact that all volunteers in human feeding trials were in this age group chappell et al 2004 although the proportion of young children to that of adults was very low 8 98 the susceptibility parameters for giardia and cryptosporidium are 17 911 fold and 10 592 fold than those of adults which may be due to lower immunity and incomplete development the susceptibility parameters of the elderly are less than 1 mainly because of fewer patients giardiasis 1 70 cryptosporidiosis 1 96 compared to their proportion of the population 14 26 which is contrary to the finding of higher sensitivity for elders and also may be related to the habit of the elderly drinking hot tea erichsen 1990 in addition the rate of giardiasis is twice as that for as cryptosporidiosis meaning that the former has higher risk however the relatively low disease burden may be due to the higher removal rates andreoli and sabogal paz 2017 which is consistent with the findings of gbd troeger et al 2017 these results fill the gap in quantifying the lack of sensitivity data for individuals 3 3 adjustment of co infection rate with age sensitivity and synergistic effects the prevalence of co infection between giardia and cryptosporidium p c p g p c g in fig 1 were calculated by using the exponential model eq 3 and prevalence rate eq 5a eq 5b in table 1 the result was from 2 95 to 10 55 with the mean rate of 6 36 as shown in table 3 considering age sensitivity the infection rate of the group 0 4 years was increased to 44 11 while that for groups under 65 years old was reduced to 1 88 with the average rate 17 53 2 76 fold increase the co infection rate for children was 4 97 fold higher than that for adults which was higher than that of children being infected with giardia 21 15 72 in a nursing home in minnesota white et al 1989 and also higher than that of being infected with cryptosporidium in georgia with 3 fold higher incidence tangermann et al 1991 but was lower than the 8 fold higher incidence for children in oregon skeels et al 1990 meanwhile this result of the co infection rate for children is higher than that in thailand measured by janoff 27 janoff et al 1990 this is consistent with the conclusion that children under 5 years of age and malnourished patients with co infection have a significantly higher prevalence of being infected with pathogens bern et al 2000 hunter and nichols 2002 when promoted by hiv p c g h the infection rate was increased to 6 00 97 17 with the highest rate in the 0 4 y group and average rate of 45 95 7 22 fold increase however the probability of infection was increased by 2 2 3 0 fold in the same age group in immunodeficiency which is similar to the 3 fold increase vakil et al 1996 reported in other studies based on the infection rate of age groups and age structure of the population the proportional predicted co infection rates for giardia and cryptosporidium in each age were calculated with the sensitivity coefficients the predicted rates for all patients co infected with giardia and cryptosporidium were from 0 17 95 ci 0 14 0 21 to 6 60 95 ci 5 63 7 85 in china by theoretical calculation fig 3 left which were in accordance with the statistical results 95 ci 0 00 8 52 fig 3 right based on other epidemiological surveys table s12 wan et al 2018 wang et al 2015 2016 yang et al 2017a although children have the highest sensitivity the proportion of illness is not the highest for the lower age structure of the population 5 66 on the contrary adults have the most patients because of they represent the largest age proportion of the population 74 40 which is consistent with the statistical results of cryptosporidiosis in a hospital in the netherlands table s6 but the ratio of giardiasis was the highest in children as shown in table s8 3 4 dalys calculation for co infection the calculated risks of co infection by giardia and cryptosporidium are listed in table 4 based on conventional treatment processes for immunocompetence and immunodeficiency with hiv the risk of co infection was 38 781 10 6 dalys 95 ci 32 615 45 807 of which the immunocompetent account for 38 742 10 6 dalys while the risk was 0 039 10 6 dalys for immunodeficiency in which the latter is much lower than the former due to their low proportion per million people 0 05 office 2008 the cumulative health risk exceeds the who s recommendations 1 10 6 dalys by approximately 38 fold who 2011 which is lower than that reported by an 65 1 10 6 dalys this may be due to the lower concentration of pathogens 2 82 oocysts 10 l than in his study 7 oocysts 10 l and the prevalence of indoor pool swimming rather than open air an et al 2011 compared with xiao s study on the risk of cryptosporidium 8 31 10 6 dalys xiao et al 2012b the co infection risk we determined was higher because the route of swimming intake was taken into account the cumulative risk implies that co infection is an important risk factor and ignoring co infection and sensitivity will cause underestimation of the total risk this means policy makers need to pay more attention to the health of the sensitive subpopulation and to co infection from the perspective of exposure routes the risk was arranged in the following sequence for immunocompetent in co infection residual intake 19 423 10 6 dalys direct drinking 17 563 10 6 dalys swimming ingestion 1 756 10 6 dalys however this was slightly different from the sequence for immunodeficiency ranging from direct drinking to residual intake to swimming ingestion for infection severities the risk order remained the same for both immunocompetence and immunodeficiency fatal no gp to gp hospital in addition the risk order of being co infected with giardia and cryptosporidium was not changed with promotion by hiv in which direct drinking and residual intake were still the main sources of disease burden consistent with the findings of others an et al 2011 cummins et al 2010 medema et al 2003 in fig 4 the co infection risk is displayed according to the division of exposure routes and age groups considering synergistic effects residual intake and direct drinking accounted for 50 13 and 45 34 of the cumulative burden respectively while swimming intake took up less than 5 among the groups adults 15 64 years old constitute the highest proportion of disease burden 52 9 in direct drinking children under age four contribute 51 7 of the disease burden in residual ingestion this coincides with a survey of south east asia and regions of africa kirk et al 2015 where children under five years of age were found to have a significant burden of disease the proportion of risks for swimming intake is roughly the same in the range 0 65 years but much lower in people over 65 years 3 5 sensitivity analysis according to the results of the sensitivity analysis shown in fig s6 the removal efficiency infectivity parameters r in the giardia dose response model age sensitivity to giardia and initial contamination level of giardia were the top four most sensitive variables that contributed to the uncertainty in the final life lost estimates the results indicated that the co infection model was generally sensitive to giardia and cryptosporidium concentrations in the tap water and the dose response curve and sensitivity were important parameters when modelling however the contamination level of cryptosporidium in swimming pools and the parameter of swimming times per person per year showed less effect on the co infection model 4 conclusion the study provided a new method of estimating the sensitivity of the population exposed to cryptosporidium and giardia broken down by age based on clinical investigation infection rates of cryptosporidium and giardia in children under 4 years old were to be 10 592 fold 17 911 fold higher than that of adults respectively using these new data on infection sensitivity by age group the cumulative health risk of giardia or cryptosporidium with hiv co infection was up to 38 781 10 6 dalys exceeding the level recommended by who by approximately 38 fold which implies that the risk from ignoring co infection is much higher than the risk reported in previous studies this means that environmental policy needs to pay more attention to the health of sensitive subpopulations and develop stricter rules and control strategy regarding giardia and cryptosporidium the drinking water treatment plant log removal rates for giardia and cryptosporidium in cities of china were estimated to be 2 03 log10 95 ci 2 15 2 27 in the bottom of the removal rate range 2 2 5 recommended by who the authors propose that stricter water quality standards that limits turbidity levels or particle counts post drinking water treatment could be effective in reducing the risk caused by giardia and cryptosporidium in china declaration of competing

18037,co infection with multiple pathogens especially the spread of giardia and cryptosporidium in source water among those with immunodeficiency is common worldwide which will result in an increase in overall risk in this study the quantitative microbial risk assessment model was used to estimate the cumulative risk of co infection with giardia and cryptosporidium promoted by hiv considering age sensitivity the sensitivity of population segments with different ages was estimated by the optimization method based on clinical data of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis with age structure the factors of co infection enhancement were used to quantify hiv synergism with the action of other pathogens the removal rates of giardia and cryptosporidium through water treatment were estimated by a model involving turbidity and particles the results showed that children 0 4 years were 17 911 fold more sensitive to infection with giardia than adults 15 64 years and that with cryptosporidium was 10 592 fold removal rates of these parasites in water treatment plants in major cities in china were estimated to be 2 03 log10 considering the hiv synergistic and age susceptibility effects the cumulative risk of exposure to giardia or cryptosporidium was about 38 781 10 6 dalys disability adjusted life years per person per year which was much higher than the reference risk level recommended by the world health organization 10 6 dalys the methodology and results of this study will be useful in better evaluating and reducing the burden due to infection of giardia and or cryptosporidium in china and other countries graphical abstract image 1 keywords giardia cryptosporidium co infection risk assessment age sensitivity synergistic effects removal rates 1 introduction worldwide about two billion cases of diarrhea occur every year with 499 000 deaths in 2015 ibrahim khalil 2018 the clearly evidenced pathogens for these illnesses include giardia and cryptosporidium globally an estimated 200 million people were infected with giardia certad et al 2017 and 44 8 million children had diarrhea due to cryptosporidium infection in 2016 ibrahim khalil 2018 which was one of the three aetiologies responsible for deaths in children younger than 5 years ibrahim khalil 2018 research shows that co infection is much more fatal to humans than a single infection where the death rate due to co infection in some developing countries is estimated to be one fifth to one third eisenstein et al 2008 rodríguez morales et al 2016 especially for those with hiv houpt et al 2005 liu et al 2014 it should be noted that the immunodeficiency population infected by hiv was up to 36 7 million at the end of 2016 unaids 2018 with an annual growth rate of 840 000 globally ritchie 2018 ignoring the effects of pathogenic co infection with hiv will result in health risk underestimation for giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis considering that giardia and cryptosporidium share the same invasive hosts and spreading routes the cumulative risk assessment of the population exposed to multiple pathogen co infection will give a more explicit health risk profile which will guide regulatory decision making on stricter control rules and strategies in the face of limited public resources there has been some research on waterborne pathogenic co infection focusing on the potency of giardia or cryptosporidium in immunodeficient people their oo cysts are more likely to be found in feces of the immunodeficient feitosa et al 2001 nkenfou et al 2013 while hiv spreads faster in patients with giardiasis or cryptosporidiosis bentwich et al 1995 the focus of this mechanism is on the description of the synergy between pathogens several models have been proposed to handle this problem an and chappell applied immunoglobulin g igg as an index to characterize the status of the immune system which was embedded into the dose response function to describe the co infection potency of cryptosporidium and hiv an et al 2011 chappell et al 1999 however it is very hard to obtain sufficient data on igg for use in risk assessment because of the complexity and expense of the detection methods sugiura et al 2001 another candidate method proposed by robinson is to define a factor to represent the degree of enhancement by hiv in pathogenic co infection robinson et al 1987 which can be estimated from clinical data feitosa et al 2001 tellevik et al 2015 yang et al 2017b on the other hand it is also necessary to refine the dose effect relationship for accurate evaluation of co infection in an experiment involving swallowing giardia or cryptosporidium in humans the sensitivity differences of the elderly and children to pathogenic microbial infections has been ignored and only adults were selected as volunteers due to legal and ethical constraints which will underestimate the health risks of the entire age population dupont et al 1995 okhuysen et al 1999 in fact age based infectivity sensitivity can be estimated based on the clinical data of giardiasis or cryptosporidiosis using age sensitivity coefficients which will increase the potency of pathogenic microbial infections in the elderly and children relative to adults what s more the removal rates of giardia or cryptosporidium are also critical for quantification of the qmra quantitative microbial risk assessment during the exposure assessment process which are estimated by particle count in the treatment process but this parameter may have been overestimated in previous studies lechevallier et al who as well as xiao et al pointed out that the recommended removal rate of giardia or cryptosporidium used in most studies is 2 2 5 log10 in conventional treatment while 4 4 5 log10 for advanced treatments lechevallier et al 1991 who 2009 xiao et al 2012b in fact its fluctuation can be up to 0 7 1 1 log10 in implementation of the experiments yasui et al 2016 which can lead to considerable uncertainty in qmra up to now this key parameter has been lacking essential statistical survey data or confirmation from chinese water plants fortunately fan morse et al provide a valid method of estimating the removal of pathogens from the changes in turbidity between raw and output water in drinking water plants fan et al 2014 morse et al 2002 swertfeger et al 1999 where the pathogens are regarded as particles in the water globally the immunodeficiency population infected by hiv was up to 36 7 million at the end of 2016 unaids 2018 with an annual growth rate of 840 000 ritchie 2018 of which over 400 000 chinese people had been infected with hiv cdc 2016 feng and xiao 2011 nhfpc 2015 according to recent large scale water quality surveys the concentrations of giardia and cryptosporidium in china are sometimes higher than those of the cities of pittsburgh and milwaukee when major infections broke out cummins et al 2010 rose et al 1991a who 2009 more than 40 million people have been suffering from diarrhea therefore it is necessary to conduct an in depth analysis of the cumulative risk of giardia and cryptosporidium co infection according to the concept of age sensitivity and hiv synergy in comparison with previous studies on risk assessment of co infection by pathogens this study has the following special considerations 1 quantitative description of the differences in susceptibility to giardia and cryptosporidium infection of different ages based on epidemiological survey data with the method of total population balance 2 consideration of the synergistic enhancement of hiv co infection with pathogens 3 estimation of the removal rates of giardia and cryptosporidium during the operation of the main water plants in key cities in china this study attempts to provide a more accurate method for estimating the cumulative risk of pathogen co infections to compensate for the neglect of age sensitivity and synergistic effects in previous studies in order to develop stricter treatment rules 2 materials and methods 2 1 framework for estimating the health risk of co infection to account for co infection in risk assessment a conceptual framework is developed on co infection of giardia cryptosporidium with hiv based on the classical qmra process fig s1 which can be divided into three parts i co infectivity estimation ii multiple route exposure assessment iii cumulative risk calculation the first part includes the estimation of age sensitivity and synergetic coefficients the second presents the zip model applied for excessive non detection and multiple exposure assessment and estimates the removal rates of pathogens the last conducts cumulative risk calculations using disability adjusted life years dalys the embedding relationship of the formula is as shown in fig s2 2 2 collection and detection water samples were collected from waterworks for a total of 183 samples covering 44 major cities in china during 2008 2018 using 20 l plastic containers as shown in fig s4 each container was placed on ice and immediately sent to the laboratory the densities of giardia and cryptosporidium in water samples were measured by the following steps including filtration air flotation monoclonal antibody marking and microscopic examination which was established as a standard method in japan hashimoto et al 2002 briefly water samples were filtered with a mixed cellulose ester membrane filter diameter 142 mm pore size 1 μm and then the membrane was dissolved in acetone solution followed by centrifugation at 1050 g for 10 min at 4 c the packed pellets were resuspended in a suitable volume 2 10 ml of distilled water half of the resuspension from each sample was used for protozoan enumeration and the other for dna extraction while 8 filters were damaged accidentally in this process the mean recoveries by this method were 41 25 for cryptosporidium and 38 32 for giardia within the standard range 24 100 set by usepa xiao et al 2012a 2 3 co infection exposure assessment zero inflated model exposure probability distribution function considering the excessive non detected data in the concentrations of giardia and cryptosporidium the zero inflated model was applied to fit their probability distribution which is a mixed function of bernoulli and another distribution using the maxlik package in r software the lowest chi square was applied to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model using the mass package in r eq 1 in table 1 removal rate estimation the recommended removal rate data of global public waterworks was not adopted directly in this study when calculating the exposure dose because these data are distinct for different treatments in treatments of major cities of china the turbidity of raw water varied from 3 to 300 while that of the drinking water output from treatment ranged from 0 1 to 1 considering the differences in treatment techniques and work status it is rather difficult to find a typical treatment to represent others due to a lack of particle count data it is practical to build a model to estimate the removal rate of giardia and cryptosporidium for each treatment plant based on turbidity online monitoring data the relationship model between turbidity and particles size over 1 μm was established according to the recommendations of fan morse et al where the giardia and cryptosporidium 1 2 μm were regarded as particles in water fan et al 2014 morse et al 2002 swertfeger et al 1999 in which modeling data was collected from the literature of global waterworks furthermore the robustness of this model was verified using continuously monitored data on turbidity and particles in a specific water plant in zhang s study zhang 2010 finally the removal efficiency of the particles was estimated based on the reduction in the online turbidity data from influent to effluent in key water plants in china more details are shown in supporting information si section i estimation of the removal rates of cryptosporidium giardia multiple exposure routes in this study waterborne exposure routes and ingestion volume were mainly divided into three parts direct drinking 0 349 1 547 l day wang and duan 2016 zhao and duan 2013 2016 residues from tooth brushing and food and dish washing 0 039 l day an et al 2011 and water swallowed in swimming pools 0 36 0 82 ml min dufour et al 2006 while contamination by secondary transmission was ignored for non host parasitism as shown in eq 2 in table 1 more details about parameters i e meaning and value was shown in table s1 the frequency of drinking and residual intake in the multi exposure routes was regarded as everyday per year but the frequency of swimming was assumed to be 96 times per year assumed to be visit swimming pools 8 times per month miranda et al 2001 sbarbaro and smith 2011 considering the investigation of chinese swimming habits in the yearbook wang and duan 2016 zhao and duan 2013 2016 the pathogen contamination in the pools was examined to be 0 30 0 79 oocysts 10 l and 0 27 0 71 cysts 10 l respectively which was mainly contributed by the shedding of pathogens by infected people during swimming xiao et al 2017 the ratio of swimming population swimming time etc are summarized in si table s13 2 4 co infectivity estimation dose response relationship the exponential model eq 3 in table 1 is used to fit the dose response curve for single dose exposure of giardia and cryptosporidium infections respectively gibson et al 1998 sales ortells and medema 2014 schets et al 2008 the infectivity constants r of oo cysts in this model was estimated based on experimental data of human infection by the nlstools packages in r software data of dose and response are listed in si table s2 then it was adjusted by age sensitivity and synergy with hiv eq 5a b in table 1 and annual risk of co infection was calculated with eq 6 infectivity sensitivity with age in the previous experiments on cryptosporidium and giardia infectivity toward humans the physical fitness of all ages was regarded as the same by default ignoring the different susceptibilities of the elderly adults and children anne alexander et al 2012 espelage et al 2010 in this study infectivity sensitivity parameters with age were represented by a constant s which is an infectivity adjustment factor for elderly or children relative to that of adults defined as one it can be estimated based on the distance between the age structure of patients and that of the normal population using eq 4a and eq 4b with the optimization method given in the optim function in r more details i e formula derivation and data used are summarized in si section ii model of estimating age sensitivity infected by giardia and cryptosporidium mode of co infection the waterborne pathogens giardia and cryptosporidium have similar spreading modes which is different from that of hiv in this study the infectivity modes between these pathogens were separated into single infection only cryptosporidium or giardia and co infection of cryptosporidium and giardia with hiv in single infection by cryptosporidiosis the prevalence rate of normal immunity is represented as p c and p c g in fig 1 calculated with eq 5a in table 1 where the co infection enhancement factor f was taken as 1 while f was set to 0 57 7 9 for immunodeficiency p c h and p c g h referring to eq 5b tellevik et al 2015 yang et al 2017b for giardiasis the factor f was assigned to 1 for immunocompetence and 1 23 3 59 for immunodeficiency feitosa et al 2001 in co infections the infectivity for all people was calculated as the sum of the infectivities of cryptosporidium and giardia removing the overlap p g with eq 5b 2 5 calculation of dalys gastroenteritis caused by pathogens may result in the reduction of survival time premature death and of quality in life or both which was divided into four severities slight symptoms i e no need to visit general practitioners no gp need to visit a general practitioner gp hospitalization hosp and severe symptoms i e fatal an et al 2012 havelaar et al 2012 severe symptoms was represented by years of life lost yll while others were converted to disability loss yld which constitute the cumulative health loss evaluated by disability adjusted life years dalys murray and lopez 1997 in this study the cumulative health risk calculated with eq 7 was divided into two parts immunocompetence and immunodeficiency respectively shown as the former or latter cumulative value in this equation 2 6 variability and sensitivity analysis to account for variability of the input parameters summarized in table 1 such as infectivity parameters and swimming times a monte carlo simulation 1000 trials was used to characterize its fluctuations in r an analysis was also performed to evaluate the sensitivity of model inputs parameters and assumptions 3 results and discussion 3 1 exposure assessment of giardia and cryptosporidium the density profiles of giardia and cryptosporidium were plotted by the columns and lines in fig 2 the concentration of cryptosporidium was up to 6 oocysts 10 l with 123 instances of non detection and the mean value was 0 50 oocysts 10 l the average concentration of giardia was 0 39 cysts 10 l 131 non detected maximum 5 cysts 10l these concentration levels are much lower than those of two outbreaks of giardia and cryptosporidium in the aragon region of spain during 2013 2015 6 7 3 8 cysts 10 l and 12 5 24 1 oocysts 10 l ramo et al 2017 it should be noted that the concentration of cryptosporidium in some cities of china was even higher than that of milwaukee 0 67 1 3 oocysts 10 l when large scale diarrhea occurred in 1993 mac kenzie et al 1994 but the risk and infections of cryptosporidium are expected to be less than what was observed during the milwaukee outbreak because a large proportion of the population boils their water in china the contamination status in source water were consistent with the infection level for humans but not significant with animal infectious sources as shown in fig s5 and surveyed by feng and gong feng and xiao 2017 gong et al 2017 li et al 2017 different functions poisson lognormal neg binomial exponential were used to fit the concentration distributions and the poisson function showed the lowest chi square for giardia and cryptosporidium then the zip model eq 1 in table 1 was employed to fit the true value obey the poisson function considering the presence of a large number of zero value detection cases with the result shown in table s3 which is similar to the results of he and cui cui and henry s 2014 he et al 2012 subsequently the concentration expectation was corrected by the recovery rate c 41 25 g 38 32 and the rationality of this model was indicated by reduction of the chi square values from 10 6 to 8 2 to 1 3 6 8 for giardia and cryptosporidium and the parameter p the exponential in influent and quadratic in effluent function were selected by msc model selection criteria to represent the best fitting relationship as shown in table s4 subsequently this model was corrected by the existing paired data of turbidity and particles from zhang s 500 day observation experiment zhang 2010 as shown in fig si3 the removal rates of giardia and cryptosporidium were estimated to be 2 03 log10 95 ci 2 15 2 27 under conventional treatment using the changes of turbidity from 54 04 ntu in influent 0 63 187 35 to effluent 0 35 ntu 0 07 0 87 in the source water of 72 water plants during 2008 18 which was within the normal range of 2 2 5 log10 recommended by who lechevallier et al 1991 who 2009 xiao et al 2012b this data fills the gap in knowledge of the efficiency of the removal rate of giardia and cryptosporidium during the operation of water plants in china after statistics and model deduction 3 2 hazard characterization and susceptibility parameter estimation the exponential dose response curves for giardia and cryptosporidium are shown in fig s3 and the values of the parameter r in eq 3 are 0 059 0 033 mean sd p value 0 117 for giardia and 0 025 0 009 p value 0 008 for cryptosporidium respectively the value is higher than 0 024 for the cryptosporidium dose effect lapen et al 2016 and also higher than 0 004 or 0 05 betancourt et al 2014 ryu et al 2007 schets et al 2008 but lower than 0 09 sales ortells and medema 2014 similarly the parameter r for giardia is higher than 0 020 0 026 0 036 betancourt et al 2014 ryu et al 2007 schets et al 2008 however its lower bound 0 026 is within the range that is tolerable by some of the population so the parameters of the exponential distribution of cryptosporidium were in the normal range but were slightly higher for giardia data from an epidemiological survey and the age structure of the population of the netherlands were used mainly because of the availability of data on patient rates in all ages in rivm reports in the netherlands in contrast with other studies from china the united states spain and europe this report also includes the proportion of patients with various symptoms of all ages in order to facilitate the calculation of the end point of dalys the results show that the age structures s tag in eq 4b of clinical patients in the netherlands according to five age groups 4 5 9 5 14 15 64 65 were 0 424 0 069 0 04 0 446 0 020 for cryptosporidiosis and 0 476 0 16 0 05 0 296 0 017 for giardiasis collected from a clinical report smc et al 2008 and as shown in table 2 detailed calculation in si table s5 table s8 among them the number of child patients is much higher than in other studies listed in table s9 but the prevalence of elderly over 65y is significantly lower than not only other groups but also than that in the united states spain and other countries using the proportion of patients with various symptoms in all age groups the sensitivity rates with age for giardia and cryptosporidium infection were estimated using a numerical iterative method more details of the method are shown in section i 2 4 in the sub section on infectivity sensitivity with age the susceptibility parameters for giardia infection in the five age groups 4 5 9 5 14 15 64 65 were 17 911 5 959 1 873 1 000 0 259 and 10 592 1 709 0 996 1 000 0 201 for cryptosporidium in which the parameters for adults aged 15 64 was set to 1 taking into account the fact that all volunteers in human feeding trials were in this age group chappell et al 2004 although the proportion of young children to that of adults was very low 8 98 the susceptibility parameters for giardia and cryptosporidium are 17 911 fold and 10 592 fold than those of adults which may be due to lower immunity and incomplete development the susceptibility parameters of the elderly are less than 1 mainly because of fewer patients giardiasis 1 70 cryptosporidiosis 1 96 compared to their proportion of the population 14 26 which is contrary to the finding of higher sensitivity for elders and also may be related to the habit of the elderly drinking hot tea erichsen 1990 in addition the rate of giardiasis is twice as that for as cryptosporidiosis meaning that the former has higher risk however the relatively low disease burden may be due to the higher removal rates andreoli and sabogal paz 2017 which is consistent with the findings of gbd troeger et al 2017 these results fill the gap in quantifying the lack of sensitivity data for individuals 3 3 adjustment of co infection rate with age sensitivity and synergistic effects the prevalence of co infection between giardia and cryptosporidium p c p g p c g in fig 1 were calculated by using the exponential model eq 3 and prevalence rate eq 5a eq 5b in table 1 the result was from 2 95 to 10 55 with the mean rate of 6 36 as shown in table 3 considering age sensitivity the infection rate of the group 0 4 years was increased to 44 11 while that for groups under 65 years old was reduced to 1 88 with the average rate 17 53 2 76 fold increase the co infection rate for children was 4 97 fold higher than that for adults which was higher than that of children being infected with giardia 21 15 72 in a nursing home in minnesota white et al 1989 and also higher than that of being infected with cryptosporidium in georgia with 3 fold higher incidence tangermann et al 1991 but was lower than the 8 fold higher incidence for children in oregon skeels et al 1990 meanwhile this result of the co infection rate for children is higher than that in thailand measured by janoff 27 janoff et al 1990 this is consistent with the conclusion that children under 5 years of age and malnourished patients with co infection have a significantly higher prevalence of being infected with pathogens bern et al 2000 hunter and nichols 2002 when promoted by hiv p c g h the infection rate was increased to 6 00 97 17 with the highest rate in the 0 4 y group and average rate of 45 95 7 22 fold increase however the probability of infection was increased by 2 2 3 0 fold in the same age group in immunodeficiency which is similar to the 3 fold increase vakil et al 1996 reported in other studies based on the infection rate of age groups and age structure of the population the proportional predicted co infection rates for giardia and cryptosporidium in each age were calculated with the sensitivity coefficients the predicted rates for all patients co infected with giardia and cryptosporidium were from 0 17 95 ci 0 14 0 21 to 6 60 95 ci 5 63 7 85 in china by theoretical calculation fig 3 left which were in accordance with the statistical results 95 ci 0 00 8 52 fig 3 right based on other epidemiological surveys table s12 wan et al 2018 wang et al 2015 2016 yang et al 2017a although children have the highest sensitivity the proportion of illness is not the highest for the lower age structure of the population 5 66 on the contrary adults have the most patients because of they represent the largest age proportion of the population 74 40 which is consistent with the statistical results of cryptosporidiosis in a hospital in the netherlands table s6 but the ratio of giardiasis was the highest in children as shown in table s8 3 4 dalys calculation for co infection the calculated risks of co infection by giardia and cryptosporidium are listed in table 4 based on conventional treatment processes for immunocompetence and immunodeficiency with hiv the risk of co infection was 38 781 10 6 dalys 95 ci 32 615 45 807 of which the immunocompetent account for 38 742 10 6 dalys while the risk was 0 039 10 6 dalys for immunodeficiency in which the latter is much lower than the former due to their low proportion per million people 0 05 office 2008 the cumulative health risk exceeds the who s recommendations 1 10 6 dalys by approximately 38 fold who 2011 which is lower than that reported by an 65 1 10 6 dalys this may be due to the lower concentration of pathogens 2 82 oocysts 10 l than in his study 7 oocysts 10 l and the prevalence of indoor pool swimming rather than open air an et al 2011 compared with xiao s study on the risk of cryptosporidium 8 31 10 6 dalys xiao et al 2012b the co infection risk we determined was higher because the route of swimming intake was taken into account the cumulative risk implies that co infection is an important risk factor and ignoring co infection and sensitivity will cause underestimation of the total risk this means policy makers need to pay more attention to the health of the sensitive subpopulation and to co infection from the perspective of exposure routes the risk was arranged in the following sequence for immunocompetent in co infection residual intake 19 423 10 6 dalys direct drinking 17 563 10 6 dalys swimming ingestion 1 756 10 6 dalys however this was slightly different from the sequence for immunodeficiency ranging from direct drinking to residual intake to swimming ingestion for infection severities the risk order remained the same for both immunocompetence and immunodeficiency fatal no gp to gp hospital in addition the risk order of being co infected with giardia and cryptosporidium was not changed with promotion by hiv in which direct drinking and residual intake were still the main sources of disease burden consistent with the findings of others an et al 2011 cummins et al 2010 medema et al 2003 in fig 4 the co infection risk is displayed according to the division of exposure routes and age groups considering synergistic effects residual intake and direct drinking accounted for 50 13 and 45 34 of the cumulative burden respectively while swimming intake took up less than 5 among the groups adults 15 64 years old constitute the highest proportion of disease burden 52 9 in direct drinking children under age four contribute 51 7 of the disease burden in residual ingestion this coincides with a survey of south east asia and regions of africa kirk et al 2015 where children under five years of age were found to have a significant burden of disease the proportion of risks for swimming intake is roughly the same in the range 0 65 years but much lower in people over 65 years 3 5 sensitivity analysis according to the results of the sensitivity analysis shown in fig s6 the removal efficiency infectivity parameters r in the giardia dose response model age sensitivity to giardia and initial contamination level of giardia were the top four most sensitive variables that contributed to the uncertainty in the final life lost estimates the results indicated that the co infection model was generally sensitive to giardia and cryptosporidium concentrations in the tap water and the dose response curve and sensitivity were important parameters when modelling however the contamination level of cryptosporidium in swimming pools and the parameter of swimming times per person per year showed less effect on the co infection model 4 conclusion the study provided a new method of estimating the sensitivity of the population exposed to cryptosporidium and giardia broken down by age based on clinical investigation infection rates of cryptosporidium and giardia in children under 4 years old were to be 10 592 fold 17 911 fold higher than that of adults respectively using these new data on infection sensitivity by age group the cumulative health risk of giardia or cryptosporidium with hiv co infection was up to 38 781 10 6 dalys exceeding the level recommended by who by approximately 38 fold which implies that the risk from ignoring co infection is much higher than the risk reported in previous studies this means that environmental policy needs to pay more attention to the health of sensitive subpopulations and develop stricter rules and control strategy regarding giardia and cryptosporidium the drinking water treatment plant log removal rates for giardia and cryptosporidium in cities of china were estimated to be 2 03 log10 95 ci 2 15 2 27 in the bottom of the removal rate range 2 2 5 recommended by who the authors propose that stricter water quality standards that limits turbidity levels or particle counts post drinking water treatment could be effective in reducing the risk caused by giardia and cryptosporidium in china declaration of competing

18038,among the emerging contaminants today pharmaceuticals are some of the most demanding chemical compounds when it comes to understanding their transport within aquifers the transport of pharmaceuticals in an unsaturated zone is influenced by many factors including compound sorption and degradation which is essential in assessing contaminant migration in soil and groundwater coarse gravel aquifers are particularly important for drinking water sources and industrial water supply globally little data on the transport characteristics of coarse gravel unsaturated zones is available however such data is crucial to understanding the transport of pollutants and to implementing the appropriate management strategies to protect the aquifers in this article we present tracer experiments employed to determine pharmaceutical transport parameters in the coarse gravel unsaturated zone the tracer experiment was performed as a multi tracer exercise where deuterated water was infiltrated as a conservative tracer to define the characteristics of the unsaturated zone together with pharmaceuticals propyphenazone caffeine and carbamazepine as reactive tracers based on the breakthrough curves measured at various depths inverse modelling in combination with analytical and numerical methods hydrus 1d was performed hydraulic parameters for the unsaturated zone were estimated linear sorption coefficients kd and degradation half lives t1 2 were evaluated for each pharmaceutical in the unsaturated zone of the coarse gravel aquifer caffeine has the lowest sorption capacity mean kd 0 027 lkg 1 while the sorption coefficient of propyphenazone is higher kd 0 07 lkg 1 results for the degradation constant of the first order and t1 2 indicate that caffeine has the fastest decay rate highest t1 2 69 3 days followed by propyphenazone highest t1 2 92 4 days the parameters for carbamazepine could not be determined using an advection dispersion equation graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceuticals unsaturated zone coarse gravel aquifer van genuchten model transport parameters tracer experiment 1 introduction organic compounds have been recognized as an important contributing factor in the larger environmental pollution scheme lapworth et al 2012 stuart et al 2012 this group includes personal care products pesticides veterinary products food additives nanomaterials and industrial as well as pharmaceutical residues fent et al 2006 pomati 2008 relyea 2009 water movement and solute transport in an unsaturated zone uz is a key process that affects both the quantity and quality of groundwater the transport of pharmaceuticals in uzs in general is not well known owing to their complex behaviour and depends on the molecular structure of the compounds and the prevailing environmental conditions lapworth et al 2012 the transport of pharmaceuticals in an aquifer is influenced by many factors including compound sorption on soil particles and their degradation the most common approach in determining reactive processes involves batch and column experiments in the laboratory under determined experimental conditions banzhaf and hebig 2016 kiecak et al 2019 however fewer experiments are performed in or under actual environmental field conditions there is also a lack of information in the literature on the physical and hydraulic properties of the coarse grained materials in the uz they are generally poorly understood owing to their relative inaccessibility dann et al 2009 their heterogeneous nature dann et al 2009 and the general lack of research in this area thoma et al 2014 the standard methods allow for the determination of physical and hydraulic properties of soil particles smaller than 2 mm which is why experiments on coarse particle soils gravel are far more complex owing to the heterogeneity of the geological media in some gravel uzs preferential flows are also present alongside dispersive flows nimmo 2005 the preferential flow path has a higher vertical water flow velocity short transit time which could rapidly transport the pollutant deeper and contaminate the groundwater while dispersive flow is characterized by large amounts of water transported relatively slowly through the uz the issue consists in determining the flow system through the coarse gravel uz and the geochemical processes that occur within it sorption coefficients together with pharmaceutical half lives and other conditions e g soil hydraulic geological hydro geological and climatic may be used to assess potential groundwater contamination various studies have reported the sorption of different pharmaceuticals in a uz as a consequence of ionization changes in ph srinivasan et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 contact with mineral surfaces martínez hernández et al 2017 and the presence of clay minerals gao and pedersen 2005 all of which influence compound sorption sorption processes which describe the sorptive exchange between water and solid phases can be characterized using a distribution coefficient kd schwarzenbach et al 2005 they are often modelled using a linear isotherm and a distribution coefficient kd kiecak et al 2019 which is considered an approximation limousin et al 2007 other sorption models do not consider sorption linearity according to al khazrajy and boxall 2016 and paul et al 2013 the sorption model we choose to use depends on site specific factors literature presents a wide range of sorption coefficients and half lives for different compounds which increases the uncertainty involved in applying laboratory results to regional scale cases of pollution kiecak et al 2019 there is also a lack of information in the literature regarding the transport of pharmaceuticals in coarse grained and highly permeable sediments as a result experiments dealing with the coarse gravel unsaturated zones of aquifers under actual environmental conditions are considered far more valuable in our research the transport parameters of water and three selected pharmaceuticals propyphenazone caffeine and carbamazepine in a coarse gravel uz were studied using a tracer experiment transport values for all three pharmaceuticals all of which have different physical and chemical properties have been reported by other authors but none of them have studied their properties in a coarse gravel uz the tracer experiment was performed using a lysimeter facility in the selniška dobrava aquifer n slovenia in order to determine the hydraulic characteristics of the uz deuterated water which has been proven to be an appropriate conservative tracer in coarse gravel uzs was used leis and benischke 2004 mali et al 2007 mali and koroša 2015 inverse model simulations using hydrus 1 d šimunek et al 2010 were used to estimate these characteristics based on the properties estimated for the uz the transport properties of carbamazepine propyphenazone and caffeine were determined inverse modelling is commonly used in solute transport where analytical solutions are matched against observed data using the inverse model approach allows the unknown model parameters to be optimized by comparing model simulations against observed data at different scales from both soil column experiments sprenger et al 2015 stumpp et al 2012 and from field scale experiments mali et al 2007 dane and hruska 1983 the transport parameters from experiments in field scale are more representative of real conditions than studies made of soil cores in columns vanderborght and vereecken 2007 the aims of the presented study were to 1 determine the uz hydraulic properties of a coarse gravel uz using a tracer experiment 2 analyse transport of selected pharmaceuticals in a coarse gravel uz under real environmental conditions and 3 characterize the sorption and 4 the degradation half lives of three selected pharmaceuticals in the coarse gravel uz under natural conditions 2 material

detailed description of the lysimeter is provided in previously published papers mali et al 2007 mali and urbanc 2009 deuterium was used as a conservative tracer for water movement and the pharmaceuticals caffeine propyphenazone and carbamazepine were selected as compounds of interest before injection of the tracer irrigation with groundwater 35 min was performed 1945 ml of deuterated water d2o 50 100 g of carbamazepine 99 500 g of caffeine and 1 kg of propyphenazone were dissolved in groundwater and simultaneously injected using sprinkler irrigation the carbamazepine 99 was purchased from acros the propyphenazone from kefo the caffeine from j t baker and the d2o was supplied by joanneum research forschungsgesellschaft mbh selected chemical properties of the studied compounds are presented in table 2 after injection the tracer was splashed by irrigated water groundwater from this area over an irrigation area of 9 5 m2 distribution of the irrigated water was controlled at 10 precipitation measurement points on the surface where the amount of irrigated water was measured the average amount of irrigated water was 55 mm 2 3 selected pharmaceuticals propyphenazone caffeine and carbamazepine were selected for the tracer experiment based on their characteristics occurrence and fate in the environment and groundwater as a rule they enter the environment through human excretion disposal of unused products and through agricultural application poynton and vulpe 2009 stuart et al 2012 propyphenazone table 2 belongs to the analgesics is a mild pain killer and is used in combination with paracetamol and caffeine in particular for the treatment of febrile conditions and various pains scheytt et al 2006 little exists in the form of published

world it has anthropogenic sources worldwide and is found in coffee tea soft drinks medications and toothpastes like other pharmaceuticals it enters the environment through human excretion and domestic waste water seiler et al 1999 and is frequently detected in groundwater impacted by sewage effluent godfrey et al 2007 seiler et al 1999 teijon et al 2010 owing to caffeine s properties concentrations in surface water are significantly higher than in groundwater auersperger et al 2011 the presence of caffeine in surface waters is a direct indication of human sourced pollution buerge

degradation was studied by kiecak et al 2019 williams and mclain 2012 and karnjanapiboonwong et al 2010 who reported that caffeine transport proceeded independently of soil clay and organic carbon

belitz 2011 godfrey et al 2007 koroša et al 2016 li 2014 loos et al 2010 mali et al 2017 2 4 sampling during the period april to january 2012 samples were taken to detect caffeine carbamazepine propyphenazone and δ2h in the uz water during the first period april to july 2010 samples were collected at 14 day intervals after which the sampling period was extended to one month during which time a total of 24 samplings were performed the samples for determination of δ2h were stored in 120 ml plastic bottles the water used for pharmaceutical analysis was sampled by pipetting the samples in 1000 ml glass bottles of ultrapure water the investigated compounds are often found in personal care products and medicines therefore rigorous quality control qc in the sampling process needs to be observed both in the field and in the laboratory sampling personnel should avoid using products containing compounds of interest to prevent secondary contamination of samples during sampling e g drinking coffee and consuming other products containing caffeine carbamazepine and propyphenazone 2 5 analytical methods δ2h was measured in continuous flow mode by chromium reduction using a ceramic reactor slightly modified from morrison et al 2001 measurements were made in the laboratory at joanneum research forschungsgesellschaft mbh institute of water resources management hydrogeology and geophysics graz austria a more detailed analytical method for deuterium is described by mali et al 2007 concentrations of caffeine carbamazepine and propyphenazone in sampled water were determined using a variation on the epa 525 2 method based on solid phase extraction spe and the use of gas chromatography with mass spectrometry gc ms analyses were carried out in the laboratory of the water supply company vodovod kanalizacija ljubljana slovenia a more detailed description of the method is given by auersperger et al 2005 2 6 numerical model setup 2 6 1 unsaturated zone parameter estimation the δ2h values expressed as had to be converted in a concentration of tracer mg l for the inverse modelling process the concentrations of 2h expressed as mg l were calculated from the equation published by becker and coplen 2001 with consideration taken of the influence of water density mali et al 2007 δ 2 h 34 721 1000 δ d v s m o w 1000 the first step consisted in visual analysis of the data using graphical representation based on the shape of the deuterium tracer breakthrough curves it was concluded that total flow q tot consists of two components a fast component and a slow component we have quantified the relation between them using the simple mixing model q tot x fast q fast x slow q slow where x fast x slow 1 represents the share of each flow component respectively in general the definite fast flow component can be considered as preferential flow and the slow flow component as dispersive flow but in some cases the differences between components can be the result of rain events the fast and slow flow components on the deuterium breakthrough curves were separated by fitting the advection dispersion slug pulse model after sauty 1980 to the terminal part of the experimental breakthrough curve the analytical model was considered the model for the slow flow component q slow once the analytical model and the experimental curve matched the data fitting analytical model was removed with the remaining part representing the fast flow component q fast the shares of the flows x fast q fast and x slow q slow were defined based on the total masses of deuterium expressed as an integral of the breakthrough curve of the component for some curves separation of the fast and slow flow components was not appropriate therefore in the following modelling steps those empirical breakthrough curves were considered as total breakthrough curves due to the lack of data which was the result of interrupted outflows and the low number of samples the results from two sample sites jv 1 jv 4 were not considered deuterium breakthrough curves of slow flow component fast flow component and total breakthrough curves where separation was not possible were used to determine the physical parameters of the unsaturated zone water flow in the uz was simulated by applying the richards equation using the hydrus 1d software package šimunek et al 2010 which was modified for deuterium transport stumpp et al 2012 deuterium transport was calculated using the advection dispersion equation without retention which assumes a single porous medium and is the most widely used model for predicting solute transport in soils under field conditions vanderborght and vereecken 2007 parameters were determined with inverse model from breakthrough curve of deuterium from deuterium results were determined saturated volumetric water content θs inverse of capillary fringe thickness α shape parameters n and m and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks the physical parameters of the mualem van genuchten model were estimated for each sampling point and applied for the parametrization process van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 the uz profiles were defined as homogenous horizons that were discretized into 101 nodes the depth of the simulation was depending on the depth of the lysimeter determined to be 500 cm according to the properties of the uz on the experimental site residual water content θr was set to zero in order to reduce the number of optimized parameters this can be justified also by the fact that it has no significant influence on transport longitudinal dispersivity α l in the model was determined for each sampling point using the equation αl 1 75d50 xu and eckstein 1997 data for average particle size d50 was obtained from a previous analysis of grain size mali 2006 the upper boundary condition was determined using the variable atmospheric condition atmospheric boundary condition with surface runoff and free drainage was used as the lower boundary condition for water flow and solutes šimunek et al 2010 all long term precipitation data used for the models is taken from the maribor measurement station slovenian environment agency 1971 2000 evapotranspiration data was estimated by the slovenian environment agency 1971 2000 based on the penman monteith equation allan et al 1998 for each day from 1 january 2010 to 1 may 2011 2 6 2 pharmaceuticals sorption and degradation parameter estimation basic figures for pharmaceutical transport were calculated based on injection time time of first tracer appearance time of highest concentration and distance between the top of the lysimeter and the observation point käss 1998 based on the physical parameters of the mualem van genuchten model defined for each sampling point in the uz the inverse advection dispersion model embedded in hydrus 1d šimunek et al 2010 was used to model pharmaceutical transport sorption coefficients were determined using a linear sorption isotherm appelo and postma 2007 kiecak et al 2019 and the first order rate of transformation was also determined for each pharmaceutical the first order transformation constant is related to the half life t1 2 of the individual substance dykaar and kitanidis 1996 walker 1974 analysis was performed and parameters defined for propyphenazone and caffeine based on the results of the experiment the transport parameters for carbamazepine cannot be defined using the advection dispersion model 2 6 3 modelling efficiency nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used to model efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 n s e 1 y 0 y p 2 y 0 y 0 2 where y 0 and y p are the observed and simulated values at a given time t and y 0 is the mean observed value over the entire observation period an efficiency value of 1 nse 1 corresponds to a perfect match of the modelled values to the observed data an efficiency value of 0 nse 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observed data whereas an efficiency of less than zero nse 0 occurs when the observed mean proves a better predictor than the model the matching of simulated data was determined by comparing observed and simulated values for each sampling point 3 results and discussion 3 1 unsaturated zone properties the deuterium tracer and all three observed pharmaceuticals were detected in all ten sampling points sampling drains higher values for all tracers occurred in the first sample after tracer injection based on the analysed results it was possible to construct breakthrough curves for all observation points which together with precipitation values at the time of the tracer experiment are presented in fig 2 the breakthrough curves show the different behaviours of the studied substances it is evident that the high intensity and amount of precipitation forced all tracers at all of the different observation points to appear at the same time the hydraulic and transport parameters for each sampling point as well as a share of slow and fast flow components are summarized in table 3 the largest proportion of the fast flow component occurs at the upper sampling site jv 3 while the proportion of the fast flow component drops with depth table 3 the estimated parameters are as follows θs is 0 38 0 51 α is 0 027 0 03 1 cm n is 1 25 1 38 ks is 4 03x10 4 5 9 10 3 m s and longitudinal dispersivity αl is 4 52 cm the lower points in the lysimeter have higher water content than the points at the top of the lysimeter ks values for the fast flow and slow flow components differ with the differences inside the same decade with the exception of sampling point jv 3 these differences are also reflected in transport parameters renshaw et al 2003 reported that some amount of preferential flow can occur through the soil profile even during relatively small storms while the faster flow component is also present in our case fig 2 dispersivity values for each sampling point soil horizon were calculated and are scale dependent where higher dispersivity values may also be the result of a finer textured soil with more clay vanderborght and vereecken 2007 the calculated values for dispersivity are comparable to values found in similar experiments vanderborght and vereecken 2007 reported dispersivity values in coarse sediments ranging from 2 to 20 cm for field experiments and transport distances from 80 to 200 cm in column experiments tracer recovery was estimated based on outflow water volumes and 2h concentrations a total of 3 47 of the initial tracer was intercepted the largest quantities of intercepted deuterium tracer appeared at sampling points jv 8 jv 10 and jv 9 representing 31 23 and 15 of the total amount of recovered tracer respectively drainages in a lysimeter do not cover the entire space and therefore lysimeter can t be treated as a closed system this is the reason why recovery rate is relatively low nse is set between 82 and 98 the best modelling efficiencies were obtained with the simulations at sampling points jv 5 and jv 6 fig 3 results from the modelling show fig 3 that together with the fast flow component which is the result of coarse gravel 60 70 in the lower part of the uz an important part of the flow is represented by the slow flow component which in turn indicates that small grain fractions have a significant influence on the flow of water the results of our tracer experiment indicate infiltration and flow heterogeneity in the coarse gravel uz which was also observed in other studies öhrström et al 2004 reported highly heterogeneous flow patterns for tracer experiments in a sandy loam under steady state irrigation conditions similar results were observed by williams et al 2003 who found preferential flow patterns in a grassy field during steady state irrigation experiments 3 2 transport of pharmaceuticals in the unsaturated zone fig 2 shows breakthrough curves for propypheanzone caffeine and carbamazepines with precipitations during tracer experiments above the lysimeter the results are shown as relative values in relation to the maximum values for each compound at each sampling point estimates of the fastest flow velocity are important in assessing the probability of the fastest effect of pollution on the aquifer through the unsaturated zone 3 2 1 propyphenazone propyphenazone breakthrough curves are presented in fig 2 the shapes of the curves are similar to those for the δ2h values concentrations in traces at sampling points jv 2 jv 3 and jv 5 in the upper part of the lysimeter were detected from the 5th day after tracer injection on and from the 76th day on at the other points the maximum values of the individual breakthrough curves appear from august 2010 at the sampling point jv 2 133 days since injection and jv 3 13 days since injection through january 2011 at the sampling point jv 10 280 days since injection fig 2 calculated average dominant flow velocities range from 5 10 3 to 2 4 10 3 m day the highest velocity for propyphenazone in the tracer experiment was on average estimated at 8 8 10 2 m day inverse models jv 2 jv 3 jv 5 jv 6 and jv 9 for propyphenazone are presented in fig 4 the adsorption coefficient kd for propyphenazone in our model was calculated at an average of 0 07 lkg 1 min 0 021 lkg 1 max 0 1 lkg 1 the efficiency of the models nse for propyphenazone ranges from 82 to 93 propyphenazone transport property values for every sampling point in the lysimeter are shown in table 5 the average first order rate constant for propyphenazone is estimated at 1 7 10 2 day 1 the maximum modelled value was 2 9 10 2 day 1 in the upper layers jv 3 and the minimum 8 0 10 3 day 1 jv 5 the average half life is estimated at 51 2 days table 4 few experiments involving propyphenazone have been published scheytt et al 2006 and burke et al 2013 observed higher propyphenazone kd values in sand column experiments than in ours at between 0 227 lkg 1 in unsaturated conditions scheytt et al 2006 and 0 28 lkg 1 in sterilized sediment burke et al 2013 these results are almost three times higher than the maximum values from our model however batch experiments performed by zuehlke et al 2007 provided no evidence that propyphenazone sorption occurs in groundwater and that there were no visible degradation processes present in sterile samples of groundwater zuehlke et al 2007 burke et al 2013 also showed that propyphenazone concentrations are only degraded biologically on the basis of these investigations zuehlke et al 2007 burke et al 2013 we can postulate that the one of the possible reasons for degradation of propyphenazone in our experiment depends on a certain type of microorganism present in the uz which may be a good topic for further research 3 2 2 caffeine caffeine is a very mobile compound and is rapidly transformed and degraded which is also reflected in the curves from the tracer experiment fig 2 concentrations of caffeine at almost all sampling points begin to diminish from the beginning of the experiment in june 2010 onwards the highest concentrations were detected at the measuring points in the lysimeter closest to the surface at jv 1 5 days and jv 3 13 days the fastest caffeine flow is on average 0 098 m day while the dominant velocity for caffeine averages from 0 0123 to 0 0714 m day the transport parameters for the observation points where calculation was possible are shown in table 5 fig 5 shows the inverse caffeine models for these points jv 2 jv 3 jv 5 jv 6 jv 8 jv 9 the curves clearly indicate low sorption and rapid degradation nse coefficient models for caffeine are on average 73 kd was calculated in the interval between 0 and 0 096 lkg 1 with the average at 0 027 lkg 1 the average degradation constant μ is 0 185 day 1 the highest μ of 0 42 day 1 in the model was determined at the measuring point jv 2 in the upper part closest to the surface the lowest value μ 0 01 day 1 was determined in the lower part of the lysimeter at the measuring point jv 9 the average half life of caffeine in the lysimeter is 14 6 days from the results we find that caffeine was highly degradable with low sorption capacity kd this was also reported by sotelo et al 2014 in column experiments under different operating conditions the same results were reported by kiecak et al 2019 in laboratory experiments with different sediment types where sorption for caffeine was negligible kiecak et al 2019 discovered in different sediment types that the most crucial factors affecting caffeine sorption are cation exchange capacity and specific surface area on the other hand karnjanapiboonwong et al 2010 found that organic matter in soils had the greatest effect on the sorption of caffeine which however is not significant for our coarse gravel uz such behaviour for caffeine can be explained by its higher water solubility low molecular size and weight and lower octanol water partition coefficient redding et al 2009 sotelo et al 2014 during the course of our study we had no opportunity to measure the products of caffeine degradation if we look at the results of other studies williams and mclain 2012 we can assume that a variety of degradation products would likely be identified in the unsaturated zone 3 2 3 carbamazepine carbamazepine first appears on the 5th day after tracer injection in observation point jv 3 higher tracer values were detected from the 76th day onwards at the upper sampling points in the lysimeter jv 2 jv 3 jv 5 the maximum concentrations were identified from day 162 jv 2 jv 3 to day 246 jv 9 around 400 days after tracer injection carbamazepine concentrations again began to rise rapidly at all observed points the experiment ended before the breakthrough curve came back down however such development indicates the persistence of carbamazepine the average dominant velocity for carbamazepine ranges from 0 0118 to 0 0217 m day the fastest average flow velocity is set at 0 0886 m day in the presented study the carbamazepine breakthrough curves fig 2 exhibit an irregular shape which may be the result of several factors it is difficult to determine which process has an impact on carbamazepine transport and to what extent some sampling points closer to the surface from jv 1 to jv 6 reveal a visible link between carbamazepine concentrations and the amount of precipitation after precipitation carbamazepine concentrations increase in certain parts the transport of carbamazepine in the soil is controlled by various mechanisms that cannot be modelled using relatively simple advection dispersion models and hydrus 1d inverse modelling could not be applied it is presumed that the persistent increases of carbamazepine concentrations are the result of sorption desorption processes with sorption we see the immobilization of a substance dissolved in water on the surface of the grains in the aquifer while desorption releases the substance back into the solution a portion of the substance is always unavailable for transport since it is fixed to the soil particles only that part of the carbamazepine that is dissolved in the water can be transported away as soon as that part of the originally absorbed carbamazepine dissolves it can also be transported these processes can slow transport down as part of the tracer is immobilized in its solid phase part of the time of the three pharmaceuticals included in this study carbamazepine is the most documented compound in the literature and is known to be persistent in the environment as indicated previously results appear contradictory at certain points banzhaf et al 2012 chefetz et al 2008 kiecak et al 2019 scheytt et al 2005 banzhaf et al 2012 observed retardation of carbamazepine in a column experiment which was explained by sorption as the dominant transport process chefetz et al 2008 reported non linear sorption isotherms with kf values of 0 9 mgkg 1 and 12 7 mgkg 1 for sediment samples of low 0 94 and high 8 13 organic carbon similar observations were reported by drillia et al 2005 where the lowest sorption kf 0 5 lkg 1 values were obtained for sediments with low organic content higher sorption was linked to sediments with high organic content the highest of which were for sludge kf 49 lkg 1 for carbamazepine kiecak et al 2019 found no correlation between toc and sorption coefficient also scheytt et al 2005 described low or negligible retardation of carbamazepine due to sorption scheytt et al 2005 3 3 comparison of transport properties of propyphenazone caffeine and carbamazepine the evaluative comparison of the transport properties of all three selected pharmaceuticals in the unsaturated zone showed that they behave very differently fig 2 in the case of propyphenazone and caffeine the signal damping with depth and time is the result of transformation reactions sorption and degradation caffeine sorption is very low average kd 0 027 lkg 1 followed by propyphenazone sorption average kd 0 070 lkg 1 the carbamazepine concentrations begin to increase after 90 days towards the end of the experiment indicating the persistence of carbamazepine in the uz propyphenazone exhibits fig 2 a dynamic similar to the water flow in the uz as the breakthrough curves closely correspond with the curves of the deuterium a slight retardation is observed indicating solubility and mobility in the unsaturated zone concentrations of caffeine tend to fall from the beginning of the tracer experiment onwards the breakthrough curves indicate a highly mobile compound that is rapidly transformed and degraded the breakthrough curves for carbamazepine which is the most persistent of the three tested compounds fig 2 are irregular in shape with numerous peaks the breakthrough curves for carbamazepine show that transport depends on various different and complex mechanisms comparison of the transport properties of all three pharmaceuticals shows that carbamazepine has the highest sorption capacity off all three as expected all three compounds are mobile in the uz the maximum kd of propyphenazone and caffeine in our study were determined at 0 1 lkg 1 for propyphenazone average 0 070 lkg 1 and 0 096 lkg 1 for caffeine average 0 027 lkg 1 according to the literature max kd values table 6 of carbamazepine have been determined at 6 3 lkg 1 navon et al 2011 however we were not able to determine kd for carbamazepine in the course of our study the occurrence and transport of contaminants in the environment as well as in groundwater is also affected by degradation and transformation processes if we compare the first order transformation constant and t1 2 of our three selected compounds it can be concluded that carbamazepine exhibits the greatest persistence the maximum published t1 2 value table 6 for carbamazepine was 820 0 days kodešová et al 2016 which is almost ten times greater than the determined t1 2 for propyphenazone 92 4 in our study caffeine exhibits the highest t1 2 at 69 3 days which means it is the most degradable of all three substances the lowest t1 2 for caffeine in our model is 1 65 days while for propyphenazone it is 23 9 days and for carbamazepine 46 2 days this also explains why carbamazepine is frequently detected in groundwater all over the world and typically at higher concentrations 4 conclusions determining the hydraulic properties of materials and transport of pollutants in the coarse gravel uz remains a challenge in our research the transport parameters of water and three pharmaceuticals carbamazepine caffeine and propyphenazone in the coarse gravel uz were studied by means of a tracer experiment above the lysimeter under natural conditions we found that total flow in the coarse gravel uz consists of slow and fast components which can be understood conceptually as dispersive and preferential flow components the largest proportion of preferential flow occurs in the upper parts of the uz while the proportion of preferential flow drops as depth increases we interpret small fractions of the uz as having a major influence on the slow flow and the presence of coarse gravel as the reason for the preferential fast flow effect the transport properties of all three pharmaceuticals in the uz were estimated based on the results of the inverse models using hydrus 1 d the transport properties of propyphenazone and caffeine were modelled the breakthrough curves for carbamazepine are irregular in shape and reflect high sorption capacity but they cannot be modelled using the advection dispersion model it can be assumed that the impulsive irregular increases of carbamazepine concentrations are the result of sorption desorption processes where the compound is immobilized on the surface of the sediment grains and occasionally released this release behaviour appears rather random but must be investigated in more detail in the future caffeine has the lowest sorption capacity of the three compounds while it also exhibits the fastest degradation the results for the propyphenazone show similar transport characteristics tracer experiments in lysimeters under natural conditions have together with inverse numerical modelling been shown to be effective in estimating groundwater flow and solute transport characteristics in the coarse gravel

18038,among the emerging contaminants today pharmaceuticals are some of the most demanding chemical compounds when it comes to understanding their transport within aquifers the transport of pharmaceuticals in an unsaturated zone is influenced by many factors including compound sorption and degradation which is essential in assessing contaminant migration in soil and groundwater coarse gravel aquifers are particularly important for drinking water sources and industrial water supply globally little data on the transport characteristics of coarse gravel unsaturated zones is available however such data is crucial to understanding the transport of pollutants and to implementing the appropriate management strategies to protect the aquifers in this article we present tracer experiments employed to determine pharmaceutical transport parameters in the coarse gravel unsaturated zone the tracer experiment was performed as a multi tracer exercise where deuterated water was infiltrated as a conservative tracer to define the characteristics of the unsaturated zone together with pharmaceuticals propyphenazone caffeine and carbamazepine as reactive tracers based on the breakthrough curves measured at various depths inverse modelling in combination with analytical and numerical methods hydrus 1d was performed hydraulic parameters for the unsaturated zone were estimated linear sorption coefficients kd and degradation half lives t1 2 were evaluated for each pharmaceutical in the unsaturated zone of the coarse gravel aquifer caffeine has the lowest sorption capacity mean kd 0 027 lkg 1 while the sorption coefficient of propyphenazone is higher kd 0 07 lkg 1 results for the degradation constant of the first order and t1 2 indicate that caffeine has the fastest decay rate highest t1 2 69 3 days followed by propyphenazone highest t1 2 92 4 days the parameters for carbamazepine could not be determined using an advection dispersion equation graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceuticals unsaturated zone coarse gravel aquifer van genuchten model transport parameters tracer experiment 1 introduction organic compounds have been recognized as an important contributing factor in the larger environmental pollution scheme lapworth et al 2012 stuart et al 2012 this group includes personal care products pesticides veterinary products food additives nanomaterials and industrial as well as pharmaceutical residues fent et al 2006 pomati 2008 relyea 2009 water movement and solute transport in an unsaturated zone uz is a key process that affects both the quantity and quality of groundwater the transport of pharmaceuticals in uzs in general is not well known owing to their complex behaviour and depends on the molecular structure of the compounds and the prevailing environmental conditions lapworth et al 2012 the transport of pharmaceuticals in an aquifer is influenced by many factors including compound sorption on soil particles and their degradation the most common approach in determining reactive processes involves batch and column experiments in the laboratory under determined experimental conditions banzhaf and hebig 2016 kiecak et al 2019 however fewer experiments are performed in or under actual environmental field conditions there is also a lack of information in the literature on the physical and hydraulic properties of the coarse grained materials in the uz they are generally poorly understood owing to their relative inaccessibility dann et al 2009 their heterogeneous nature dann et al 2009 and the general lack of research in this area thoma et al 2014 the standard methods allow for the determination of physical and hydraulic properties of soil particles smaller than 2 mm which is why experiments on coarse particle soils gravel are far more complex owing to the heterogeneity of the geological media in some gravel uzs preferential flows are also present alongside dispersive flows nimmo 2005 the preferential flow path has a higher vertical water flow velocity short transit time which could rapidly transport the pollutant deeper and contaminate the groundwater while dispersive flow is characterized by large amounts of water transported relatively slowly through the uz the issue consists in determining the flow system through the coarse gravel uz and the geochemical processes that occur within it sorption coefficients together with pharmaceutical half lives and other conditions e g soil hydraulic geological hydro geological and climatic may be used to assess potential groundwater contamination various studies have reported the sorption of different pharmaceuticals in a uz as a consequence of ionization changes in ph srinivasan et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 contact with mineral surfaces martínez hernández et al 2017 and the presence of clay minerals gao and pedersen 2005 all of which influence compound sorption sorption processes which describe the sorptive exchange between water and solid phases can be characterized using a distribution coefficient kd schwarzenbach et al 2005 they are often modelled using a linear isotherm and a distribution coefficient kd kiecak et al 2019 which is considered an approximation limousin et al 2007 other sorption models do not consider sorption linearity according to al khazrajy and boxall 2016 and paul et al 2013 the sorption model we choose to use depends on site specific factors literature presents a wide range of sorption coefficients and half lives for different compounds which increases the uncertainty involved in applying laboratory results to regional scale cases of pollution kiecak et al 2019 there is also a lack of information in the literature regarding the transport of pharmaceuticals in coarse grained and highly permeable sediments as a result experiments dealing with the coarse gravel unsaturated zones of aquifers under actual environmental conditions are considered far more valuable in our research the transport parameters of water and three selected pharmaceuticals propyphenazone caffeine and carbamazepine in a coarse gravel uz were studied using a tracer experiment transport values for all three pharmaceuticals all of which have different physical and chemical properties have been reported by other authors but none of them have studied their properties in a coarse gravel uz the tracer experiment was performed using a lysimeter facility in the selniška dobrava aquifer n slovenia in order to determine the hydraulic characteristics of the uz deuterated water which has been proven to be an appropriate conservative tracer in coarse gravel uzs was used leis and benischke 2004 mali et al 2007 mali and koroša 2015 inverse model simulations using hydrus 1 d šimunek et al 2010 were used to estimate these characteristics based on the properties estimated for the uz the transport properties of carbamazepine propyphenazone and caffeine were determined inverse modelling is commonly used in solute transport where analytical solutions are matched against observed data using the inverse model approach allows the unknown model parameters to be optimized by comparing model simulations against observed data at different scales from both soil column experiments sprenger et al 2015 stumpp et al 2012 and from field scale experiments mali et al 2007 dane and hruska 1983 the transport parameters from experiments in field scale are more representative of real conditions than studies made of soil cores in columns vanderborght and vereecken 2007 the aims of the presented study were to 1 determine the uz hydraulic properties of a coarse gravel uz using a tracer experiment 2 analyse transport of selected pharmaceuticals in a coarse gravel uz under real environmental conditions and 3 characterize the sorption and 4 the degradation half lives of three selected pharmaceuticals in the coarse gravel uz under natural conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 general settings the lysimeter is located at the coarse gravel aquifer in selniška dobrava in the north east of slovenia fig 1 the area has a moderate continental climate with a typical continental precipitation regime and an average annual rainfall of 1250 mm the average annual air temperature is 10 c mali and janža 2005 the intergranular aquifer has a high yield and average saturated hydraulic conductivity of 5 10 3 m s mali et al 2005 mali 2006 mali and janža 2005 the thickness of the coarse gravel deposit is estimated at up to 50 m the groundwater table is positioned at an average depth of 25 37 m below the surface depending on the surface morphology mali et al 2005 mali 2006 the surface at the lysimeter location is covered with grass surrounded by a mixed forest the characteristics of the uz at this location are presented in table 1 the soil on the surface was defined as distric cambisol with saturated hydraulic conductivity of 1 5 4 5 10 5 m s while the

detailed description of the lysimeter is provided in previously published papers mali et al 2007 mali and urbanc 2009 deuterium was used as a conservative tracer for water movement and the

pain killer and is used in combination with paracetamol and caffeine in particular for the treatment of febrile conditions and various pains scheytt et al 2006 little exists in the form of published

domestic waste water seiler et al 1999 and is frequently detected in groundwater impacted by sewage effluent godfrey et al 2007 seiler et al 1999 teijon et al 2010 owing to caffeine s properties concentrations in surface water are significantly higher than in groundwater auersperger et al 2011 the presence of caffeine in surface waters is a direct indication of human sourced pollution buerge et al 2003 caffeine is a relatively polar molecule and carbon in nature generally favours the adsorption of non polar compounds rather than polar ones sotelo et al 2014 caffeine sorption and degradation was studied by kiecak et al 2019 williams and mclain 2012 and karnjanapiboonwong et al 2010 who reported that caffeine transport proceeded independently of soil clay and organic carbon content other studies have reported low caffeine adsorption capacity redding et al 2009 sotelo et al 2014 transformation rates that have a greater impact on caffeine transport have been reported by williams and mclain 2012 carbamazepine table 2 is an anti epileptic drug used globally and applied to treat partial seizures trigeminal neuralgia manic depression and explosive aggression liu et al

belitz 2011 godfrey et al 2007 koroša et al 2016 li 2014 loos et al 2010 mali et al 2017 2 4 sampling during the period april to january 2012 samples were taken to detect caffeine carbamazepine propyphenazone and δ2h in the uz water during the first period april to july 2010 samples were collected at 14 day intervals after which the sampling period was extended to one month during which time a total of 24 samplings were performed the samples for determination of δ2h were stored in 120 ml plastic bottles the water used for pharmaceutical analysis was sampled by pipetting the samples in 1000 ml glass bottles of ultrapure water the investigated compounds are often found in personal care products and medicines therefore rigorous quality control qc in the sampling process needs to be observed both in the field and in the laboratory sampling personnel should avoid using products containing compounds of interest to prevent secondary contamination of samples during sampling e g drinking coffee and consuming other products containing caffeine carbamazepine and propyphenazone 2 5 analytical methods δ2h was measured in continuous flow mode by chromium reduction using a ceramic reactor slightly modified from morrison et al 2001 measurements were made in the laboratory at joanneum research forschungsgesellschaft mbh institute of water resources management hydrogeology and geophysics graz austria a more detailed analytical method for deuterium is described by mali et al 2007 concentrations of caffeine carbamazepine and propyphenazone in sampled water were determined using a variation on the epa 525 2 method based on solid phase extraction spe and the use of gas chromatography with mass spectrometry gc ms analyses were carried out in the laboratory of the water supply company vodovod kanalizacija ljubljana slovenia a more detailed description of the method is given by auersperger et al 2005 2 6 numerical model setup 2 6 1 unsaturated zone parameter estimation the δ2h values expressed as had to be converted in a concentration of tracer mg l for the inverse modelling process the concentrations of 2h expressed as mg l were calculated from the equation published by becker and coplen 2001 with consideration taken of the influence of water density mali et al 2007 δ 2 h 34 721 1000 δ d v s m o w 1000 the first step consisted in visual analysis of the data using graphical representation based on the shape of the deuterium tracer breakthrough curves it was concluded that total flow q tot consists of two components a fast component and a slow component we have quantified the relation between them using the simple mixing model q tot x fast q fast x slow q slow where x fast x slow 1 represents the share of each flow component respectively in general the definite fast flow component can be considered as preferential flow and the slow flow component as dispersive flow but in some cases the differences between components can be the result of rain events the fast and slow flow components on the deuterium breakthrough curves were separated by fitting the advection dispersion slug pulse model after sauty 1980 to the terminal part of the experimental breakthrough curve the analytical model was considered the model for the slow flow component q slow once the analytical model and the experimental curve matched the data fitting analytical model was removed with the remaining part representing the fast flow component q fast the shares of the flows x fast q fast and x slow q slow were defined based on the total masses of deuterium expressed as an integral of the breakthrough curve of the component for some curves separation of the fast and slow flow components was not appropriate therefore in the following modelling steps those empirical breakthrough curves were considered as total breakthrough curves due to the lack of data which was the result of interrupted outflows and the low number of samples the results from two sample sites jv 1 jv 4 were not considered deuterium breakthrough curves of slow flow component fast flow component and total breakthrough curves where separation was not possible were used to determine the physical parameters of the unsaturated zone water flow in the uz was simulated by applying the richards equation using the hydrus 1d software package šimunek et al 2010 which was modified for deuterium transport stumpp et al 2012 deuterium transport was calculated using the advection dispersion equation without retention which assumes a single porous medium and is the most widely used model for predicting solute transport in soils under field conditions vanderborght and vereecken 2007 parameters were determined with inverse model from breakthrough curve of deuterium from deuterium results were determined saturated volumetric water content θs inverse of capillary fringe thickness α shape parameters n and m and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks the physical parameters of the mualem van genuchten model were estimated for each sampling point and applied for the parametrization process van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 the uz profiles were defined as homogenous horizons that were discretized into 101 nodes the depth of the simulation was depending on the depth of the lysimeter determined to be 500 cm according to the properties of the uz on the experimental site residual water content θr was set to zero in order to reduce the number of optimized parameters this can be justified also by the fact that it has no significant influence on transport longitudinal dispersivity α l in the model was determined for each sampling point using the equation αl 1 75d50 xu and eckstein 1997 data for average particle size d50 was obtained from a previous analysis of grain size mali 2006 the upper boundary condition was determined using the variable atmospheric condition atmospheric boundary condition with surface runoff and free drainage was used as the lower boundary condition for water flow and solutes šimunek et al 2010 all long term precipitation data used for the models is taken from the maribor measurement station slovenian environment agency 1971 2000 evapotranspiration data was estimated by the slovenian environment agency 1971 2000 based on the penman monteith equation allan et al 1998 for each day from 1 january 2010 to 1 may 2011 2 6 2 pharmaceuticals sorption and degradation parameter estimation basic figures for pharmaceutical transport were calculated based on injection time time of first tracer appearance time of highest concentration and distance between the top of the lysimeter and the observation point käss 1998 based on the physical parameters of the mualem van genuchten model defined for each sampling point in the uz the inverse advection dispersion model embedded in hydrus 1d šimunek et al 2010 was used to model pharmaceutical transport sorption coefficients were determined using a linear sorption isotherm appelo and postma 2007 kiecak et al 2019 and the first order rate of transformation was also determined for each pharmaceutical the first order transformation constant is related to the half life t1 2 of the individual substance dykaar and kitanidis 1996 walker 1974 analysis was performed and parameters defined for propyphenazone and caffeine based on the results of the experiment the transport parameters for carbamazepine cannot be defined using the advection dispersion model 2 6 3 modelling efficiency nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used to model efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 n s e 1 y 0 y p 2 y 0 y 0 2 where y 0 and y p are the observed and simulated values at a given time t and y 0 is the mean observed value over the entire observation period an efficiency value of 1 nse 1 corresponds to a perfect match of the modelled values to the observed data an efficiency value of 0 nse 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observed data whereas an efficiency of less than zero nse 0 occurs when the observed mean proves a better predictor than the model the matching of simulated data was determined by comparing observed and simulated values for each sampling point 3 results and discussion 3 1 unsaturated zone properties the deuterium tracer and all three observed pharmaceuticals were detected in all ten sampling points sampling drains higher values for all tracers occurred in the first sample after tracer injection based on the analysed results it was possible to construct breakthrough curves for all observation points which together with precipitation values at the time of the tracer experiment are presented in fig 2 the breakthrough curves show the different behaviours of the studied substances it is evident that the high intensity and amount of precipitation forced all tracers at all of the different observation points to appear at the same time the hydraulic and transport parameters for each sampling point as well as a share of slow and fast flow components are summarized in table 3 the largest proportion of the fast flow component occurs at the upper sampling site jv 3 while the proportion of the fast flow component drops with depth table 3 the estimated parameters are as follows θs is 0 38 0 51 α is 0 027 0 03 1 cm n is 1 25 1 38 ks is 4 03x10 4 5 9 10 3 m s and longitudinal dispersivity αl is 4 52 cm the lower points in the lysimeter have higher water content than the points at the top of the lysimeter ks values for the fast flow and slow flow components differ with the differences inside the same decade with the exception of sampling point jv 3 these differences are also reflected in transport parameters renshaw et al 2003 reported that some amount of preferential flow can occur through the soil profile even during relatively small storms while the faster flow component is also present in our case fig 2 dispersivity values for each sampling point soil horizon were calculated and are scale dependent where higher dispersivity values may also be the result of a finer textured soil with more clay vanderborght and vereecken 2007 the calculated values for dispersivity are comparable to values found in similar experiments vanderborght and vereecken 2007 reported dispersivity values in coarse sediments ranging from 2 to 20 cm for field experiments and transport distances from 80 to 200 cm in column experiments tracer recovery was estimated based on outflow water volumes and 2h concentrations a total of 3 47 of the initial tracer was intercepted the largest quantities of intercepted deuterium tracer appeared at sampling points jv 8 jv 10 and jv 9 representing 31 23 and 15 of the total amount of recovered tracer respectively drainages in a lysimeter do not cover the entire space and therefore lysimeter can t be treated as a closed system this is the reason why recovery rate is relatively low nse is set between 82 and 98 the best modelling efficiencies were obtained with the simulations at sampling points jv 5 and jv 6 fig 3 results from the modelling show fig 3 that together with the fast flow component which is the result of coarse gravel 60 70 in the lower part of the uz an important part of the flow is represented by the slow flow component which in turn indicates that small grain fractions have a significant influence on the flow of water the results of our tracer experiment indicate infiltration and flow heterogeneity in the coarse gravel uz which was also observed in other studies öhrström et al 2004 reported highly heterogeneous flow patterns for tracer experiments in a sandy loam under steady state irrigation conditions similar results were observed by williams et al 2003 who found preferential flow patterns in a grassy field during steady state irrigation experiments 3 2 transport of pharmaceuticals in the unsaturated zone fig 2 shows breakthrough curves for propypheanzone caffeine and carbamazepines with precipitations during tracer experiments above the lysimeter the results are shown as relative values in relation to the maximum values for each compound at each sampling point estimates of the fastest flow velocity are important in assessing the probability of the fastest effect of pollution on the aquifer through the unsaturated zone 3 2 1 propyphenazone propyphenazone breakthrough curves are presented in fig 2 the shapes of the curves are similar to those for the δ2h values concentrations in traces at sampling points jv 2 jv 3 and jv 5 in the upper part of the lysimeter were detected from the 5th day after tracer injection on and from the 76th day on at the other points the maximum values of the individual breakthrough curves appear from august 2010 at the sampling point jv 2 133 days since injection and jv 3 13 days since injection through january 2011 at the sampling point jv 10 280 days since injection fig 2 calculated average dominant flow velocities range from 5 10 3 to 2 4 10 3 m day the highest velocity for propyphenazone in the tracer experiment was on average estimated at 8 8 10 2 m day inverse models jv 2 jv 3 jv 5 jv 6 and jv 9 for propyphenazone are presented in fig 4 the adsorption coefficient kd for propyphenazone in our model was calculated at an average of 0 07 lkg 1 min 0 021 lkg 1 max 0 1 lkg 1 the efficiency of the models nse for propyphenazone ranges from 82 to 93 propyphenazone transport property values for every sampling point in the lysimeter are shown in table 5 the average first order rate constant for propyphenazone is estimated at 1 7 10 2 day 1 the maximum modelled value was 2 9 10 2 day 1 in the upper layers jv 3 and the minimum 8 0 10 3 day 1 jv 5 the average half life is estimated at 51 2 days table 4 few experiments involving propyphenazone have been published scheytt et al 2006 and burke et al 2013 observed higher propyphenazone kd values in sand column experiments than in ours at between 0 227 lkg 1 in unsaturated conditions scheytt et al 2006 and 0 28 lkg 1 in sterilized sediment burke et al 2013 these results are almost three times higher than the maximum values from our model however batch experiments performed by zuehlke et al 2007 provided no evidence that propyphenazone sorption occurs in groundwater and that there were no visible degradation processes present in sterile samples of groundwater zuehlke et al 2007 burke et al 2013 also showed that propyphenazone concentrations are only degraded biologically on the basis of these investigations zuehlke et al 2007 burke et al 2013 we can postulate that the one of the possible reasons for degradation of propyphenazone in our experiment depends on a certain type of microorganism present in the uz which may be a good topic for further research 3 2 2 caffeine caffeine is a very mobile compound and is rapidly transformed and degraded which is also reflected in the curves from the tracer experiment fig 2 concentrations of caffeine at almost all sampling points begin to diminish from the beginning of the experiment in june 2010 onwards the highest concentrations were detected at the measuring points in the lysimeter closest to the surface at jv 1 5 days and jv 3 13 days the fastest caffeine flow is on average 0 098 m day while the dominant velocity for caffeine averages from 0 0123 to 0 0714 m day the transport parameters for the observation points where calculation was possible are shown in table 5 fig 5 shows the inverse caffeine models for these points jv 2 jv 3 jv 5 jv 6 jv 8 jv 9 the curves clearly indicate low sorption and rapid degradation nse coefficient models for caffeine are on average 73 kd was calculated in the interval between 0 and 0 096 lkg 1 with the average at 0 027 lkg 1 the average degradation constant μ is 0 185 day 1 the highest μ of 0 42 day 1 in the model was determined at the measuring point jv 2 in the upper part closest to the surface the lowest value μ 0 01 day 1 was determined in the lower part of the lysimeter at the measuring point jv 9 the average half life of caffeine in the lysimeter is 14 6 days from the results we find that caffeine was highly degradable with low sorption capacity kd this was also reported by sotelo et al 2014 in column experiments under different operating conditions the same results were reported by kiecak et al 2019 in laboratory experiments with different sediment types where sorption for caffeine was negligible kiecak et al 2019 discovered in different sediment types that the most crucial factors affecting caffeine sorption are cation exchange capacity and specific surface area on the other hand karnjanapiboonwong et al 2010 found that organic matter in soils had the greatest effect on the sorption of caffeine which however is not significant for our coarse gravel uz such behaviour for caffeine can be explained by its higher water solubility low molecular size and weight and lower octanol water partition coefficient redding et al 2009 sotelo et al 2014 during the course of our study we had no opportunity to measure the products of caffeine degradation if we look at the results of other studies williams and mclain 2012 we can assume that a variety of degradation products would likely be identified in the unsaturated zone 3 2 3 carbamazepine carbamazepine first appears on the 5th day after tracer injection in observation point jv 3 higher tracer values were detected from the 76th day onwards at the upper sampling points in the lysimeter jv 2 jv 3 jv 5 the maximum concentrations were identified from day 162 jv 2 jv 3 to day 246 jv 9 around 400 days after tracer injection carbamazepine concentrations again began to rise rapidly at all observed points the experiment ended before the breakthrough curve came back down however such development indicates the persistence of carbamazepine the average dominant velocity for carbamazepine ranges from 0 0118 to 0 0217 m day the fastest average flow velocity is set at 0 0886 m day in the presented study the carbamazepine breakthrough curves fig 2 exhibit an irregular shape which may be the result of several factors it is difficult to determine which process has an impact on carbamazepine transport and to what extent some sampling points closer to the surface from jv 1 to jv 6 reveal a visible link between carbamazepine concentrations and the amount of precipitation after precipitation carbamazepine concentrations increase in certain parts the transport of carbamazepine in the soil is controlled by various mechanisms that cannot be modelled using relatively simple advection dispersion models and hydrus 1d inverse modelling could not be applied it is presumed that the persistent increases of carbamazepine concentrations are the result of sorption desorption processes with sorption we see the immobilization of a substance dissolved in water on the surface of the grains in the aquifer while desorption releases the substance back into the solution a portion of the substance is always unavailable for transport since it is fixed to the soil particles only that part of the carbamazepine that is dissolved in the water can be transported away as soon as that part of the originally absorbed carbamazepine dissolves it can also be transported these processes can slow transport down as part of the tracer is immobilized in its solid phase part of the time of the three pharmaceuticals included in this study carbamazepine is the most documented compound in the literature and is known to be persistent in the environment as indicated previously results appear contradictory at certain points banzhaf et al 2012 chefetz et al 2008 kiecak et al 2019 scheytt et al 2005 banzhaf et al 2012 observed retardation of carbamazepine in a column experiment which was explained by sorption as the dominant transport process chefetz et al 2008 reported non linear sorption isotherms with kf values of 0 9 mgkg 1 and 12 7 mgkg 1 for sediment samples of low 0 94 and high 8 13 organic carbon similar observations were reported by drillia et al 2005 where the lowest sorption kf 0 5 lkg 1 values were obtained for sediments with low organic content higher sorption was linked to sediments with high organic content the highest of which were for sludge kf 49 lkg 1 for carbamazepine kiecak et al 2019 found no correlation between toc and sorption coefficient also scheytt et al 2005 described low or negligible retardation of carbamazepine due to sorption scheytt et al 2005 3 3 comparison of transport properties of propyphenazone caffeine and carbamazepine the evaluative comparison of the transport properties of all three selected pharmaceuticals in the unsaturated zone showed that they behave very differently fig 2 in the case of propyphenazone and caffeine the signal damping with depth and time is the result of transformation reactions sorption and degradation caffeine sorption is very low average kd 0 027 lkg 1 followed by propyphenazone sorption average kd 0 070 lkg 1 the carbamazepine concentrations begin to increase after 90 days towards the end of the experiment indicating the persistence of carbamazepine in the uz propyphenazone exhibits fig 2 a dynamic similar to the water flow in the uz as the breakthrough curves closely correspond with the curves of the deuterium a slight retardation is observed indicating solubility and mobility in the unsaturated zone concentrations of caffeine tend to fall from the beginning of the tracer experiment onwards the breakthrough curves indicate a highly mobile compound that is rapidly transformed and degraded the breakthrough curves for carbamazepine which is the most persistent of the three tested compounds fig 2 are irregular in shape with numerous peaks the breakthrough curves for carbamazepine show that transport depends on various different and complex mechanisms comparison of the transport properties of all three pharmaceuticals shows that carbamazepine has the highest sorption capacity off all three as expected all three compounds are mobile in the uz the maximum kd of propyphenazone and caffeine in our study were determined at 0 1 lkg 1 for propyphenazone average 0 070 lkg 1 and 0 096 lkg 1 for caffeine average 0 027 lkg 1 according to the literature max kd values table 6 of carbamazepine have been determined at 6 3 lkg 1 navon et al 2011 however we were not able to determine kd for carbamazepine in the course of our study the occurrence and transport of contaminants in the environment as well as in groundwater is also affected by degradation and transformation processes if we compare the first order transformation constant and t1 2 of our three selected compounds it can be concluded that carbamazepine exhibits the greatest persistence the maximum published t1 2 value table 6 for carbamazepine was 820 0 days kodešová et al 2016 which is almost ten times greater than the determined t1 2 for propyphenazone 92 4 in our study caffeine exhibits the highest t1 2 at 69 3 days which means it is the most degradable of all three substances the lowest t1 2 for caffeine in our model is 1 65 days while for propyphenazone it is 23 9 days and for carbamazepine 46 2 days this also explains why carbamazepine is frequently detected in groundwater all over the world and typically at higher concentrations 4 conclusions determining the hydraulic properties of materials and transport of pollutants in the coarse gravel uz remains a challenge in our research the transport parameters of water and three pharmaceuticals carbamazepine caffeine and propyphenazone in the coarse gravel uz were studied by means of a tracer experiment above the lysimeter under natural conditions we found that total flow in the coarse gravel uz consists of slow and fast components which can be understood conceptually as dispersive and preferential flow components the largest proportion of preferential flow occurs in the upper parts of the uz while the proportion of preferential flow drops as depth increases we interpret small fractions of the uz as having a major influence on the slow flow and the presence of coarse gravel as the reason for the preferential fast flow effect the transport properties of all three pharmaceuticals in the uz were estimated based on the results of the inverse models using hydrus 1 d the transport properties of propyphenazone and caffeine were modelled the breakthrough curves for carbamazepine are irregular in shape and reflect high sorption capacity but they cannot be modelled using the advection dispersion model it can be assumed that the impulsive irregular increases of carbamazepine concentrations are the result of sorption desorption processes where the compound is immobilized on the surface of the sediment grains and occasionally released this release behaviour appears rather random but must be investigated in more detail in the future caffeine has the lowest sorption capacity of the three compounds while it also exhibits the fastest degradation the results for the propyphenazone show similar transport characteristics tracer experiments in lysimeters under natural conditions have together with inverse numerical modelling been shown to be effective in estimating groundwater flow and solute transport characteristics in the coarse gravel

mehg compounds in wastewaters mehg can cause severe ecotoxicological effects through bioaccumulation and its high toxicity thereby endangering humans via the food chain behra et al 1993 1994 mahbub et al 2017 the reported mehg concentrations in raw wastewater range from 0 4 to 7 5 ng l and they can be up to 2 ng l in treated wastewater but are often very low due to a combination of limited occurrence and or efficient degradation along the treatment chain balogh and nollet 2008a bodaly et al 1998 gilmour and bloom 1995 mao et al 2016 however unlike thg mehg is often less effectively retained in sewage sludge 30 98 balogh and nollet 2008a 2008b bodaly et al 1998 gbondo tugbawa et al 2010 gilmour and bloom 1995 stoichev et al 2009 which may reflect the rather low binding affinity of mehg to suspended solids based on the available studies e g balogh and nollet 2008b bodaly et al 1998 fricke et al 2015 perusini 2016 effluents of wwtps are currently expected to be of minor importance in terms of the fluxes of hg that currently occur in surface waters however comprehensive studies to substantiate this assumption are lacking in this context switzerland is uniquely suited for studies aimed at quantifying the contribution of wwtp effluents to hg loads in surface waters nearly the entire swiss population 98 oecd 2013 is connected to wastewater treatment systems and all major rivers have their origin in the country and are routinely monitored thereby enabling the establishment of a rigorous mass balance therefore in the present study we quantified the hg concentrations in both the raw and the treated wastewaters from representative wwtps in switzerland we first screened samples from 64 wwtps in a pre study in 2016 and then focused on a subset of 28 wwtps in 2017 for detailed sampling and investigation we further determined the hg speciation in the sewage sludge and assessed changes in concentrations and speciation along the different steps of the wastewater treatment process in a state of the art wwtp with this dataset we were able to estimate i the total and per capita hg loads to wwtps ii the hg removal efficiencies of wwtps and iii the overall contribution of wwtp effluents to the riverine hg load on a national scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 studied wwtps and sample collection the locations and catchments of the studied wwtps are shown in fig 1 in a pre study samples from 64 wwtps were repeatedly collected in january june and july 2016 vriens et al 2017 raw wastewater sewage sludge and treated wastewater were collected again from 28 of the same wwtps in june 2017 see fig s4 characteristic properties of the investigated wwtps are listed in the supporting tables s7 and s13 the wwtps were selected to obtain a broad nationwide representation based on geographical distribution number of connected people and industries in the catchment areas vriens et al 2017 the communal and industrial wwtps from both rural and urban areas represent a total of 2 6 million connected people equivalent to 31 of the swiss population foen 2017 the wwtps all run similar mechanical and biological treatment processes with slight variations in their nitrate and phosphorus elimination schemes see table s7 the incoming raw wastewater and the outflowing treated wastewater effluent were collected as 24 h composite samples the raw wastewater was sampled after the bar screens and sand trap and the treated wastewater was collected after the final filtration step sludge treatment included anaerobic digestion with an average sludge age of 26 11 days samples were shipped and processed within 24 72 h see supporting information in addition to the samples collected from wwtps in 2017 the freeze dried sewage sludge samples collected in 2016 from 64 swiss wwtps were also analyzed for thg contents and speciation for comparison vriens et al 2017 a detailed study was conducted at the state of the art zurich werdhoelzli wwtp in august 2017 to determine hg concentrations speciation and retention along the successive treatment steps and to determine the variability in hg concentrations in the raw and the treated wastewaters over a period of eight days 24 h composite samples 15 mins flow proportional intervals 15 22 08 2017 several grab samples were also taken throughout the treatment steps on the last sampling day 2 2 sample

the maximum temperature was set at 110 c to avoid hg losses through volatilization lomonte et al 2008 the particulate fraction of hg was calculated as the difference between the total and dissolved hg concentrations sewage sludge samples were freeze dried hojdová et al 2015 homogenized in an agate mortar and digested by microwave similarly to the raw wastewaters but without h2o2 due to strong

operational information on the size of the connected population catchment area wastewater flow rates and sewage sludge quantities of all studied wwtps were obtained from the swisstopo geographic

swiss federal office for the environment foen foen 2017 river water data were obtained from the national long term surveillance of swiss rivers program naduf zobrist et al 2018 hg concentrations have been recorded since 1994 on a monthly to bi monthly basis in the rhine river at weil am rhein on the border of switzerland and germany ruff et al 2013 concentrations below the lod in wastewater and sewage sludge were replaced by lod 2 newman et al 1989 statistical analyses were carried out with originpro v 9 1 originlab corporation for correlation analysis spearman s rank correlations were performed at a significance level of 95 p 0 05 the kolmogorov smirnov test was also used to identify the variability between data sets the mann whitney paired t tests and median tests were also used for data set comparison the thg loads entering the individual wwtps with wastewater or leaving them with sludge were calculated by multiplication of the respective thg concentration ci by the daily

inflows of the 28 wwtps are shown in fig 2 a for abbreviations see table s7 they spanned two orders of magnitude from 9 to 750 ng l with a median concentration of 57 ng l average 110 ng l table 1 and table s8 the dissolved hg concentrations ranged from 0 6 to 59 ng l and accounted for 1 27 of the thg average 7 hence hg was predominantly bound to particulate matter 93 6 with a positive correlation of thg ρ 0 5 p 0 01 with total suspended solids tss 30 392 mg l when compared to studies in other countries the average thg concentration in switzerland is in the lower range and comparable with the literature values of wwtp inflows in canada england or brazil table s6 bodaly et al 1998 gardner et al 2013 hargreaves et al 2016 oliveira et al 2007 it is interesting to note that this range is 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than values recently reported in a comprehensive study of china average 3400 2600 ng l max 15 000 ng l liu et al 2018 the four swiss wwtps with the highest determined thg concentrations i e chdf visp vern and vev fig s1 are located in western switzerland figs 2a and s1 the region of chdf vern and vev is known for its watch and jewelry industry which may be a legacy source for hg however this would need further investigation as with the thg concentrations in raw wastewaters the daily loads of thg spanned over two orders of magnitude from 0 05 to 39 5 g d with an average of 4 8 7 7 g d table s8 by comparison the tss loads were 150 52 100 kg d 3 1 2 treated wastewater the thg in the treated wastewaters ranged from lod 0 3 ng l to 92 ng l fig 2a with a volumetric weighted mean concentration of 3 8 0 4 ng l table s9 these concentrations of a few tens of ng l correspond with references to wwtps that efficiently remove hg balogh and nollet 2008b bodaly et al 1998 fricke et al 2015 gbondo tugbawa et al 2010 mao et al 2016 stoichev et al 2009 see table s6 liu et al 2018 recently reported an average of 160 ng l thg in chinese effluents together with an overall 95 removal efficiency but the incoming concentrations are much higher than in switzerland see section 3 1 1 above the daily loads of thg in treated wastewater i e the wwtp effluents ranged from 3 to 950 mg d our data allowed an estimation of the wastewater derived hg discharge to surface waters for the entirety of switzerland of 13 1 3 g thg d equivalent to a per capita discharge of 1 6 0 16 μg thg capita day table 1 the relevance of wastewater derived hg discharge to the aquatic environment is discussed in section 4 1 3 1 3 hg retention efficiencies the studied wwtps reveal an overall efficient hg removal from wastewater of 85 99 7 with an average of 96 4 interestingly the lowest efficiencies 85 88 were found in wwtps that received the highest dissolved hg concentrations in their inflowing wastewaters i e 17 59 ng l dissolved hg equal to 12 17 of thg suggesting limited sorption of dissolved hg to tss and a consequently poor elimination efficiency of the dissolved hg fraction 3 2 concentrations and speciation in sewage sludge 3 2 1 thg concentrations in sewage sludge the concentrations in sludge from the 28 wwtps are plotted in fig 2b together with the percentage of mmhg the thg concentrations of the 2017 campaign ranged from 320 to 1400 ng g median 675 ng g as shown in the corresponding box plot for the wwtps studied in 2016 the thg spanned a slightly wider range from 160 to 2600 ng g median 445 ng g see fig 1 fig s4 and table s13 the variability between the two campaigns within individual wwtps was about 20 with the majority of the wwtps 16 of 28 differing by less than 10 thereby confirming small temporal variations as reported by vriens et al 2017 for other major and trace elements the measured thg concentrations are largely in line with long term monitoring data of the swiss cantons and with published data from various european countries 100 3000 ng g awel 2017 canton de vaud 2017 canton de vaud 2018 clara and scheffknecht 2016 hittinger and pichler 2007 kanton aargau 2015 wiechmann et al 2013 3 2 2 hg speciation in sewage sludge the only organic species found with gc icp ms analysis was mmhg no peaks that could correspond to ethylated or phenyl hg forms were present the mmhg concentrations in sewage sludge ranged from lod 0 11 ng g to 8 6 ng g median 0 7 ng g the gc icp ms analyses further revealed that the majority of hg was present as ihg median 84 see table s10 as shown in fig 2b mmhg represented up to 0 8 of the thg the determined mmhg concentrations are very similar to values reported in other studies from around the globe balogh and nollet 2008b bodaly et al 1998 gbondo tugbawa et al 2010 gilmour and bloom 1995 liu et al 2018 mao et al 2016 such low mmhg concentrations in the sludges suggest that mmhg in the treated wastewater is most likely below the detection limit 3 3 detailed study of hg loads and variability within the treatment process 3 3 1 wastewater treatment chain in raw wastewater of the zurich werdhoelzli wwtp which was continuously sampled for eight days the thg varied between 45 and 73 ng l on working days average 59 ng l and between 29 and 32 ng l on the weekend see fig s5 and table s11 along the treatment stages depicted in fig 3 the thg decreased from 52 16 ng l in the inflow to 22 2 ng l after the primary clarifier to 9 2 ng l after the final sand filter and to lod 0 3 ng l in the treated outflow removal efficiency 99 5 the highest thg concentrations along the treatment train 203 56 ng l were present in the return sludge which recirculates a major part of the activated sludge back to the bioreactor inflow to maintain microbial activity fig 3 this loop causes an approximately 5 fold enrichment of hg in the biological treatment stage 103 3 ng l note that the median sludge age is 27 days of the solids the suspended solids of the preliminary clarifier were the most heavily burdened with thg 416 28 ng g and hence contributed the largest share of thg in the dewatered sewage sludge 465 40 ng g fig 3 in the activated sludge treatment bioreactor which includes nitrification denitrification and phosphorus precipitation the thg in the suspended solids decreased to 163 3 ng g mmhg was also analyzed in the suspended matter and sewage sludge the concentrations were between 0 2 and 1 6 ng g accounting for 0 1 0 9 of the thg fig 3 the proportion of mmhg was therefore in the same range as found in the sewage sludge of the other 27 wwtps further mmhg remained quite stable along the different treatment steps indicating no significant transformation 3 3 2 sludge incineration the zurich werdhoelzli wwtp incinerates its own dewatered sludge 29 970 t in 2017 and sludge from other wwtps 53 670 t in 2017 with an estimated thg load of 37 1 kg y 79 720 t of sludge in 2017 465 thg ng g for the years 2016 2018 the reported thg concentration in the incineration ash was in the range of 100 430 ng g while the residues from flue gas treatment showed 100 times higher thg concentrations of 11 41 μg g schafflützel 2019 in switzerland the legal limit for thg in incineration exhaust is 0 05 mg m3 sfc 2018 the zurich werdhoelzli wwtp reported a daily average thg concentration in the exhaust gas of 0 016 mg m3 which in 2017 resulted in 1 7 kg 5 thg expelled to the atmosphere abegglen 2018 this indicates that most of the hg is volatilized in the incineration process but is then recaptured in the flue gas treatment after the separation of the fly and bottom ash van velzen et al 2002 hence the major fraction of hg is not found in the incineration ash but in the flue gas treatment residues the overall retention efficiency of the sewage sludge incineration was 95 combined with the 99 5 removal by the wastewater treatment a grand total of 95 of the hg was therefore retained by the wwtp even though some thg is expelled to the atmosphere through sludge incineration the wwtps efficiently remove most thg from wastewater and allow its storage in hazardous waste landfills 3 4 total and per capita loads in raw wastewater the weighted mean thg concentration of raw wastewaters 104 28 ng l and the total wastewater flow of switzerland gave an estimated annual hg input of 130 30 kg y table 1 for switzerland which has 8 29 million people connected foen 2017 to wwtps 98 of population in 2016 this corresponds to a per capita load of 43 11 μg capita d hence the swiss average is comparable with estimations made for austria 55 μg capita d reisinger et al 2009 the city of frankfurt 59 μg capita d fricke et al 2015 or sweden 67 μg capita d sörme and lagerkvist 2002 two of the 28 wwtps namely visp 620 μg thg capita d and la chaux de fonds chdf 210 μg thg capita d had exceptionally high per capita loads these wwtps are located in catchments that are strongly influenced by chemical and watchmaking industries by contrast for the zurich werdhoelzli wwtp that has a much smaller proportion of industrial wastewater the thg flux in the raw wastewater was 8 3 g thg d with a corresponding per capita load of 19 6 μg thg capita d table s11 since only a minor fraction of the total hg input to wwtps is released into surface waters and since most thg is retained in the sewage sludge the total mass of thg retained in the annually produced sewage sludge represents an independent estimate of the thg flow into swiss wwtp from the weighted mean thg concentration in sewage sludge and the annual swiss sludge production a thg load of 190 30 kg y was calculated table 1 this sludge based estimate is about 50 higher than the thg load calculated from thg in raw wastewater however sludge is believed to provide a better estimate since the sludge samples integrate longer time periods than the aqueous phase 4 environmental implications 4 1 relevance of wastewater derived hg discharge to the aquatic environment in the following we estimate the extent to which the discharge of wastewater can contribute to hg amounts in riverine water in 2017 the combined average flow of the four rivers that drain switzerland was 194 million m3 d naduf 2017 with the vast majority discharged by the rhine 71 and rhone 23 rivers fig 1 the total treated wastewater discharge of the 28 wwtps amounted to 1 28 million m3 d or 0 49 m3 d per capita for the 2 6 million connected people hence an amount of 4 1 million m3 d of wastewater is estimated for the entire country of switzerland 8 29 million connected population in 2017 equaling 2 1 of the average riverine discharge from switzerland as mentioned above foen 2017 recent thg measurements in swiss surface waters are scarce and the concentrations are often below the lod 10 5 ng l ritscher et al 2018 however the rhine river monitoring station at the swiss border with germany has regularly measured thg in suspended solids and in water since 1994 fig s6 for the period of 1994 2017 the range of 5 year averages of thg concentrations was 2 7 4 5 ng l with an average of 3 3 0 8 ng l in suspended solids and below lod 5 ng l for the truly dissolved thg in water mazacek 2019 yearly loads calculated from the available thg concentrations are shown in fig s6 and range from 30 to 378 kg y mean 137 90 kg y based on these long term data for the rhine river which actually captures 71 of the entire surface water discharge of switzerland we can conclude that the average thg concentrations in swiss rivers range between 3 8 and 6 3 ng l equaling an estimated hg discharge from switzerland of some 160 290 kg y mean 197 kg y finally the total flux of thg in treated wastewater from the 28 investigated wwtps was calculated and extrapolated to the whole of switzerland note that 97 of the country is connected to wwtps the estimated combined thg discharged from all the wwtps in switzerland was 13 g d 4 7 kg y which corresponds to a total hg contribution from treated wastewater of some 1 5 3 mean 2 4 of the riverine hg loads fig 4 the swiss limit for hg concentrations in surface water is defined as 30 ng l thg and 10 ng l dissolved hg after thorough mixing of a potential wastewater inflow eu max yearly average is 50 ng l behra et al 1993 behra et al 1994 ec 2008 sfc 2020 the thg contributions of the 28 wwtps to the receiving rivers were calculated based on river water discharge being representative for 95 of the time foen 1992 the resulting thg concentrations of 0 01 8 5 ng l thg meet the legal requirements however in some cases they are close to the ecotoxicological quality criterion of 10 ng l behra et al 1993 behra et al 1994 sfc 2020 at present no more hg point sources are known that contribute to surface waters in switzerland therefore diffuse sources are likely the main contributors to hg in swiss rivers potential diffuse sources could include atmospheric deposition erosion and runoff historical sources e g hg in lake sediments díez et al 2018 yernet and thomas 1972 or other unspecified sources although emissions of hg have declined significantly in switzerland in the last decade emep 2015 the mean direct atmospheric deposition rate to surface waters is still estimated at 11 g km2 year with more than 99 originating from emission sources outside the country emep 2015 the total direct atmospheric deposition to the swiss surface water bodies alone 1734 km2 therefore amounts to 52 g d hg which is 5 27 of the riverine thg load see above soil erosion can also be a source of hg to rivers for an erosion rate of 0 4 t y ha mosimann et al 1991 from swiss farmland 4071 km2 bfs 2009 with a mean soil hg content of 45 μg kg range 20 70 μg kg selin 2009 this flux amounts to 20 g d hg thereby accounting for 2 10 of the riverine thg loads see above rainfall and glacier melt are likely only very minor contributors at 1 blanc and schädler 2014 similar to exfiltration of groundwater fricke et al 2015 4 2 contamination of soils by hg in sewage sludge given its high content in essential elements such as phosphorus for which resources are getting more and more scarce ec 2018 sewage sludge is an attractive fertilizer in many regions worldwide mattsson et al 2017 mayer et al 2016 mulchandani and westerhoff 2016 nancharaiah et al 2016a 2016b olofsson et al 2012 vriens et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 the estimated annual thg load of sewage sludge in switzerland decreased from 612 kg y in 1984 170 kt y of sludge thg concentration 3600 ng g laube and vonplon 2004 to 176 28 kg y in 2017 268 kt y of sludge thg concentration 656 108 ng g this study hence a significant reduction in both hg concentrations and loads can be observed despite the 50 increase in sewage sludge production in the same time period fig 5 külling et al 2002 declining thg concentrations in sewage sludge were also observed in other countries such as germany 4 8 mg kg in 1977 to 0 6 mg kg in 2002 2006 wiechmann et al 2013 austria the uk sweden 2 5 mg kg in 1987 to 0 5 mg kg in 2010 2012 swedish epa 2014 and the usa e g new jersey 3 6 mg kg in 1983 to 1 47 mg kg in 2003 state of new jersey 2003 in switzerland as a result of application restrictions the use of sewage sludge as a fertilizer strongly decreased from 70 to 20 between 1980 and 2002 fig 5 laube and vonplon 2004 in 2006 sewage sludge spreading was completely banned in switzerland and all sludge has since been incinerated sfc 2011 where sewage sludge is still used as a fertilizer in agriculture hg is distributed again in the environment and can pose a risk to human health and the ecosystem epa 1972 2002 in our study thg concentrations in sewage sludge ranged from 320 to 1400 ng thg g table s10 consequently when compared to background soil and sediment concentrations unpolluted soils 100 ng g adriano 1986 to 232 ng g natural background remy et al 2002 2006 or organic fertilizers cattle and pig slurry 20 200 ng g manure 30 50 ng g bio compost 150 ng g hittinger and pichler sewage sludge can contribute substantially to hg in agricultural soils the thg concentrations and the ratios of mmhg thg in sewage sludge were comparable to those in soils 0 6 mmhg grigal 2003 and sediments up to 2 in lake sediments jiang et al 2011 5 conclusions our nationwide survey shows that thg concentrations in sewage sludge and treated wastewaters are in the same range as in other developed regions around the globe the geographic setting of switzerland with its main rivers originating within the country and with almost the entire population connected to wwtps allowed an estimation of the mean per capita loads and the share of wastewater derived hg inputs to receiving rivers further the well documented fluxes of wastewater sewage sludge production rates and river discharge in switzerland enabled a nationwide quantitative assessment of i the fluxes of hg into wwtps ii the extent of hg removal and the concomitant hg accumulation in sewage sludge and iii the importance of wastewater treatment plants as sources for hg in receiving streams the derived mean per capita loads of 16 mg year in raw wastewater and 0 6 mg year in treated wastewater are valuable proxies to estimate hg loads elsewhere for example extrapolation to the population of europe 746 million people in 2018 yields a total amount of 11 700 kg year of hg in raw wastewater with 425 kg year discharged to surface waters although these are considerable quantities our study indicated that the amount of hg discharged by wwtps into rivers in switzerland is marginal 3 compared to the total riverine hg export from switzerland thus the main share of the riverine hg originates from other diffuse and point sources e g atmospheric deposition erosion and runoff legacy sites that need further investigation annual mean hg concentrations in sewage sludge were significantly reduced fivefold since the 1980s and have leveled at concentrations below 1000 ng g for the past 10 years demonstrating the effectiveness of the imposed regulations our survey further confirmed that wwtps effectively reduce the release of hg resulting from anthropogenic activities into surface waters provided the sewage sludge is disposed of properly and not used as fertilizer in agriculture this study provides valuable baseline estimates

18039,mercury hg pollution threatens ecosystems and human health wastewater treatment plants wwtps play a key role in limiting hg discharges from wastewaters to rivers and lakes but large scale studies to estimate hg loads and discharge at national levels are scarce we assessed the concentration flux speciation and removal of hg in municipal wastewater throughout switzerland by investigating 64 wwtps in a pre study and a subset of 28 wwtps in the main study we also studied the behavior and pathways of hg along the various treatment steps in a state of the art wwtp the resulting dataset representative of industrialized countries provides an overview of i current hg concentration ranges ii average per capita loads and iii wastewater hg inputs into surface waters the results allowed estimation of a total hg thg load in swiss wastewater of 130 30 kg thg year 15 7 mg capita y of which 96 4 is retained in sewage sludge about 4 7 0 5 kg thg year 0 57 mg capita y is discharged with the treated wastewater into surface waters this corresponds to only 1 5 3 of the thg load carried by the major swiss rivers indicating that 95 of riverine hg originates from other sources extrapolation to the population of europe would yield a total amount of 11 700 kg thg year in raw wastewater with some 480 kg thg year discharged to surface waters monomethyl mercury on average accounted for 0 23 of thg and its fraction remained constant along the different treatment steps graphical abstract image 1 keywords mercury and methyl mercury discharge wastewater sewage sludge incineration surface water 1 introduction mercury is classified as a priority hazardous substance by many countries including switzerland the european union and the united states epa 1972 2002 ritscher et al 2018 the multiple environmental and health issues related to mercury hg were addressed by the international minamata convention which was reached in 2013 with the aim of reducing global anthropogenic hg emissions unep 2013b the convention came into force in 2017 and is currently signed by 128 countries and ratified by 118 countries including switzerland among the key convention objectives are the identification quantification control and reduction of hg emissions to land and water and the attainment of a better understanding of hg environmental distribution and transformation processes eu 2017 unep 2013b in this context wastewater treatment plants wwtps play a key role in limiting hg discharge to aquatic ecosystems in the past wastewater effluents were major pathways of hg to surface waters balogh et al 1999 kocman et al 2017 however current legislation limits the maximum total hg thg concentrations in surface waters to 30 ng l in switzerland sfc 2020 and 70 ng l in the eu eu 2013 therefore removal of hg by wwtps must be effective most wwtps receive mixed wastewaters of domestic and industrial origins which include discharges from agriculture hospitals dentists research institutions households and the chemical cement and metal industries as well as landfill leachates and surface drainage balogh and liang 1995 cantinho et al 2016 gbondo tugbawa et al 2010 koch 2002 sörme and lagerkvist 2002 unep 2013a wang et al 2004 the thg inputs from most of these sources have been significantly reduced due to stricter regulations e g in germany austria sweden and the usa state of new jersey 2003 swedish epa 2014 wiechmann et al 2013 nevertheless even today thg concentrations in raw wastewater can still reach several μg l cantinho et al 2016 carletti et al 2008 goldstone et al 1990 liu et al 2018 mao et al 2016 but concentrations in treated wastewater are often in the low ng l range bodaly et al 1998 fricke et al 2015 stoichev et al 2009 zierhut et al 2010 hg is usually effectively retained in sewage sludge with retention efficiencies often exceeding 95 fricke et al 2015 liu et al 2018 perusini 2016 stoichev et al 2009 previous studies have reported hg concentrations in sewage sludge between 0 4 and 7 mg thg kg fricke et al 2015 hittinger and pichler jones et al 2014 külling et al 2002 mattsson et al 2017 oliveira et al 2007 olofsson et

european union bianchini et al 2016 mattsson et al 2017 nrc 2002 olofsson et al 2012 in switzerland this practice was banned in 2006 and sewage sludge has been exclusively incinerated since then with the ash and the flue gas treatment residue safely stored in managed landfill sites foen 2012 ritscher et al 2018 sfc 2019 in addition to thg concentrations a number of studies have analyzed methyl hg mehg compounds in wastewaters mehg can cause severe ecotoxicological effects through bioaccumulation and its high toxicity thereby endangering humans via the food chain behra et al 1993 1994 mahbub et al 2017 the reported mehg concentrations in raw wastewater range from 0 4 to 7 5 ng l and they can be up to 2 ng l in treated wastewater but are often very low due to a combination of limited occurrence and or efficient degradation along the treatment chain balogh and nollet 2008a bodaly et al 1998 gilmour and bloom 1995 mao et al 2016 however unlike thg mehg is often less effectively

of mehg to suspended solids based on the available studies e g balogh and nollet 2008b bodaly et al 1998 fricke et al 2015 perusini 2016 effluents of wwtps are currently expected to be of minor importance in terms of the fluxes of hg that currently occur in surface waters however comprehensive studies to substantiate this assumption are lacking in this context switzerland is uniquely suited for studies aimed at quantifying the contribution of wwtp effluents to hg loads in surface waters nearly the entire swiss population 98 oecd 2013 is connected to wastewater treatment systems and all major rivers have their origin in the country and are routinely monitored thereby enabling the establishment of a rigorous mass balance therefore in the present study we quantified the hg concentrations in both the raw and the treated wastewaters from representative wwtps in switzerland we first screened samples from 64 wwtps in a pre study in 2016 and then focused on a subset of 28 wwtps in 2017 for detailed sampling and investigation we further determined the hg speciation in the sewage sludge and assessed changes in concentrations and speciation along the different steps of the wastewater treatment process in a state of the art wwtp with this dataset we were able to estimate i the total and per capita hg loads to wwtps ii the hg removal efficiencies of wwtps and iii the overall contribution of wwtp effluents to the riverine hg load on a national scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 studied wwtps and sample collection the locations and catchments of the studied wwtps are shown in fig 1 in a pre study samples from 64 wwtps were repeatedly collected in january june and july 2016 vriens et al 2017 raw wastewater sewage sludge and treated wastewater were collected again from 28 of the same wwtps in june 2017 see fig s4 characteristic properties of the investigated wwtps are listed in the supporting tables s7 and s13 the wwtps were selected to obtain a broad nationwide representation based on geographical distribution number of connected people and industries in the catchment areas vriens et al 2017 the communal and industrial wwtps from both rural and urban areas represent a total of 2 6 million connected people equivalent to 31 of the swiss population foen 2017 the wwtps all run similar mechanical and biological treatment processes with slight variations in their nitrate and phosphorus elimination schemes see table s7 the incoming raw wastewater and the outflowing treated wastewater effluent were collected as 24 h composite samples the raw wastewater was sampled after the bar screens and sand trap and the treated wastewater was collected after the final filtration step sludge treatment included anaerobic digestion with an average sludge age of 26 11 days samples were shipped and processed within 24 72 h see supporting information in addition to the samples collected from wwtps in 2017 the freeze dried sewage sludge samples collected in 2016 from 64 swiss wwtps were also analyzed for thg contents and speciation for comparison vriens et al 2017 a detailed study was conducted at the state of the art zurich werdhoelzli wwtp in august 2017 to determine hg concentrations speciation and retention along the successive treatment steps and to determine the variability in hg concentrations in the raw and the treated wastewaters over a period of eight days 24 h composite samples 15 mins flow proportional intervals 15 22 08 2017 several grab samples were also taken throughout the treatment steps on the last sampling day 2 2 sample

operational information on the size of the connected population catchment area wastewater flow rates and sewage sludge quantities of all studied wwtps were obtained from the swisstopo geographic

swiss federal office for the environment foen foen 2017 river water data were obtained from the national long term surveillance of swiss rivers program naduf zobrist et al 2018 hg concentrations have been recorded since 1994 on a monthly to bi monthly basis in the rhine river at weil am rhein on the border of switzerland and germany ruff et al 2013 concentrations below the lod in wastewater and sewage sludge were replaced by lod 2 newman et al 1989 statistical analyses were carried out with originpro v 9 1 originlab corporation for correlation analysis spearman s rank correlations were performed at a significance level of 95 p 0 05 the kolmogorov smirnov test was also used to identify the variability between data sets the mann whitney paired t tests and median tests were also used for data set comparison the thg loads entering the individual wwtps with wastewater or leaving them with sludge were calculated by multiplication of the respective thg concentration ci by the daily

inflows of the 28 wwtps are shown in fig 2 a for abbreviations see table s7 they spanned two orders of magnitude from 9 to 750 ng l with a median concentration of 57 ng l average 110 ng l table 1 and table s8 the dissolved hg concentrations ranged from 0 6 to 59 ng l and accounted for 1 27 of the thg average 7 hence hg was predominantly bound to particulate matter 93 6 with a positive correlation of thg ρ 0 5 p 0 01 with total suspended solids tss 30 392 mg l when compared to studies in other countries the average thg concentration in switzerland is in the lower range and comparable with the literature values of wwtp inflows in canada england or brazil table s6 bodaly et al 1998 gardner et al 2013 hargreaves et al 2016 oliveira et al 2007 it is interesting to note that this range is 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than values recently reported in a comprehensive study of china average 3400 2600 ng l max 15 000 ng l liu et al 2018 the four swiss wwtps with the highest determined thg concentrations i e chdf visp vern and vev fig s1 are located in western switzerland figs 2a and s1 the region of chdf vern and vev is known for its watch and jewelry industry which may be a legacy source for hg however this would need further investigation as with the thg concentrations in raw wastewaters the daily loads of thg spanned over two orders of magnitude from 0 05 to 39 5 g d with an average of 4 8 7 7 g d table s8 by comparison the tss loads were 150 52 100 kg d 3 1 2 treated wastewater the thg in the treated wastewaters ranged from lod 0 3 ng l to 92 ng l fig 2a with a volumetric weighted mean concentration of 3 8 0 4 ng l table s9 these concentrations of a few tens of ng l correspond with references to wwtps that efficiently remove hg balogh and nollet 2008b bodaly et al 1998 fricke et al 2015 gbondo tugbawa et al 2010 mao et al 2016 stoichev et al 2009 see table s6 liu et al 2018 recently reported an average of 160 ng l thg in chinese effluents together with an overall 95 removal efficiency but the incoming concentrations are much higher than in switzerland see section 3 1 1 above the daily loads of thg in treated wastewater i e the wwtp effluents ranged from 3 to 950 mg d our data allowed an estimation of the wastewater derived hg discharge to surface waters for the entirety of switzerland of 13 1 3 g thg d equivalent to a per capita discharge of 1 6 0 16 μg thg capita day table 1 the relevance of wastewater derived hg discharge to the aquatic environment is discussed in section 4 1 3 1 3 hg retention efficiencies the studied wwtps reveal an overall efficient hg removal from wastewater of 85 99 7 with an average of 96 4 interestingly the lowest efficiencies 85 88 were found in wwtps that received the highest dissolved hg concentrations in their inflowing wastewaters i e 17 59 ng l dissolved hg equal to 12 17 of thg suggesting limited sorption of dissolved hg to tss and a consequently poor elimination efficiency of the dissolved hg fraction 3 2 concentrations and speciation in sewage sludge 3 2 1 thg concentrations in sewage sludge the concentrations in sludge from the 28 wwtps are plotted in fig 2b together with the percentage of mmhg the thg concentrations of the 2017 campaign ranged from 320 to 1400 ng g median 675 ng g as shown in the corresponding box plot for the wwtps studied in 2016 the thg spanned a slightly wider range from 160 to 2600 ng g median 445 ng g see fig 1 fig s4 and table s13 the variability between the two campaigns within individual wwtps was about 20 with the majority of the wwtps 16 of 28 differing by less than 10 thereby confirming small temporal variations as reported by vriens et al 2017 for other major and trace elements the measured thg concentrations are largely in line with long term monitoring data of the swiss cantons and with published data from various european countries 100 3000 ng g awel 2017 canton de vaud 2017 canton de vaud 2018 clara and scheffknecht 2016 hittinger and pichler 2007 kanton aargau 2015 wiechmann et al 2013 3 2 2 hg speciation in sewage sludge the only organic species found with gc icp ms analysis was mmhg no peaks that could correspond to ethylated or phenyl hg forms were present the mmhg concentrations in sewage sludge ranged from lod 0 11 ng g to 8 6 ng g median 0 7 ng g the gc icp ms analyses further revealed that the majority of hg was present as ihg median 84 see table s10 as shown in fig 2b mmhg represented up to 0 8 of the thg the determined mmhg concentrations are very similar to values reported in other studies from around the globe balogh and nollet 2008b bodaly et al 1998 gbondo tugbawa et al 2010 gilmour and bloom 1995 liu et al 2018 mao et al 2016 such low mmhg concentrations in the sludges suggest that mmhg in the treated wastewater is most likely below the detection limit 3 3 detailed study of hg loads and variability within the treatment process 3 3 1 wastewater treatment chain in raw wastewater of the zurich werdhoelzli wwtp which was continuously sampled for eight days the thg varied between 45 and 73 ng l on working days average 59 ng l and between 29 and 32 ng l on the weekend see fig s5 and table s11 along the treatment stages depicted in fig 3 the thg decreased from 52 16 ng l in the inflow to 22 2 ng l after the primary clarifier to 9 2 ng l after the final sand filter and to lod 0 3 ng l in the treated outflow removal efficiency 99 5 the highest thg concentrations along the treatment train 203 56 ng l were present in the return sludge which recirculates a major part of the activated sludge back to the bioreactor inflow to maintain microbial activity fig 3 this loop causes an approximately 5 fold enrichment of hg in the biological treatment stage 103 3 ng l note that the median sludge age is 27 days of the solids the suspended solids of the preliminary clarifier were the most heavily burdened with thg 416 28 ng g and hence contributed the largest share of thg in the dewatered sewage sludge 465 40 ng g fig 3 in the activated sludge treatment bioreactor which includes nitrification denitrification and phosphorus precipitation the thg in the suspended solids decreased to 163 3 ng g mmhg was also analyzed in the suspended matter and sewage sludge the concentrations were between 0 2 and 1 6 ng g accounting for 0 1 0 9 of the thg fig 3 the proportion of mmhg was therefore in the same range as found in the sewage sludge of the other 27 wwtps further mmhg remained quite stable along the different treatment steps indicating no significant transformation 3 3 2 sludge incineration the zurich werdhoelzli wwtp incinerates its own dewatered sludge 29 970 t in 2017 and sludge from other wwtps 53 670 t in 2017 with an estimated thg load of 37 1 kg y 79 720 t of sludge in 2017 465 thg ng g for the years 2016 2018 the reported thg concentration in the incineration ash was in the range of 100 430 ng g while the residues from flue gas treatment showed 100 times higher thg concentrations of 11 41 μg g schafflützel 2019 in switzerland the legal limit for thg in incineration exhaust is 0 05 mg m3 sfc 2018 the zurich werdhoelzli wwtp reported a daily average thg concentration in the exhaust gas of 0 016 mg m3 which in 2017 resulted in 1 7 kg 5 thg expelled to the atmosphere abegglen 2018 this indicates that most of the hg is volatilized in the incineration process but is then recaptured in the flue gas treatment after the separation of the fly and bottom ash van velzen et al 2002 hence the major fraction of hg is not found in the incineration ash but in the flue gas treatment residues the overall retention efficiency of the sewage sludge incineration was 95 combined with the 99 5 removal by the wastewater treatment a grand total of 95 of the hg was therefore retained by the wwtp even though some thg is expelled to the atmosphere through sludge incineration the wwtps efficiently remove most thg from wastewater and allow its storage in hazardous waste landfills 3 4 total and per capita loads in raw wastewater the weighted mean thg concentration of raw wastewaters 104 28 ng l and the total wastewater flow of switzerland gave an estimated annual hg input of 130 30 kg y table 1 for switzerland which has 8 29 million people connected foen 2017 to wwtps 98 of population in 2016 this corresponds to a per capita load of 43 11 μg capita d hence the swiss average is comparable with estimations made for austria 55 μg capita d reisinger et al 2009 the city of frankfurt 59 μg capita d fricke et al 2015 or sweden 67 μg capita d sörme and lagerkvist 2002 two of the 28 wwtps namely visp 620 μg thg capita d and la chaux de fonds chdf 210 μg thg capita d had exceptionally high per capita loads these wwtps are located in catchments that are strongly influenced by chemical and watchmaking industries by contrast for the zurich werdhoelzli wwtp that has a much smaller proportion of industrial wastewater the thg flux in the raw wastewater was 8 3 g thg d with a corresponding per capita load of 19 6 μg thg capita d table s11 since only a minor fraction of the total hg input to wwtps is released into surface waters and since most thg is retained in the sewage sludge the total mass of thg retained in the annually produced sewage sludge represents an independent estimate of the thg flow into swiss wwtp from the weighted mean thg concentration in sewage sludge and the annual swiss sludge production a thg load of 190 30 kg y was calculated table 1 this sludge based estimate is about 50 higher than the thg load calculated from thg in raw wastewater however sludge is believed to provide a better estimate since the sludge samples integrate longer time periods than the aqueous phase 4 environmental implications 4 1 relevance of wastewater derived hg discharge to the aquatic environment in the following we estimate the extent to which the discharge of wastewater can contribute to hg amounts in riverine water in 2017 the combined average flow of the four rivers that drain switzerland was 194 million m3 d naduf 2017 with the vast majority discharged by the rhine 71 and rhone 23 rivers fig 1 the total treated wastewater discharge of the 28 wwtps amounted to 1 28 million m3 d or 0 49 m3 d per capita for the 2 6 million connected people hence an amount of 4 1 million m3 d of wastewater is estimated for the entire country of switzerland 8 29 million connected population in 2017 equaling 2 1 of the average riverine discharge from switzerland as mentioned above foen 2017 recent thg measurements in swiss surface waters are scarce and the concentrations are often below the lod 10 5 ng l ritscher et al 2018 however the rhine river monitoring station at the swiss border with germany has regularly measured thg in suspended solids and in water since 1994 fig s6 for the period of 1994 2017 the range of 5 year averages of thg concentrations was 2 7 4 5 ng l with an average of 3 3 0 8 ng l in suspended solids and below lod 5 ng l for the truly dissolved thg in water mazacek 2019 yearly loads calculated from the available thg concentrations are shown in fig s6 and range from 30 to 378 kg y mean 137 90 kg y based on these long term data for the rhine river which actually captures 71 of the entire surface water discharge of switzerland we can conclude that the average thg concentrations in swiss rivers range between 3 8 and 6 3 ng l equaling an estimated hg discharge from switzerland of some 160 290 kg y mean 197 kg y finally the total flux of thg in treated wastewater from the 28 investigated wwtps was calculated and extrapolated to the whole of switzerland note that 97 of the country is connected to wwtps the estimated combined thg discharged from all the wwtps in switzerland was 13 g d 4 7 kg y which corresponds to a total hg contribution from treated wastewater of some 1 5 3 mean 2 4 of the riverine hg loads fig 4 the swiss limit for hg concentrations in surface water is defined as 30 ng l thg and 10 ng l dissolved hg after thorough mixing of a potential wastewater inflow eu max yearly average is 50 ng l behra et al 1993 behra et al 1994 ec 2008 sfc 2020 the thg contributions of the 28 wwtps to the receiving rivers were calculated based on river water discharge being representative for 95 of the time foen 1992 the resulting thg concentrations of 0 01 8 5 ng l thg meet the legal requirements however in some cases they are close to the ecotoxicological quality criterion of 10 ng l behra et al 1993 behra et al 1994 sfc 2020 at present no more hg point sources are known that contribute to surface waters in switzerland therefore diffuse sources are likely the main contributors to hg in swiss rivers potential diffuse sources could include atmospheric deposition erosion and runoff historical sources e g hg in lake sediments díez et al 2018 yernet and thomas 1972 or other unspecified sources although emissions of hg have declined significantly in switzerland in the last decade emep 2015 the mean direct atmospheric deposition rate to surface waters is still estimated at 11 g km2 year with more than 99 originating from emission sources outside the country emep 2015 the total direct atmospheric deposition to the swiss surface water bodies alone 1734 km2 therefore amounts to 52 g d hg which is 5 27 of the riverine thg load see above soil erosion can also be a source of hg to rivers for an erosion rate of 0 4 t y ha mosimann et al 1991 from swiss farmland 4071 km2 bfs 2009 with a mean soil hg content of 45 μg kg range 20 70 μg kg selin 2009 this flux amounts to 20 g d hg thereby accounting for 2 10 of the riverine thg loads see above rainfall and glacier melt are likely only very minor contributors at 1 blanc and schädler 2014 similar to exfiltration of groundwater fricke et al 2015 4 2 contamination of soils by hg in sewage sludge given its high content in essential elements such as phosphorus for which resources are getting more and more scarce ec 2018 sewage sludge is an attractive fertilizer in many regions worldwide mattsson et al 2017 mayer et al 2016 mulchandani and westerhoff 2016 nancharaiah et al 2016a 2016b olofsson et al 2012 vriens et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 the estimated annual thg load of sewage sludge in switzerland decreased from 612 kg y in 1984 170 kt y of sludge thg concentration 3600 ng g laube and vonplon 2004 to 176 28 kg y in 2017 268 kt y of sludge thg concentration 656 108 ng g this study hence a significant reduction in both hg concentrations and loads can be observed despite the 50 increase in sewage sludge production in the same time period fig 5 külling et al 2002 declining thg concentrations in sewage sludge were also observed in other countries such as germany 4 8 mg

in 2003 state of new jersey 2003 in switzerland as a result of application restrictions the use of sewage sludge as a fertilizer strongly decreased from 70 to 20 between 1980 and 2002 fig 5 laube and vonplon 2004 in 2006 sewage sludge spreading was completely banned in switzerland and all sludge has since been incinerated sfc 2011 where sewage sludge is still used as a fertilizer in agriculture hg is distributed again in the environment and can pose a risk to human health and the ecosystem epa 1972 2002 in our study thg concentrations in sewage sludge ranged from 320 to 1400 ng thg g table s10 consequently when compared to background soil and sediment concentrations unpolluted soils 100 ng g adriano 1986 to 232 ng g natural background remy et al 2002 2006 or organic fertilizers cattle and pig slurry 20 200 ng g manure 30 50 ng g bio compost 150 ng g hittinger and pichler sewage sludge can contribute substantially to hg in agricultural soils the thg concentrations and the ratios of mmhg thg in sewage sludge were comparable to those in soils 0 6 mmhg grigal 2003 and sediments up to 2 in lake sediments jiang et al 2011 5 conclusions our nationwide survey shows that thg concentrations in sewage sludge and treated wastewaters are in the same range as in other developed regions around the globe the geographic setting of switzerland with its main rivers originating within the country and with almost the entire population connected to wwtps allowed an estimation of the mean per capita loads and the share of wastewater derived hg inputs to receiving rivers further the well documented fluxes of wastewater sewage sludge production rates and river discharge in switzerland enabled a nationwide quantitative assessment of i the fluxes of hg into wwtps ii the extent of hg removal and the concomitant hg accumulation in sewage sludge and iii the importance of wastewater treatment plants as sources for hg in receiving streams the derived mean per capita loads of 16 mg year in raw wastewater and 0 6 mg year in treated wastewater are valuable proxies to estimate hg loads elsewhere for example extrapolation to the population of europe 746 million people in 2018 yields a total amount of 11 700 kg year of hg in raw wastewater with 425 kg year discharged to surface waters although these are considerable quantities our study indicated that the amount of hg discharged by wwtps into rivers in switzerland is marginal 3 compared to the total riverine hg export from switzerland thus the main share of the riverine hg originates from other diffuse and point sources e g atmospheric deposition erosion and runoff legacy sites that need further investigation annual mean hg concentrations in sewage sludge were significantly reduced fivefold since the 1980s and have leveled at concentrations below 1000 ng g for the past 10 years demonstrating the effectiveness of the imposed regulations our survey further confirmed that wwtps effectively reduce the release of hg resulting from anthropogenic activities into surface waters provided the sewage sludge is disposed of properly and not used as fertilizer in agriculture this study provides valuable baseline estimates that contribute to the goals of the global minamata convention and will be of interest to stakeholders in the fields of wastewater treatment environmental chemistry ecology toxicology and
