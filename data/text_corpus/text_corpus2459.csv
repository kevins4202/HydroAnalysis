investigations have reported that the rock layer near the fracture surface of many open fractures have been altered by precipitation and deposition of mineral organic and inorganic matters robinson et

influence the transport through the formations fracture skins are ubiquitous in nature and are especially noticeable in fractured formations or doubly porous rocks where there is an interchange of

microfissures in the rock matrices ranges between 0 01 and 10 µm birgersson and neretnieks 1982 colloid transport models which assume that the colloids are confined to fractures may often lead to an overestimation of the colloid concentrations along the fracture hence development of colloid facilitated transport models incorporating the process of colloid penetration into the formation will be useful in predicting contaminant migration in fractured media in situations where colloids penetrate the matrix till date no numerical models have been developed to study the colloid facilitated contaminant transport in fractured formations with fracture skin with colloid penetration into the rock formation the present paper deals with the development of a triple continuum transport model for the analysis of colloid facilitated contaminant migration in fractured rocks the main objective of this work is to derive solutions for one dimensional macroscopic colloid facilitated contaminant transport in sets of parallel fractures with fracture skin accounting for reversible contaminant deposition onto fracture skin surfaces contaminant penetration into the rock formation reversible contaminant deposition onto rock matrix surfaces colloid deposition onto fracture skin surfaces and colloid penetration into the rock formation sorption of the contaminant onto suspended and deposited colloids is assumed to follow a modified freundlich reversible equilibrium isotherm proposed by summers and roberts 1988 and mckinley and jenne 1991 the system of equations is solved using a fully implicit finite difference numerical scheme sensitivity analyses are performed to investigate the impact of various model parameters on the spatial evolution of the contaminant in the fractured formation it should be noted that because of the relatively large number of variables associated with colloid and contaminant cotransport only the most important and controlling parameters are investigated 2 the physical system this study considers sets of parallel fractures of infinite extent of width 2b which is situated in a water saturated rock formation the conceptualization of the fracture skin matrix system is shown in fig 1 in deriving the governing equations the following assumptions are made regarding geometry and hydraulic properties tang et al 1981 1 the length of the fracture is much larger than its width 2 transverse diffusion and dispersion within the fracture ensure complete mixing across fracture width at all times 3 permeability of the fracture skin and the matrix is very low and the transport within the skin and the matrix occurs mainly by effective molecular diffusion 4 transport along the fracture is much faster than transport within the fracture skin and the matrix assumptions 1 and 2 provide the basis for a one dimensional analysis of mass transport along the fracture assumptions 3 and 4 provide the basis for taking the direction of mass flux in the reservoir to be perpendicular to the fracture axis the result is the simplification of the two dimensional system into coupled orthogonal one dimensional systems the physical and chemical processes relevant to colloid facilitated transport of contaminant are listed below 1 advection and dispersion of dissolved contaminant in the fracture 2 solute rock interaction including diffusion

hydrodynamic and deposition mechanisms the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient of contaminants is the sum of mechanical dispersion coefficient and molecular diffusion coefficient while for colloidal particles it is the sum of mechanical dispersion coefficient and brownian diffusion coefficient of colloids generally mechanical dispersion dominates brownian diffusion or molecular diffusion therefore the same hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient equal to the mechanical dispersion coefficient is used for both the contaminant and colloids we also assume that the contaminant and colloids have the same velocity as the aqueous phase flow velocity v a linear reversible equilibrium isotherm is assumed for contaminant sorption on to fracture surfaces which is given by 2 c f t z k f c f t z where k f is the partition coefficient for contaminant sorption on to fracture surfaces l and retardation coefficient r f of fracture surface is given by r f 1 k f b however the amount of contaminant sorption on to fracture surfaces is influenced by the available fracture surface area for sorption which is a function of the deposited colloid concentration ε the fracture surface area fraction equal to zero represents the case of no colloid deposition and ε equal to one represents the case of a complete monolayer coverage of the fracture surface a modified freundlich reversible equilibrium

the equation is 6 c s t x z t d s r s 2 c s t x z x 2 λ c s t x z where r s is the retardation factor in the fracture skin the governing transport equation in the rock matrix is derived in a similar way as 7 c m t x z t d m r m 2 c m t x z x 2 λ c m t x z where c m is the contaminant concentration in the rock matrix m l 3 d m is the effective diffusion coefficient of rock matrix l2 t 1 and r m is

initially contaminant is absent in the fracture skin matrix system the boundary conditions 9a and 9b corresponds to inlet boundary condition and either 9a which represents the case of constant concentration boundary condition or 9b which represents constant flux boundary condition is employed at a time the boundary condition 10 preserves concentration continuity for the fracture outlet the boundary condition 11 implies equal solute concentration in the fracture and fracture skin at the interface between them while 12 implies diffusive mass flux continuity at the interface between fracture skin and rock matrix the boundary condition 13 corresponds to concentration of contaminants at the interface between fracture skin and rock matrix the boundary condition 14 preserves concentration continuity in the rock matrix the governing differential equation of colloid transport in the fracture the skin and the matrix are based on the mass balance for an element in the fracture the skin and the matrix respectively assuming that colloids may be able to penetrate the formation the equations governing the transport of colloids in the fracture the skin and the matrix

condition at the inlet while eq 20b corresponds to continuous constant flux boundary condition at the inlet the downstream boundary condition 21 preserves colloid concentration continuity for the fracture 3 numerical method the system of governing transport equations in the fracture skin matrix system are solved using a finite difference model a fully implicit finite difference numerical scheme is employed for the discretisation of transport equations in the fracture fracture skin and rock matrix the resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations is solved by iterative methods the concentration of colloids in the fractured formation is obtained by solving eqs 15 18 subject to the boundary conditions the computed value of concentration of colloids in the fracture is used in solving eq 5 and the resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations is solved by iterative methods to satisfy the continuity of fluxes at the fracture skin interface the solution is iterated in each time step a smaller grid size at the fracture skin interface helps in accurately simulating the concentration flux into the fracture skin for temporal simulations the maximum courant number is fixed as 0 2 4 results and discussion the one dimensional transport model is used to study the impact of colloid on contaminant migration in fractured rocks the numerical model is validated with the analytical solutions robinson et al 1998 of simpler case of contaminant transport in sets of parallel fracture with fracture skin in absence of colloids with the data given in table 1 the numerical model results are in good agreement with the analytical solutions fig 2 the concentrations of solute along the fracture fracture skin and rock matrix at the end of 10 years have been calculated with the data presented in table 2 the contaminant concentration along the fracture is expressed in terms of the relative concentration c c 0 and the concentration profiles along the fracture are plotted the top curve in each profile corresponds to the concentration profile for the no skin scenario for the specified condition and other curve corresponds to the with skin scenarios the contaminant concentration in the fractured media for a fracture surface free of colloids and for a fracture surface completely covered by deposited colloids has been simulated the resulting concentration profiles for different values of flow velocities are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively the contaminant concentration in the fracture with fracture skin is essentially same as the contaminant concentration in the fracture without considering the fracture skin for a fracture surface completely covered by deposited colloids the contaminant penetration along the fracture for a fracture surface with monolayer coverage of deposited colloids is found to be much higher than the contaminant penetration along the fracture for a fracture surface free of colloids the result was expected as for monolayer coverage of deposited colloids the chances of diffusion of contaminant through the fracture skin to the matrix is minimal rate of contaminant diffusion into the rock and the rate of contaminant sorption onto fracture surfaces are greatly affected by the presence of previously deposited colloids on fracture surfaces surface exclusion effect the reduction in diffusion and sorption of contaminant is accounted in the model by adjusting the value of parameter ε the area blocked by a colloid particle is a function of colloid size and the number of deposited particles per unit surface area of the fracture surface the portion of a fracture surface area blocked by colloids ε is evaluated chrysikopoulos and abdel salam 1997 as ε t z 3 2 c c o l t z ρ p d p where ρ p is the density of colloidal particle and d p is the size of colloidal particle the value of ε thus obtained from the equation is substituted in eq 5 to account for the influence of previously deposited colloids on fracture surfaces on further contaminant migration and the resulting concentration profiles along the fracture for different flow velocities are shown in fig 5 the significance of incorporating fracture skin in the modelling of colloid facilitated contaminant transport is also illustrated in fig 5 the results clearly demonstrate the effect fracture skin on colloid facilitated contaminant migration in fractured media it can be seen from the results that the analysis of fracture matrix systems without considering the fracture skin ie the models based on dual continuum approach show large variation with the solutions obtained using triple continuum models the plots indicate that the contaminant concentrations along the fracture are lesser than that predicted by dual continuum models as in the simulated case the diffusion coefficient of fracture skin is reported to be more than that of the rock matrix the results also highlight the importance of surface exclusion effect on colloid facilitated contaminant migration in fractured media simulations are performed for cases with surface exclusion and without surface exclusion and the corresponding results are also presented in the plots figs 6 and 7 present the contaminant concentration profiles along the fracture for different values of the distribution coefficient for contaminant sorption onto the suspended colloids k n and the distribution coefficient for contaminant sorption onto the deposited colloids k n respectively an increase in the value of k n results in increase in contaminant concentrations along the fracture whereas an increase in the value of k n leads to a decrease in the concentrations of contaminant along the fracture the influence of the distribution coefficient for contaminant sorption onto the suspended colloids is found to be less significant compared to the influence of the distribution coefficient for contaminant sorption onto the deposited colloids the influence of exponents a and d on colloid facilitated contaminant migration in fractured formations with colloids penetrating the formation are illustrated in figs 8 and 9 respectively computations are performed for three different values of these exponents large values of d results in considerable reduction in contaminant concentrations along the fracture fig 10 presents the results of computations performed for three different values of colloid deposition coefficient at very low colloid deposition coefficient values the contaminant concentrations along the fracture are almost equal however significant changes in contaminant concentrations are seen at large colloid deposition coefficients more pronounced changes are seen when the influence of previously deposited colloids are considered fig 10b at large values of the colloid deposition coefficient 5 conclusions a complex numerical model in a triple continuum framework incorporating fracture skin as the third continuum is developed to analyze the colloid facilitated contaminant transport in sets of parallel fractures with colloid penetration into the rock formation the complex mass transfer between the different interfaces is accurately modelled in the present model the set of coupled partial differential equations of solute transport in the fracture skin matrix system is solved using a fully implicit finite difference model a series of numerical simulations was carried out to analyze the effect of fracture skin on contaminant transport in the fractured system in presence of colloids model results with fracture skin and without fracture skin conditions clearly demonstrates the importance of incorporating fracture skin as the third continuum in the analysis of colloid facilitated contaminant transport in fractured media contaminant migration in fractured media is shown to be greatly affected by the presence of previously deposited colloids on fracture surfaces parametric investigations have showed that distribution coefficient for contaminant sorption onto the deposited colloids and isotherm fitting parameter for contaminant sorption onto the deposited colloids are the most significant colloid related parameter affecting the contaminant transport in fractured media if the sorption of the contaminant onto suspended and deposited colloids is governed by a modified freundlich reversible equilibrium isotherm the model results are useful in characterization studies of colloid facilitated solute transport in fractured formations with fracture skin and have implications on the management and remediation of groundwater quality

the equation is 6 c s t x z t d s r s 2 c s t x z x 2 λ c s t x z where r s is the retardation factor in the fracture skin the governing transport equation in the rock matrix is derived in a similar way as 7 c m t x z t d m r m 2 c m t x z x 2 λ c m t x z where c m is the contaminant concentration in the rock matrix m l 3 d m is the effective diffusion coefficient of rock matrix l2 t 1 and r m is

initially contaminant is absent in the fracture skin matrix system the boundary conditions 9a and 9b corresponds to inlet boundary condition and either 9a which represents the case of constant concentration boundary condition or 9b which represents constant flux boundary condition is employed at a time the boundary condition 10 preserves concentration continuity for the fracture outlet the boundary condition 11 implies equal solute concentration in the fracture and fracture skin at the interface between them while 12 implies diffusive mass flux continuity at the interface between fracture skin and rock matrix the boundary condition 13 corresponds to concentration of contaminants at the interface between fracture skin and rock matrix the boundary condition 14 preserves concentration continuity in the rock matrix the governing differential equation of colloid transport in the fracture the skin and the matrix are based on the mass balance for an element in the fracture the skin and the matrix respectively assuming that colloids may be able to penetrate the formation the equations governing the transport of colloids in the fracture the skin and the matrix

fracture 3 numerical method the system of governing transport equations in the fracture skin matrix system are solved using a finite difference model a fully implicit finite difference numerical scheme is employed for the discretisation of transport equations in the fracture fracture skin and rock matrix the resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations is solved by iterative methods the concentration of colloids in the fractured formation is obtained by solving eqs 15 18 subject to the boundary conditions the computed value of concentration of colloids in the fracture is used in solving eq 5 and the resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations is solved by iterative methods to satisfy the continuity of fluxes at the fracture skin interface the solution is iterated in each time step a smaller grid size at the fracture skin interface helps in accurately simulating the concentration flux into the fracture skin for temporal simulations the maximum courant number is fixed as 0 2 4 results and discussion the one dimensional transport model is used to study the impact of colloid on contaminant migration in fractured rocks the numerical model is validated with the analytical solutions robinson et al 1998 of simpler case of contaminant transport in sets of parallel fracture with fracture skin in absence of colloids with the data given in table 1 the numerical model results are in good agreement with the analytical solutions fig 2 the concentrations of solute along the fracture fracture skin and rock matrix at the end of 10 years have been calculated with the data presented in table 2 the contaminant concentration along the fracture is expressed in terms of the relative concentration c c 0 and the concentration profiles along the fracture are plotted the top curve in each profile corresponds to the concentration profile for the no skin scenario for the specified condition and other curve corresponds to the with skin scenarios the contaminant concentration in the fractured media for a fracture surface free of colloids and for a fracture surface completely covered by deposited colloids has been simulated the resulting concentration profiles for different values of flow velocities are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively the contaminant concentration in the fracture with fracture skin is essentially same as the contaminant concentration in the fracture without considering the fracture skin for a fracture surface completely covered by deposited colloids the contaminant penetration along the fracture for a fracture surface with monolayer coverage of deposited colloids is found to be much higher than the contaminant penetration along the fracture for a fracture surface free of colloids the result was expected as for monolayer coverage of deposited colloids the chances of diffusion of contaminant through the fracture skin to the matrix is minimal rate of contaminant diffusion into the rock and the rate of contaminant sorption onto fracture surfaces are greatly affected by the presence of previously deposited colloids on fracture surfaces surface exclusion effect the reduction in diffusion and sorption of contaminant is accounted in the model by adjusting the value of parameter ε the area blocked by a colloid particle is a function of colloid size and the number of deposited particles per unit surface area of the fracture surface the portion of a fracture surface area blocked by colloids ε is evaluated chrysikopoulos and abdel salam 1997 as ε t z 3 2 c c o l t z ρ p d p where ρ p is the density of colloidal particle and d p is the size of colloidal particle the value of ε thus obtained from the equation is substituted in eq 5 to account for the influence of previously deposited colloids on fracture surfaces on further contaminant migration and the resulting concentration profiles along the fracture for different flow velocities are shown in fig 5 the significance of incorporating fracture skin in the modelling of colloid facilitated contaminant transport is also illustrated in fig 5 the results clearly demonstrate the effect fracture skin on colloid facilitated contaminant migration in fractured media it can be seen from the results that the analysis of fracture matrix systems without considering the fracture skin ie the models based on dual continuum approach show large variation with the solutions obtained using triple continuum models the plots indicate that the contaminant concentrations along the fracture are lesser than that predicted by dual continuum models as in the simulated case the diffusion coefficient of fracture skin is reported to be more than that of the rock matrix the results also highlight the importance of surface exclusion effect on colloid facilitated contaminant migration in fractured media simulations are performed for cases with surface exclusion and without surface exclusion and the corresponding results are also presented in the plots figs 6 and 7 present the contaminant concentration profiles along the fracture for different values of the distribution coefficient for contaminant sorption onto the suspended colloids k n and the distribution coefficient for contaminant sorption onto the deposited colloids k n respectively an increase in the value of k n results in increase in contaminant concentrations along the fracture whereas an increase in the value of k n leads to a decrease in the concentrations of contaminant along the fracture the influence of the distribution coefficient for contaminant sorption onto the suspended colloids is found to be less significant compared to the influence of the distribution coefficient for contaminant sorption onto the deposited colloids the influence of exponents a and d on colloid facilitated contaminant migration in fractured formations with colloids penetrating the formation are illustrated in figs 8 and 9 respectively computations are performed for three different values of these exponents large values of d results in considerable reduction in contaminant concentrations along the fracture fig 10 presents the results of computations performed for three different values of colloid deposition coefficient at very low colloid deposition coefficient values the contaminant concentrations along the fracture are almost equal however significant changes in contaminant concentrations are seen at large colloid deposition coefficients more pronounced changes are seen when the influence of previously deposited colloids are considered fig 10b at large values of the colloid deposition coefficient 5 conclusions a complex numerical model in a triple continuum framework incorporating fracture skin as the third continuum is developed to analyze the colloid facilitated contaminant transport in sets of parallel fractures with colloid penetration into the rock formation the complex mass transfer between the different interfaces is accurately modelled in the present model the set of coupled partial differential equations of solute transport in the fracture skin matrix system is solved using a fully implicit finite difference model a series of numerical simulations was carried out to analyze the effect of fracture skin on contaminant transport in the fractured system in presence of colloids model results with fracture skin and without fracture skin conditions clearly demonstrates the importance of incorporating fracture skin as the third continuum in the analysis of colloid facilitated contaminant transport in fractured media contaminant migration in fractured media is shown to be greatly affected by the presence of previously deposited colloids on fracture surfaces parametric investigations have showed that distribution coefficient for contaminant sorption onto the deposited colloids and isotherm fitting parameter for contaminant sorption onto the deposited colloids are the most significant colloid related parameter affecting the contaminant transport in fractured media if the sorption of the contaminant onto suspended and deposited colloids is governed by a modified freundlich reversible equilibrium isotherm the model results are useful in characterization studies of colloid facilitated solute transport in fractured formations with fracture skin and have implications on the management and remediation of groundwater quality

graphical abstract fx1 keywords wastewater reuse adsorptive treatment tectona grandis sawdust crystal violet polyaniline composite 1 introduction in recent years the large scale industrialization is the root of the economic development however it is also considered to be the main cause of environmental pollution and ecological injuries ahuti 2015 cherniwchan 2012 almost all practices executed by man for the manufacture and enhancement of goods and services lead to the production of pollutants which causes the rigorous and widespread contamination of surface water and groundwater the contamination of groundwater by dyes is a big concern in many countries most of the pollutants are unaffected and not degraded by a native microorganism and persist in the environment for the longer period and when these pollutants discharge from industries directly into the water bodies poses serious health issues and challenges to the researchers ahuti 2015 cherniwchan 2012 diez 2010 girling 2008 schröder 1996 presence of dangerous and virulent contaminants like heavy metals dyes radioactive elements pesticides insecticides etc causes the water pollution and their toxicity lead to the major problems around the globe jadhav et al 2010 jarup 2003 kar et al 2008 qamruzzaman and nasar 2015 schwarzenbach et al 2010 dyes are one of the most environmentally unfriendly pollutants because of their toxic nature and high color intensity textile pharmaceutical food leather paint automobiles chemical cosmetic printing paper polymer and so on belong to industries that generate various types of colored effluents and discharge directly into the water system cassano et al 2001 kant 2012 verma et al 2012 wainwright 2008 the discharge of such untreated effluent contaminates the surface water and groundwater as well due to the complex structure and synthetic nature most of the dyes are unaffected by light water and many chemicals forgacs et al 2004 mittal et al 2010 revankar and lele 2007 presence of dyes in water bodies increases the bod level and reduces the light penetration this consequently causes dramatic changes in the aquatic life as well as on human and terrestrial animals deshannavar et al 2016 nasar and shakoor 2017 thus contamination of groundwater particularly in the nearby dye based industrial area has become a challenging task because dyes deliver objectionable color besides their toxic effect therefore in order to maintain the quality of groundwater near to industrial regions the treatment of dye loaded wastewater is essential various methods namely electrodialysis korngold et al 1977 photocatalysis bahnemann 2004 chong et al 2010 electrofloatation chen et al 2002 electrokinetics wang et al 2004 coagulation and flocculation amuda and amoo 2007

chan et al 2009 adsorption anastopoulos et al 2017 bhatnagar et al 2015 bhatnagar and sillanpää 2017 2010 zhao et al 2015b are available to remove different pollutants such as dyes heavy metals pesticides and other organic matters from water and wastewater however most of these methods are conventional and not efficiently successful due to several restrictions among these methods adsorption has been considered to be one of the most effective simple sustainable and cost effective wastewater treatment techniques to reduce hazardous inorganic and organic pollutants present in the effluent silica gel and activated carbon are very effective conventional adsorbent used to treat wastewater however their uses were many times supposed to be undesirable due to their high cost and problem associated with regeneration there has been increasing trend in using low cost adsorbent derived from domestic agricultural and industrial wastes as well as naturally occurring cheap materials such as fe iii cr iii hydroxide namasivayam et al 1994 zeolites armağan et al 2004 titania silica messina and schulz 2006 sugar industry waste anastopoulos et al 2017 rejected tea nasuha et al 2010 citrus

et al 2017 kaolinite abidi et al 2017 organo montmorillonite huang et al 2017 etc for the effective treatment of contaminated water however adsorbents obtained from a single source have a limitation of their specific nature and therefore have limited applications to overcome this problem and also to increase wider scope there has been an increasing trend in developing the adsorbents by making them as composites of a variety of precursor the composites have attracted prominent attention in different fields because their properties can be tailored to make them with specific properties as per requirements it is worth appropriate to mention here that during recent years there has been an increasing trend in the preparation and utilization of composites for various applications aday et al

contaminants from aqueous solution polyaniline pani is a polyaromatic amine and has obtained significant attraction nowadays due to its low cost ease in synthesis chemical and environmental stability high conductivity and also have good separation characteristics make it an ideal in many applications it is broadly used in batteries corrosion protection electronic devices and solar cells boeva and sergeyev 2014 recently a number of research studies have been emphasized for the development of pani based composite adsorbents for the removal of dyes from the polluted water nasar 2018 the pani

efficient adsorbents used for treating polluted water in the present study a pani based composite was synthesized by incorporating an inexpensive unusable and usually thrown waste material namely tectona grandis sawdust tgsd to explore its utilization for dye removal from aqueous media at the outset crystal violet cv dye was chosen as a starting contaminant crystal violet cv is a triarylmethane synthetic dye with deep purple hue it has uses in paint and printing ink veterinary medicines etc it also has antibacterial and antifungal properties however this dye has been reported to be toxic in several aspects and stays in the environment for a very long time mani and bharagava 2016 literature inspection indicates that the confiscation of crystal violet dye from contaminated water by adsorption method has been carried out using different conventional and non conventional low cost adsorbents but this adsorbate adsorbent system i e cv pani tgsd has not been studied so far the present study was planned with the main objective to improve the knowledge of dye control under various conditions which in turn will help to prevent groundwater contamination and also to contribute to human health different batch parameters i e ph adsorbent doses contact time different initial concentration and temperature were adjusted for maximum removal of cv moreover isothermal kinetic and thermodynamic studies were also conducted to realize the clear understanding of adsorption of cv onto pani tgsd composite 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals and reagents hcl naoh ch3cooh kno3 nh4 2s2o8 c6h5nh2 and cv dye of analytical regent grade obtained from cdh india were used in the present investigation the doubly distilled deionized water dddw was used throughout the experiment 2 2 preparation and characterization of pani tgsd composite sawdust of tectona grandis collected from the nearby sawmill was washed several times with double distilled water till the complete elimination of adhered surface contaminants the washed mass was oven dried at 95 c for about 30 h and then 105 c for 2 h the dried biomass was then ground and sieved with 180 bss mesh size the adsorbent was synthesized in situ by oxidative polymerization of aniline by treating 5 g tgsd with a mixture of aniline 5 ml and 1 m hcl 50 ml after removing the excess aniline by decantation 50 ml of 0 5 m nh4 2s2o8 ammonium per disulfate as a redox initiator was added dropwise into the mixture under continuous stirring for 6 h at room temperature the mass so obtained was washed many times with dddw and then dried in an oven at 60 c for 24 h the textural and the functional group analysis of the cv loaded and unloaded pani tgsd composite was carried out by scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm6510lv japan and fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir in the spectral range of 4000 400 cm 1 respectively the scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive x ray analysis edax was also employed to determine the elemental composition of the pani tgsd composite 2 3 determination of point of zero charge of pani tgsd composite the point of zero charge phpzc is the ph when the charge on the surface of adsorbent is zero i e the ph below which the surface of the adsorbent is positively charged while the ph above of which the adsorbent surface is negatively charged the phpzc of pani tgsd surface was measured by employing the solid addition method for this purpose 25 ml solutions of 0 1 m kno3 of different ph ranging from 2 to 12 were prepared by adding 0 1 m naoh or hcl in different 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks after recording the initial ph phi of the solutions 0 020 g of pani tgsd was then added to each flask and placed in the dark place for 48 h the final ph phf of the supernatant liquid was measured the point of zero charge phpzc was obtained from the ph vs phi plot and the phpzc of pani tgsd was taken as the point that passes through phi axis 2 4 batch adsorption studies batch experiments were executed at the varied dose of adsorbent ph of the medium initial concentrations of adsorbate adsorbate adsorbent contact time and temperature batch experiments were conducted in a conical flask containing 25 ml adsorbate solution and 0 02 g of pani tgsd adsorbent the ph of the medium was maintained at 7 by using 0 1 m hcl or naoh solution throughout the experiment for the reason which will be discussed in section 3 4 after the accomplishment of equilibrium the samples were filtered by using whatman filter paper and the residual dye concentration of the supernatant after adsorption were quantified by using uv vis spectrophotometer at an optimized wavelength of 575 nm 2 5 batch experiments the extent of adsorbate cv adsorbed onto the adsorbent pani tgsd was evaluated in terms of equilibrium adsorption capacity qe and removal efficiency r which are defined by following equations 1 q e c o c e v m 2 r c 0 c t c 0 100 where co ce and ct are the initial equilibrium and any time concentration of the cv dye solution mg l 1 respectively v is the volume of dye solution l and m is the mass of the pani tgsd composite g the adsorption capacity qt at any time was calculated by equation analogous to eq 1 2 6 equilibrium isotherm modeling adsorption isotherm plays an important role in describing the mechanism prevailing the release retention or mobility of the adsorbate to the adsorbent the finding of the present study has been analyzed in the light of the isotherm models proposed langmuir foo and hameed 2010 freundlich foo and hameed 2010 yang 1998 and temkin johnson and arnold 1995 langmuir model considers monolayer adsorption and based on the assumption that each vacant site accommodates only one adsorbate molecule and each site possesses a constant amount of energy during the process of adsorption the linearized form of langmuir isotherm is given as 3 1 q e 1 q m k l c e 1 q m where qm implies the maximum theoretical adsorption capacity of the adsorbate onto the adsorbent mg g 1 and kl l mg 1 is the langmuir constant which shows the binding affinity of adsorbate to the adsorbent further the feasibility of the adsorption process is checked by a dimensionless constant known as separation factor r l 1 1 k l c 0 the rl value foo and hameed 2010 describe the behavior of adsorption process to be either irreversible rl 0 linear rl 1 unfavorable rl 1 or favorable 0 rl 1 freundlich isotherm model is in fact an empirical equation which describes the relationship between adsorption and the equilibrium concentration of the dye based multilayer adsorption this isothermal model is represented as follows 4 lnq e 1 n ln c e ln k f where kf mg1 1 n l1 n g 1 and n are the freundlich constants indicates the adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively temkin isotherm model assumes that the adsorption of adsorbate onto the adsorbent is associated with the linear decrease in enthalpy of adsorption process and its linear mathematical is given as follows 5 q e rt b lnc e rt b lnk t where b j mol 1 and kt l g 1 are temkin constants associated with the heat of adsorption and maximum binding energy respectively 2 7 adsorption kinetics along with the conceivable mechanism of adsorption and reaction pathway kinetics consideration of an adsorption process also predicts the residence time required for carrying out the adsorption of solute from aqueous media onto the adsorbent which depends upon the adsorbate adsorbent interaction and on the system conditions rate of adsorption of adsorbate onto the adsorbent were enumerated by using the commonly known kinetic models i e pseudo first order ho and mckay 1998 pseudo second order cheung et al 2000 ho and mckay 1999 1998 intraparticle diffusion model tan and hameed 2017 vadivelan and kumar 2005 and elovich isotherm model cheung et al 2000 wu et al 2009 there linearized forms of these models are given in following the respective order 6 ln q e q t lnq e k 1 t 7 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 8 q t k id t 1 2 c 9 q t ln α β β 1 β ln t where k1 min 1 k2 g min 1 mg 1 and kid mg min ½ g 1 is the first order second order and intraparticle diffusion rate constant respectively β mg g 1 min 1 is the desorption constant and α g mg 1 min 2 is the initial adsorption rate 2 8 adsorption thermodynamics in order to develop an insight whether the adsorption of cv onto the pani tgsd composite is feasible or not it is obligatory to study the thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption process such as gibb s free energy g enthalpy h and entropy s 10 g rt ln k c 11 ln k c g rt h rt s r where kc is the equilibrium constant which is the ratio of the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate on the adsorbent to that in the solution 2 9 desorption study the desorption studies were performed in batch with different desorbing agents namely 0 1 m each of hydrochloric acid acetic acid sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide and also with water the experiments were conducted by treating 0 2 g adsorbent with 250 ml of 50 mg l 1 cv solution for 2 h at 30 c the dye loaded adsorbent after separation by filtration was carefully washed a few times with dddw to eliminate any possible presence of unadsorbed cv the 0 020 g of dye loaded pani tgsd adsorbent was agitated separately with 25 ml of the above desorbing agents and equilibrated for 3 h after desorption the supernatant was quantified spectrophotometrically and desorption was computed by employing the following equation 12 d m d m a 100 where ma and md denote the concentrations of dye adsorbed and dye desorbed in mg l 1 respectively in order to examine the reusability potential of pani tgsd adsorbent consecutive adsorption desorption studies were carried out in a number of repeated cycles 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization the sem micrographic images of the unloaded and cv loaded adsorbent pani tgsd composite respectively shown in fig 1 a and b clearly indicate that the surface of unloaded pani tgsd is highly irregular porous and have cave type openings which provide a greater surface area for adsorption of cv after the adsorption the surface of the adsorbent is altered and becomes saturated by cv molecules fig 1 b the edax spectrum of the adsorbent shown in fig 1 c clearly indicates that the composite pani tgsd chiefly contains c 53 55 wt 60 27 at n 4 92 wt 4 74 at and o 41 28 wt 34 88 at along with traces of si 0 15 wt 0 07 at and cl 0 1 wt 0 04 at the ftir spectra of cv loaded and unloaded pani tgsd adsorbent is shown in fig 1 d the prominent peaks have observed at 3427 2912 1725 1623 1370 cm 1 besides these a number of weak to medium bands have been observed in the range of 1260 1020 cm 1 the strong broadband at 3427 cm 1 is due to stretching vibration of h bonded alcoholic o h group the peak at 2912 cm 1 may be attributed to c h stretching of the alkyl group the band at 1725 cm 1 is attributed to c o stretching of the carbonyl group a medium broad band observed at 1623 cm 1 may either be due to c c stretching of alkene or n h bending of amine the band at 1370 cm 1 may be assigned to o h bending of alcohol and c h bending of the alkyl group the bands in the range of 1260 1020 cm 1 are possibly due c n stretching of amine or c o stretching or their combined effect fig 1 d clearly indicates that there is shift in band position from 3427 2912 1623 1370 1260 1155 1105 1021 cm 1 to 3409 2916 1621 1364 1250 1156 1107 1052 cm 1 respectively some minor changes in other frequencies have also been observed the change in peak position obviously indicates the involvement of the respective group during the adsorption of cv by pani tgsd 3 2 contact time and initial dye concentration the influence of adsorbate cv adsorbent pani tgsd contact time and initial adsorbate concentration on the adsorptive removal of adsorbate was studied at the different initial concentrations of dye solution ranging from 25 to 150 mg l 1 for up to 240 min and results are graphically shown in fig 2 the figure clearly indicates that adsorption of cv dye is fast at the initial stage 0 20 min of the contact time and slowly lower down and reaches equilibrium after 120 min further it is also clear from the figure that the equilibrium time is independent of the initial dye concentration the fast adsorption of cv during the initial stage is due to the availability of a larger number of vacant sites on the surface of pani tgsd adsorbent with the increase of contact time there is a decrease in the availability of vacant sites which slows down the adsorption process further the slower adsorption at a later stage may also be partly due to the possible repulsion of adsorbate with adsorbed adsorbate fig 2 also shows that there is an increase in adsorption capacity with an increase in the initial concentration of dye at each adsorbate adsorbent contact time this is due to increase in driving force with the increase in initial cv dye concentration which accelerates the diffusion rate of adsorbate to the adsorbent surface the variation of equilibrium adsorption capacity against equilibrium dye concentration is shown as the labeled diagram in fig 3 the figure undoubtedly specifies that with the increase in equilibrium dye concentration there is a significant increase in adsorption capacity regardless of the initial dye concentration 3 3 adsorbent dose the adsorbent dose is a dominant factor affecting the adsorption process since it regulates the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of an adsorbent for a particular initial concentration of the adsorbate at the working experimental conditions variation in adsorption capacity and removal efficiency with an adsorbent dose ranging from 0 4 to 14 0 g l 1 at a typically chosen initial dye concentration of 50 mg l 1 is shown in fig 4 this figure clearly demonstrates that the removal efficiency increases from 90 6 to 97 3 with an increase of adsorbent dose from 0 4 to 14 0 g l 1 however a reverse effect of adsorbent dose on the adsorption capacity has been observed it can be seen from the fig 4 that adsorption capacity decreases from 113 3 to 3 5 mg g 1 with the increase in adsorbent dose from 0 4 to 14 g l 1 the increase in removal efficiency of cv is owing to an enhancement in overall adsorption sites for any fixed initial dye concentration however the opposite trend for adsorption capacity is due to the decrease of adsorption sites per unit mass of the adsorbent at a higher dose this is due to interactions like aggregation and agglomeration of the adsorbent particles at their higher quantity in the same volume 3 4 effect of ph the ph is one of the most substantial factors for adsorption process as it influences the degree of ionization adsorbent surface charge and nature of dye solution the adsorption of cv onto pani tgsd composite was studied in the ph range of 2 12 fig 5 it is clearly depicted from the graph that the adsorption capacity increased from 43 4 to 60 4 mg g 1 with an increase in ph from 2 to 7 afterward there is a minor increase in removal efficiency with a further change in ph up to 12 in fact the ph of the medium can change the surface charge of the composite as it gets protonated in the lower ph and deprotonated at higher ph resultantly the adsorption behavior changes significantly at different ph values the dependency of adsorption on ph may alternatively be interpreted in the light of phpzc of the adsorbent the phpzc of pani tgsd was observed to be 5 fig 5 inset thus at ph 5 the surface of pani tgsd is positively charged due to protonation while at ph 5 the surface carries negative charge due to deprotonating in the presence of a large number of hydroxyl ions malekbala et al 2012 hence the favorable medium for the removal cv by the surface pani tgsd is ph 5 this is due to fact that the surface of pani tgsd acquires negative charge and adsorption of any cationic dye like cv is favored in the light of outcome results in the effect of ph on adsorption capacity and phpzc of pani tgsd a judiciously safe value of ph 7 was selected for further studies further fig 5 clearly tells that the maximum adsorption has been achieved at a ph value of 7 during decontamination of water containing cv it is remarkable that in most of the cases ph of the groundwater is close to this value it means that the proposed adsorbent pani tgsd can also be effectively utilized for the purification of contaminated groundwater 3 5 novelty of the pani tgsd adsorbent in order to check the novelty of the adsorbent a number of experiments have been carried out with the native untreated tgsd at different initial dye concentrations the adsorption results on tgsd are compared in table 1 with those of pani tgsd this table clearly reflects that the adsorption capacity of the tgsd adsorbent increased drastically after the modification with pani the enhancement was more than 2 5 times at all the concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mg l 1 of cv dye in this context it is also relevant to mention that the equilibrium was achieved within 2 h with pani tgsd while larger equilibrium time of 3 h was required for untreated tgsd thus it unambiguously highlights the novelty of pani tgsd adsorbent for the removal of dyes particularly cv 3 6 adsorption isotherms in the present study the experimental data were analyzed to fit with the three widely used isotherm models viz langmuir freundlich and temkin the results so obtained are incorporated in table 2 on the basis of relative values of r2 it has been confirmed that the langmuir isotherm model plot shown in fig 6 is the best one to describe the adsorption of cv dye onto the pani tgsd this result suggests that pani tgsd surface offers homogeneous areas for the monolayer adsorption further the adsorbent surface has a finite number of adsorption sites with constant energy of adsorption the rl value of adsorption of cv onto pani tgsd was found to be 0 119 which confirmed the favorability of the process similar reports have been documented previously that the adsorption of cv onto the adsorbents such as chitosan magnetic composite and glutamic acid modified chitosan magnetic composite yan et al 2013 κ carrageenan g poly methacrylic acid gholami et al 2016 magnetically modified spent coffee grounds safarik et al 2012 ferrofluid modified peanut husk safarik and safarikova 2010 magnetically modified activated carbon hamidzadeh et al 2015 3 aminipropyl triethoxysilane modified magnetic nanoparticle ge et al 2012 manganese oxide coated sepiolite eren et al 2010 alginate acid activated bentonite oladipo and gazi 2014 coconut tree activated carbon senthilkumaar et al 2006 apricot waste activated carbon basar 2006 fly ash supported zero valent iron liu et al 2017 fe3o4 modified kaolin sun et al 2017 jute fiber activated carbon porkodi and kumar 2007 acid activated red mud zhang et al 2014 h2so4 treated cucumis sativus smitha et al 2017 and naoh modified rice husk chakraborty et al 2011 were well represented by langmuir isotherm the values of langmuir isotherm parameters reported for the adsorption of cv by different adsorbents are listed in table 3 langmuir isotherm model is used to find out the maximum adsorption capacity qm which is found to be 263 2 mg g 1 a high value of qm indicates the usefulness of this adsorbent for the treatment of wastewater and thereby for the protection of the quality of groundwater in this table the performance pani tgsd for cv removal has been compared with 17 other modified adsorbents it has been observed that the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity 263 2 mg g 1 for monolayer coverage associated with pani tgsd is higher than that for 14 adsorbents only three adsorbents namely glutamic acid modified chitosan magnetic composite manganese oxide coated sepiolite and alginate acid activated bentonite have higher adsorption capacity table 3 further indicates that there are considerable variations in the adsorption parameters reported by different investigators in fact these parameters are strongly dependent on the experimental conditions which were obviously different for different investigators 3 7 adsorption kinetics the kinetic study is significant to understand the underlying mechanism rate determining step and evaluate the efficiency of the adsorption process to compute the rate of cv adsorption on pani tgsd composite various kinetic models have been proposed such as pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion elovich diffusion etc these models show the relation between amounts of dye adsorbed as a function of time the kinetic parameters for pseudo first order pseudo second order intraparticle and elovich diffusion model are listed in table 4 based on the value of r2 found closer to unity and coinciding of the experimental qe value 59 636 mg g 1 with the calculated qe value 60 241 mg g 1 suggested that the pseudo second order were the best followed kinetic model for the adsorption of cv dye onto the pani tgsd composite the pseudo second order plot is presented in fig 7 similar trend of pseudo second order kinetic have also been reported for the adsorption of cv by other adsorbents such as glutamic acid modified chitosan magnetic composite yan et al 2013 chitosan magnetic composite yan et al 2013 κ carrageenan g poly methacrylic acid gholami et al 2016 edta cross linked β cyclodextrin zhao et al 2015b 3 aminipropyl triethoxysilane modified magnetic nanoparticle ge et al 2012 manganese oxide coated sepiolite eren et al 2010 alginate acid activated bentonite oladipo and gazi 2014 coconut tree activated carbon senthilkumaar et al 2006 jute fiber activated carbon porkodi and kumar 2007 acid activated red mud zhang et al 2014 h2so4 treated cucumis sativus smitha et al 2017 naoh modified rice husk chakraborty et al 2011 apricot waste activated carbon önal 2006 etc the values of pseudo second order parameters as found by these researchers and also of the present study are incorporated in table 5 this table evidently shows that the results obtained in the present investigation are comparable with those of the previously reported 3 8 adsorption thermodynamics the values δg for the adsorption of cv onto pani tgsd at different temperatures as calculated by using eq 10 are listed in table 6 the negative values of δg confirm that the adsorption process is spontaneous within the temperature range of study since the negative value of δg increases with temperature and thus it can be established that the process is more achievable at higher temperatures thus entropy factor plays a dominating role towards the adsorption the values of δh and δs were determined from the slope and intercept of ln kc vs 1 t plot fig 8 and presented in table 6 the table indicates that the process is endothermic and associated with an increase in entropy it is relevant to comment here that the adsorption of cv molecules onto other adsorbents such as magnetically modified activated carbon hamidzadeh et al 2015 manganese oxide coated sepiolite eren et al 2010 alginate acid activated bentonite oladipo and gazi 2014 coconut tree activated carbon senthilkumaar et al 2006 apricot waste activated carbon basar 2006 fe3o4 modified kaolin sun et al 2017 etc was also reported to be endothermic in nature the positive change in entropy reflects that there is an increase in randomness at the adsorbate solution interface due to a gain of translational entropy at the time of adsorption coordinated water molecules are displaced by the adsorbate species and gain more translational entropy than is lost by cv resulting in an overall increase in randomness in the adsorbate adsorbent interaction kyzas et al 2012 unnithan and anirudhan 2001 literature survey reveals that the increase in randomness of the species accompanying with the adsorption of cv by different adsorbents such as chitosan magnetic composite yan et al 2013 κ carrageenan g poly methacrylic acid gholami et al 2016 magnetically modified activated carbon hamidzadeh et al 2015 alginate acid activated bentonite oladipo and gazi 2014 coconut tree activated carbon senthilkumaar et al 2006 apricot waste activated carbon basar 2006 fe3o4 modified kaolin sun et al 2017 acid activated red mud zhang et al 2014 has also been observed by several other investigators 3 9 desorption study the possible recovery used pani tgsd was examined by performing desorption studies with different desorbing agents as already mentioned in section 2 9 the percent desorption efficiencies linked with various desorbents are summarized in table 7 it has been observed that hcl 0 1 m is the best desorbing agent among the chosen ones for the recovery of pani tgsd with 60 7 desorption in order to make the adsorption process economical and feasible the adsorbent should be reusable in several consecutive adsorption desorption cycles in the present study four consecutive cycles have been carried out with 0 1 m hcl solution and the results are illustrated in fig 9 this figure confirms that this adsorbent has potential to be used effectively at least four repeated cycles for the removal of cv from aqueous solution 4 conclusion treatment of industrial effluents before their discharge into the water bodies is essential to maintain and preserve the quality of groundwater present research study explores the efficiency of effective adsorption of toxic cv dye onto the pani tgsd composite adsorbent from aqueous system it was observed that adsorptive removal of dye was influenced by the different factors such as cv pani tgsd contact time initial cv concentration pani tgsd dosage ph of the medium and temperature it was found that equilibrium for the adsorption of cv onto pani tgsd composite was attained in 120 min in acidic medium a significant enhancement in adsorption of cv was observed up to a ph of 7 and thereafter the change becomes insignificant the kinetic study shows that the pseudo second order kinetics was best described the adsorption process isotherm analysis of the results reflected that the isotherm results were best represented by langmuir model the maximum monolayer coverage adsorption capacity was established to be 263 2 mg g 1 the thermodynamic study revealed that the adsorption process was spontaneous endothermic and associated with the enhancement of entropy the desorption of cv from cv loaded pani tgsd was found to be maximum in 0 1 m hcl in view of promising adsorption capacity and simplicity and ease in the synthesis of pani tgsd the present study submits that this composite is an effective low cost and economically feasible adsorbent for the treatment of polluted water containing dyes as contaminants the present study concludes that the proposed adsorbent pani tgsd can be exploited to keep groundwater clean by effective removal of dyes from polluted wastewater acknowledgments the authors are thankful to the chairman department of applied chemistry faculty

graphical abstract fx1 keywords wastewater reuse adsorptive treatment tectona grandis sawdust crystal violet polyaniline composite 1 introduction in recent years the large scale industrialization is the root of the economic development however it is also considered to be the main cause of environmental pollution and ecological injuries ahuti 2015 cherniwchan 2012 almost all practices executed by man for the manufacture and enhancement of goods and services lead to the production of pollutants which causes the rigorous and widespread contamination of surface water and groundwater the contamination of groundwater by dyes is a big concern in many countries most of the pollutants are unaffected and not degraded by a native microorganism and persist in the environment for the longer period and when these pollutants discharge from industries directly into the water bodies poses serious health issues and challenges to the researchers ahuti 2015 cherniwchan 2012 diez 2010 girling 2008 schröder 1996 presence of dangerous and virulent contaminants like heavy metals dyes radioactive elements pesticides insecticides etc causes the water pollution and their toxicity lead to the major problems around the globe jadhav et al 2010 jarup 2003 kar et al 2008 qamruzzaman and nasar 2015 schwarzenbach et al 2010 dyes are one of the most environmentally unfriendly pollutants because of their toxic nature and high color intensity textile pharmaceutical food leather paint automobiles chemical cosmetic printing paper polymer and so on belong to industries that generate various types of colored effluents and discharge directly into the water system cassano et al 2001 kant 2012 verma et al 2012 wainwright 2008 the discharge of such untreated effluent contaminates the surface water and groundwater as well due to the complex structure and synthetic nature most of the dyes are unaffected by light water and many chemicals forgacs et al 2004 mittal et al 2010 revankar and lele 2007 presence of dyes in water bodies increases the bod level and reduces the light penetration this consequently causes dramatic changes in the aquatic life as well as on human and terrestrial animals deshannavar et al 2016 nasar and shakoor 2017 thus contamination of groundwater particularly in the nearby dye based industrial area has become a challenging task because dyes deliver objectionable color besides their toxic effect therefore in order to maintain the quality of groundwater near to industrial regions the treatment of dye loaded wastewater is essential various methods namely electrodialysis korngold et al 1977 photocatalysis bahnemann 2004 chong et al 2010 electrofloatation chen et al 2002 electrokinetics wang et al 2004 coagulation and flocculation amuda and amoo 2007

chan et al 2009 adsorption anastopoulos et al 2017 bhatnagar et al 2015 bhatnagar and sillanpää 2017 2010 zhao et al 2015b are available to remove different pollutants such as dyes heavy metals pesticides and other organic matters from water and wastewater however most of these methods are conventional and not efficiently successful due to several restrictions among these methods adsorption has been considered to be one of the most effective simple sustainable and cost effective wastewater treatment techniques to reduce hazardous inorganic and organic pollutants present in the effluent silica gel and activated carbon are very effective conventional adsorbent used to treat wastewater however their uses were many times supposed to be undesirable due to their high cost and problem associated with regeneration there has been increasing trend in using low cost adsorbent derived from domestic agricultural and industrial wastes as well as naturally occurring cheap materials such as fe iii cr iii hydroxide namasivayam et al 1994 zeolites armağan et al 2004 titania silica messina and schulz 2006 sugar industry waste anastopoulos et al 2017 rejected tea nasuha et al 2010 citrus

et al 2017 kaolinite abidi et al 2017 organo montmorillonite huang et al 2017 etc for the effective treatment of contaminated water however adsorbents obtained from a single source have a limitation of their specific nature and therefore have limited applications to overcome this problem and also to increase wider scope there has been an increasing trend in developing the adsorbents by making them as composites of a variety of precursor the composites have attracted prominent attention in different fields because their properties can be tailored to make them with specific properties as per requirements it is worth appropriate to mention here that during recent years there has been an increasing trend in the preparation and utilization of composites for various applications aday et al 2016b 2016a akocak et al 2017 ayranci et al 2017 başkaya et al 2017 çelik et al 2016 demirci et al 2016 göksu et al 2016 pamuk et al 2015 sen et al 2012 a number of composites such as typha latifolia

contaminants from aqueous solution polyaniline pani is a polyaromatic amine and has obtained significant attraction nowadays due to its low cost ease in synthesis chemical and environmental stability high conductivity and also have good separation characteristics make it an ideal in many applications it is broadly used in batteries corrosion protection electronic devices and solar cells boeva and sergeyev 2014 recently a number of research studies have been emphasized for the development of pani based composite adsorbents for the removal of dyes from the polluted water nasar 2018 the pani based composites developed by using rice husk shabandokht et al 2016 nylon 6 nanofibers zarrini et al 2017 starch janaki et al 2012b zirconium oxide agarwal et al 2016 zirconium iv silicophosphate gupta et al 2014 silver salem et al 2016 starch montmorillonite olad et al 2014 sio2 tanzifi et al 2018 peanut hull tahir et al 2017 chitosan janaki et al 2012a etc are some remarkable examples of efficient adsorbents used for treating polluted water in the present study a pani based composite was synthesized by incorporating an inexpensive unusable and usually thrown waste material namely tectona grandis sawdust tgsd to explore its utilization for dye removal from aqueous media at the outset crystal violet cv dye was chosen as a starting contaminant crystal violet cv is a triarylmethane synthetic dye with deep purple hue it has uses in paint and printing ink veterinary medicines etc it also has antibacterial and antifungal properties however this dye has been reported to be toxic in several aspects and stays in the environment for a very long time mani and bharagava 2016 literature inspection indicates that the confiscation of crystal violet dye from contaminated water by adsorption method has been carried out using different conventional and non conventional low cost adsorbents but this adsorbate adsorbent system i e cv pani tgsd has not been studied so far the present study was planned with the main objective to improve the knowledge of dye control under various conditions which in turn will help to prevent groundwater contamination and also to contribute to human health different batch parameters i e ph adsorbent doses contact time different initial concentration and temperature were adjusted for maximum removal of cv moreover isothermal kinetic and thermodynamic studies were also conducted to realize the clear understanding of adsorption of cv onto pani tgsd composite 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals and reagents hcl naoh ch3cooh kno3 nh4 2s2o8 c6h5nh2 and cv dye of analytical regent grade obtained from cdh india were used in the present investigation the doubly distilled deionized water dddw was used throughout the experiment 2 2 preparation and characterization of pani tgsd composite sawdust of tectona grandis collected from the nearby sawmill was washed several times with double distilled water till the complete elimination of adhered surface contaminants the washed mass was oven dried at 95 c for about 30 h and then 105 c for 2 h the dried biomass was then ground and sieved with 180 bss mesh size the adsorbent was synthesized in situ by oxidative polymerization of aniline by treating 5 g tgsd with a mixture of aniline 5 ml and 1 m hcl 50 ml after removing the excess aniline by decantation 50 ml of 0 5 m nh4 2s2o8 ammonium per disulfate as a redox initiator was added dropwise into the mixture under continuous stirring for 6 h at room temperature the mass so obtained was washed many times with dddw and then dried in an oven at 60 c for 24 h the textural and the functional group analysis of the cv loaded and unloaded pani tgsd composite was carried out by scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm6510lv japan and fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir in the spectral range of 4000 400 cm 1 respectively the scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive x ray analysis edax was also employed to determine the elemental composition of the pani tgsd composite 2 3 determination of point of zero charge of pani tgsd composite the point of zero charge phpzc is the ph when the charge on the surface of adsorbent is zero i e the ph below which the surface of the adsorbent is positively charged while the ph above of which the adsorbent surface is negatively charged the phpzc of pani tgsd surface was measured by employing the solid addition method for this purpose 25 ml solutions of 0 1 m kno3 of different ph ranging from 2 to 12 were prepared by adding 0 1 m naoh or hcl in different 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks after recording the initial ph phi of the solutions 0 020 g of pani tgsd was then added to each flask and placed in the dark place for 48 h the final ph phf of the supernatant liquid was measured the point of zero charge phpzc was obtained from the ph vs phi plot and the phpzc of pani tgsd was taken as the point that passes through phi axis 2 4 batch adsorption studies batch experiments were executed at the varied dose of adsorbent ph of the medium initial concentrations of adsorbate adsorbate adsorbent contact time and temperature batch experiments were conducted in a conical flask containing 25 ml adsorbate solution and 0 02 g of pani tgsd adsorbent the ph of the medium was maintained at 7 by using 0 1 m hcl or naoh solution throughout the experiment for the reason which will be discussed in section 3 4 after the accomplishment of equilibrium the samples were filtered by using whatman filter paper and the residual dye concentration of the supernatant after adsorption were quantified by using uv vis spectrophotometer at an optimized wavelength of 575 nm 2 5 batch experiments the extent of adsorbate cv adsorbed onto the adsorbent pani tgsd was evaluated in terms of equilibrium adsorption capacity qe and removal efficiency r which are defined by following equations 1 q e c o c e v m 2 r c 0 c t c 0 100 where co ce and ct are the initial equilibrium and any time concentration of the cv dye solution mg l 1 respectively v is the volume of dye solution l and m is the mass of the pani tgsd composite g the adsorption capacity qt at any time was calculated by equation analogous to eq 1 2 6 equilibrium isotherm modeling adsorption isotherm plays an important role in describing the mechanism prevailing the release retention or mobility of the adsorbate to the adsorbent the finding of the present study has been analyzed in the light of the isotherm models proposed langmuir foo and hameed 2010 freundlich foo and hameed 2010 yang 1998 and temkin johnson and arnold 1995 langmuir model considers monolayer adsorption and based on the assumption that each vacant site accommodates only one adsorbate molecule and each site possesses a constant amount of energy during the process of adsorption the linearized form of langmuir isotherm is given as 3 1 q e 1 q m k l c e 1 q m where qm implies the maximum theoretical adsorption capacity of the adsorbate onto the adsorbent mg g 1 and kl l mg 1 is the langmuir constant which shows the binding affinity of adsorbate to the adsorbent further the feasibility of the adsorption process is checked by a dimensionless constant known as separation factor r l 1 1 k l c 0 the rl value foo and hameed 2010 describe the behavior of adsorption process to be either irreversible rl 0 linear rl 1 unfavorable rl 1 or favorable 0 rl 1 freundlich isotherm model is in fact an empirical equation which describes the relationship between adsorption and the equilibrium concentration of the dye based multilayer adsorption this isothermal model is represented as follows 4 lnq e 1 n ln c e ln k f where kf mg1 1 n l1 n g 1 and n are the freundlich constants indicates the adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively temkin isotherm model assumes that the adsorption of adsorbate onto the adsorbent is associated with the linear decrease in enthalpy of adsorption process and its linear mathematical is given as follows 5 q e rt b lnc e rt b lnk t where b j mol 1 and kt l g 1 are temkin constants associated with the heat of adsorption and maximum binding energy respectively 2 7 adsorption kinetics along with the conceivable mechanism of adsorption and reaction pathway kinetics consideration of an adsorption process also predicts the residence time required for carrying out the adsorption of solute from aqueous media onto the adsorbent which depends upon the adsorbate adsorbent interaction and on the system conditions rate of adsorption of adsorbate onto the adsorbent were enumerated by using the commonly known kinetic models i e pseudo first order ho and mckay 1998 pseudo second order cheung et al 2000 ho and mckay 1999 1998 intraparticle diffusion model tan and hameed 2017 vadivelan and kumar 2005 and elovich isotherm model cheung et al 2000 wu et al 2009 there linearized forms of these models are given in following the respective order 6 ln q e q t lnq e k 1 t 7 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 8 q t k id t 1 2 c 9 q t ln α β β 1 β ln t where k1 min 1 k2 g min 1 mg 1 and kid mg min ½ g 1 is the first order second order and intraparticle diffusion rate constant respectively β mg g 1 min 1 is the desorption constant and α g mg 1 min 2 is the initial adsorption rate 2 8 adsorption thermodynamics in order to develop an insight whether the adsorption of cv onto the pani tgsd composite is feasible or not it is obligatory to study the thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption process such as gibb s free energy g enthalpy h and entropy s 10 g rt ln k c 11 ln k c g rt h rt s r where kc is the equilibrium constant which is the ratio of the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate on the adsorbent to that in the solution 2 9 desorption study the desorption studies were performed in batch with different desorbing agents namely 0 1 m each of hydrochloric acid acetic acid sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide and also with water the experiments were conducted by treating 0 2 g adsorbent with 250 ml of 50 mg l 1 cv solution for 2 h at 30 c the dye loaded adsorbent after separation by filtration was carefully washed a few times with dddw to eliminate any possible presence of unadsorbed cv the 0 020 g of dye loaded pani tgsd adsorbent was agitated separately with 25 ml of the above desorbing agents and equilibrated for 3 h after desorption the supernatant was quantified spectrophotometrically and desorption was computed by employing the following equation 12 d m d m a 100 where ma and md denote the concentrations of dye adsorbed and dye desorbed in mg l 1 respectively in order to examine the reusability potential of pani tgsd adsorbent consecutive adsorption desorption studies were carried out in a number of repeated cycles 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization the sem micrographic images of the unloaded and cv loaded adsorbent pani tgsd composite respectively shown in fig 1 a and b clearly indicate that the surface of unloaded pani tgsd is highly irregular porous and have cave type openings which provide a greater surface area for adsorption of cv after the adsorption the surface of the adsorbent is altered and becomes saturated by cv molecules fig 1 b the edax spectrum of the adsorbent shown in fig 1 c clearly indicates that the composite pani tgsd chiefly contains c 53 55 wt 60 27 at n 4 92 wt 4 74 at and o 41 28 wt 34 88 at along with traces of si 0 15 wt 0 07 at and cl 0 1 wt 0 04 at the ftir spectra of cv loaded and unloaded pani tgsd adsorbent is shown in fig 1 d the prominent peaks have observed at 3427 2912 1725 1623 1370 cm 1 besides these a number of weak to medium bands have been observed in the range of 1260 1020 cm 1 the strong broadband at 3427 cm 1 is due to stretching vibration of h bonded alcoholic o h group the peak at 2912 cm 1 may be attributed to c h stretching of the alkyl group the band at 1725 cm 1 is attributed to c o stretching of the carbonyl group a medium broad band observed at 1623 cm 1 may either be due to c c stretching of alkene or n h bending of amine the band at 1370 cm 1 may be assigned to o h bending of alcohol and c h bending of the alkyl group the bands in the range of 1260 1020 cm 1 are possibly due c n stretching of amine or c o stretching or their combined effect fig 1 d clearly indicates that there is shift in band position from 3427 2912 1623 1370 1260 1155 1105 1021 cm 1 to 3409 2916 1621 1364 1250 1156 1107 1052 cm 1 respectively some minor changes in other frequencies have also been observed the change in peak position obviously indicates the involvement of the respective group during the adsorption of cv by pani tgsd 3 2 contact time and initial dye concentration the influence of adsorbate cv adsorbent pani tgsd contact time and initial adsorbate concentration on the adsorptive removal of adsorbate was studied at the different initial concentrations of dye solution ranging from 25 to 150 mg l 1 for up to 240 min and results are graphically shown in fig 2 the figure clearly indicates that adsorption of cv dye is fast at the initial stage 0 20 min of the contact time and slowly lower down and reaches equilibrium after 120 min further it is also clear from the figure that the equilibrium time is independent of the initial dye concentration the fast adsorption of cv during the initial stage is due to the availability of a larger number of vacant sites on the surface of pani tgsd adsorbent with the increase of contact time there is a decrease in the availability of vacant sites which slows down the adsorption process further the slower adsorption at a later stage may also be partly due to the possible repulsion of adsorbate with adsorbed adsorbate fig 2 also shows that there is an increase in adsorption capacity with an increase in the initial concentration of dye at each adsorbate adsorbent contact time this is due to increase in driving force with the increase in initial cv dye concentration which accelerates the diffusion rate of adsorbate to the adsorbent surface the variation of equilibrium adsorption capacity against equilibrium dye concentration is shown as the labeled diagram in fig 3 the figure undoubtedly specifies that with the increase in equilibrium dye concentration there is a significant increase in adsorption capacity regardless of the initial dye concentration 3 3 adsorbent dose the adsorbent dose is a dominant factor affecting the adsorption process since it regulates the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of an adsorbent for a particular initial concentration of the adsorbate at the working experimental conditions variation in adsorption capacity and removal efficiency with an adsorbent dose ranging from 0 4 to 14 0 g l 1 at a typically chosen initial dye concentration of 50 mg l 1 is shown in fig 4 this figure clearly demonstrates that the removal efficiency increases from 90 6 to 97 3 with an increase of adsorbent dose from 0 4 to 14 0 g l 1 however a reverse effect of adsorbent dose on the adsorption capacity has been observed it can be seen from the fig 4 that adsorption capacity decreases from 113 3 to 3 5 mg g 1 with the increase in adsorbent dose from 0 4 to 14 g l 1 the increase in removal efficiency of cv is owing to an enhancement in overall adsorption sites for any fixed initial dye concentration however the opposite trend for adsorption capacity is due to the decrease of adsorption sites per unit mass of the adsorbent at a higher dose this is due to interactions like aggregation and agglomeration of the adsorbent particles at their higher quantity in the same volume 3 4 effect of ph the ph is one of the most substantial factors for adsorption process as it influences the degree of ionization adsorbent surface charge and nature of dye solution the adsorption of cv onto pani tgsd composite was studied in the ph range of 2 12 fig 5 it is clearly depicted from the graph that the adsorption capacity increased from 43 4 to 60 4 mg g 1 with an increase in ph from 2 to 7 afterward there is a minor increase in removal efficiency with a further change in ph up to 12 in fact the ph of the medium can change the surface charge of the composite as it gets protonated in the lower ph and deprotonated at higher ph resultantly the adsorption behavior changes significantly at different ph values the dependency of adsorption on ph may alternatively be interpreted in the light of phpzc of the adsorbent the phpzc of pani tgsd was observed to be 5 fig 5 inset thus at ph 5 the surface of pani tgsd is positively charged due to protonation while at ph 5 the surface carries negative charge due to deprotonating in the presence of a large number of hydroxyl ions malekbala et al 2012 hence the favorable medium for the removal cv by the surface pani tgsd is ph 5 this is due to fact that the surface of pani tgsd acquires negative charge and adsorption of any cationic dye like cv is favored in the light of outcome results in the effect of ph on adsorption capacity and phpzc of pani tgsd a judiciously safe value of ph 7 was selected for further studies further fig 5 clearly tells that the maximum adsorption has been achieved at a ph value of 7 during decontamination of water containing cv it is remarkable that in most of the cases ph of the groundwater is close to this value it means that the proposed adsorbent pani tgsd can also be effectively utilized for the purification of contaminated groundwater 3 5 novelty of the pani tgsd adsorbent in order to check the novelty of the adsorbent a number of experiments have been carried out with the native untreated tgsd at different initial dye concentrations the adsorption results on tgsd are compared in table 1 with those of pani tgsd this table clearly reflects that the adsorption capacity of the tgsd adsorbent increased drastically after the modification with pani the enhancement was more than 2 5 times at all the concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mg l 1 of cv dye in this context it is also relevant to mention that the equilibrium was achieved within 2 h with pani tgsd while larger equilibrium time of 3 h was required for untreated tgsd thus it unambiguously highlights the novelty of pani tgsd adsorbent for the removal of dyes particularly cv 3 6 adsorption isotherms in the present study the experimental data were analyzed to fit with the three widely used isotherm models viz langmuir freundlich and temkin the results so obtained are incorporated in table 2 on the basis of relative values of r2 it has been confirmed that the langmuir isotherm model plot shown in fig 6 is the best one to describe the adsorption of cv dye onto the pani tgsd this result suggests that pani tgsd surface offers homogeneous areas for the monolayer adsorption further the adsorbent surface has a finite number of adsorption sites with constant energy of adsorption the rl value of adsorption of cv onto pani tgsd was found to be 0 119 which confirmed the favorability of the process similar reports have been documented previously that the adsorption of cv onto the adsorbents such as chitosan magnetic composite and glutamic acid modified chitosan magnetic composite yan et al 2013 κ carrageenan g poly methacrylic acid gholami et al 2016 magnetically modified spent coffee grounds safarik et al 2012 ferrofluid modified peanut husk safarik and safarikova 2010 magnetically modified activated carbon hamidzadeh et al 2015 3 aminipropyl triethoxysilane modified magnetic nanoparticle ge et al 2012 manganese oxide coated sepiolite eren et al 2010 alginate acid activated bentonite oladipo and gazi 2014 coconut tree activated carbon senthilkumaar et al 2006 apricot waste activated carbon basar 2006 fly ash supported zero valent iron liu et al 2017 fe3o4 modified kaolin sun et al 2017 jute fiber activated carbon porkodi and kumar 2007 acid activated red mud zhang et al 2014 h2so4 treated cucumis sativus smitha et al 2017 and naoh modified rice husk chakraborty et al 2011 were well represented by langmuir isotherm the values of langmuir isotherm parameters reported for the adsorption of cv by different adsorbents are listed in table 3 langmuir isotherm model is used to find out the maximum adsorption capacity qm which is found to be 263 2 mg g 1 a high value of qm indicates the usefulness of this adsorbent for the treatment of wastewater and thereby for the protection of the quality of groundwater in this table the performance pani tgsd for cv removal has been compared with 17 other modified adsorbents it has been observed that the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity 263 2 mg g 1 for monolayer coverage associated with pani tgsd is higher than that for 14 adsorbents only three adsorbents namely glutamic acid modified chitosan magnetic composite manganese oxide coated sepiolite and alginate acid activated bentonite have higher adsorption capacity table 3 further indicates that there are considerable variations in the adsorption parameters reported by different investigators in fact these parameters are strongly dependent on the experimental conditions which were obviously different for different investigators 3 7 adsorption kinetics the kinetic study is significant to understand the underlying mechanism rate determining step and evaluate the efficiency of the adsorption process to compute the rate of cv adsorption on pani tgsd composite various kinetic models have been proposed such as pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion elovich diffusion etc these models show the relation between amounts of dye adsorbed as a function of time the kinetic parameters for pseudo first order pseudo second order intraparticle and elovich diffusion model are listed in table 4 based on the value of r2 found closer to unity and coinciding of the experimental qe value 59 636 mg g 1 with the calculated qe value 60 241 mg g 1 suggested that the pseudo second order were the best followed kinetic model for the adsorption of cv dye onto the pani tgsd composite the pseudo second order plot is presented in fig 7 similar trend of pseudo second order kinetic have also been reported for the adsorption of cv by other adsorbents such as glutamic acid modified chitosan magnetic composite yan et al 2013 chitosan magnetic composite yan et al 2013 κ carrageenan g poly methacrylic acid gholami et al 2016 edta cross linked β cyclodextrin zhao et al 2015b 3 aminipropyl triethoxysilane modified magnetic nanoparticle ge et al 2012 manganese oxide coated sepiolite eren et al 2010 alginate acid activated bentonite oladipo and gazi 2014 coconut tree activated carbon senthilkumaar et al 2006 jute fiber activated carbon porkodi and kumar 2007 acid activated red mud zhang et al 2014 h2so4 treated cucumis sativus smitha et al 2017 naoh modified rice husk chakraborty et al 2011 apricot waste activated carbon önal 2006 etc the values of pseudo second order parameters as found by these researchers and also of the present study are incorporated in table 5 this table evidently shows that the results obtained in the present investigation are comparable with those of the previously reported 3 8 adsorption thermodynamics the values δg for the adsorption of cv onto pani tgsd at different temperatures as calculated by using eq 10 are listed in table 6 the negative values of δg confirm that the adsorption process is spontaneous within the temperature range of study since the negative value of δg increases with temperature and thus it can be established that the process is more achievable at higher temperatures thus entropy factor plays a dominating role towards the adsorption the values of δh and δs were determined from the slope and intercept of ln kc vs 1 t plot fig 8 and presented in table 6 the table indicates that the process is endothermic and associated with an increase in entropy it is relevant to comment here that the adsorption of cv molecules onto other adsorbents such as magnetically modified activated carbon hamidzadeh et al 2015 manganese oxide coated sepiolite eren et al 2010 alginate acid activated bentonite oladipo and gazi 2014 coconut tree activated carbon senthilkumaar et al 2006 apricot waste activated carbon basar 2006 fe3o4 modified kaolin sun et al 2017 etc was also reported to be endothermic in nature the positive change in entropy reflects that there is an increase in randomness at the adsorbate solution interface due to a gain of translational entropy at the time of adsorption coordinated water molecules are displaced by the adsorbate species and gain more translational entropy than is lost by cv resulting in an overall increase in randomness in the adsorbate adsorbent interaction kyzas et al 2012 unnithan and anirudhan 2001 literature survey reveals that the increase in randomness of the species accompanying with the adsorption of cv by different adsorbents such as chitosan magnetic composite yan et al 2013 κ carrageenan g poly methacrylic acid gholami et al 2016 magnetically modified activated carbon hamidzadeh et al 2015 alginate acid activated bentonite oladipo and gazi 2014 coconut tree activated carbon senthilkumaar et al 2006 apricot waste activated carbon basar 2006 fe3o4 modified kaolin sun et al 2017 acid activated red mud zhang et al 2014 has also been observed by several other investigators 3 9 desorption study the possible recovery used pani tgsd was examined by performing desorption studies with different desorbing agents as already mentioned in section 2 9 the percent desorption efficiencies linked with various desorbents are summarized in table 7 it has been observed that hcl 0 1 m is the best desorbing agent among the chosen ones for the recovery of pani tgsd with 60 7 desorption in order to make the adsorption process economical and feasible the adsorbent should be reusable in several consecutive adsorption desorption cycles in the present study four consecutive cycles have been carried out with 0 1 m hcl solution and the results are illustrated in fig 9 this figure confirms that this adsorbent has potential to be used effectively at least four repeated cycles for the removal of cv from aqueous solution 4 conclusion treatment of industrial effluents before their discharge into the water bodies is essential to maintain and preserve the quality of groundwater present research study explores the efficiency of effective adsorption of toxic cv dye onto the pani tgsd composite adsorbent from aqueous system it was observed that adsorptive removal of dye was influenced by the different factors such as cv pani tgsd contact time initial cv concentration pani tgsd dosage ph of the medium and temperature it was found that equilibrium for the adsorption of cv onto pani tgsd composite was attained in 120 min in acidic medium a significant enhancement in adsorption of cv was observed up to a ph of 7 and thereafter the change becomes insignificant the kinetic study shows that the pseudo second order kinetics was best described the adsorption process isotherm analysis of the results reflected that the isotherm results were best represented by langmuir model the maximum monolayer coverage adsorption capacity was established to be 263 2 mg g 1 the thermodynamic study revealed that the adsorption process was spontaneous endothermic and associated with the enhancement of entropy the desorption of cv from cv loaded pani tgsd was found to be maximum in 0 1 m hcl in view of promising adsorption capacity and simplicity and ease in the synthesis of pani tgsd the present study submits that this composite is an effective low cost and economically feasible adsorbent for the treatment of polluted water containing dyes as contaminants the present study concludes that the proposed adsorbent pani tgsd can be exploited to keep groundwater clean by effective removal of dyes from polluted wastewater acknowledgments the authors are thankful to the chairman department of applied chemistry faculty

metal refers to any metallic chemical element that has a high density gold silver copper iron lead etc or is toxic or poisonous at low concentrations mercury cadmium lead chromium etc goodell 2006 trace concentration of some heavy metals can be necessary for health but too much may cause acute or chronic toxicity poisoning many of the heavy metals released in the mining and burning of coal are environmentally and biologically toxic elements such as lead mercury nickel tin cadmium antimony and arsenic as well as radio isotopes of thorium and strontium for example small amounts of lead in the body can make it difficult for children to learn pay attention and succeed in school lead accounts for most of the cases of pediatric heavy metal poisoning mercury exposure put newborns at risk of neurological deficits and increased cardiovascular risk in adults arsenic is the most common cause of acute heavy metal poisoning in adults and does not leave the body once it enters coal contains most elements in the periodic table as it is created through compressed organic matter containing virtually every element in the periodic table mainly carbon but also heavy metals the heavy metal content of coal varies by coal seam and geographic region a variety of chemicals mostly metals are associated with coal that are either found in the coal directly or in the layers of rock that lie

large coal bases spread over 12 provinces and autonomous regions six of these 12 coal base provinces are water scarce with hebei henan and ningxia even running a water deficit three are water stressed whilst three are water rich these 12 coal base provinces also rely heavily on groundwater with 31 of total water supplied by groundwater compared to the national average of 18 on top of this over 70 of deep and shallow groundwater in the north china plain is polluted in the chinese national standard gb t 19223 2015 state administration for market regulation of china and china standardization administration 2015 coal mine water is defined and classified the coal mine water is defined as the drainage of bursting water infiltrating water from surface water and working produced water during coal mining activity according to ph values the coal mine water is divided into acid ph 6 0 neutral 6 0 9 0 and alkaline ph 9 coal mine water regarding tds coal mine water is classified into low 1000 mg l medium 1000 6000 mg l and high 6000 mg l tds coal mine water regarding to suspended matter the coal mine waters are low 50 mg l medium 50 500 mg l and high 500 mg l suspended coal mine water based on concentration of cations and anions the coal mine waters can be grouped into seven classes respectively some coal mine water has special characteristics is also defined such as concentrations or levels of iron fluorine sulfur arsenic temperature manganese and radioactivity besides arsenic some other toxic trace elements maybe contained in the coal mine water the acid coal mine water usually forms through oxidation and dissolution of sulfide such as pyrite sahoo et al 2014 zhu et al 2017a 2017b through this way metal elements could be released into water causing high concentrations of pb cd cu etc johnson 2003 cravotta 2005 2015a zhao et al 2014 cravotta and brady 2015b yue and zhao 2008 found that co ni zn and cd were released during oxidation and dissolution of pyrite release of al cr as pb were affected by ph of the leachate and absorption co precipitation however the neutral and alkaline mine water is also common because of dissolution of alkaline minerals such as calcite and dolomite net effect of which determines ph value of coal mine water and produces high mineralization value zhao et al 2014 bidari and aghazadeh 2018 releasing behavior of trace elements is different among the acid neutral and alkaline water through drainage of coal mine water the trace elements may be transported to surrounding water bodies cravotta 2008a 2008b shan et al

element immigration and the pathway of the trace elements have been widely investigated however influence of occurrence of trace elements on migration behavior is a gap to understand the leaching

hwang et al 2001 singh et al 2004 liu et al 2017 etc by using the method of multivariate technology it is possible to disclose the leaching mechanism from the view of trace element occurrence and leaching behavior the aim of our research can be divided into three steps 1 get data from the in site sampling and experiments and make a geochemistry analysis 2 set up a model of multivariate

seam xuzhou coal mining group co ltd 2005 2 2 leaching experiments and sample test 16 water samples and 28 rock coal samples were collected from the study area water samples were collected in 1000 ml nalgene bottles previously acid cleaned and rinsed twice using the water to be collected pe and ph of water samples were taken in the field using a jenco 6010 ph orp meter coal and rock samples were collected from the working area at the mine and put into plastic bags that were immediately sealed major ions and physical parameters of water samples were determined according to chinese standard protocols in jiangsu provincial coal geology research institute ph was also analysed in the laboratory using glass electrode method gb t 6920 86 total dissolved solids and hardness were analysed using the standard gb t 8538 method k and na were analysed by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry gb 11904 89 mg and ca were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometric gb 11905 89 fe was measured by phenanthroline spectrophotometry hj t 345 2007 ammonia and nitrate nitrogen were analysed by phase molecular absorption spectrometry hj t 195 2005 and gas phase molecular absorption spectrometry hj j 198 2005 respectively sulphate and chloride were determined using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry gb 13196 91 and silver nitrate titration gb 11896 89 respectively solid samples were acid digested to determine concentration of trace elements treatment can be described as follows 0 05 mg of rock sample were weighted and put into tetrafluoroethylene crucibles to these some acids were added in the following quantities 3 ml of hno3 1 ml of hf and 1 ml of hclo4 then crucibles were heated until all liquid consumed up at that point 3 ml of hcl were added and crucibles were heated once more until all liquid evaporated after that crucibles were rinsed three times using deionised water this was filtered into 50 ml volumetric flasks for analysis concentration of trace elements in water coal rock samples were determined by icp ms and the icp aes the icp ms analysis was carried out in the china university of mining and technology using the x series icp ms thermo electron co at the following operating conditions icp ms power 1200 w nebuliser flow rate 0 80 l min auxiliary flow rate 0 75 l min coolant argon flow rate 13 50 l min an internal standard of rh was used to determine limit of detection 0 5 pg ml and analytical deviation less than 2 the icp aes analysis was carried out in the nanjing university using a jy38s icp aes model the limit of detection and deviation for the analysis carried out by such equipment are 0 01 μg ml and less than 2 respectively the mineralogy of the coal and rock samples was determined using xrd at the imperial college london samples were analysed on a philips pw 1830 diffractometer system using cu kα radiation this is fitted with a pw 1820 goniometer and a graphite monochromator rock samples were analysed in the 2θ range 2 5 70 degrees xrd signals were processed using the hiltonbrooks interface with output to the traces software leaching experiments were conducted using batch mode to simulate conditions in a coal seam where water movement is slow and dissolution reactions tend to achieve equilibrium su and wang 2011 schwartz et al 2016 studied the leaching behavior of arsenic and selenium from coal ash however study of the leaching behavior and mechanism from coal and host rock are rare to simulate a closed environment with low po2 see stumm and morgan 1996 for details bottles were closed with a rubber stopper samples were taken out using syringes the pe of the solution during experiments was determined by a jenco 6010 ph orp meter all glassware intended to be in contact with rock coal and water samples was previously soaked in 3 2 mol l hno3 for 2 days to reduce cross contamination rock coal samples were ground sieved to 120 µm and divided into 30 mg sub samples for the leaching experiment three sub samples were used for each sample one per 1000 ml aliquot of deionised water at the following phs 2 5 6 7 and 12 flasks were sealed and shaken every 2 h for up to 10 days temperature was controlled using a water bath at about 40 c leachate solutions were collected using syringes at 2 6 24 and 48 h 0 5 mol l hno3 was added into all the samples leachates aliquots were titrated with hcl or naoh depending of the ph conditions to compare the behavior of leaching elements at acid neutral and alkali environments in addition to leaching experiments water samples including those collected from the zhaoyang lake shown in fig 1 and yunlong lakes in the study area but not coal mine district were shaken every 2 h for up to 10 days at constant temperature of 40 c 2 3 multivariate analysis while univariate statistical analysis of a large scale of data could be cumbersome and cause misunderstanding and error in the interpretation multivariate statistical techniques are more robust therefore it becomes more useful tool for environmental data treatment and of identification of anomalous patterns during the immigration process of the trace elements from coal bedding seam to groundwater and surface water the complex matrix system solid and liquid body are involved in each system the elements show different or similar co existing patterns and immigration behavior including dissolution transport adsorption therefore the multivariate analysis can be used to find out different and similar components which suggest similar and dissimilar occurrence in solids and immigration mechanism during the process of water rock interaction in the area of hydrochemical studies the pca method has been widely used to reduce dimensions and analyze the relations among the variates and samples hwang et al 2001 singh et al 2004 liu et al 2017 güler et al 2002 2012 sako et al 2016 cortes et al 2016 carucci et al 2012 chihi et al 2015 the pca is a typical non supervised analytical method to calculate the pca result data are first standardized by mean centering each column within the original data matrix and then dividing each of the values within each column by the column standard deviation with pca the large data matrix is reduced to smaller ones that consist of pc loadings and scores pc loadings are the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix therefore it contains information on all of the variables combined into a single number with the loadings indicating the relative contribution that each variable makes to that scores pcs are calculated so that they take into account the correlations present in the original data but are uncorrelated to others typically the data can be reduced to two or three dimensions that representing majority of the variance within the original data sometimes more dimensions may have to be included to present more variance of the original data singh et al 2004 based on the pca analytical result the loadings and scores of data frame were then clustered in the dimensions that pca have reduced as the axis of coordinates were rotated to achieve maximum loadings of elements the rotated axis of coordinates was marked as rcs the bi plot of pca result is usually drawn to show patterns of parameters and samples however the loading and score of the pca axis show different aspects of the result in our study the loadings of every drawn show co existing pattern of elements and scores of every drawn show the co existing pattern of samples what we focus on is the co existing pattern of elements to disclose their migration mechanism the clustering result of loadings show similar and different pattern among elements and parameters therefore the co existing behavior of elements and parameters can be summarized the clustering result of scores show similar and different pattern among samples therefore the co existing behavior of samples which means types of solid and liquid samples can be summarized the clustering method was based on the gaussian mixture model the gm model can cluster target reasonable comparing with k means algorithm the gm model does not divide different group by stiff border but allow some mixture of different groups so the classifying probability to each group can be calculated we have applied software r as tool the packages psych and mclust were used to calculate pca and gm model clustering result 3 result and discussion 3 1 major ions in water samples and multivariate analysis the sampling site type major ion concentrations and major parameters of coal mine water carbonate water and surface water are listed in the table 1 according to sampling marks the samples 1 12 were coal mine water the samples 13 14 were surface water and the samples 15 16 were carbonate water respectively a piper plot fig 3 has been drawn to show the cation and anion composition in the coal mine water carbonate water and surface water as shown in the table 1 and fig 3 the surface water belongs to low mineralized water carbonate water and coal mine water belongs to medium mineralized water according to the national standard of coal mine classification and the surface water is na mg ca cl so4 2 hco3 type water the carbonate water is na mg ca so4 2 water type the coal mine water is na ca so4 2 na so4 2 or na hco3 type water coal mine waters showed characteristics of high soluble minerals so4 2 of most coal mine water samples were higher than usepa and chinese highest limit 250 mg l besides so4 2 cl tds and hardness were also higher than the chinese regulated limit the combination of higher levels of ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 concentrations in the groundwater suggests that the coupled reactions involving sulfide oxidation and carbonate dissolution which largely controls the solute acquisition processes in the study area singh et al 2007 the scatter diagrams between different ions can reveal information about the origin and evolution solutes and about the hydro geochemical processes control mechanism occurring in the aquifer edmunds et al 1987 reactions between groundwater and aquifer matrix can significantly control water chemistry the cross plot between na vs cl in diagram fig 4a shows most of the sample points falls below the equiline and predominance of na ions over cl ions suggests addition of na ions released from the weathering of silicate minerals and ion exchange within the aquifer mayback 1987 the na vs ca2 scatter diagram fig 4b shows higher levels of calcium concentrations than sodium concentrations and also indicate ion exchange reactions occurring in the aquifer which increases the ca2 concentrations in groundwater trace elements of surface water and coal mine water in coal mine district and non coalmine district is shown in table 1 compared with the national standard of ground water criterion and surface water criterion trace elements as se hg pb cd cr belong to class three to five which means slightly to severely contaminated comparing the surface water from coal mine district sample 13 and non coalmine district sample14 it is found that the concentrations are significantly higher in the surface water from coal mine district li and xu 2008 studied as and hg concentration of surface water in coal mine district founding that their concentration in sediment of river is concentrated from the analysis of the data it is found that 1 the coal mine water has higher mineralization than surface water which suggest water rock interaction especially solution of minerals between the rock coal and ground water 2 higher na portion in the coal mine water was found suggesting ion exchange behavior of coal mine water 3 the data and literature have showed that the coal mine water is contaminated by trace elements and have contaminating potential for ground water and surface water it can be concluded that the trace elements were released by water rock interaction such as oxidation dissolution ion exchange etc however trace elements may be controlled by different water rock interaction mode which take account of trace element occurrence water parameters and reaction process the 16 water samples were analysed using the pca method and then clustered using the gaussian mixture mode under the hypothesis that same source of water should have similar element co behavior pattern the elements have similar behaviors can be clustered and they should have similar process of water rock interaction scores of the analytical result show similarity of samples based on the in site sampling strategy the water samples can be grouped to coal mine water carbonate water and surface water in the pca analysis if six principal components were selected the rc 1 6 explained 29 21 17 10 9 5 of variance respectively as the rc1 3 were more important the first three rcs were taken after re calculation the principal components rc1 rc2 and rc3 explained 30 25 and 19 of all variance and 74 in all as shown in the fig 5 22 elements ions and parameters can be reasonably projected to three axes principal components and then clustered into four groups the group i includes k na cl so4 2 tds cr which are marked in solid circles the group ii ca mg mn hardness are marked in hollow squares the group iii hco3 co3 2 ph zn ni cu are marked in solid triangles the group iv as hg se mo cd pb co ba are marked in crosses in fig 6 the scores of 16 samples were calculated and plotted in the chart the samples were clustered to three groups the group i ii iii are showed in solid circles hollow squares and solid triangles respectively the group i has high positive scores on the principal component rc1 at the same time the group ii and iii have high negative scores on the principal component rc1 the group iii has high positive scores on the component principal rc2 according to the sampling recode the group i means coal mine water the group ii means carbonate water and the group iii include surface water and part of coal mine water the coal mine water was collected from different coal mine district about 30 km apart and different coal seam the coal mine water may undergo different water rock interaction in type and level therefore some coal mine water may have similar pattern with surface water elements in group iv have high loadings on principal component rc1 most of these elements are environment concern trace element it is inferred that the rc1 stands for the influence of coal mine water these elements show the most variance of coal mine water and groups i in the samples are coal mine water the group ii of elements are mainly component of water hardness which have high positive load on the principal component rc2 the group iii of samples have high positive scores on the principal component rc2 groundwater compositions that are primarily controlled by carbonate reactions will have relatively high ca and mg concentrations and bicarbonate contents are attributed to the presence of calcite and dolomite stumm and morgan 1981 mohanty et al 2018 therefore the rc2 stands for the influence of carbonate water the group iii of samples mainly in carbonate waters mn in this group was caused by the mechanism of dissolution of mn carbonates bhattacharya et al 2012 the high soluble major elements have high loadings on the principal component rc3 therefore the rc3 stand for dissolution of high soluble minerals however in the score chart coal mine water and surface water spread through the rc3 this phenomenon suggest that the dissolution happens in different water environment or the coal mine water had influence on the surface water 3 2 occurrence and leaching mode of trace elements in coal host rock as the carrier of trace element kaolinite quartz calcite pyrite and illite were the predominant minerals in coal gangue with a certain amount of organic matter and a little mica fu et al 2013 wang et al 2005 bai et al 2014 peng et al 2018 dai et al 2018 in our study the mineral composition in coal host rock were tested using xrd the result showed that quartz kaolinite illite feldspar albite pyrite took 52 28 17 1 1 and trace component of overall mineral in weight in order to analysis the trace element leaching mode of coal seam host rock the trace elements in host rock and its leaching product in water were calculated by using the mothed of pca and clustering analysis analytical results of solid matrix were used to infer the trace element occurrences in the host rock the results of liquid samples were used to analyze the immigration mode of trace element then leaching mechanisms were analysed and concluded by combing the two types of results the major and trace element concentrations in host rock are listed in the table 1 in shan et al 2018 in the pca analysis of coal host rock if six principal components were selected the rc 1 6 explained 34 22 17 7 7 5 of variance respectively as the rc1 3 were more important the first three rcs were taken after re calculation the rc 1 3 explained 34 28 and 13 of variance respectively elements in host rock can be classified into three groups the group i marked in solid triangles includes zn ba mn fe mg as hg se cd the groups ii marked in hollow squares includes v cu sr ca the group iii marked in solid circles includes mo pb cr ti al respectively fig 7 finkelman et al 2018 analysed occurrence of trace element in coal it is found that the as hg cd zn mainly occur in sulfide form ca and sr are mainly carbonate related mo pb cr ti al are mainly in clay minerals xiong et al 2017 found cd are mainly in sulfide form in the coal host rock as and mo are mainly carbonate and silicate related form cr has high affinity of clay and ash yield in gangue zhou et al 2014 for pb and se zhou et al 2014 reported high relationship each other and with fe in gangue so high sulfide mineral affinity was observed zn and cd was found to have high association with pyrite and sphalerite zhou et al 2014 group i have high positive loading on the principal rc1 based on literature research and their co existing behavior the elements in the group i occurred in sulfide mode group ii and group iii have low loading on the rc1 and therefore low relation with sulfide were found group ii stand for marine facies minerals such as calcite and the group iii stand for continental facies minerals such as clay minerals the groups ii and iii have high positive loading on the rc3 and rc2 respectively meaning that the rc3 and rc2 meaning the affinity of marine face and continental face origin from the charting result we could also find that the group ii and iii have negative relation considering the environmental concern elements the as hg se cd mainly occur in sulfide minerals pb and cr mainly occur in clay minerals the trace element concentrations in host rock leachate are listed in the table 3 in shan et al 2018 in the pca analysis of host rock leaching if six principal components were selected the rc 1 6 explained 32 19 17 15 6 6 of variance respectively as the rc1 3 were more important the first three rcs were taken after re calculation the rc 1 3 explained 33 21 and 19 of variance respectively the trace elements were classified into four groups based on leaching behavior they are group i al si cr in solid circles group ii v se as hg in solid triangles group iii mg fe cd pb in crosses and group iv ti mo zn sr ba in hollow squares fig 8 the group iii ii and i have high positive loadings on the rc1 rc2 and rc3 respectively on the rc1 dimension the group iii mg fe cd pb have high loadings and other three groups have little relationships this dimension stands for the metal element behavior i e the dissolution or adsorption by iron oxide minerals on the rc2 the group ii v se as mo hg have high loadings at the same time other three groups have little relations with the group ii this group stands for releasing of major environmental concern elements group i al si ti cr has high loading on the rc3 and the other three groups have little relations with the group i this group i stands for releasing of elements born in continental facies minerals combining the host rock analysis and leaching product the leaching mechanisms can be answered first the environmental concern trace element se as and hg had similar behavior pattern in solid and liquid matrix therefore it is inferred that the leaching product in the water were mainly from dissolution of its bearing mineral the sulfide mineral in our study area the sulfur content is relatively low compared with other coal mine district however trace component of pyrite in the host rock was found pyrite is highly probability oxidized and dissolved in an aerobic environment and then the trace elements including se as and hg were leaching into ground water and surface water in the coal seam lower than our study area which will be mined after the sulfur content is higher therefore stronger water rock interaction and more trace element releasing may happen second the trace element cr al have similar behavior pattern in solid and liquid matrix the leaching product were mainly from dissolution of its bearing minerals these elements usually occur in continental facies mineral such as clay mineral therefore the environmental concern element chromium came from the dissolution or transformation of clay minerals compared to fresh water seawater is more favorable for the formation of ammonian illite during deposition when the host rock interacts with fresh water illite transform to kaolinite accompanying releasing of chromium shan et al 2010 zheng et al 2016 in our analysis of the xrd test result illite content in host rock reduced from 17 to 15 and 12 and kaolinite increased from 28 to 29 and 35 after leaching while ph was 12 and 2 respectively the trace elements pb and cd have different behavior pattern in solid and liquid matrix for their high adsorption affinity in alkaline and neutral ph environment these elements may be adsorbed by clay mineral iron oxides or forming new mineral in study area although the pb and cd have low concentration in coal mine water high pb and cd concentrations was found in the surface water in coal mine district and non coalmine district pb concentration of surface water were 7 21 μg l and 0 517 μg l cd concentration were 0 05 μg l and 1 09 μg l respectively it is clearly that the surface water was contaminated by pb and cd in the coal mine district therefore these elements may be taken by adsorbent or minerals through coal mine drainage and release in the surface water environment 3 3 occurrence and leaching mode of trace elements in coal in order to analyze the trace element leaching mode of coal seam the trace elements in coal and its leaching product in water were calculated by using the mothed pca and clustering by using the similar strategy of analysis of host rock leaching the solid samples and liquid samples in coal leaching was discussed then the leaching mechanisms of trace elements in coal were obtained the major and trace element concentrations in coal are listed in the table 2 in shan et al 2018 in the pca analysis of coal analysis if six principal components were selected the rc 1 6 explained 36 21 14 8 7 5 of variance respectively as the rc1 3 were more important the first three rcs were taken after re calculation the rc 1 3 explained 44 23 and 12 of variance respectively elements in coal can be classified into four groups the group i marked in solid circles includes mo pb cr cu ti al se the groups ii marked in hollow squares includes zn cd the group iii marked in solid triangles includes ba mn sr mg ca and the group iv marked in crosses includes v as fe hg respectively fig 9 group i and iv have high positive loading on the principal rc1 finkelman et al 2018 investigated occurrence of most of the trace elements it is found that 65 of ti 90 of al and 75 of cr 25 and 30 of cu and mo are in clay minerals little pb and se are in clay form 75 and 65 of zn and cd formed in mono sulfide form 70 and 90 of as and hg are sulfide form ward 2002 argued the pyrite affinity of as and swaine 1990 reported clay and organic association of as in coal pumure et al 2011 argued that as and se usually occur in clay minerals pb was found to be sulfide form as pyrite and galena finkelman and gross 1999 dai et al 2006 and organic form swaine 1990 based on the literature research and their co existing behavior the elements in the group i occurred in clay mineral mode the group ii and iv suggest the sulfide existing mode the group ii has two element zn and cd this result is consistent with some previous studies finkelman and gross 1999 gurdal 2008 finkelman et al 2018 they can be in form of sphalerite the group ii and group iii have low loading on the rc1 which suggest that the sphalerite may have high affinity of marine face origin the group iii standing for marine facies minerals have high loadings on the rc2 at the same time other three groups have low loadings on the rc2 meaning low relations with marine facies minerals the groups ii and iv have high positive loading on the rc3 the rc3 stand for sulfide minerals other two groups have little relations with the group ii and iv from the charting result it is concluded the main occurrence of trace elements as hg cd occurred in sulfide minerals pb cr and se occurred in clay minerals zn and cd occurred in sphalerite compared with host rock the sphalerite is more probably to form independent mineral in coal the trace element concentrations in coal leachate are listed in the table 5 in shan et al 2018 in the pca analysis of coal leaching product if six principal components were selected the rc 1 6 explained 26 20 14 10 9 7 of variance respectively as the rc1 3 were more important the first three rcs were taken after re calculation the rc 1 3 explained 29 28 and 11 of variance respectively the leaching product were classified into three groups based on the trace elements behavior they are group i al se cd pb in solid circles group ii si as sr mo hg in hollow squares and group iii ti cr mn fe zn ba in solid triangles respectively fig 10 the group iii has high positive loadings on the rc1 and the other two groups have low or negative loading on the rc1 according to the previous analysis the elements in group i are mainly clay bearing minerals so the group i stands for the element s immigration caused by the dissolution and transformation of clay mineral the group ii has high positive loading on the rc2 and the other two groups have low rc2 loadings the rc2 dimensions shows oxidation and dissolution of sulfide minerals so it is inferred that elements in other two groups have little relations with sulfide dissolution the group i have relative high loadings on the rc3 other two groups have relative low loading on the rc3 the group i includes some environmental concern elements so it is also an important mechanism of trace element immigration combining the coal analysis and leaching product leaching mechanisms can be answered first the environmental concern trace element as and hg had similar behavior pattern in solid and liquid matrix so the leaching product in water were mainly from dissolution of its bearing mineral the sulfide mineral we have found nearly 1 of pyrite in weight in the host rock pyrite in coal was relatively low due to the main organic composite however some pyrite mineral nodule can be found in the coal seam pyrite is stable in an anaerobic environment however in an aerobic environment it is easy to be oxidized and dissolved and then the trace elements including as and hg were leaching into ground water and surface water xiong et al 2017 found that cd cr as tl have high affinity with fe during coal leaching therefore the pyrite leaching may be the mechanism of their immigration in the samples we have picked up the content of pyrite was relatively low however higher content of sulfur was expected in the lower coal strata coal seams no 17 and no 19 of the carboniferous system as ph of coal mine water is determined by the mineral of sulfide and carbonate high sulfur may lower ph value then the leaching behavior changes zhao et al 2014 bidari and aghazadeh 2018 more metal trace elements may be released on the other hand metalloid trace element in the water may be reduced second the trace element se and pb have similar behavior pattern in solid and liquid matrix the leaching product were mainly from dissolution of its bearing minerals according to the literature research and co existing analysis these elements usually occur in continental facies mineral such as clay mineral therefore the environmental concern element pb and se came from the dissolution or transformation of clay minerals cr have similar immigration mode with some continental mineral element so this element can also be inferred to be released by clay minerals 4 conclusion combining the literature review multivariate analysis of solid and liquid analysis the co existing behavior of trace elements in coal host rock and water were inferred then the leaching mechanisms were concluded in the coal seam host rock se cd hg as occurred mainly in sulfide minerals be and v occurred mainly in carbonate minerals cr and pb occurred mainly in clay minerals respectively in coal seam se cr pb mainly occurred in clay minerals as and hg were mainly occurred in sulfide minerals the leaching mechanism in coal host rock and coal are similarity in some part and different in other aspects first as and hg show similar immigration mechanism both in coal and host rock second se show different main immigration mechanism in coal and host rock matrix the reason may be the various occurrence of se in coal and host in fact se have been found to exist in both clay and sulfide mineral so mechanism is not unique but some mechanism may be prominent in different matrix third cr is mainly released by the transformation of clay mineral cd and pb showed different co existing behavior in solid and liquid matrix these elements are typical metal elements they can be easily adsorbed in alkaline and neutral environment it is probably the reason of the different co existing pattern in solid and liquid matrix the immigration mechanism and long term of environmental impact need further studies acknowledgements the test of samples was carried out in the jiangsu provincial coal geology research institute the analysis and test center of the china university of mining and technology imperial college london we would like to thank all of them for their support formatting of funding sources our study is funded by the fundamental research funds for the central

12297,trace elements in coal mine water have pollution potential to environmental water bodies by process of water rock interaction in coal seam and coal host rock trace elements may immigrate from solid matrix to water including oxidation dissolution ion exchange adsorption desorption etc water parameters and occurrence of trace elements in the solid matrix are keys to leaching behavior in site observation and leaching experiments were designed and implemented so as to model these processes analyze leaching behavior and mechanisms the data composes a matrix by two dimensions samples and trace elements which were used to analyze trace element occurrence in coal host rock and leaching behavior in the coal rock leaching water by method of multivariate analysis analytical results showed major occurrence of trace elements in the coal and host rock and key controlling mechanism of trace elements during water rock interaction in coal host rock seam se cd hg as occurred in sulfide minerals be and v occurred in carbonate minerals cr and pb occurred in clay minerals respectively se as and hg immigrated through dissolution of sulfide minerals cr immigrated through transformation of clay minerals in coal seam se cr pb occurred in clay minerals as and hg occurred in sulfide minerals se pb and cr immigrated through transformation of clay minerals as and hg immigrated through dissolution of sulfide minerals respectively graphical abstract fx1 keywords coal coal seam host rock occurrence leaching mechanism multivariate analysis gaussian mixture model 1 introduction heavy metal refers to any metallic chemical element that has a high density gold silver copper iron lead etc or is toxic or poisonous at low concentrations mercury cadmium lead chromium etc goodell 2006 trace concentration of some heavy metals can be necessary for health but too much may cause acute or chronic toxicity poisoning many of the heavy metals released in the mining and burning of coal are environmentally and biologically toxic elements such as lead mercury nickel tin cadmium antimony and arsenic as well as radio isotopes of thorium and strontium for example small amounts of lead in the body can make it difficult for children to learn pay attention and succeed in school lead accounts for most of the cases of pediatric heavy metal poisoning mercury exposure put newborns at risk of neurological deficits and increased cardiovascular risk in adults arsenic is the most common cause of acute heavy metal poisoning in adults and does not leave the body once it enters coal contains most elements in the periodic table as it is created through compressed organic matter containing virtually every element in the periodic table mainly carbon but also heavy metals the heavy metal content of coal varies by coal seam and geographic region a variety of chemicals mostly metals are associated with coal that are either found in the coal directly or in the layers of rock that lie above and between the seams of coal goodell 2006 coal mining has caused global environmental concern fang et al 2003 finkelman et al 2002 liu et al 2004 2005 querol et al 2001 zhou et al 2014 for the environmental concern toxic elements such as as hg se cd pb cr can immigrate into surrounding environment the toxic elements may immigrate through combustion into air and water rock interaction of coal rock and ground water surface water into surrounding water bodies mohanty et al 2018 water contamination of coal mine could occur in active and abandoned coal mines besides gangue rejected by the active coal mine may release toxic trace elements on land zhou et al 2014 in coal mines both coal and host rock are source of the toxic elements most of them as cd co cr cu mn ni pb se sn v and zn are associate with inorganic matter finkelman et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 as reported by china water risk on the topic of towards a water energy secure china more than 90 of coal production comes from 14 large coal bases spread over 12 provinces and autonomous regions six of these 12 coal base provinces are water scarce with hebei henan and ningxia even running a water deficit three are water stressed whilst three are water rich these 12 coal base provinces also rely heavily on groundwater with 31 of total water supplied by groundwater compared to the national average of 18 on top of this over 70 of deep and shallow groundwater in the north china plain is polluted in the chinese national standard gb t 19223 2015 state administration for market regulation of china and china standardization administration 2015 coal mine water is defined and classified the coal mine water is defined as the drainage of bursting water infiltrating water from surface water and working produced water during coal mining activity according to ph values the coal mine water is divided into acid ph 6 0 neutral 6 0 9 0 and alkaline ph 9 coal mine water regarding tds coal mine water is classified into low 1000 mg l medium 1000 6000 mg l and high 6000 mg l tds coal mine water regarding to suspended matter the coal mine waters are low 50 mg l medium 50 500 mg l and high 500 mg l suspended coal mine water based on concentration of cations and anions the coal mine waters can be grouped into seven classes respectively some coal mine water has special characteristics is also defined such as concentrations or levels of iron fluorine sulfur arsenic temperature manganese and radioactivity besides arsenic some other toxic trace elements maybe contained in the coal mine water the acid coal mine water usually forms through oxidation and dissolution of sulfide such as pyrite sahoo et al 2014 zhu et al 2017a 2017b through this way metal elements could be released into water causing high concentrations of pb cd cu etc johnson 2003 cravotta 2005 2015a zhao et al 2014 cravotta and brady 2015b yue and zhao 2008 found that co ni zn and cd were released during oxidation and dissolution of pyrite release of al cr as pb were affected by ph of the leachate and absorption co precipitation however the neutral and alkaline mine water is also common because of dissolution of alkaline minerals such as calcite and dolomite net effect of which determines ph value of coal mine water and produces high mineralization value zhao et al 2014 bidari and aghazadeh 2018 releasing behavior of trace elements is different among the acid neutral and alkaline water through drainage of coal mine water the trace elements may be transported to surrounding water bodies cravotta 2008a 2008b shan et al 2010 bhuiyan et al 2010 liu et al 2017 groundwater contaminated by abandoned coal mine has also been identified using the isotope tracing method gammons and duaime 2010 gammons et al 2013a 2013b besides the water parameters occurrence of trace elements also influences its migration boruvka et al 2012 dai et al 2008 paul 2005 swaine and goodarzi 1995 zheng et al 2007 main minerals in coal includes quartz clay sulfur contained minerals and lesser amount of feldspars and carbonates karayiğit et al 2017 liu et al 2015 as cr pb hg mo zn sb was found to enriched in coal compared with continent crust tozsin 2014 song et al 2007 zheng et al 2008 sia and abdullah 2011 the occurrence of trace elements has similar rules some of them can varies depending on locations fu et al 2013 song et al 2007 sia and abdullah 2011 zheng et al 2017 ali et al 2015 comparing with coal host rock and gangue rejected on land of coal can release up to ten times toxic element into water xiong et al 2017 zhou et al 2014 wang et al 2014 dai et al 2004 goodarzi and swaine 1994 concentration and occurrence of trace elements in coal host rock and coal mine water influence of water parameters on trace element immigration and the pathway of the trace elements have been widely investigated however influence of occurrence of trace elements on migration behavior is a gap to understand the leaching mechanism further multivariate analytical technology provides a method to study the water chrematistics orakwe and chukwuma 2017 source matiatos et al 2018 zhu et al 2017a 2017b ground water pathway hwang et al 2001 singh et al 2004 liu et al 2017 etc by using the method of multivariate technology it is possible to disclose the leaching mechanism from the view of trace element occurrence and leaching behavior the aim of our research can be divided into three steps 1 get data from the in site sampling and experiments and make a geochemistry analysis 2 set up a model of multivariate including the pca and gaussian mixture model to get optimized group strategy for the water and solid samples 3 look back to the trace elements leaching behavior to disclose controlling leaching mechanism of environmental concern toxic trace elements from coal and host rock to surrounding water bodies 2 method 2 1 site description and sampling this study was carried out at the xuzhou datun

aquifers one is located in the carboniferous taiyuan formation thickness of 180 200 m and the other in the ordovician thickness of 600 m these last two aquifers are the main water sources of the coal seam xuzhou coal mining group co ltd 2005 2 2 leaching experiments and sample test 16 water samples and 28 rock coal samples were collected from the study area water samples were collected in 1000 ml nalgene bottles previously acid cleaned and rinsed twice using the water to be collected pe and ph of water samples were taken in the field using a jenco 6010 ph orp meter coal and rock samples were collected from the working area at the mine and put into plastic bags that were immediately sealed major ions and physical parameters of water samples were determined according to chinese standard protocols in jiangsu provincial coal geology research institute ph was also analysed in the laboratory using glass electrode method gb t 6920 86 total dissolved solids and hardness were analysed using the standard gb t 8538 method k and na were analysed by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry gb 11904 89 mg and ca were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometric gb 11905 89 fe was measured by phenanthroline spectrophotometry hj t 345 2007 ammonia and nitrate nitrogen were analysed by phase molecular absorption spectrometry hj t 195 2005 and gas phase molecular absorption spectrometry hj j 198 2005 respectively sulphate and chloride were determined using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry gb 13196 91 and silver nitrate titration gb 11896 89 respectively solid samples were acid digested to determine concentration of trace elements treatment can be described as follows 0 05 mg of rock sample were weighted and put into tetrafluoroethylene crucibles to these some acids were added in the following quantities 3 ml of hno3 1 ml of hf and 1 ml of hclo4 then crucibles were heated until all liquid consumed up at that point 3 ml of hcl were added and crucibles were heated once more until all liquid evaporated after that crucibles were rinsed three times using deionised water this was filtered into 50 ml volumetric flasks for analysis concentration of trace elements in water coal rock samples were determined by icp ms and the icp aes the icp ms analysis was carried out in the china university of mining and technology using the x series icp ms thermo electron co at the following operating conditions icp ms power 1200 w nebuliser flow rate 0 80 l min auxiliary flow rate 0 75 l min coolant argon flow rate 13 50 l min an internal standard of rh was used to determine limit of detection 0 5 pg ml and analytical deviation less than 2 the icp aes analysis was carried out in the nanjing university using a jy38s icp aes model the limit of detection and deviation for the analysis carried out by such equipment are 0 01 μg ml and less than 2 respectively the mineralogy of the coal and rock samples was determined using xrd at the imperial college london samples were analysed on a philips pw 1830 diffractometer system using cu kα radiation this is fitted with a pw 1820 goniometer and a graphite monochromator rock samples were analysed in the 2θ range 2 5 70 degrees xrd signals were processed using the hiltonbrooks interface with output to the traces software leaching experiments were conducted using batch mode to simulate conditions in a coal seam where water movement is slow and dissolution reactions tend to achieve equilibrium su and wang 2011 schwartz et al 2016 studied the leaching behavior of arsenic and selenium from coal ash however study of the leaching behavior and mechanism from coal and host rock are rare to simulate a closed environment with low po2 see stumm and morgan 1996 for details bottles were closed with a rubber stopper samples were taken out using syringes the pe of the solution during experiments was determined by a jenco 6010 ph orp meter all glassware intended to be in contact with rock coal and water samples was previously soaked in 3 2 mol l hno3 for 2 days to reduce cross contamination rock coal samples were ground sieved to 120 µm and divided into 30 mg sub samples for the leaching experiment three sub samples were used for each sample one per 1000 ml aliquot of deionised water at the following phs 2 5 6 7 and 12 flasks were sealed and shaken every 2 h for up to 10 days temperature was controlled using a water bath at about 40 c leachate solutions were collected using syringes at 2 6 24 and 48 h 0 5 mol l hno3 was added into all the samples leachates aliquots were titrated with hcl or naoh depending of the ph conditions to compare the behavior of leaching elements at acid neutral and alkali environments in addition to leaching experiments water samples including those collected from the zhaoyang lake shown in fig 1 and yunlong lakes in the study area but not coal mine district were shaken every 2 h for up to 10 days at constant temperature of 40 c 2 3 multivariate analysis while univariate statistical analysis of a large scale of data could be cumbersome and cause misunderstanding and error in the interpretation multivariate statistical techniques are more robust therefore it becomes more useful tool for environmental data treatment and of identification of anomalous patterns during the immigration process of the trace elements from coal bedding seam to groundwater and surface water the complex matrix system solid and liquid body are involved in each system the elements show different or similar co existing patterns and immigration behavior including dissolution transport adsorption therefore the multivariate analysis can be used to find out different and similar components which suggest similar and dissimilar occurrence in solids and immigration mechanism during the process of water rock interaction in the area of hydrochemical studies the pca method has been widely used to reduce dimensions and analyze the relations among the variates and samples hwang et al 2001 singh et al 2004 liu et al 2017 güler et al 2002 2012 sako et al 2016 cortes et al 2016 carucci et al 2012 chihi et al 2015 the pca is a typical non supervised analytical method to calculate the pca result data are first standardized by mean centering each column within the original data matrix and then dividing each of the values within each column by the column standard deviation with pca the large data matrix is reduced to smaller ones that consist of pc loadings and scores pc loadings are the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix therefore it contains information on all of the variables combined into a single number with the loadings indicating the relative contribution that each variable makes to that scores pcs are calculated so that they take into account the correlations present in the original data but are uncorrelated to others typically the data can be reduced to two or three dimensions that representing majority of the variance within the original data sometimes more dimensions may have to be included to present more variance of the original data singh et al 2004 based on the pca analytical result the loadings and scores of data frame were then clustered in the dimensions that pca have reduced as the axis of coordinates were rotated to achieve maximum loadings of elements the rotated axis of coordinates was marked as rcs the bi plot of pca result is usually drawn to show patterns of parameters and samples however the loading and score of the pca axis show different aspects of the result in our study the loadings of every drawn show co existing pattern of elements and scores of every drawn show the co existing pattern of samples what we focus on is the co existing pattern of elements to disclose their migration mechanism the clustering result of loadings show similar and different pattern among elements and parameters therefore the co existing behavior of elements and parameters can be summarized the clustering result of scores show similar and different pattern among samples therefore the co existing behavior of samples which means types of solid and liquid samples can be summarized the clustering method was based on the gaussian mixture model the gm model can cluster target reasonable comparing with k means algorithm the gm model does not divide different group by stiff border but allow some mixture of different groups so the classifying probability to each group can be calculated we have applied software r as tool the packages psych and mclust were used to calculate pca and gm model clustering result 3 result and discussion 3 1 major ions in water samples and multivariate analysis the sampling site type major ion concentrations and major parameters of coal mine water carbonate water and surface water are listed in the table 1 according to sampling marks the samples 1 12 were coal mine water the samples 13 14 were surface water and the samples 15 16 were carbonate water respectively a piper plot fig 3 has been drawn to show the cation and anion composition in the coal mine water carbonate water and surface water as shown in the table 1 and fig 3 the surface water belongs to low mineralized water carbonate water and coal mine water belongs to medium mineralized water according to the national standard of coal mine classification and the surface water is na mg ca cl so4 2 hco3 type water the carbonate water is na mg ca so4 2 water type the coal mine water is na ca so4 2 na so4 2 or na hco3 type water coal mine waters showed characteristics of high soluble minerals so4 2 of most coal mine water samples were higher than usepa and chinese highest limit 250 mg l besides so4 2 cl tds and hardness were also higher than the chinese regulated limit the combination of higher levels of ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 concentrations in the groundwater suggests that the coupled reactions involving sulfide oxidation and carbonate dissolution which largely controls the solute acquisition processes in the study area singh et al 2007 the scatter diagrams between different ions can reveal information about the origin and evolution solutes and about the hydro geochemical processes control mechanism occurring in the aquifer edmunds et al 1987 reactions between groundwater and aquifer matrix can significantly control water chemistry the cross plot between na vs cl in diagram fig 4a shows most of the sample points falls below the equiline and predominance of na ions over cl ions suggests addition of na ions released from the weathering of silicate minerals and ion exchange within the aquifer mayback 1987 the na vs ca2 scatter diagram fig 4b shows higher levels of calcium concentrations than sodium concentrations and also indicate ion exchange reactions occurring in the aquifer which increases the ca2 concentrations in groundwater trace elements of surface water and coal mine water in coal mine district and non coalmine district is shown in table 1 compared with the national standard of ground water criterion and surface water criterion trace elements as se hg pb cd cr belong to class three to five which means slightly to severely contaminated comparing the surface water from coal mine district sample 13 and non coalmine district sample14 it is found that the concentrations are significantly higher in the surface water from coal mine district li and xu 2008 studied as and hg concentration of surface water in coal mine district founding that their concentration in sediment of river is concentrated from the analysis of the data it is found that 1 the coal mine water has higher mineralization than surface water which suggest water rock interaction especially solution of minerals between the rock coal and ground water 2 higher na portion in the coal mine water was found suggesting ion exchange behavior of coal mine water 3 the data and literature have showed that the coal mine water is contaminated by trace elements and have contaminating potential for ground water and surface water it can be concluded that the trace elements were released by water rock interaction such as oxidation dissolution ion exchange etc however trace elements may be controlled by different water rock interaction mode which take account of trace element occurrence water parameters and reaction process the 16 water samples were analysed using the pca method and then clustered using the gaussian mixture mode under the hypothesis that same source of water should have similar element co behavior pattern the elements have similar behaviors can be clustered and they should have similar process of water rock interaction scores of the analytical result show similarity of samples based on the in site sampling strategy the water samples can be grouped to coal mine water carbonate water and surface water in the pca analysis if six principal components were selected the rc 1 6 explained 29 21 17 10 9 5 of variance respectively as the rc1 3 were more important the first three rcs were taken after re calculation the principal components rc1 rc2 and rc3 explained 30 25 and 19 of all variance and 74 in all as shown in the fig 5 22 elements ions and parameters can be reasonably projected to three axes principal components and then clustered into four groups the group i includes k na cl so4 2 tds cr which are marked in solid circles the group ii ca mg mn hardness are marked in hollow squares the group iii hco3 co3 2 ph zn ni cu are marked in solid triangles the group iv as hg se mo cd pb co ba are marked in crosses in fig 6 the scores of 16 samples were calculated and plotted in the chart the samples were clustered to three groups the group i ii iii are showed in solid circles hollow squares and solid triangles respectively the group i has high positive scores on the principal component rc1 at the same time the group ii and iii have high negative scores on the principal component rc1 the group iii has high positive scores on the component principal rc2 according to the sampling recode the group i means coal mine water the group ii means carbonate water and the group iii include surface water and part of coal mine water the coal mine water was collected from different coal mine district about 30 km apart and different coal seam the coal mine water may undergo different water rock interaction in type and level therefore some coal mine water may have similar pattern with surface water elements in group iv have high loadings on principal component rc1 most of these elements are environment concern trace element it is inferred that the rc1 stands for the influence of coal mine water these elements show the most variance of coal mine water and groups i in the samples are coal mine water the group ii of elements are mainly component of water hardness which have high positive load on the principal component rc2 the group iii of samples have high positive scores on the principal component rc2 groundwater compositions that are primarily controlled by carbonate reactions will have relatively high ca and mg concentrations and bicarbonate contents are attributed to the presence of calcite and dolomite stumm and morgan 1981 mohanty et al 2018 therefore the rc2 stands for the influence of carbonate water the group iii of samples mainly in carbonate waters mn in this group was caused by the mechanism of dissolution of mn carbonates bhattacharya et al 2012 the high soluble major elements have high loadings on the principal component rc3 therefore the rc3 stand for dissolution of high soluble minerals however in the score chart coal mine water and surface water spread through the rc3 this phenomenon suggest that the dissolution happens in different water environment or the coal mine water had influence on the surface water 3 2 occurrence and leaching mode of trace elements in coal host rock as the carrier of trace element kaolinite quartz calcite pyrite and illite were the predominant minerals in coal gangue with a certain amount of organic matter and a little mica fu et al 2013 wang et al 2005 bai et al 2014 peng et al 2018 dai et al 2018 in our study the mineral composition in coal host rock were tested using xrd the result showed that quartz kaolinite illite feldspar albite pyrite took 52 28 17 1 1 and trace component of overall mineral in weight in order to analysis the trace element leaching mode of coal seam host rock the trace elements in host rock and its leaching product in water were calculated by using the mothed of pca and clustering analysis analytical results of solid matrix were used to infer the trace element occurrences in the host rock the results of liquid samples were used to analyze the immigration mode of trace element then leaching mechanisms were analysed and concluded by combing the two types of results the major and trace element concentrations in host rock are listed in the table 1 in shan et al 2018 in the pca analysis of coal host rock if six principal components were selected the rc 1 6 explained 34 22 17 7 7 5 of variance respectively as the rc1 3 were more important the first three rcs were taken after re calculation the rc 1 3 explained 34 28 and 13 of variance respectively elements in host rock can be classified into three groups the group i marked in solid triangles includes zn ba mn fe mg as hg se cd the groups ii marked in hollow squares includes v cu sr ca the group iii marked in solid circles includes mo pb cr ti al respectively fig 7 finkelman et al 2018 analysed occurrence of trace element in coal it is found that the as hg cd zn mainly occur in sulfide form ca and sr are mainly carbonate related mo pb cr ti al are mainly in clay minerals xiong et al 2017 found cd are mainly in sulfide form in the coal host rock as and mo are mainly carbonate and silicate related form cr has high affinity of clay and ash yield in gangue zhou et al 2014 for pb and se zhou et al 2014 reported high relationship each other and with fe in gangue so high sulfide mineral affinity was observed zn and cd was found to have high association with pyrite and sphalerite zhou et al 2014 group i have high positive loading on the principal rc1 based on literature research and their co existing behavior the elements in the group i occurred in sulfide mode group ii and group iii have low loading on the rc1 and therefore low relation with sulfide were found group ii stand for marine facies minerals such as calcite and the group iii stand for continental facies minerals such as clay minerals the groups ii and iii have high positive loading on the rc3 and rc2 respectively meaning that the rc3 and rc2 meaning the affinity of marine face and continental face origin from the charting result we could also find that the group ii and iii have negative relation considering the environmental concern elements the as hg se cd mainly occur in sulfide minerals pb and cr mainly occur in clay minerals the trace element concentrations in host rock leachate are listed in the table 3 in shan et al 2018 in the pca analysis of host rock leaching if six principal components were selected the rc 1 6 explained 32 19 17 15 6 6 of variance respectively as the rc1 3 were more important the first three rcs were taken after re calculation the rc 1 3 explained 33 21 and 19 of variance respectively the trace elements were classified into four groups based on leaching behavior they are group i al si cr in solid circles group ii v se as hg in solid triangles group iii mg fe cd pb in crosses and group iv ti mo zn sr ba in hollow squares fig 8 the group iii ii and i have high positive loadings on the rc1 rc2 and rc3 respectively on the rc1 dimension the group iii mg fe cd pb have high loadings and other three groups have little relationships this dimension stands for the metal element behavior i e the dissolution or adsorption by iron oxide minerals on the rc2 the group ii v se as mo hg have high loadings at the same time other three groups have little relations with the group ii this group stands for releasing of major environmental concern elements group i al si ti cr has high loading on the rc3 and the other three groups have little relations with the group i this group i stands for releasing of elements born in continental facies minerals combining the host rock analysis and leaching product the leaching mechanisms can be answered first the environmental concern trace element se as and hg had similar behavior pattern in solid and liquid matrix therefore it is inferred that the leaching product in the water were mainly from dissolution of its bearing mineral the sulfide mineral in our study area the sulfur content is relatively low compared with other coal mine district however trace component of pyrite in the host rock was found pyrite is highly probability oxidized and dissolved in an aerobic environment and then the trace elements including se as and hg were leaching into ground water and surface water in the coal seam lower than our study area which will be mined after the sulfur content is higher therefore stronger water rock interaction and more trace element releasing may happen second the trace element cr al have similar behavior pattern in solid and liquid matrix the leaching product were mainly from dissolution of its bearing minerals these elements usually occur in continental facies mineral such as clay mineral therefore the environmental concern element chromium came from the dissolution or transformation of clay minerals compared to fresh water seawater is more favorable for the formation of ammonian illite during deposition when the host rock interacts with fresh water illite transform to kaolinite accompanying releasing of chromium shan et al 2010 zheng et al 2016 in our analysis of the xrd test result illite content in host rock reduced from 17 to 15 and 12 and kaolinite increased from 28 to 29 and 35 after leaching while ph was 12 and 2 respectively the trace elements pb and cd have different behavior pattern in solid and liquid matrix for their high adsorption affinity in alkaline and neutral ph environment these elements may be adsorbed by clay mineral iron oxides or forming new mineral in study area although the pb and cd have low concentration in coal mine water high pb and cd concentrations was found in the surface water in coal mine district and non coalmine district pb concentration of surface water were 7 21 μg l and 0 517 μg l cd concentration were 0 05 μg l and 1 09 μg l respectively it is clearly that the surface water was contaminated by pb and cd in the coal mine district therefore these elements may be taken by adsorbent or minerals through coal mine drainage and release in the surface water environment 3 3 occurrence and leaching mode of trace elements in coal in order to analyze the trace element leaching mode of coal seam the trace elements in coal and its leaching product in water were calculated by using the mothed pca and clustering by using the similar strategy of analysis of host rock leaching the solid samples and liquid samples in coal leaching was discussed then the leaching mechanisms of trace elements in coal were obtained the major and trace element concentrations in coal are listed in the table 2 in shan et al 2018 in the pca analysis of coal analysis if six principal components were selected the rc 1 6 explained 36 21 14 8 7 5 of variance respectively as the rc1 3 were more important the first three rcs were taken after re calculation the rc 1 3 explained 44 23 and 12 of variance respectively elements in coal can be classified into four groups the group i marked in solid circles includes mo pb cr cu ti al se the groups ii marked in hollow squares includes zn cd the group iii marked in solid triangles includes ba mn sr mg ca and the group iv marked in crosses includes v as fe hg respectively fig 9 group i and iv have high positive loading on the principal rc1 finkelman et al 2018 investigated occurrence of most of the trace elements it is found that 65 of ti 90 of al and 75 of cr 25 and 30 of cu and mo are in clay minerals little pb and se are in clay form 75 and 65 of zn and cd formed in mono sulfide form 70 and 90 of as and hg are sulfide form ward 2002 argued the pyrite affinity of as and swaine 1990 reported clay and organic association of as in coal pumure et al 2011 argued that as and se usually occur in clay minerals pb was found to be sulfide form as pyrite and galena finkelman and gross 1999 dai et al 2006 and organic form swaine 1990 based on the literature research and their co existing behavior the elements in the group i occurred in clay mineral mode the group ii and iv suggest the sulfide existing mode the group ii has two element zn and cd this result is consistent with some previous studies finkelman and gross 1999 gurdal 2008 finkelman et al 2018 they can be in form of sphalerite the group ii and group iii have low loading on the rc1 which suggest that the sphalerite may have high affinity of marine face origin the group iii standing for marine facies minerals have high loadings on the rc2 at the same time other three groups have low loadings on the rc2 meaning low relations with marine facies minerals the groups ii and iv have high positive loading on the rc3 the rc3 stand for sulfide minerals other two groups have little relations with the group ii and iv from the charting result it is concluded the main occurrence of trace elements as hg cd occurred in sulfide minerals pb cr and se occurred in clay minerals zn and cd occurred in sphalerite compared with host rock the sphalerite is more probably to form independent mineral in coal the trace element concentrations in coal leachate are listed in the table 5 in shan et al 2018 in the pca analysis of coal leaching product if six principal components were selected the rc 1 6 explained 26 20 14 10 9 7 of variance respectively as the rc1 3 were more important the first three rcs were taken after re calculation the rc 1 3 explained 29 28 and 11 of variance respectively the leaching product were classified into three groups based on the trace elements behavior they are group i al se cd pb in solid circles group ii si as sr mo hg in hollow squares and group iii ti cr mn fe zn ba in solid triangles respectively fig 10 the group iii has high positive loadings on the rc1 and the other two groups have low or negative loading on the rc1 according to the previous analysis the elements in group i are mainly clay bearing minerals so the group i stands for the element s immigration caused by the dissolution and transformation of clay mineral the group ii has high positive loading on the rc2 and the other two groups have low rc2 loadings the rc2 dimensions shows oxidation and dissolution of sulfide minerals so it is inferred that elements in other two groups have little relations with sulfide dissolution the group i have relative high loadings on the rc3 other two groups have relative low loading on the rc3 the group i includes some environmental concern elements so it is also an important mechanism of trace element immigration combining the coal analysis and leaching product leaching mechanisms can be answered first the environmental concern trace element as and hg had similar behavior pattern in solid and liquid matrix so the leaching product in water were mainly from dissolution of its bearing mineral the sulfide mineral we have found nearly 1 of pyrite in weight in the host rock pyrite in coal was relatively low due to the main organic composite however some pyrite mineral nodule can be found in the coal seam pyrite is stable in an anaerobic environment however in an aerobic environment it is easy to be oxidized and dissolved and then the trace elements including as and hg were leaching into ground water and surface water xiong et al 2017 found that cd cr as tl have high affinity with fe during coal leaching therefore the pyrite leaching may be the mechanism of their immigration in the samples we have picked up the content of pyrite was relatively low however higher content of sulfur was expected in the lower coal strata coal seams no 17 and no 19 of the carboniferous system as ph of coal mine water is determined by the mineral of sulfide and carbonate high sulfur may lower ph value then the leaching behavior changes zhao et al 2014 bidari and aghazadeh 2018 more metal trace elements may be released on the other hand metalloid trace element in the water may be reduced second the trace element se and pb have similar behavior pattern in solid and liquid matrix the leaching product were mainly from dissolution of its bearing minerals according to the literature research and co existing analysis these elements usually occur in continental facies mineral such as clay mineral therefore the environmental concern element pb and se came from the dissolution or transformation of clay minerals cr have similar immigration mode with some continental mineral element so this element can also be inferred to be released by clay minerals 4 conclusion combining the literature review multivariate analysis of solid and liquid analysis the co existing behavior of trace elements in coal host rock and water were inferred then the leaching mechanisms were concluded in the coal seam host rock se cd hg as occurred mainly in sulfide minerals be and v occurred mainly in carbonate minerals cr and pb occurred mainly in clay minerals respectively in coal seam se cr pb mainly occurred in clay minerals as and hg were mainly occurred in sulfide minerals the leaching mechanism in coal host rock and coal are similarity in some part and different in other aspects first as and hg show similar immigration mechanism both in coal and host rock second se show different main immigration mechanism in coal and host rock matrix the reason may be the various occurrence of se in coal and host in fact se have been found to exist in both clay and sulfide mineral so mechanism is not unique but some mechanism may be prominent in different matrix third cr is mainly released by the transformation of clay mineral cd and pb showed different co existing behavior in solid and liquid matrix these elements are typical metal elements they can be easily adsorbed in alkaline and neutral environment it is probably the reason of the different co existing pattern in solid and liquid matrix the immigration mechanism and long term of environmental impact need further studies acknowledgements the test of samples was carried out in the jiangsu provincial coal geology research institute the analysis and test center of the china university of

12298,the evaluation of groundwater quality is crucial for water resources management in arid and semi arid regions particularly in irrigated area where groundwater chemistry can be modified by variety of natural and anthropogenic factors this study aims to investigate the origin of water quality variation and the major geochemical processes controlling the groundwater evolution in the shallow aquifer of takelsa northeastern of tunisia the combined use of geochemical modeling and multivariate statistical analysis such as hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca indicates several major influences including the lithology of the aquifer system and anthropogenic inputs saturation indices pco2 and hypothetical salt combinations in integration with various mapping and graphical method identified water rock interaction reactions through dissolution and cation exchange reactions as a major factor this process controlling groundwater quality explains 54 2 of the total variance and prevails mainly in southern part of the basin furthermore the excessive use of composite chemical fertilizer was identified as a second factor with 14 3 of the total variance this anthropogenic factor causes a change of chemical pattern of groundwater samples by an inversion of cation exchange reaction and an increase of nitrate contents in 84 of the wells located in the irrigated area of the basin graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality geochemical multivariate statistical analysis nitrate tunisia 1 introduction in arid and semi arid countries groundwater plays a major role in ensuring domestic water supply for urban population and promoting the development of society and economy in these regions groundwater irrigation has grown rapidly over last decades and now is making a substantial contribution to agriculture and food security shah 2014 however the extensive use of groundwater by human being is causing serious aquifer depletion and quality degradation and further reduces its use for urban water supply and agricultural use kumar et al 2013 thus the sustainable management of groundwater resources constitutes a very sensitive issue and requires an adequate knowledge of the causes and processes of water resources quantity and quality variations in time and space understanding these mechanisms is difficult because it could be linked either to anthropogenic effects and or to natural processes geologic the impact of long term water rock interaction on groundwater quality has been intensively investigated using geochemical tracing approaches e g leaking of minerals present in the rock formation as halite or gypsum dissolution farid et al 2013 kraiem et al 2014 abid et al 2014 kumar et al 2015 additionally recent changes on groundwater quality as a result of human activities were highlighted in different regions across the world including nitrate pollution due to application of chemical fertilizers re et al 2017 seawater or connate seawater intrusion linked to over pumping sanford and pope 2010 trabelsi et al 2012 pastén zapata et al 2014 kumar et al 2015 and contamination by as and f whose initial release is driven by the anthropogenic activities kumar et al 2016 therefore correctly understanding groundwater geochemistry and identifying the risk factors of the aquifer system are crucial to control and improve groundwater resources management scheme in these regions nevertheless the delineation of geochemical processes is very complex as there is important hydrochemical variability due to the combined effect of several major influences in the aquifer system the literature shows different methodologies that could be useful to investigate and to characterize the sources of groundwater quality variation geochemical modeling constitutes an important method that is commonly used for the description of water rock interface systems interaction plummer 1992 appelo and postma 2005 it attempts to determine the chemical reactions occurring along a flow path plummer et al 1994 based on sets of mole transfers of phases that account for changes in water chemistry between one or a mixture of initial water compositions and final water compositions parkhurst and appelo 1999 it allows identifying thermodynamic controls on the groundwater composition through equilibrium speciation and saturation index calculations in this investigation geochemical modeling used to investigate water rock interactions as dissolution and precipitation is coupled with multivariate statistical techniques such as hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca the combined use of these tools constitutes effective approaches that help in the interpretation of hydrochemical data to better understand the water quality and geochemical process in the studied systems they allow the identification of possible factors sources that influence water geochemistry lee et al 2001 shrestha and kazama 2007 matiatos et al 2014 sonkamble at al 2014 hadj ammar et al 2014 kumar et al 2016 these methods are also useful in characterizing and evaluating surface and freshwater quality variations caused by natural and anthropogenic factors singh et al 2004 shrestha and kazama 2007 zghibi et al 2014 das et al 2015 the use of different multivariate statistical techniques offers a valuable tool for reliable management of water resources as well as helps decision makers to find rapid solution to contamination problems in the present investigation geochemical modeling and different multivariate statistical methods are applied to physico chemical data of shallow groundwater in the irrigated area of takelsa syncline in cap bon region located northeastern of tunisia cap bon peninsula is a typical agricultural and tourist area where the water supply to major urban centers and areas under intensive agriculture development depends on groundwater resources over the last decades groundwater exploitation has been increasing and progressively exceeding the available resources estimated at 160 mm3 year trabelsi 2004 this over exploitation is causing marked lowering of water tables of up to 5 m in some areas and progressive deterioration of groundwater quality by the increase of the salinity and nitrate contents in some areas takelsa aquifer system constitutes one of the most exploited aquifer in the cap bon peninsula where exploitation rate is largely exceeding the available groundwater resources trabelsi 2004 previous investigations dealing with the qualitative aspects of groundwater treat in detail the spatial distribution of physico chemical parameters correlations between major elements and isotopic investigation in order to identify the main mineralization processes affecting different aquifers in the cap bon peninsula ben hamouda et al 2009 ben moussa et al 2012 charfi et al 2013 re et al 2017 however none of these studies has dealt with groundwater quality degradation in the irrigated area of takelsa syncline this research which reports the results of the first geochemical investigation carried out on the shallow aquifer of takelsa integrates geochemical modeling and multivariate statistical analysis in order to identify sources and process controlling groundwater chemistry the aims were i to investigate groundwater quality variation ii to extract information about the geochemical processes and iii to identify the influence of possible sources natural and anthropogenic on the groundwater quality overall this investigation can demonstrate the fundamental role of multidisciplinary hydrogeological assessment to support sustainable development in arid and semi arid regions highlighting the crucial role that adequate groundwater management can play to reduce poverty and socioeconomic development 2 materials and methods 2 1 general setting takelsa area is located north west of cap bon peninsula in the north east of tunisia it is constituted by a syncline with general direction ne sw limited to the east by the anticline of djebel abderrahmene to the north and west by the mediterranean sea and to the south by the plain of menzel bouzelfa fig 1 the population of the takelsa region is about 20000 inhabitants the area comprises a sub humid to a semi arid climate with an annual mean precipitation of 496 mm year the most rainfall is concentrated between the months of september to may 97 with minimum values of temperature of 9 c in january the driest months are june july and august precipitation of about 3 with temperature values up to 31 in august evapotranspiration show a rise during the summer june july and august in response to the decrease of the air humidity and temperature increase the region is a rich agricultural area specializing in production of citrus fruits and viticulture including table grapes and wine hence surface waters are limited farmers are heavily depending on groundwater resources 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the study area is a syncline formed during the atlas compression assigned to the miocene it s limited to the east by the anticline of djebel abderrahmene and to the west by the monocline of korbous dip sandstone deposits of the central part of the basin show a syncline axis oriented sw ne ben salem 1992 takelsa syncline constitutes subsident basin where miocene series can reach a thickness of 1500 m geological outcrops of this basin are ranging in ages from the oligocene to quaternary the different lithostratigraphic unit identified in the study area from the oldest to the youngest are i oligocene lower miocene which presents major sequence of regressive sedimentation trend outcropping only at the boarding reliefs formed on its lower part by marine carbonates and by detritic sediments on its upper part ii middle miocene appearing at the eastern flank of monocline korbous represented by homogeneous clayey marl rich microfaunas iii the upper miocene represented by detrital sandstone or alternations with dominant sandstone and clay indicating a regressive sedimentation sequence in deltaic environment prograding under the influence of waves and storm and vi quaternary represented by alluvial deposits outcropping in wadis and alluvial plains burollet 1956 ben salem 1992 takelsa region presents a multilayer aquifer system consisting of an alternation of permeable semi permeable and impermeable levels the syncline is dominated by miocene series composed by clay marl and sandstones that constitute small levels whose number and thickness become increasingly important to the bottom thus in relation with the absence of significant alluvial cover surface and deep drilling wells are tapping the sandstone aquifer levels of miocene fig 2 the shallow aquifer is unconfined composed of two levels separated by semi permeable layers clayey sandstone or sandstone clay favoring their hydraulic communication and improving the productivity of shallow wells in the area the depth ranged from 20 to 30 m for the first level and from 40 to 60 m for the second one the recharge of the shallow aquifer system is occurring by rain water infiltration through sandstone outcrops at the hills located at the center east of the syncline henchir cheddly fig 1 therefore shallow groundwater flows from the central part of the syncline according to two directions i towards to the north east to wadi el abid and the gulf of tunis and ii towards to the west and the south west in the direction of the monocline of korbous wadi bezirk and the mediterranean sea fig 1 the deep aquifer levels contained in sandstones layers of miocene extend over all the syncline with a lateral variation in the thickness depth and lithology the transmissivity of the miocene sandstones is about 5 10 4 m2 s shallow groundwater in takelsa is exploited by more than 850 shallow wells about 80 of these wells are equipped and used mainly for irrigation which represents 90 of total exploited volume the annual exploitation volume reaches 13 mm3 which exceed largely the natural recharge rate estimated to 10 mm3 year trabelsi 2004 the geochemical investigation presented in this paper focuses on the shallow groundwater quality variations 2 3 sample collection and analysis in total 37 shallow wells were sampled once during the rainy period extending from september 2003 to january 2004 fig 1 the groundwater samples were collected in 1000 ml polyethylene bottles which were rinsed first by the samples water several times and then filled to the top for all samples temperature t c ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ using a multiparameter wtw with an accuracy of 0 1 for ph and 0 5 for ec reading limits total dissolved solids tds were measured by evaporating 100 ml of the samples at 105 c during 24h major chemical elements were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc type beckman cations ca2 mg2 na k analysis were performed at 21 c using ic pak tm cm d columns with edta and nitric acid as eluent at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min anions concentrations cl so4 2 no3 were determined using ci super sep columns with phthalic acid and acetonitrile as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 5 ml min and temperature of 21 c the overall detection limit for ions was 0 2 mg l the co3 and hco3 concentrations were analyzed in the laboratory by titration using 0 1 n hcl acid the ionic balance for all samples is within 5 all the chemical analyses were performed at the laboratory of radio analysis and environment of the national engineering school of sfax tunisia 2 4 thematic maps the spatial distribution of groundwater quality in takelsa syncline was carried out using the surface mapping program surfer 9 developed by golden software the experimental variograms were computed for each chemical parameter and then fitted with the best mathematical model the basic geostatistical approach of the ordinary kriging was used as the interpolation method for all parameters it serves to compute a value at unsampled point using a simple linear weighted average of measured data in the neighborhood of the estimation location de smith et al 2007 the weights are determined from the fitted variogram defined for each parameter 2 5 geochemical modeling the speciation modeling such the calculation saturation states partial pressure of co2 and species present in different water samples was performed using the usgs geochemical code phreeqc version 3 1 7 9213 the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 was calculated using ph measurement and total alkalinity values phreeqc allows an accurate calculation of carbonates speciation which includes activity coefficients complexing and correction of mass action constants to in situ temperature appelo and postma 2005 the changes in saturation state has been used to differentiate different stages of hydrochemical evolution and to identify which geochemical reactions are important in controlling water chemistry negative saturation indices si indicate that the groundwater is under saturated with respect to a particular mineral positive si reflects whether the groundwater is oversaturated with respect to a particular mineral i e unable of dissolving more of the mineral si values close to zero indicate an equilibrium state between groundwater and the mineral appelo and postma 2005 2 6 multivariate statistical analysis recently multivariate statistical techniques have been widely used for the assessment of water quality suk and lee 1999 lee et al 2001 kim et al 2005 shrestha and kazama 2007 matiatos et al 2014 these tools help to simplify and organize large data sets in a way to explain observed relations among several variables matiatos et al 2014 in this investigation pca and hca statistical methods were performed on 37 water samples all mathematical and statistical computations were made using microsoft office excel 2007 and statistica data analysis software system version 10 from statsoft inc 2 6 1 principal components analysis pca pca as one of the descriptive multivariate analyses is used to study and to graphically represent the maximum of information and correlation between the variables and the observations points it consists to reduce the large data set of interdependent variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components to complete pca four steps were followed i the standardization of the data davis 2002 given that the variables are expressed in different scales and unit ii computation of correlation matrix by determining the correlation coefficient iii estimation of the factor loadings and factor scores and iv factor extraction and interpretation the determination of factor is based on the kaiser criteria kaiser 1958 retaining only components factors whose eigenvalues are equal or greater than 1 the obtained factor are classified in such a way that the first principal component has the highest eigenvalue and represents the most sources of variation of the original data suk and lee 1999 everitt and hothorn 2011 the factor loadings are interpreted as correlation coefficient between the variable and principal components it may be positive or negative which indicates that the contribution of variables increases or decreases with increasing loadings in a dimension respectively liu et al 2003 the factor scores reflect the relative importance of the examined processes on the observation 2 6 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hca cluster analysis is a technique for classifying individuals or objects into unknown groups based on the characteristics they possess the similarity between two objects is maximal if they belong to the same cluster hierarchical cluster analysis is the most used where the resulting clusters are presented in dendrogram tree diagram mckenna 2003 the dendrogram presents a picture of the clusters and their proximity and provides a useful graphical tool for determining the number of clusters that adequately describe underlying processes that lead to the identification of homogeneous groups the approaches consisting to grouping small clusters into larger ones is called agglomerative in this study hierarchical cluster analysis hca was applied for classification using ward s linkage method ward 1963 and the squared euclidian distance as the similarity measurement between two objects 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical chemical parameters and major elements geochemistry descriptive statistics for the variables and their standard deviations are presented in table 1 all of the parameters show a high dispersion implying a spatial variation as indicated by the high standard deviation values the ph values range from 7 to 8 7 which indicates that shallow groundwater is slightly alkaline this is probably due to a mineralogical source given alkaline cations bicarbonate or dissolved hydroxide in the water groundwater samples in the takelsa syncline basin show heterogeneous values of temperature varying between 12 and 22 c with an average of 17 8 c these values reflect the variation of surface air temperatures 19 c during different sampling periods since the water table is close to the surface electrical conductivity ranges between 0 47 and 4 65 ms cm with a mean value of 2 05 ms cm 19 of analyzed water samples gave ec values less than 1 41 between 1 and 2 ms cm 22 between 2 and 3 ms cm and 19 comprised between 3 and 5 ms cm table 1 based on these values groundwater could be classified into three types fresh brackish and saline reflecting variation of the concentration of dissolved ionized solids in the water additionally the higher value of the standard deviation indicates variability in the hydrogeochemical processes it could be attributed to the local variation of aquifer lithology soil type groundwater transit time and also agriculture related activities in the area accordantly groundwater salinity represented by the total dissolved salts tds values displays a large range of variation from 0 32 l to 3 27 g l p32 fig 3 the lowest values are found in the central eastern part of takelsa syncline area samples p15 p29 p34 and p20 which corresponds to the recharge area and suggests that upstream groundwater flow is diluted by rain water this seems to be linked to the high permeability of the miocene sands which outcrop in the recharge area allowing a rapid infiltration of surface and rain water however the highest tds values are recorded in southern part towards wadi bezirk samples p32 p23 p37 p17 and 30 where the soils are significantly rich in clay minerals which results in increased salt in the unsaturated zone in fact clay fractions existing in detrital layers of the basin will extend groundwater transit time leading to the longer contact periods favoring dissolution of minerals present in the aquifer formation and so providing an additional input of chemical elements thus the groundwater which is flowing through less permeable but soluble mineral rich argillaceous materials contains high ions concentration on the other hand high tds value 3 g l is observed in the central part p33 in the areas of extensive withdrawal the increase of the salinity seems to be linked to the increase of major ions cl na ca2 and so4 2 concentrations fig 4 which correlate well with the electrical conductivity the distribution maps of the chlorides and sodium fig 4 show that cl and na have the same spatial repartition their concentrations generally increase towards the north and south of the basin according to the flowpaths except for wells p24 p33 p23 and p37 where the cl and na contents may exceed 1000 and 500 mg l respectively this distribution is consistent with that of total mineralization in order to thoroughly delineate the processes contributing to groundwater mineralization in the takelsa groundwater different diagrams using major ions are investigated fig 5 the plot of na versus cl fig 5a shows parallel increase in both ions for majority of the analyzed waters indicating the dissolution of this mineral and or enrichment of dissolved phase due to partial evaporation of water nevertheless for some samples the molar ratio na cl is clearly lower than unity points located below the halite dissolution line fig 5a meaning that its composition cannot be attributed only to dissolution of halite some reaction of silicate minerals involving the sodium or anthropogenic sources of chloride could explain the decrease in this ratio below 1 groundwater alkalinity is controlled by varying proportions of bicarbonate hco3 carbonate co3 2 and carbonic acid h2co3 in the present case bicarbonate is the predominant species due to the ph range of local groundwaters the concentrations of hco3 vary between 100 65 and 488 mg l the highest values are measured in the well samples n p21 p23 p25 p32 and p36 the hco3 can come from dissolution of carbonate minerals soil co2 or bacterial degradation of the organic contamination the origin of carbonate species in the studied groundwater will be discussed further using the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and saturation indices in comparison with chlorides the sulphates show lower contents fig 4 the highest concentrations of so4 2 are observed at the p17 p21 p24 and p32 wells in correlation with calcium these points have the highest concentrations indicating that the high mineralization observed at these points is mainly due to the dissolution of the sulphated minerals the plot ca2 mg2 vs so4 2 hco3 fig 5b of takelsa shallow groundwater exhibits a good linear relationship with 1 1 stoichiometry ratio in some water samples indicating that these ions were most probably derived from a simple dissolution of sulphate and carbonates minerals however the majority of water sampling points is falling above the line slope 1 and suggests enrichment in ca2 and mg2 concentrations relatives to so4 2 and hco3 contents fig 5b this excess is pointing to the existence of others ca2 and mg2 sources probably linked to an anthropogenic input or cation exchange reactions occurring through existing clay minerals leading to the release of these cations to the solution in this diagram fig 5b only two sampling points are plotted below the equiline suggesting a deficit in ca2 and mg2 contents comparing to so4 2 and hco3 concentrations 3 2 geochemical modeling 3 2 1 water types the major ion composition of water analyses is depicted in the piper trilinear equivalence diagram to examine the hydrochemical water types fig 6 the chemical composition of groundwater in the study area is composed of different water types the nacl type the camgcl and cahco3 water types the wide range of hydrochemical types indicates the variability of chemical processes leading to the observed groundwater mineralization the nacl is generally localized downstream of the basin p17 p37 p32 p33 and characterized by high tds content however the camgclno3 is usually located upstream of groundwater flow p34 p29 p15 and characterized by low tds contents the wells p35 p31 p5 p6 p12 and p19 located at the foothills of djebel abderrahmene and monocline of korbous show cahco3 water type pointing to the dilution effect by rain or surface water infiltration 3 2 2 partial pressures of co2 the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 has an important role in the water chemistry it reflects the geochemical process and influences the reactions between groundwater and carbonate minerals the pco2 of water sample which is in equilibrium with the atmosphere should be about 10 3 5 atm however the pco2 in groundwater is generally higher by two or three order of magnitudes as result of uptake of carbon dioxide from the soil during the infiltration of rain water the co2 in sandy unsaturated zone is produced by root respiration and decay of labile organic material the calculated values of pco2 in water samples vary between 10 3 3 and 10 1 5 atm confirming the presence of biogenic source of co2 in the soil coming probably from bacteria activities and vegetation roots releasing co2 gas in the soil the vertical evolution of log pco2 with the depth shows that the maximum of these activities is located close to land surface and at 5 m of depth where an increase in partial pressure of co2 is observed fig 7 a the lowest values of pco2 indicate both the significant recharge by irrigation water which is largely influenced by the atmospheric co2 and the infiltration of rainfall at the recharge area 3 2 3 saturation indices the calculated saturation table 2 indices using the phreeqc program show an under saturation state of groundwater with respect to halite appelo and postma 2005 which confirms the dissolution of this mineral under saturation of groundwater with respect to gypsum and anhydrite suggests that the possible source of sulphate and calcium may be the dissolution of these evaporites this is concordant with the spatial distribution maps which indicate similar concentration points of ca2 and so4 2 fig 4 takelsa shallow groundwaters are at or above equilibrium versus carbonates minerals saturation calcite aragonite magnesite and dolomite the oversaturation of groundwater shows that these minerals have already precipitated in the past and are not contributing much of ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater saturation indices of the carbonate minerals calcite aragonite dolomite and magnesite were compared with the log pco2 values for all samples the decreasing log pco2 increases the saturation index of most of the carbonate minerals fig 7b thus the geochemical evolution of carbonates in groundwater involves the co2 based weathering reactions 3 3 nitrates contamination nitrate represents the most widespread chemical contaminant in the world s aquifers high concentrations are attributed to atmospheric deposition discharge from septic tanks and leaking sewers the spreading of sewage sludge to land and seepage from landfills wakida and lerner 2005 furthermore agricultural activities are considered as the principal source of nitrate pollution in groundwater takelsa region is one of the most important agricultural areas in cap bon peninsula where large amounts of fertilizer such as urea and commercial composite have been applied for a long time to increase agricultural production the measured no3 content was above the threshold value for anthropogenic influence 3 mg l burkart and kolpin 1993 in 84 of the wells and above the maximum value recommended for drinking water by the who organization 50 mg l who 2004 in 43 of sampled wells this increase in nitrate concentration can have severe effects on human health and food security the highest no3 levels were found in north western and center parts of the basin where it reached 352 2 mg l p33 while the lowest are found in eastern part of the basin fig 3 this spatial distribution appears to be related to areas of irrigation and application of chemical fertilizers to shallow rooted vegetable crops on sandy soils in fact in these regions of the investigated basin flood irrigation is applied and the excess of irrigation water undergoes excessive nitrate enrichment at the shallow aquifer the evolution in nitrate contents is correlated with those of ca k and chloride which could be explained by the use of ca no3 2 kno3 and kcl fertilizers the similar evolution between mg and so4 provide insight into the excessive use mgso4 fertilizers gi tak et al 2004 stigter et al 2006 3 4 hydrochemical processes according to the chemical analysis of takelsa shallow groundwater it is clear that the dissolution of different salts in the aquifer matrix play an important role in water mineralization as shown by the calculated saturation indices table 2 however it s not the only process anthropogenic inputs and cations exchange contribute also to groundwater salinity in fact the presence of clay lenses in takelsa syncline provides a chance for leaching and cation exchange process the most abundant clay types in the study region are montmorillonite kaolinite and illite sassi 1964 amri 1989 these clay minerals have the property of absorbing certain ions and retaining them in an exchangeable state ma and eggleton 1999 the most common exchangeable cations in order of usual relative abundance are ca2 mg 2 h k nh4 na grim 1968 the cations exchange on a charged clay mineral depends on the bonding energy of the common metal cations which is in the order ca mg k h na this cation selectivity sequence depends on clay types but in general divalent ions with strong bonding energy in contact solutions are able to occupy the exchange positions preferentially to monovalent ions carroll and starkey 1958 atesok et al 1988 rytwo et al 1996 ma and eggleton 1999 thus if this type of cations exchange prevails the groundwater chemistry of takelsa syncline then a deficit of ca2 concentrations compared to so4 2 hco3 should be observed due to the adsorption of this cation on clay mineral on the contrary the majority of samples show enrichment on ca2 contents and at the same time an excess on cl concentrations compared to that of na fig 5 this situation could be explained by the fact that at natural situation equilibrium is reached between the calcium dissolved in the groundwater and that adsorbed by the clay mineral but the use of k fertilizers in particular kcl will cause calcium desorption hence reverse ion exchange is taking place in the groundwater of the study area in this process 2 k replace one ca2 fixed on the surface of rock matrix thus the calcium released will associate with chloride and the water type can change to cacl2 that remains in the evaporite deposits the determination of hypothetical salt combinations is useful in this case because they permit to identify associations involving elements that can show the same origin it can also point out the participation of major mineralization processes which commonly occurs in hydrochemistry the calculated hypothetical salt combination palmer 1911 using chemical analysis of takelsa groundwater shows different assemblage the first assemblage i nacl mgso4 ca so4 mg hco3 2 and ca hco3 2 which characterizes only 5 of analyzed water samples reflects earlier stage of chemical development than other assemblages i ii iii iv the presence of mg hco3 2 and ca hco3 2 salts indicates possible contribution of a meteoric water or surface water to the recent recharge of the aquifer the second assemblage ii kcl nacl mgso4 na2so4 ca so4 mg hco3 2 and ca hco3 2 which concerns 11 of groundwater samples presents more developed chemical composition the occurrence of na2so4 in this assemblage could be linked either to the cation exchange reactions or to the thenardite na2so4 mineral dissolution nevertheless the calculated saturation indices of thenardite which is not detected in the geologic formations of the study region table 2 are very low thus the potential dissolution of this mineral is not possible therefore the most likely source of the na2so4 combination is the cations exchange process where ca2 is adsorbed by the clay mineral and na are released is the solution to associate then with so4 2 ions so such water assemblage acquires its chemical composition from water rock interactions via leaching dissolution and direct cations exchange process the third assemblage iii kcl nacl mgcl2 cacl2 mgso4 caso4 mg hco3 2 and ca hco3 2 is detected in 46 of analyzed groundwater samples the presence of four chloride salts indicates a more advanced stage of chemical development in fact the chemical composition evolves from dominant hco3 salts i to dominant so4 and cl salts ii and ends by dominant chloride salts iii moreover the presence mgcl2 cacl2 salts gives an evidence of cation exchange processes in groundwater such cation exchange type is enhanced by the introduction of potassium fertilizers kcl in groundwater where alkalis cations na k in the solution replace ca2 and mg2 on the surface of clay minerals in the aquifer matrix abo el fadl et al 2015 as a result cacl2 and mgcl2 associations are formed this type of assemblage reflects combined effect of water rock interaction processes dissolution cation exchange reactions and return flow of contaminated irrigation water the fourth assemblage iv kcl nacl mgcl2 mgso4 caso4 mg hco3 2 and ca hco3 2 existing in 38 of analyzed water samples traduces also an advanced stage of chemical development groundwater salinity is mainly attributed to the effect of leaching and dissolution of soluble salts and reverse cation exchange reactions induced by return flow of irrigation water 3 5 statistical analysis in order to further elucidate the geochemical processes that contribute to mineralization of takelsa shallow groundwater hydrochemical data and the results of hypothetical salts combinations are employed for principal components and hierarchical cluster analysis using 21 variables chemical analysis hypothetical salts combinations and 37 observations 3 5 1 principal component analysis pca the results of the pca of takelsa shallow groundwater are presented in figs 8 and 9 the number of factors generated from principal components analysis indicates the total number of possible sources of variation in the chemical data the first three components extracted have eigen values greater than 1 and account for 78 5 of the total variance in the dataset shrestha and kazama 2007 this percentage is relatively low indicating a limited structuring of the variance because the chemistry of the water is conditioned by various factors the first factor which explains 54 2 of the total variance is considered as major factor controlling the relative proportions of chemical element existing in the groundwater samples factors 2 and 3 are not as important as the first one and explain only about 14 3 and 10 respectively these two components are related to more local effects than the first component the different variables are represented according to the factors 1 and 2 which explain together 68 5 of the variance and thus account for the majority of the variance in the original dataset fig 8a factor 1 has strong positive loadings of na ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl caso4 nacl and tds this group of variables is coming in general from rock weathering and silicates minerals hydrolysis as halite and gypsum the negative association of this factor with mg hco 3 and ca hco 3 indicates that this factor expresses fresh groundwater that are recently recharged by surface or rain water on its negative part thus the factor f1 represents the groundwater evolution and the importance of water rock interaction processes it emphasizes that groundwater with a higher residence time has higher contents in sodium chloride calcium and magnesium as related to the lithology of the aquifer therefore the first principal component expresses natural mineralization and water rock interaction processes which increase with longer residence time of water the second factor accounting for 14 3 of total variance presents positive loading for no3 co3 2 k kcl mgcl2 and cacl2 and negative loadings for ph hco3 na2so4 and mgso4 thus this principal component is mostly associated with chemical fertilizers and not the organics urea animal manure which should associate both no3 and hco3 the main component of commercial composite fertilizer nh4 is easily oxidized to no3 by the nitrification process according to reaction kim et al 2005 nh4 2o2 no3 h2o 2h the production of no3 through the nitrification processes is accompanied by the production of h ions which are released in the solution therefore when no3 contents increase ph values decrease in groundwater furthermore this axe opposes mgcl2 and cacl2 which are associated to kcl to na2so4 thus this principal component traduces cations exchange reactions occurring through existing clay minerals in the aquifer formations in the natural conditions bivalent cations ca 2 and mg2 are preferentially adsorbed by the clay minerals than monovalent cation and na2so4 is formed in the groundwater however the use of kcl fertilizers causes a desorbtion of these cations which will associate cl to form cacl2 and mgcl2 this finding is coherent with the previous explanation of the chemical composition of takelsa groundwater and confirms that the excessive use of fertilizers and the irrigation return flow cause groundwater quality degradation by the increase of nitrates contents and water hardness therefore the second principal component is mainly associated to the anthropogenic effect which causes groundwater contamination and an inversion of cation exchange reactions the projection of the groundwater samples according to the two factors and the spatial distribution maps of f1f2 scores which represents the influence natural mineralization process and anthropogenic effect respectively are represented in fig 8b and 9 different groups could be distinguished group a represents fresh and non contaminated groundwater with negative f1 scores and negative or low f2 score these groundwater samples located in the recharge area close to wadi abid and on foothills of djebel korbous traduce a recent recharge by rain water or surface water infiltration fig 9 group b is formed by a poorly mineralized groundwater affected by direct cation exchange process characterized by na2so4 assemblage group c represents mineralized groundwater affected by water rock interaction the groundwater salinity is principally due to dissolution process of evaporate minerals as halite and gypsum group d represents mineralized groundwater contaminated by the use of chemical fertilizer mainly nitrogen and potassium fertilizers f1 and f2 scores are positive and high these groundwater samples located mainly in the irrigated area are affected by inverse cation exchange presence of cacl2 mgcl2 assemblage group e is formed by relatively low mineralized groundwater which presents an anthropogenic effect f2 scores are positives f1 scores are low or negative fig 9 3 5 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hca hierarchical cluster analysis performed using chemical parameter yielded a dendrogram grouping all 37 groundwater samples of the takelsa basin into different statistically clusters fig 10 the number of significant statistically clusters could be defined by moving the position of the phenon line up or down on the dendrogram güler et al 2002 the position of the phenon line at a linkage distance of 3 5x106 allows a division of the dendrogram into three 03 cluster with similar hydrogeochemical composition named clusters i ii and iii and composed of 10 14 and 13 wells respectively to study the chemical variation according to the groups box and whisker plots of individual variables were plotted in fig 11 the clusters i ii and iii are discriminated by their chemical contents hco3 so4 cl na mg ca and tds have a decreasing trend in the order clusters i ii and iii whereas k and no3 have different trend fig 11 cluster iii presents the lowest mineralization tds 1000 mg l and lowest mean concentrations for all major elements fig 11 it includes the majority of samples belonging to a and b groups identified by principal components analysis and located in the recharge area or close to wadi abid and on foothills of djebel korbous this cluster represents fresh and non contaminated groundwater recharged recently by rain water or surface water infiltration however the cluster i corresponds to most mineralized samples it includes groups b and c fig 9 characterized by relatively long residence time and affected mainly by water rock interaction processes dissolution and cation exchange reactions this cluster is composed by groundwater samples located downstream of the basin and mainly around wadi bezirk cluster ii presents an intermediate chemical compositions marked by relatively high salinity it includes group e affected by an anthropogenic inputs induced by irrigation return flow consistently several samples of this cluster are also characterized by elevated concentration of no3 fig 11 4 conclusion in this investigation multivariate statistical analysis and geochemical modeling have been used to provide basic information about the processes controlling groundwater quality variations in the irrigated area of takelsa syncline the geochemical composition of groundwater in the study area comprises three main types nacl camgcl and cahco3 reflecting chemical evolution from early to advanced stage as revealed by the hypothetical salts combination of groundwater the spatial distribution of salinity indicates that the groundwater could be classified into three types fresh brackish and saline water 3 g l which is observed in the areas of extensive withdrawal in the central part of the basin the increase of the salinity linked to the increase of major ions cl na ca2 and so4 2 concentrations is mainly attributed to the effect of direct cation exchange and dissolution of soluble salts in the aquifer matrix as shown by the calculated saturation indices and ionic relations however groundwater quality in the central eastern and northern parts of the study area is clearly influenced by irrigation return flow as confirmed by low values of pco2 which indicates an infiltration of water largely influenced by the atmospheric co2 the majority of these groundwater samples are characterized by high nitrate contents exceeding 50 mg l which are mainly caused by the widespread use of nitrogen fertilizers the use of chemical fertilizers in particular potassic based composite has caused the change of groundwater chemical pattern and inversion of natural cations exchange reactions multivariate statistical analysis pca and hca helped in identifying the factors or sources responsible for water quality variations and confirmed that the main geochemical process is water rock interaction via dissolution and cation exchange reactions explaining 54 the anthropogenic effect is also among the major sources responsible for water quality deterioration causing the increase of nitrate contents and groundwater mineralization furthermore this study illustrates the usefulness of multivariate statistical techniques and geochemical modeling for the analysis and interpretation of complex data sets identification of pollution sources and understanding variations in water quality for groundwater management interventions should be made to reduce anthropogenic effect in the takelsa basin otherwise the frequent use of such poor quality water by farmers for irrigation will cause adverse environmental impacts such as salinization of irrigated land change in soil structure permeability and aeration which indirectly affect the plant growth moreover high levels of pollution will greatly influence the population and will provoke socio economic problems in this framework future investigations involving the application of environmental isotopes tracers and chemical trace elements will improve the understanding of the studied aquifer system especially in relation with the origin of nitrate contamination and recharge processes acknowledgments the authors gratefully thank the technical staff at the laboratory of radio analyses and environment of the

12298,the evaluation of groundwater quality is crucial for water resources management in arid and semi arid regions particularly in irrigated area where groundwater chemistry can be modified by variety of natural and anthropogenic factors this study aims to investigate the origin of water quality variation and the major geochemical processes controlling the groundwater evolution in the shallow aquifer of takelsa northeastern of tunisia the combined use of geochemical modeling and multivariate statistical analysis such as hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca indicates several major influences including the lithology of the aquifer system and anthropogenic inputs saturation indices pco2 and hypothetical salt combinations in integration with various mapping and graphical method identified water rock interaction reactions through dissolution and cation exchange reactions as a major factor this process controlling groundwater quality explains 54 2 of the total variance and prevails mainly in southern part of the basin furthermore the excessive use of composite chemical fertilizer was identified as a second factor with 14 3 of the total variance this anthropogenic factor causes a change of chemical pattern of groundwater samples by an inversion of cation exchange reaction and an increase of nitrate contents in 84 of the wells located in the irrigated area of the basin graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality geochemical multivariate statistical analysis nitrate tunisia 1 introduction in arid and semi arid countries groundwater plays a major role in ensuring domestic water supply for urban population and promoting the development of society and economy in these regions groundwater irrigation has grown rapidly over last decades and now is making a substantial contribution to agriculture and food security shah 2014 however the extensive use of groundwater by human being is causing serious aquifer depletion and quality degradation and further reduces its use for urban water supply and agricultural use kumar et al 2013 thus the sustainable management of groundwater resources constitutes a very sensitive issue and requires an adequate knowledge of the causes and processes of water resources quantity and quality variations in time and space understanding these mechanisms is difficult because it could be linked either to anthropogenic effects and or to natural processes geologic the impact of long term water rock interaction on groundwater quality has been intensively investigated using geochemical tracing approaches e g leaking of minerals present in the rock formation as halite or gypsum dissolution farid et al 2013 kraiem et al 2014 abid et al 2014 kumar et al 2015 additionally recent changes on groundwater quality as a result of human activities were highlighted in different regions across the world including nitrate pollution due to application of chemical fertilizers re et al 2017 seawater or connate seawater intrusion linked to over pumping sanford and pope 2010 trabelsi et al 2012 pastén zapata et al 2014 kumar et al 2015 and contamination by as and f whose initial release is driven by the anthropogenic activities kumar et al 2016 therefore correctly understanding groundwater geochemistry and identifying the risk factors of the aquifer system are crucial to control and improve groundwater resources management scheme in these regions nevertheless the delineation of geochemical processes is very complex as there is important hydrochemical variability due to the combined effect of several major influences in the aquifer system the literature shows different methodologies that could be useful to investigate and to characterize the sources of groundwater quality variation geochemical modeling constitutes an important method that is commonly used for the description of water rock interface systems interaction plummer 1992 appelo and postma 2005 it attempts to determine the chemical reactions occurring along a flow path plummer et al 1994 based on sets of mole transfers of phases that account for changes in water chemistry between one or a mixture of initial water compositions and final water compositions parkhurst and appelo 1999 it allows identifying thermodynamic controls on the groundwater composition through equilibrium speciation and saturation index calculations in this investigation geochemical modeling used to investigate water rock interactions as dissolution and precipitation is coupled with multivariate statistical techniques such as hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca the combined use of these tools constitutes effective approaches that help in the interpretation of hydrochemical data to better understand the water quality and geochemical process in the studied systems they allow the identification of possible factors sources that influence water geochemistry lee et al 2001 shrestha and kazama 2007 matiatos et al 2014 sonkamble at al 2014 hadj ammar et al 2014 kumar et al 2016 these methods are also useful in characterizing and evaluating surface and freshwater quality variations caused by natural and anthropogenic factors singh et al 2004 shrestha and kazama 2007 zghibi et al 2014 das et al 2015 the use of different multivariate statistical techniques offers a valuable tool for reliable management of water resources as well as helps decision makers to find rapid solution to contamination problems in the present investigation geochemical modeling and different multivariate statistical methods are applied to physico chemical data of shallow groundwater in the irrigated area of takelsa syncline in cap bon region located northeastern of tunisia cap bon peninsula is a typical agricultural and tourist area where the water supply to major urban centers and areas under intensive agriculture development depends on groundwater resources over the last decades groundwater exploitation has been increasing and progressively exceeding the available resources estimated at 160 mm3 year trabelsi 2004 this over exploitation is causing marked lowering of water tables of up to 5 m in some areas and progressive deterioration of groundwater quality by the increase of the salinity and nitrate contents in some areas takelsa aquifer system constitutes one of the most exploited aquifer in the cap bon peninsula where exploitation rate is largely exceeding the available groundwater resources trabelsi 2004 previous investigations dealing with the qualitative aspects of groundwater treat in detail the spatial distribution of physico chemical parameters correlations between major elements and isotopic investigation in order to identify the main mineralization processes affecting different aquifers in the cap bon peninsula ben hamouda et al 2009 ben moussa et al 2012 charfi et al 2013 re et al 2017 however none of these studies has dealt with groundwater quality degradation in the irrigated area of takelsa syncline this research which reports the results of the first geochemical investigation carried out on the shallow aquifer of takelsa integrates geochemical modeling and multivariate statistical analysis in order to identify sources and process controlling groundwater chemistry the aims were i to investigate groundwater quality variation ii to extract information about the geochemical processes and iii to identify the influence of possible sources natural and anthropogenic on the groundwater quality overall this investigation can demonstrate the fundamental role of multidisciplinary hydrogeological assessment to support sustainable development in arid and semi arid regions highlighting the crucial role that adequate groundwater management can play to reduce poverty and socioeconomic development 2 materials and methods 2 1 general setting takelsa area is located north west of cap bon peninsula in the north east of tunisia it is constituted by a syncline with general direction ne sw limited to the east by the anticline of djebel abderrahmene to the north and west by the mediterranean sea and to the south by the plain of menzel bouzelfa fig 1 the population of the takelsa region is about 20000 inhabitants the area comprises a sub humid to a semi arid climate with an annual mean precipitation of 496 mm year the most rainfall is concentrated between the months of september to may 97 with minimum values of temperature of 9 c in january the driest months are june july and august precipitation of about 3 with temperature values up to 31 in august evapotranspiration show a rise during the summer june july and august in response to the decrease of the air humidity and temperature increase the region is a rich agricultural area specializing in production of citrus fruits and viticulture including table grapes and wine hence surface waters are limited farmers are heavily depending on groundwater resources 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the study area is a syncline formed during the atlas compression assigned to the miocene it s limited to the east by the anticline of djebel abderrahmene and to the west by the monocline of korbous dip sandstone deposits of the central part of the basin show a syncline axis oriented sw ne ben salem 1992 takelsa syncline constitutes subsident basin where miocene series can reach a thickness of 1500 m geological outcrops of this basin are ranging in ages from the oligocene to quaternary the different lithostratigraphic unit identified in the study area from the oldest to the youngest are i oligocene lower miocene which presents major sequence of regressive sedimentation trend outcropping only at the boarding reliefs formed on its lower part by marine carbonates and by detritic sediments on its upper part ii middle miocene appearing at the eastern flank of monocline korbous represented by homogeneous clayey marl rich microfaunas iii the upper miocene represented by detrital sandstone or alternations with dominant sandstone and clay indicating a regressive sedimentation sequence in deltaic environment prograding under the influence of waves and storm and vi quaternary represented by alluvial deposits outcropping in wadis and alluvial plains burollet 1956 ben salem 1992 takelsa region presents a multilayer aquifer system consisting of an alternation of permeable semi permeable and impermeable levels the syncline is dominated by miocene series composed by clay marl and sandstones that constitute small levels whose number and thickness become increasingly important to the bottom thus in relation with the absence of significant alluvial cover surface and deep drilling wells are tapping the sandstone aquifer levels of miocene fig 2 the shallow aquifer is unconfined composed of two levels separated by semi permeable layers clayey sandstone or sandstone clay favoring their hydraulic communication and improving the productivity of shallow wells in the area the depth ranged from 20 to 30 m for the first level and from 40 to 60 m for the second one the recharge of the shallow aquifer system is occurring by rain water infiltration through sandstone outcrops at the hills located at the center east of the syncline henchir cheddly fig 1 therefore shallow groundwater flows from the central part of the syncline according to two directions i towards to the north east to wadi el abid and the gulf of tunis and ii towards to the west and the south west in the direction of the monocline of korbous wadi bezirk and the mediterranean sea fig 1 the deep aquifer levels contained in sandstones layers of miocene extend over all the syncline with a lateral variation in the thickness depth and lithology the transmissivity of the miocene sandstones is about 5 10 4 m2 s shallow groundwater in takelsa is exploited by more than 850 shallow wells about 80 of these wells are equipped and used mainly for irrigation which represents 90 of total exploited volume the annual exploitation volume reaches 13 mm3 which exceed largely the natural recharge rate estimated to 10 mm3 year trabelsi 2004 the geochemical investigation presented in this paper focuses on the shallow groundwater quality variations 2 3 sample collection and analysis in total 37 shallow wells were sampled once during the rainy period extending from september 2003 to january 2004 fig 1 the groundwater samples were collected in 1000 ml polyethylene bottles which were rinsed first by the samples water several times and then filled to the top for all samples temperature t c ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ using a multiparameter wtw with an accuracy of 0 1 for ph and 0 5 for ec reading limits total dissolved solids tds were measured by evaporating 100 ml of the samples at 105 c during 24h major chemical elements were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc type beckman cations ca2 mg2 na k analysis were performed at 21 c using ic pak tm cm d columns with edta and nitric acid as eluent at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min anions concentrations cl so4 2 no3 were determined using ci super sep columns with phthalic acid and acetonitrile as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 5 ml min and temperature of 21 c the overall detection limit for ions was 0 2 mg l the co3 and hco3 concentrations were analyzed in the laboratory by titration using 0 1 n hcl acid the ionic balance for all samples is within 5 all the chemical analyses were performed at the laboratory of radio analysis and environment of the national engineering school of sfax tunisia 2 4 thematic maps the spatial distribution of groundwater quality in takelsa syncline was carried out using the surface mapping program surfer 9 developed by golden software the experimental variograms were computed for each chemical parameter and then fitted with the best mathematical model the basic geostatistical approach of the ordinary kriging was used as the interpolation method for all parameters it serves to compute a value at unsampled point using a simple linear weighted average of measured data in the neighborhood of the estimation location de smith et al 2007 the weights are determined from the fitted variogram defined for each parameter 2 5 geochemical modeling the speciation modeling such the calculation saturation states partial pressure of co2 and species present in different water samples was performed using the usgs geochemical code phreeqc version 3 1 7 9213 the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 was calculated using ph measurement and total alkalinity values phreeqc allows an accurate calculation of carbonates speciation which includes activity coefficients complexing and correction of mass action constants to in situ temperature appelo and postma 2005 the changes in saturation state has been used to differentiate different stages of hydrochemical evolution and to identify which geochemical reactions are important in controlling water chemistry negative saturation indices si indicate that the groundwater is under saturated with respect to a particular mineral positive si reflects whether the groundwater is oversaturated with respect to a particular mineral i e unable of dissolving more of the mineral si values close to zero indicate an equilibrium state between groundwater and the mineral appelo and postma 2005 2 6 multivariate statistical analysis recently multivariate statistical techniques have been widely used for the assessment of water quality suk and lee 1999 lee et al 2001 kim et al 2005 shrestha and kazama 2007 matiatos et al 2014 these tools help to simplify and organize large data sets in a way to explain observed relations among several variables matiatos et al 2014 in this investigation pca and hca statistical methods were performed on 37 water samples all mathematical and statistical computations were made using microsoft office excel 2007 and statistica data analysis software system version 10 from statsoft inc 2 6 1 principal components analysis pca pca as one of the descriptive multivariate analyses is used to study and to graphically represent the maximum of information and correlation between the variables and the observations points it consists to reduce the large data set of interdependent variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components to complete pca four steps were followed i the standardization of the data davis 2002 given that the variables are expressed in different scales and unit ii computation of correlation matrix by determining the correlation coefficient iii estimation of the factor loadings and factor scores and iv factor extraction and interpretation the determination of factor is based on the kaiser criteria kaiser 1958 retaining only components factors whose eigenvalues are equal or greater than 1 the obtained factor are classified in such a way that the first principal component has the highest eigenvalue and represents the most sources of variation of the original data suk and lee 1999 everitt and hothorn 2011 the factor loadings are interpreted as correlation coefficient between the variable and principal components it may be positive or negative which indicates that the contribution of variables increases or decreases with increasing loadings in a dimension respectively liu et al 2003 the factor scores reflect the relative importance of the examined processes on the observation 2 6 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hca cluster analysis is a technique for classifying individuals or objects into unknown groups based on the characteristics they possess the similarity between two objects is maximal if they belong to the same cluster hierarchical cluster analysis is the most used where the resulting clusters are presented in dendrogram tree diagram mckenna 2003 the dendrogram presents a picture of the clusters and their proximity and provides a useful graphical tool for determining the number of clusters that adequately describe underlying processes that lead to the identification of homogeneous groups the approaches consisting to grouping small clusters into larger ones is called agglomerative in this study hierarchical cluster analysis hca was applied for classification using ward s linkage method ward 1963 and the squared euclidian distance as the similarity measurement between two objects 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical chemical parameters and major elements geochemistry descriptive statistics for the variables and their standard deviations are presented in table 1 all of the parameters show a high dispersion implying a spatial variation as indicated by the high standard deviation values the ph values range from 7 to 8 7 which indicates that shallow groundwater is slightly alkaline this is probably due to a mineralogical source given alkaline cations bicarbonate or dissolved hydroxide in the water groundwater samples in the takelsa syncline basin show heterogeneous values of temperature varying between 12 and 22 c with an average of 17 8 c these values reflect the variation of surface air temperatures 19 c during different sampling periods since the water table is close to the surface electrical conductivity ranges between 0 47 and 4 65 ms cm with a mean value of 2 05 ms cm 19 of analyzed water samples gave ec values less than 1 41 between 1 and 2 ms cm 22 between 2 and 3 ms cm and 19 comprised between 3 and 5 ms cm table 1 based on these values groundwater could be classified into three types fresh brackish and saline reflecting variation of the concentration of dissolved ionized solids in the water additionally the higher value of the standard deviation indicates variability in the hydrogeochemical processes it could be attributed to the local variation of aquifer lithology soil type groundwater transit time and also agriculture related activities in the area accordantly groundwater salinity represented by the total dissolved salts tds values displays a large range of variation from 0 32 l to 3 27 g l p32 fig 3 the lowest values are found in the central eastern part of takelsa syncline area samples p15 p29 p34 and p20 which corresponds to the recharge area and suggests that upstream groundwater flow is diluted by rain water this seems to be linked to the high permeability of the miocene sands which outcrop in the recharge area allowing a rapid infiltration of surface and rain water however the highest tds values are recorded in southern part towards wadi bezirk samples p32 p23 p37 p17 and 30 where the soils are significantly rich in clay minerals which results in increased salt in the unsaturated zone in fact clay fractions existing in detrital layers of the basin will extend groundwater transit time leading to the longer contact periods favoring dissolution of minerals present in the aquifer formation and so providing an additional input of chemical elements thus the groundwater which is flowing through less permeable but soluble mineral rich argillaceous materials contains high ions concentration on the other hand high tds value 3 g l is observed in the central part p33 in the areas of extensive withdrawal the increase of the salinity seems to be linked to the increase of major ions cl na ca2 and so4 2 concentrations fig 4 which correlate well with the electrical conductivity the distribution maps of the chlorides and sodium fig 4 show that cl and na have the same spatial repartition their concentrations generally increase towards the north and south of the basin according to the flowpaths except for wells p24 p33 p23 and p37 where the cl and na contents may exceed 1000 and 500 mg l respectively this distribution is consistent with that of total mineralization in order to thoroughly delineate the processes contributing to groundwater mineralization in the takelsa groundwater different diagrams using major ions are investigated fig 5 the plot of na versus cl fig 5a shows parallel increase in both ions for majority of the analyzed waters indicating the dissolution of this mineral and or enrichment of dissolved phase due to partial evaporation of water nevertheless for some samples the molar ratio na cl is clearly lower than unity points located below the halite dissolution line fig 5a meaning that its composition cannot be attributed only to dissolution of halite some reaction of silicate minerals involving the sodium or anthropogenic sources of chloride could explain the decrease in this ratio below 1 groundwater alkalinity is controlled by varying proportions of bicarbonate hco3 carbonate co3 2 and carbonic acid h2co3 in the present case bicarbonate is the predominant species due to the ph range of local groundwaters the concentrations of hco3 vary between 100 65 and 488 mg l the highest values are measured in the well samples n p21 p23 p25 p32 and p36 the hco3 can come from dissolution of carbonate minerals soil co2 or bacterial degradation of the organic contamination the origin of carbonate species in the studied groundwater will be discussed further using the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and saturation indices in comparison with chlorides the sulphates show lower contents fig 4 the highest concentrations of so4 2 are observed at the p17 p21 p24 and p32 wells in correlation with calcium these points have the highest concentrations indicating that the high mineralization observed at these points is mainly due to the dissolution of the sulphated minerals the plot ca2 mg2 vs so4 2 hco3 fig 5b of takelsa shallow groundwater exhibits a good linear relationship with 1 1 stoichiometry ratio in some water samples indicating that these ions were most probably derived from a simple dissolution of sulphate and carbonates minerals however the majority of water sampling points is falling above the line slope 1 and suggests enrichment in ca2 and mg2 concentrations relatives to so4 2 and hco3 contents fig 5b this excess is pointing to the existence of others ca2 and mg2 sources probably linked to an anthropogenic input or cation exchange reactions occurring through existing clay minerals leading to the release of these cations to the solution in this diagram fig 5b only two sampling points are plotted below the equiline suggesting a deficit in ca2 and mg2 contents comparing to so4 2 and hco3 concentrations 3 2 geochemical modeling 3 2 1 water types the major ion composition of water analyses is depicted in the piper trilinear equivalence diagram to examine the hydrochemical water types fig 6 the chemical composition of groundwater in the study area is composed of different water types the nacl type the camgcl and cahco3 water types the wide range of hydrochemical types indicates the variability of chemical processes leading to the observed groundwater mineralization the nacl is generally localized downstream of the basin p17 p37 p32 p33 and characterized by high tds content however the camgclno3 is usually located upstream of groundwater flow p34 p29 p15 and characterized by low tds contents the wells p35 p31 p5 p6 p12 and p19 located at the foothills of djebel abderrahmene and monocline of korbous show cahco3 water type pointing to the dilution effect by rain or surface water infiltration 3 2 2 partial pressures of co2 the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 has an important role in the water chemistry it reflects the geochemical process and influences the reactions between groundwater and carbonate minerals the pco2 of water sample which is in equilibrium with the atmosphere should be about 10 3 5 atm however the pco2 in groundwater is generally higher by two or three order of magnitudes as result of uptake of carbon dioxide from the soil during the infiltration of rain water the co2 in sandy unsaturated zone is produced by root respiration and decay of labile organic material the calculated values of pco2 in water samples vary between 10 3 3 and 10 1 5 atm confirming the presence of biogenic source of co2 in the soil coming probably from bacteria activities and vegetation roots releasing co2 gas in the soil the vertical evolution of log pco2 with the depth shows that the maximum of these activities is located close to land surface and at 5 m of depth where an increase in partial pressure of co2 is observed fig 7 a the lowest values of pco2 indicate both the significant recharge by irrigation water which is largely influenced by the atmospheric co2 and the infiltration of rainfall at the recharge area 3 2 3 saturation indices the calculated saturation table 2 indices using the phreeqc program show an under saturation state of groundwater with respect to halite appelo and postma 2005 which confirms the dissolution of this mineral under saturation of groundwater with respect to gypsum and anhydrite suggests that the possible source of sulphate and calcium may be the dissolution of these evaporites this is concordant with the spatial distribution maps which indicate similar concentration points of ca2 and so4 2 fig 4 takelsa shallow groundwaters are at or above equilibrium versus carbonates minerals saturation calcite aragonite magnesite and dolomite the oversaturation of groundwater shows that these minerals have already precipitated in the past and are not contributing much of ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater saturation indices of the carbonate minerals calcite aragonite dolomite and magnesite were compared with the log pco2 values for all samples the decreasing log pco2 increases the saturation index of most of the carbonate minerals fig 7b thus the geochemical evolution of carbonates in groundwater involves the co2 based weathering reactions 3 3 nitrates contamination nitrate represents the most widespread chemical contaminant in the world s aquifers high concentrations are attributed to atmospheric deposition discharge from septic tanks and leaking sewers the spreading of sewage sludge to land and seepage from landfills wakida and lerner 2005 furthermore agricultural activities are considered as the principal source of nitrate pollution in groundwater takelsa region is one of the most important agricultural areas in cap bon peninsula where large amounts of fertilizer such as urea and commercial composite have been applied for a long time to increase agricultural production the measured no3 content was above the threshold value for anthropogenic influence 3 mg l burkart and kolpin 1993 in 84 of the wells and above the maximum value recommended for drinking water by the who organization 50 mg l who 2004 in 43 of sampled wells this increase in nitrate concentration can have severe effects on human health and food security the highest no3 levels were found in north western and center parts of the basin where it reached 352 2 mg l p33 while the lowest are found in eastern part of the basin fig 3 this spatial distribution appears to be related to areas of irrigation and application of chemical fertilizers to shallow rooted vegetable crops on sandy soils in fact in these regions of the investigated basin flood irrigation is applied and the excess of irrigation water undergoes excessive nitrate enrichment at the shallow aquifer the evolution in nitrate contents is correlated with those of ca k and chloride which could be explained by the use of ca no3 2 kno3 and kcl fertilizers the similar evolution between mg and so4 provide insight into the excessive use mgso4 fertilizers gi tak et al 2004 stigter et al 2006 3 4 hydrochemical processes according to the chemical analysis of takelsa shallow groundwater it is clear that the dissolution of different salts in the aquifer matrix play an important role in water mineralization as shown by the calculated saturation indices table 2 however it s not the only process anthropogenic inputs and cations exchange contribute also to groundwater salinity in fact the presence of clay lenses in takelsa syncline provides a chance for leaching and cation exchange process the most abundant clay types in the study region are montmorillonite kaolinite and illite sassi 1964 amri 1989 these clay minerals have the property of absorbing certain ions and retaining them in an exchangeable state ma and eggleton 1999 the most common exchangeable cations in order of usual relative abundance are ca2 mg 2 h k nh4 na grim 1968 the cations exchange on a charged clay mineral depends on the bonding energy of the common metal cations which is in the order ca mg k h na this cation selectivity sequence depends on clay types but in general divalent ions with strong bonding energy in contact solutions are able to occupy the exchange positions preferentially to monovalent ions carroll and starkey 1958 atesok et al 1988 rytwo et al 1996 ma and eggleton 1999 thus if this type of cations exchange prevails the groundwater chemistry of takelsa syncline then a deficit of ca2 concentrations compared to so4 2 hco3 should be observed due to the adsorption of this cation on clay mineral on the contrary the majority of samples show enrichment on ca2 contents and at the same time an excess on cl concentrations compared to that of na fig 5 this situation could be explained by the fact that at natural situation equilibrium is reached between the calcium dissolved in the groundwater and that adsorbed by the clay mineral but the use of k fertilizers in particular kcl will cause calcium desorption hence reverse ion exchange is taking place in the groundwater of the study area in this process 2 k replace one ca2 fixed on the surface of rock matrix thus the calcium released will associate with chloride and the water type can change to cacl2 that remains in the evaporite deposits the determination of hypothetical salt combinations is useful in this case because they permit to identify associations involving elements that can show the same origin it can also point out the participation of major mineralization processes which commonly occurs in hydrochemistry the calculated hypothetical salt combination palmer 1911 using chemical analysis of takelsa groundwater shows different assemblage the first assemblage i nacl mgso4 ca so4 mg hco3 2 and ca hco3 2 which characterizes only 5 of analyzed water samples reflects earlier stage of chemical development than other assemblages i ii iii iv the presence of mg hco3 2 and ca hco3 2 salts indicates possible contribution of a meteoric water or surface water to the recent recharge of the aquifer the second assemblage ii kcl nacl mgso4 na2so4 ca so4 mg hco3 2 and ca hco3 2 which concerns 11 of groundwater samples presents more developed chemical composition the occurrence of na2so4 in this assemblage could be linked either to the cation exchange reactions or to the thenardite na2so4 mineral dissolution nevertheless the calculated saturation indices of thenardite which is not detected in the geologic formations of the study region table 2 are very low thus the potential dissolution of this mineral is not possible therefore the most likely source of the na2so4 combination is the cations exchange process where ca2 is adsorbed by the clay mineral and na are released is the solution to associate then with so4 2 ions so such water assemblage acquires its chemical composition from water rock interactions via leaching dissolution and direct cations exchange process the third assemblage iii kcl nacl mgcl2 cacl2 mgso4 caso4 mg hco3 2 and ca hco3 2 is detected in 46 of analyzed groundwater samples the presence of four chloride salts indicates a more advanced stage of chemical development in fact the chemical composition evolves from dominant hco3 salts i to dominant so4 and cl salts ii and ends by dominant chloride salts iii moreover the presence mgcl2 cacl2 salts gives an evidence of cation exchange processes in groundwater such cation exchange type is enhanced by the introduction of potassium fertilizers kcl in groundwater where alkalis cations na k in the solution replace ca2 and mg2 on the surface of clay minerals in the aquifer matrix abo el fadl et al 2015 as a result cacl2 and mgcl2 associations are formed this type of assemblage reflects combined effect of water rock interaction processes dissolution cation exchange reactions and return flow of contaminated irrigation water the fourth assemblage iv kcl nacl mgcl2 mgso4 caso4 mg hco3 2 and ca hco3 2 existing in 38 of analyzed water samples traduces also an advanced stage of chemical development groundwater salinity is mainly attributed to the effect of leaching and dissolution of soluble salts and reverse cation exchange reactions induced by return flow of irrigation water 3 5 statistical analysis in order to further elucidate the geochemical processes that contribute to mineralization of takelsa shallow groundwater hydrochemical data and the results of hypothetical salts combinations are employed for principal components and hierarchical cluster analysis using 21 variables chemical analysis hypothetical salts combinations and 37 observations 3 5 1 principal component analysis pca the results of the pca of takelsa shallow groundwater are presented in figs 8 and 9 the number of factors generated from principal components analysis indicates the total number of possible sources of variation in the chemical data the first three components extracted have eigen values greater than 1 and account for 78 5 of the total variance in the dataset shrestha and kazama 2007 this percentage is relatively low indicating a limited structuring of the variance because the chemistry of the water is conditioned by various factors the first factor which explains 54 2 of the total variance is considered as major factor controlling the relative proportions of chemical element existing in the groundwater samples factors 2 and 3 are not as important as the first one and explain only about 14 3 and 10 respectively these two components are related to more local effects than the first component the different variables are represented according to the factors 1 and 2 which explain together 68 5 of the variance and thus account for the majority of the variance in the original dataset fig 8a factor 1 has strong positive loadings of na ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl caso4 nacl and tds this group of variables is coming in general from rock weathering and silicates minerals hydrolysis as halite and gypsum the negative association of this factor with mg hco 3 and ca hco 3 indicates that this factor expresses fresh groundwater that are recently recharged by surface or rain water on its negative part thus the factor f1 represents the groundwater evolution and the importance of water rock interaction processes it emphasizes that groundwater with a higher residence time has higher contents in sodium chloride calcium and magnesium as related to the lithology of the aquifer therefore the first principal component expresses natural mineralization and water rock interaction processes which increase with longer residence time of water the second factor accounting for 14 3 of total variance presents positive loading for no3 co3 2 k kcl mgcl2 and cacl2 and negative loadings for ph hco3 na2so4 and mgso4 thus this principal component is mostly associated with chemical fertilizers and not the organics urea animal manure which should associate both no3 and hco3 the main component of commercial composite fertilizer nh4 is easily oxidized to no3 by the nitrification process according to reaction kim et al 2005 nh4 2o2 no3 h2o 2h the production of no3 through the nitrification processes is accompanied by the production of h ions which are released in the solution therefore when no3 contents increase ph values decrease in groundwater furthermore this axe opposes mgcl2 and cacl2 which are associated to kcl to na2so4 thus this principal component traduces cations exchange reactions occurring through existing clay minerals in the aquifer formations in the natural conditions bivalent cations ca 2 and mg2 are preferentially adsorbed by the clay minerals than monovalent cation and na2so4 is formed in the groundwater however the use of kcl fertilizers causes a desorbtion of these cations which will associate cl to form cacl2 and mgcl2 this finding is coherent with the previous explanation of the chemical composition of takelsa groundwater and confirms that the excessive use of fertilizers and the irrigation return flow cause groundwater quality degradation by the increase of nitrates contents and water hardness therefore the second principal component is mainly associated to the anthropogenic effect which causes groundwater contamination and an inversion of cation exchange reactions the projection of the groundwater samples according to the two factors and the spatial distribution maps of f1f2 scores which represents the influence natural mineralization process and anthropogenic effect respectively are represented in fig 8b and 9 different groups could be distinguished group a represents fresh and non contaminated groundwater with negative f1 scores and negative or low f2 score these groundwater samples located in the recharge area close to wadi abid and on foothills of djebel korbous traduce a recent recharge by rain water or surface water infiltration fig 9 group b is formed by a poorly mineralized groundwater affected by direct cation exchange process characterized by na2so4 assemblage group c represents mineralized groundwater affected by water rock interaction the groundwater salinity is principally due to dissolution process of evaporate minerals as halite and gypsum group d represents mineralized groundwater contaminated by the use of chemical fertilizer mainly nitrogen and potassium fertilizers f1 and f2 scores are positive and high these groundwater samples located mainly in the irrigated area are affected by inverse cation exchange presence of cacl2 mgcl2 assemblage group e is formed by relatively low mineralized groundwater which presents an anthropogenic effect f2 scores are positives f1 scores are low or negative fig 9 3 5 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hca hierarchical cluster analysis performed using chemical parameter yielded a dendrogram grouping all 37 groundwater samples of the takelsa basin into different statistically clusters fig 10 the number of significant statistically clusters could be defined by moving the position of the phenon line up or down on the dendrogram güler et al 2002 the position of the phenon line at a linkage distance of 3 5x106 allows a division of the dendrogram into three 03 cluster with similar hydrogeochemical composition named clusters i ii and iii and composed of 10 14 and 13 wells respectively to study the chemical variation according to the groups box and whisker plots of individual variables were plotted in fig 11 the clusters i ii and iii are discriminated by their chemical contents hco3 so4 cl na mg ca and tds have a decreasing trend in the order clusters i ii and iii whereas k and no3 have different trend fig 11 cluster iii presents the lowest mineralization tds 1000 mg l and lowest mean concentrations for all major elements fig 11 it includes the majority of samples belonging to a and b groups identified by principal components analysis and located in the recharge area or close to wadi abid and on foothills of djebel korbous this cluster represents fresh and non contaminated groundwater recharged recently by rain water or surface water infiltration however the cluster i corresponds to most mineralized samples it includes groups b and c fig 9 characterized by relatively long residence time and affected mainly by water rock interaction processes dissolution and cation exchange reactions this cluster is composed by groundwater samples located downstream of the basin and mainly around wadi bezirk cluster ii presents an intermediate chemical compositions marked by relatively high salinity it includes group e affected by an anthropogenic inputs induced by irrigation return flow consistently several samples of this cluster are also characterized by elevated concentration of no3 fig 11 4 conclusion in this investigation multivariate statistical analysis and geochemical modeling have been used to provide basic information about the processes controlling groundwater quality variations in the irrigated area of takelsa syncline the geochemical composition of groundwater in the study area comprises three main types nacl camgcl and cahco3 reflecting chemical evolution from early to advanced stage as revealed by the hypothetical salts combination of groundwater the spatial distribution of salinity indicates that the groundwater could be classified into three types fresh brackish and saline water 3 g l which is observed in the areas of extensive withdrawal in the central part of the basin the increase of the salinity linked to the increase of major ions cl na ca2 and so4 2 concentrations is mainly attributed to the effect of direct cation exchange and dissolution of soluble salts in the aquifer matrix as shown by the calculated saturation indices and ionic relations however groundwater quality in the central eastern and northern parts of the study area is clearly influenced by irrigation return flow as confirmed by low values of pco2 which indicates an infiltration of water largely influenced by the atmospheric co2 the majority of these groundwater samples are characterized by high nitrate contents exceeding 50 mg l which are mainly caused by the widespread use of nitrogen fertilizers the use of chemical fertilizers in particular potassic based composite has caused the change of groundwater chemical pattern and inversion of natural cations exchange reactions multivariate statistical analysis pca and hca helped in identifying the factors or sources responsible for water quality variations and confirmed that the main geochemical process is water rock interaction via dissolution and cation exchange reactions explaining 54 the anthropogenic effect is also among the major sources responsible for water quality deterioration causing the increase of nitrate contents and groundwater mineralization furthermore this study illustrates the usefulness of multivariate statistical techniques and geochemical modeling for the analysis and interpretation of complex data sets identification of pollution sources and understanding variations in water quality for groundwater management interventions should be made to reduce anthropogenic effect in the takelsa basin otherwise the frequent use of such poor quality water by farmers for irrigation will cause adverse environmental impacts such as salinization of irrigated land change in soil structure permeability and aeration which indirectly affect the plant growth moreover high levels of pollution will greatly influence the population and will provoke socio economic problems in this framework future investigations involving the application of environmental isotopes tracers and chemical trace elements will improve the understanding of the studied aquifer system especially in relation with the origin of nitrate contamination and recharge processes acknowledgments the authors gratefully thank the technical staff at the laboratory of radio analyses and environment of the

frequently depleted thereby affecting the area covered with green spaces in such cities zektser et al 2004 urban vegetation covers in such climatic zones thrive on precipitation and intermittent storm water or irrigation thus in cities of arid regions maintenance of green space is based on the assessment of the water reserves the quality of water affects the quality of soil and thereby impacts the vegetal cover on it the chemistry of the groundwater system of a particular area is supposed to be unique and is believed to be the result of chemical alterations in the meteoric water while recharging the system back 1966 ravikumar and somashekar 2011 salinity is the most commonly observed problem which is responsible for the loss of about 10 million hectares of land every year worldwide tanji 1990 suresh and nagesh 2015 therefore it is essential to have an effective management plan for use of both the green space and the irrigation water the quality of irrigation water is also important as with the bad quality of water supplied for irrigation the soil deteriorates and ultimately the vegetation on it is affected the irrigation water quality criteria depend on ph salinity and permeability as well as specific ion toxicity like sodium chloride boron and miscellaneous effects of nitrates and bicarbonates ayers and westcot 1985 the rate of indiscriminate exploitation of groundwater has grown in the asian countries in the past decade ravikumar and somashekar 2011 in india the quantity as well as quality of water available for irrigation is depending on the geology and climatology of the site and at the same time the demands on water use in agriculture industry and urbanization processes have increased the exploitation of groundwater has led to the lowering of water table and deterioration in water quality prasad et al 2008 the aberration in the monsoon pattern and increase in impervious urban covers leading to decrease in percolation rate of surface water have also led to the degradation of groundwater quality therefore for the development and sustainability of green spaces in a city the groundwater quality evaluation is essential rourkela in the state of odisha popularly known as steel city of india has several green spaces in the form of parks viz indira gandhi park sector 4 deer park sector 8 nehru park in front of ispat general hospital sanjivani park at civil township uditnagar park chotha park near railway colony children park at chhend lugun park at sector 9 fitness park at sector 14 and sona udyan fertilizer the sustainability of these green spaces is dependent on groundwater rourkela city is expanding in different directions with the decadal population growth rate of 20 hudp 2011 the growth of the city demands for the development of new green spaces in the urban rurban and rural setup of the region and maintenance of existing green spaces for the wellbeing of the inhabitants however in this context no such study has been conducted and therefore the present investigation is aimed at assessing the suitability of groundwater of rourkela city to be used in maintaining the green spaces by carrying out groundwater quality assessment for agricultural irrigation in accordance with fao irrigation and drainage protocols 2 the study area rourkela is a city of sundargarh district of odisha in india which lies at an elevation of 219 m above sea level and is placed around 84 54 e longitude and 22 12 n latitude fig 1 rourkela is an important industrial city the rourkela city has a geographical spread over 264 7 km2 and it harbours a human population of more than 4 lakhs there are iron ore dolomite and coal belts surrounding the region durgapur hill range bifurcates the city into two parts northern and southern clusters koel river flows towards west in the north of rourkela and confluences with east flowing sankh river near vedavyas in the downstream of this confluence the river is named as brahmani which has a southward flow in the region brahmani river system is one of the large river systems of the country with a mega steel plant in the area and many medium and large scale industries the rourkela city is an industrial complex with the monsoon period accounting for greater than 70 of the total annual rainfall the average annual rainfall amounts to 137 cm the air temperature in the region goes down to 6 c during winter december january and rises up to 47 c during summer may the range for average relative humidity is 35 85 the humidity is highest during july the population density of rourkela urban area is about 6696 persons per km2 approximately there is variation in land use land cover pattern within the region at the extremes there are areas in rural sectors and areas that are considered urban between these two extremes there exists a vast geographical area for this area the discrete definitions of rural and urban settings are often blurred and such areas are considered rurban settings however urban rurban and rural setup are unified systems where people ideas and materials circulate the congestion in all these areas demands for the green spaces for control of environmental pollution 3 methodology this study was conducted during march to may i e during indian pre monsoon seasons twenty five groundwater samples were collected from the study area from 25 locations lying in urban rurban and rural settings fig 1 and table 2 the samples were collected from three types of wells viz bore wells tube wells and dug wells the groundwater samples were collected after 10 min of flow in case of tube wells and bore wells the samples were directly collected in pre cleaned polyethylene bottles of 2 l capacity and stored electrical conductivity ph temperature and total dissolved solids for the collected samples were measured in the field immediately after sampling using water analysis kit the concentrations of major ions in the water samples were determined at the laboratory using the standard analytical procedures described in apha 2005 the ion charge balance equation and ion balance error computation methods mathhess 1982 domenico and schwartz 1990 were used to check the accuracy of all chemical analyses these methods considered the relationship between the total cations na k ca2 mg2 and the total anions po4 3 no3 so4 2 co3 2 hco3 and cl for each groundwater analysis and calculated the error percent reaction error cationic and anionic balance e of samples as e c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i o n s 100 where the sum of major cations and anions are expressed in meq l the reaction error of all groundwater samples was less than the accepted limit of 10 mathhess 1982 thus supporting the precision of the data to evaluate the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purpose different parameters and indices were calculated using the formulae given by different workers table 1 the analysis on the suitability of the groundwater of the region for irrigation was made by plotting the sodium absorption ratio and electrical conductivity data on us salinity laboratory diagram ussl 1954 fig 2 to understand the controlling mechanism for groundwater chemistry the functional sources of dissolved chemical constituents viz precipitation dominance rock dominance and evaporation dominance were assessed from two distinct diagrams proposed by gibbs 1970 where ratio i for cations na k na k ca and ratio ii for anions cl cl hco3 were plotted against the tds values fig 4a and b 4 results and discussion different analysed parameters and calculated indices values are given in table 2 and discussed in the following sections 4 1 ph the ph value in groundwater is dependent on the carbon dioxide carbonate bicarbonate equilibria masters and ela 2008 the groundwater contains carbonates of calcium and magnesium at a ph range of 7 5 8 whilst the water with ph of 8 5 or higher carries appreciable exchangeable sodium the ph values of the groundwater samples of the region vary from 6 5 to 7 8 and at five localities the ph values exceed the threshold limit of 7 5 table 2 the ranges of ph values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 6 5 7 8 6 7 7 6 and 6 6 7 4 respectively at this ph levels the groundwater is suitable for irrigation 4 2 electrical conductivity ec the ec value of groundwater samples of the area ranges from 228 to 303 μs cm table 1 suggesting that the water is excellent to good for irrigation in accordance with the scheme proposed by wilcox 1955 the ranges of ec values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 228 280 230 277 and 230 303 μs cm respectively following uccc 1974 scheme on degree of restriction on use based on ec values the groundwater of the study area belongs to none category and therefore suitable for irrigation purpose 4 3 salinity index si following handa 1969 the groundwater samples of the region were grouped into two categories low excellent quality and medium good quality table 3 i most of the samples 60 belonged to low salinity category suggesting that the groundwater is of excellent quality since the ec values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 228 280 230 277 and 230 303 μs cm respectively each set up contained good to excellent quality waters in terms of salinity level table 3i 4 4 chlorinity index ci low salt tolerance crops are generally very sensitive to chloride all the groundwater samples of the region were found to be suitable class i for irrigation table 3ii the ranges of ci values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 0 56 4 65 0 63 4 65 and 0 63 6 85 meq l respectively 4 5 total hardness th the bicarbonate component of the soil indirectly affects the plant growth using this parameter the groundwater samples of the region were classified into three different categories viz soft moderately hard and hard following the scheme of sawyer and mccarthy 1967 table 3iii the ranges of th values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 63 230 98 141 and 84 106 mg l respectively out of 25 groundwater samples the numbers of hard moderately hard and soft categories were 3 19 and 3 respectively it appears that major portions of the groundwater of the region are only moderately hard and therefore suitable for irrigation purpose 4 6 sodium absorption ratio sar the waters in which sodium deposition is high are not considered suitable for irrigating the soils because sodium when occurring in higher concentrations negatively affects the soil characters particularly the soil permeability is reduced by sodium which in turn inhibits the supply of water to crops high sar values indicate the dominance of sodium over calcium and magnesium considered together and is effectively used to understand the sodium hazard of high carbonate waters it is a suitable index to estimate the alkali hazard in irrigation water and effectively suggests whether a particular water source can be used for irrigation the groundwater samples of the region were classified based on sar values using the scheme proposed by todd 1980 and richards 1954 table 3iv all the groundwater samples collected in this study have sar values less than 10 suggesting that they are grouped into s1 sodium hazard class and are excellent for irrigation purpose the ranges of sar values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 0 44 2 75 1 19 3 44 and 1 88 5 65 respectively thus sar values were generally high for rural samples 4 7 salinity hazard the salinity hazard in irrigation water is determined in terms of electrical conductivity classification of the groundwater samples of the study area based on salinity hazard presented in table 3v indicates that samples are good to excellent on ussl 1954 diagram 11 data plots fall on c2s1 field suggesting that this groundwater are medium salinity low sodium type on the contrary 14 data plots fall on c1s1 indicating that the groundwater of these locations is low salinity low sodium type and is suitable for irrigation of majority of crops and soils where leaching predominates where there is moderate amount of leaching the medium salinity hazard type c2 groundwater can be used for irrigation high conductivity and high sar values for most of the rurban and rural samples place them in c2s1 medium salinity low sodium field fig 2 4 8 percent sodium na methods proposed by richards 1954 and wilcox 1955 were used to classify and understand the basic chemical characteristics of groundwater since its suitability for irrigation depends on the mineralization of water as well as its effects on plants and soil in case of sodium rich irrigation water the clay particles in soil absorb na displacing the mg2 and ca2 ions from the lattice this replacement of ca2 and mg2 in soil by na from water affects the permeability and reduces the internal drainage within the soil therefore air and water circulations are restricted under wet conditions and when dried such soils become hard saleh et al 1999 based on percent sodium levels the groundwater samples of the region are classified into excellent good and permissible categories table 3vi while only two samples are of excellent category 8 samples are good and 15 samples are of permissible category the ranges of na values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 18 38 55 09 28 60 56 69 and 42 27 57 99 respectively thus na is generally high for groundwater of rural setup moreover the data plots disposition on percent sodium vs ec diagram of wilcox 1955 fig 3 a suggests that the groundwater samples are excellent to good in nature and therefore suitable for irrigation 4 9 soluble sodium percentage ssp the soluble sodium percentage ssp values for the groundwater samples of the region range from 23 27 to 95 77 table 2 suggesting that the water quality is excellent to good categories for the purpose of agricultural use the ranges of ssp values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 23 27 74 81 33 62 69 79 and 48 10 95 75 respectively thus the rural waters have high ssp values 4 10 residual sodium carbonate rsc the excess concentration of co3 2 and hco3 in groundwater considered together over the sum of ca 2 and mg 2 also determines the usability of groundwater for irrigation purpose in groundwater with high concentrations of hco3 the ca 2 and mg 2 ions tend to precipitate sodium bicarbonate and carbonate when present in excess affect the physical properties of soils these ions together cause dissolution of organic matter in the soil and result in black stain when the soil surface is dried us department of agriculture has proposed that water with more than 2 50epm of residual sodium carbonate rsc is unsuitable for irrigation in the study region 16 groundwater samples showed rsc values greater than 2 50epm these high rsc values suggest that the concentration of dissolved ca2 and mg2 ions were less compared to co3 2 and hco3 ions thus making the water unsuitable for irrigation the ranges of rsc values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 1 94 to 4 28 2 67 5 10 and 2 64 7 40 epm respectively the study indicates that 64 of the groundwater samples of the regions are unsuitable while 6 samples 24 have good and 3 samples 12 have doubtful status with regard to rsc table 3vii in particular the rurban and rural samples are unsuitable with regard to rsc 4 11 residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc values for the groundwater samples varied from 1 20 to 6 86 meq l table 2 the ranges of rsbc values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 1 20 5 06 3 75 5 90 and 3 93 6 86 meq l respectively the groundwater samples from 7 locations 28 were unsuitable with rsbc values 5 meq l however in 72 of the studied region 18 locations the groundwater was suitable in regard to rsbc 4 12 permeability index pi long term irrigation affects the permeability of the soil due to presence of na ca2 mg2 and hco3 ions in water therefore the permeability index pi values can be effectively used to determine the suitability of groundwater to be used for irrigation purpose because of low level of permeability of the soil the supply of water to crops is reduced and this affects the cropping process through crusting of seedbeds water logging of surface soil and accompanying disease salinity weed oxygen and nutritional problems michael 1997 the pi is used to classify waters into three classes i ii and iii fig 3b the permeability index values of the groundwater samples of the region ranged from 23 61 to 68 25 the ranges of pi values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 23 61 68 25 38 37 43 23 and 35 01 55 39 respectively the data plots fall in classes i and ii of doneen s chart suggesting that the groundwater of the region is good fig 3b 4 13 potential salinity ps the suitability of water for irrigation is independent of the level of soluble salts in it doneen 1962 1964 in successive stages of irrigation the low soluble salts are accumulated in the soil and the presence of highly soluble salts increase the salinity of the soil the potential salinity ps of the groundwater samples of the study region varied from 1 50 to 7 29 table 2 the ranges of ps values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 1 50 7 29 1 90 4 84 and 1 88 3 60 meq l respectively 4 14 ion exchange processes it is crucial to understand the changes taking place in the chemical composition of groundwater during flow johnson 1979 sastri 1994 the chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and cai 2 suggested by schoeller 1965 1967 and 1977 have established that these indices indicate ion exchange between the groundwater and its host environment during residence or travel in the subsurface in case of exchange of na and k ions of water by mg2 and ca2 ions the indices become positive indicating direct base exchange reaction or chloro alkaline equilibrium on the other hand in the reverse exchange reaction the index value becomes negative attesting to chloro alkaline disequilibrium process the calculated chloro alkaline indices values for 72 of the groundwater samples of the region were negative suggesting indirect base exchange reaction table 2 on the contrary 28 of the samples showed positive chloro alkaline indices values suggesting that they had direct base exchange reaction the ranges of ec values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were cai 1 2 63 0 56 5 14 to 0 47 and 5 41 to 7 40 and cai 2 0 35 0 49 0 35 0 14 0 53 0 08 respectively during base exchange reaction the host rocks act as the primary sources of dissolved solids schoeller s indices cai 1 and cai 2 of the groundwater samples revealed that cation anion exchange i e chloro alkaline equilibrium present only at 7 sites and at 18 sites the values were negative in terms of the base exchange reaction groundwater is classified into two types handa 1979 viz i base exchange softened water where the alkaline earths have been exchanged for na ions hco3 ca2 mg2 and ii base exchange hardened water where the na ions have been exchanged for the alkaline earths ca2 mg2 hco3 in the study region the hco3 ions concentration in the groundwater is relatively higher than that of alkaline earths this indicates the base exchange softened the nature of the groundwater of the area 4 15 kelley s index ki the ki index is same as exchangeable sodium ratio esr proposed by u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 the kelley s index ki value of groundwater greater than one suggests that the water has na in excess of ca and mg therefore the water to be suitable for irrigation should have ki value 1 the ki values in the study region varied from 0 23 to 3 31 and eighteen 72 groundwater samples are considered suitable for irrigation table 2 the ranges of ki values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 0 26 1 41 0 44 1 49 and 0 81 3 31 respectively 4 16 magnesium hazard mh calcium and magnesium remain in an equilibrium state in water however these ions do not exhibit similar behavior in soil sodium dominated highly saline water if rich in magnesium affects the soil structure the exchangeable na in irrigated soils controls the level of mg2 in it high level of mg2 concentration in water makes the soil alkaline which adversely affects the crop yields when the magnesium hazard mh value of water is 50 the crop yield is affected adversely because the soils become more alkaline the mh values of groundwater samples of the region varied from 11 25 to 81 93 out of the 25 groundwater samples 5 samples had mh index values below 50 suggesting their suitability while 20 samples fall in the unsuitable category with mh more than 50 suggesting that this water will have adverse effect on crop yield table 2 the ranges of mh values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 37 29 81 93 42 29 62 24 and 11 25 68 73 respectively 4 17 magnesium calcium ratio mr irrigation water having higher magnesium concentration than calcium is likely to decrease soil productivity the mg ca ratio classifies water it into three categories for the purpose of irrigation safe moderate and unsafe in the study region 13 9 and 3 groundwater samples belong to the safe moderate and unsafe category respectively table 3viii the ranges of mr values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 0 59 4 53 0 73 1 64 and 0 12 2 14 respectively 4 18 controlling mechanisms for groundwater chemistry the data plots disposition on the gibbs diagram fig 4a and b suggests that the chemical composition of the groundwater in the region is affected by dissolution of minerals in rocks by circulating groundwater the groundwater of the region is suitable for irrigation in terms of their ph ec si ci th sar sh na ssp pi and ps table 4 majority of the samples are suitable in terms of rsbc and ki values but unsuitable in terms of rsc values for irrigation while most of the samples are unsuitable for irrigation in terms of mh values the magnesium calcium ratio values suggest that only 50 of the samples are unsuitable the spatial variability in the values of physico chemical parameters of groundwater samples indicates that the groundwater of i chhend colony civil township sector 21 uditnagar and bandamunda are most suitable for irrigation ii koel nagar and shaktinagar area are moderately suitable and iii basanti colony and northwest of jagda jhirpani area are least suitable thus there is ample scope for the use of groundwater for the development of green spaces of rourkela city 5 conclusions green space development is imperative for the maintenance of the microclimatic set up in cities with the decline in quantity and quality of surface water in city areas it is essential to tap the groundwater for the sustenance of green spaces in cities however suitability assessment of the groundwater available at different locales of the city for irrigation purpose is essential single water quality index value is not generally useful for this purpose it is essential to examine different parameters indices values such as ph electrical conductivity total hardness sodium absorption ratio sodium percentage residual soluble carbonate residual sodium bicarbonate permeability index potential salinity magnesium hazard mg ca ratio kelly s ratio indices of base exchange as well as us salinity wilcox 1955 doneen 1964 and gibbs 1970 diagrams to meaningfully conclude that the ground water of a particular region can be suitably used for irrigation of green spaces since the city development takes place with the fringe growth such investigations must be carried out in the urban and its associated rurban and rural setup this approach tested in the rourkela city in india can be used as a model for sustainable urban planning in

12299,for the health of the city dwellers the development of green spaces is imperative sustenance of such green spaces is directly controlled by the water quality steel city rourkela in odisha state of india lying between 84 54 e longitude and 22 12 n latitude has green spaces whose existence depends on the groundwater quality the quality of 25 groundwater samples in the rourkela city was evaluated for examining their suitability for irrigation purpose in order to sustain green spaces in the city the assessment was completed using ph electrical conductivity total hardness sodium absorption ratio na residual soluble carbonate residual sodium bicarbonate permeability index potential salinity magnesium hazard magnesium calcium ratio kelley s ratio and indices of base exchange data plot dispositions on gibb s diagram indicated that the chemistry of groundwater of the area is controlled by rock composition most of the samples with negative chloro alkaline indices values suggested the predominance of chloro alkaline disequilibrium process in the groundwater system data plot disposition on u s salinity hazard diagram indicates that 11 and 14 samples belong to c2s1 and c1s1 illustrating medium salinity low sodium type and low salinity low sodium type respectively there was difference in the groundwater samples from urban rurban and rural setup of the region with respect to some parameters indices the spatial variability of the physico chemical parameters suggests that the groundwater of chhend colony civil township sector 21 uditnagar and bandamunda are most suitable for irrigation in contrast to that of koel nagar shaktinagar basanti colony and northwest part of jagda jhirpani area with the surface water scarcity in the region the groundwater at some sites of the city can be used for maintenance of green spaces graphical abstract image 1 keywords steel city rourkela groundwater green space in city irrigation water quality 1 introduction many

groundwater of the study area belongs to none category and therefore suitable for irrigation purpose 4 3 salinity index si following handa 1969 the groundwater samples of the region were grouped into two categories low excellent quality and medium good quality table 3 i most of the samples 60 belonged to low salinity category suggesting that the groundwater is of excellent quality since the ec values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 228 280 230 277 and 230 303 μs cm respectively each set up contained good to excellent quality waters in terms of salinity level table 3i 4 4 chlorinity index ci low salt tolerance crops are generally very sensitive to chloride all the groundwater samples of the region were found to be suitable class i for irrigation table 3ii the ranges of ci values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 0 56 4 65 0 63 4 65 and 0 63 6 85 meq l respectively 4 5 total hardness th the bicarbonate component of the soil indirectly affects the plant growth using this parameter the groundwater samples of the region were classified into three different categories viz soft moderately hard and hard following the scheme of sawyer and mccarthy 1967 table 3iii the ranges of th values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 63 230 98 141 and 84 106 mg l respectively out of 25 groundwater samples the numbers of hard moderately hard and soft categories were 3 19 and 3 respectively it appears that major portions of the groundwater of the region are only moderately hard and therefore suitable for irrigation purpose 4 6 sodium absorption ratio sar the waters in which sodium deposition is high are not considered suitable for irrigating the soils because sodium when occurring in higher concentrations negatively affects the soil characters particularly the soil permeability is reduced by sodium which in turn inhibits the supply of water to crops high sar values indicate the dominance of sodium over calcium and magnesium considered together and is effectively used to understand the sodium hazard of high carbonate waters it is a suitable index to estimate the alkali hazard in irrigation water and effectively suggests whether a particular water source can be used for irrigation the groundwater samples of the region were classified based on sar values using the scheme proposed by todd 1980 and richards 1954 table 3iv all the groundwater samples collected in this study have sar values less than 10 suggesting that they are grouped into s1 sodium hazard class and are excellent for irrigation purpose the ranges of sar values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 0 44 2 75 1 19 3 44 and 1 88 5 65 respectively thus sar values were generally high for rural samples 4 7 salinity hazard the salinity hazard in irrigation water is determined in terms of electrical conductivity classification of the groundwater samples of the study area based on salinity hazard presented in table 3v indicates that samples are good to excellent on ussl 1954 diagram 11 data plots fall on c2s1 field suggesting that this groundwater are medium salinity low sodium type on the contrary 14 data plots fall on c1s1 indicating that the groundwater of these locations is low salinity low sodium type and is suitable for irrigation of majority of crops and soils where leaching predominates where there is moderate amount of leaching the medium salinity hazard type c2 groundwater can be used for irrigation high conductivity and high sar values for most of the rurban and rural samples place them in c2s1 medium salinity low sodium field fig 2 4 8 percent sodium na methods proposed by richards 1954 and wilcox 1955 were used to classify and understand the basic chemical characteristics of groundwater since its suitability for irrigation depends on the mineralization of water as well as its effects on plants and soil in case of sodium rich irrigation water the clay particles in soil absorb na displacing the mg2 and ca2 ions from the lattice this replacement of ca2 and mg2 in soil by na from water affects the permeability and reduces the internal drainage within the soil therefore air and water circulations are restricted under wet conditions and when dried such soils become hard saleh et al 1999 based on percent sodium levels the groundwater samples of the region are classified into excellent good and permissible categories table 3vi while only two samples are of excellent category 8 samples are good and 15 samples are of permissible category the ranges of na values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 18 38 55 09 28 60 56 69 and 42 27 57 99 respectively thus na is generally high for groundwater of rural setup moreover the data plots disposition on percent sodium vs ec diagram of wilcox 1955 fig 3 a suggests that the groundwater samples are excellent to good in nature and therefore suitable for irrigation 4 9 soluble sodium percentage ssp the soluble sodium percentage ssp values for the groundwater samples of the region range from 23 27 to 95 77 table 2 suggesting that the water quality is excellent to good categories for the purpose of agricultural use the ranges of ssp values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 23 27 74 81 33 62 69 79 and 48 10 95 75 respectively thus the rural waters have high ssp values 4 10 residual sodium carbonate rsc the excess concentration of co3 2 and hco3 in groundwater considered together over the sum of ca 2 and mg 2 also determines the usability of groundwater for irrigation purpose in groundwater with high concentrations of hco3 the ca 2 and mg 2 ions tend to precipitate sodium bicarbonate and carbonate when present in excess affect the physical properties of soils these ions together cause dissolution of organic matter in the soil and result in black stain when the soil surface is dried us department of agriculture has proposed that water with more than 2 50epm of residual sodium carbonate rsc is unsuitable for irrigation in the study region 16 groundwater samples showed rsc values greater than 2 50epm these high rsc values suggest that the concentration of dissolved ca2 and mg2 ions were less compared to co3 2 and hco3 ions thus making the water unsuitable for irrigation the ranges of rsc values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 1 94 to 4 28 2 67 5 10 and 2 64 7 40 epm respectively the study indicates that 64 of the groundwater samples of the regions are unsuitable while 6 samples 24 have good and 3 samples 12 have doubtful status with regard to rsc table 3vii in particular the rurban and rural samples are unsuitable with regard to rsc 4 11 residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc values for the groundwater samples varied from 1 20 to 6 86 meq l table 2 the ranges of rsbc values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 1 20 5 06 3 75 5 90 and 3 93 6 86 meq l respectively the groundwater samples from 7 locations 28 were unsuitable with rsbc values 5 meq l however in 72 of the studied region 18 locations the groundwater was suitable in regard to rsbc 4 12 permeability index pi long term irrigation affects the permeability of the soil due to presence of na ca2 mg2 and hco3 ions in water therefore the permeability index pi values can be effectively used to determine the suitability of groundwater to be used for irrigation purpose because of low level of permeability of the soil the supply of water to crops is reduced and this affects the cropping process through crusting of seedbeds water logging of surface soil and accompanying disease salinity weed oxygen and nutritional problems michael 1997 the pi is used to classify waters into three classes i ii and iii fig 3b the permeability index values of the groundwater samples of the region ranged from 23 61 to 68 25 the ranges of pi values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 23 61 68 25 38 37 43 23 and 35 01 55 39 respectively the data plots fall in classes i and ii of doneen s chart suggesting that the groundwater of the region is good fig 3b 4 13 potential salinity ps the suitability of water for irrigation is independent of the level of soluble salts in it doneen 1962 1964 in successive stages of irrigation the low soluble salts are accumulated in the soil and the presence of highly soluble salts increase the salinity of the soil the potential salinity ps of the groundwater samples of the study region varied from 1 50 to 7 29 table 2 the ranges of ps values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 1 50 7 29 1 90 4 84 and 1 88 3 60 meq l respectively 4 14 ion exchange processes it is crucial to understand the changes taking place in the chemical composition of groundwater during flow johnson 1979 sastri 1994 the chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and cai 2 suggested by schoeller 1965 1967 and 1977 have established that these indices indicate ion exchange between the groundwater and its host environment during residence or travel in the subsurface in case of exchange of na and k ions of water by mg2 and ca2 ions the indices become positive indicating direct base exchange reaction or chloro alkaline equilibrium on the other hand in the reverse exchange reaction the index value becomes negative attesting to chloro alkaline disequilibrium process the calculated chloro alkaline indices values for 72 of the groundwater samples of the region were negative suggesting indirect base exchange reaction table 2 on the contrary 28 of the samples showed positive chloro alkaline indices values suggesting that they had direct base exchange reaction the ranges of ec values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were cai 1 2 63 0 56 5 14 to 0 47 and 5 41 to 7 40 and cai 2 0 35 0 49 0 35 0 14 0 53 0 08 respectively during base exchange reaction the host rocks act as the primary sources of dissolved solids schoeller s indices cai 1 and cai 2 of the groundwater samples revealed that cation anion exchange i e chloro alkaline equilibrium present only at 7 sites and at 18 sites the values were negative in terms of the base exchange reaction groundwater is classified into two types handa 1979 viz i base exchange softened water where the alkaline earths have been exchanged for na ions hco3 ca2 mg2 and ii base exchange hardened water where the na ions have been exchanged for the alkaline earths ca2 mg2 hco3 in the study region the hco3 ions concentration in the groundwater is relatively higher than that of alkaline earths this indicates the base exchange softened the nature of the groundwater of the area 4 15 kelley s index ki the ki index is same as exchangeable sodium ratio esr proposed by u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 the kelley s index ki value of groundwater greater than one suggests that the water has na in excess of ca and mg therefore the water to be suitable for irrigation should have ki value 1 the ki values in the study region varied from 0 23 to 3 31 and eighteen 72 groundwater samples are considered suitable for irrigation table 2 the ranges of ki values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 0 26 1 41 0 44 1 49 and 0 81 3 31 respectively 4 16 magnesium hazard mh calcium and magnesium remain in an equilibrium state in water however these ions do not exhibit similar behavior in soil sodium dominated highly saline water if rich in magnesium affects the soil structure the exchangeable na in irrigated soils controls the level of mg2 in it high level of mg2 concentration in water makes the soil alkaline which adversely affects the crop yields when the magnesium hazard mh value of water is 50 the crop yield is affected adversely because the soils become more alkaline the mh values of groundwater samples of the region varied from 11 25 to 81 93 out of the 25 groundwater samples 5 samples had mh index values below 50 suggesting their suitability while 20 samples fall in the unsuitable category with mh more than 50 suggesting that this water will have adverse effect on crop yield table 2 the ranges of mh values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 37 29 81 93 42 29 62 24 and 11 25 68 73 respectively 4 17 magnesium calcium ratio mr irrigation water having higher magnesium concentration than calcium is likely to decrease soil productivity the mg ca ratio classifies water it into three categories for the purpose of irrigation safe moderate and unsafe in the study region 13 9 and 3 groundwater samples belong to the safe moderate and unsafe category respectively table 3viii the ranges of mr values of water samples from urban rurban and rural setup in the region were 0 59 4 53 0 73 1 64 and 0 12 2 14 respectively 4 18 controlling mechanisms for groundwater chemistry the data plots disposition on the gibbs diagram fig 4a and b suggests that the chemical composition of the groundwater in the region is affected by dissolution of minerals in rocks by circulating groundwater the groundwater of the region is suitable for irrigation in terms of their ph ec si ci th sar sh na ssp pi and ps table 4 majority of the samples are suitable in terms of rsbc and ki values but unsuitable in terms of rsc values for irrigation while most of the samples are unsuitable for irrigation in terms of mh values the magnesium calcium ratio values suggest that only 50 of the samples are unsuitable the spatial variability in the values of physico chemical parameters of groundwater samples indicates that the groundwater of i chhend colony civil township sector 21 uditnagar and bandamunda are most suitable for irrigation ii koel nagar and shaktinagar area are moderately suitable and iii basanti colony and northwest of jagda jhirpani area are least suitable thus there is ample scope for the use of groundwater for the development of green spaces of rourkela city 5 conclusions green space development is imperative for the maintenance of the microclimatic set up in cities with the decline in quantity and quality of surface water in city areas it is essential to tap the groundwater for the sustenance of green spaces in cities however suitability assessment of the groundwater available at different locales of the city for irrigation purpose is essential single water quality index value is not generally useful for this purpose it is essential to examine different parameters indices values such as ph electrical conductivity total hardness sodium absorption ratio sodium percentage residual soluble carbonate residual sodium bicarbonate permeability index potential salinity magnesium hazard mg ca ratio kelly s ratio indices of base exchange as well as us salinity wilcox 1955 doneen 1964 and gibbs 1970 diagrams to meaningfully conclude that the ground water of a particular region can be suitably used for irrigation of green spaces since the city development takes place with the fringe growth such investigations must be carried out in the urban and its associated rurban and rural setup this approach tested in the rourkela city in india can be used as a model for sustainable urban planning in
