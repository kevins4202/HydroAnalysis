15370,an efficient in situ self cleaning catalytic ceramic membrane tailored with mno2 co3o4 nanoparticles mn co cm was fabricated density functional theory calculations result substantiated that molecular ozone could be effectively adsorbed by oxygen vacancies ov on the mn co cm surface and then direct activated into a surface bound atomic oxygen oad and a peroxide o2 ad ultimately producing oh mn co cm coupling with ozone efficiently removed foulants from the permeate and the membrane surface simultaneously and leading to in situ formation of oh that changed the nature of the irreversible foulants and ultimately resulted in the rapid release and degradation of humic acid like substances causing irreversible fouling however the commercial cm with ozone mainly removed cake layer fouling including protein like and fulvic acid like substances followed by the slow release and degradation of irreversible foulant resulting in many humic acid like substances remain on the membrane surface as irreversible fouling based on these the flux growth rate of mn co cm was 3 5 times higher than that of cm with ozone this study provides new insights into the mechanism of in situ

a very effective means of membrane fouling mitigation in water treatment alpatova et al 2013 karnik et al 2005 kim et al 2009 park et al 2012 tang et al 2017 this coupled process was first reported by schlichter et al 2003 and revealed that cm o f was effective in improving water flux and extending backwash cycles wei et al 2016a reported that in situ ozonation accelerates organic degradation within the cm pores and therefore alleviates membrane pore blocking song et al 2017 demonstrated that in situ ozonation effectively mitigated both reversible and irreversible fouling most studies of membrane fouling elimination focus on the effects of varying the molecular weight mw of natural organic matter nom or effluent organic matter efom on membrane fouling zheng et al 2018 but it is not enough to understand the mitigation mechanism of membrane fouling karnik et al 2005 innovatively assembled iron oxide nanoparticles onto cm surfaces to construct a coupled ozone catalytic membrane process thus further enhancing the high reactivity of ozone with foulants and to mitigate fouling it was revealed that the efficient interfacial catalytic reaction develop the rate of flux recovery by reducing the binding force between nom and tio2 based catalytic membrane surface kim et al 2009 park et al 2012 found that iron oxide coated cm with ozone was able to achieve efficient mitigation of membrane fouling mainly attributed to the disruption of the nom structure and the concentration reduction after that more research has focused on the design and development of catalytic membranes with advanced catalytic properties ti mn zhu et al 2013 fe2o3 harman et al 2010 mno2 byun et al 2011 tio2 hu et al 2011 cumn2o4 guo et al 2018 ceo x lee et al 2019 mn ce oxide he et al 2022 and mn feox li et al 2022 have been deposited on the surfaces of cms to improve micropollutants mps degradation in addition to the degradation of mps the effective mitigation of membrane fouling remains one of the key bottlenecks limiting the development of catalytic membranes karnik et al 2007 used salicylic acid sa as a hydroxyl radical probe to highlight the importance of hydroxyl reactions in the ozone membrane filtration process the roles of molecular ozone in direct oxidation and of various radicals in indirect oxidation in in situ mitigation of membrane fouling should be studied in more detail at the molecular level to improve the understanding of the concept of in situ self cleaning of catalytic ozonation membranes this will further inspire the design of advanced catalytic membranes and facilitate the application of catalytic ozonation membrane regenerative water treatment processes herein mno2 co3o4 tailored cm mn co cm was used to study the mechanisms by which membrane fouling is mitigated when this catalytic ozonation membrane used in wastewater reusing process the prerequisite of membrane fouling mitigation by catalytic ozonation membrane is the in situ catalytic reaction at the interface of a catalytic membrane as the in situ formation of free radicals is the driving force for membrane fouling mitigation this driving force was revealed by density functional theoretical dft calculation the interaction between these free radicals and efom on the membrane surface or in the permeate is revealed by fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy synchronous fluorescence sf spectroscopy and mw distribution finally the membrane fouling mitigation behavior was studied by two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos and the mechanism of in situ self cleaning was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the commercial cms uf aiyuqi membrane technology co ltd nanjing china used in this study were tubes outer diameter 30 mm inner diameter 2 mm length 250 mm 19 channels with an α al2o3 substrate and zro2 filtration layer the average pore size of the α al2o3 substrate and zro2 filtration layer were 500 and 50 nm respectively as measured from sem mapping fig s1 al and zr were distributed uniformly on the uncoated cm surface and a 22 68 4 64 μm zro2 filter layer was observed all reagents were analytical grade or higher sinopharm group co ltd beijing china wastewater samples table 1 were collected from the effluent of secondary clarifiers in a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp text s1 located in beijing china 2 2 preparation of mn co cm in situ redox precipitation method synthesized mno2 co3o4 composite powder followed by the procedure established in our previous study guo et al 2016 were used for the fabrication of the reactive cm named as mn co cm that was fabricated according to the same reference 2 3 hybrid catalytic ozonation filtration procedure all cm experiments with or without ozone were conducted in a catalytic membrane reactor fig s2 details of the apparatus and experimental procedures are given in text s2 the permeate flux was measured with an electronic balance ohaus corp usa at certain time intervals the self cleaning performance of the membrane was evaluated from the normalized permeate flux j j 0 where j 0 is the pure water flux prior to fouling and j is the water flux in the presence of organic foulants the flux growth rate f g was obtained for the ozone dosed feed solution in the presence of wwtp effluent sun et al 2018 and calculated as 1 f g j 1 j j 100 where j 1 is the water flux after ozone dosing of the feed solution the water flux recovery ratio after phgysical cleaning fr p or chemical cleaning fr c sun et al 2018 was calculated by eqs 2 and 3 2 f r p j 2 j 0 100 3 f r c j 3 j 0 100 where j 2 is membrane flux during filtration of double deionized ddi water after physical cleaning and j 3 is the membrane flux during filtration of ddi water after chemical cleaning membrane fouling is generally classified into three types physical reversible fouling chemical reversible fouling and chemical irreversible fouling chang et al 2012 the corresponding contribution

calculations the dft simulations have been performed on all structures by using the vienna ab initio simulation vasp package kresse and furthmüller 1996 implemented within the generalized gradient approximation gga and perdew burke ernzerhof pbe function perdew et al 1996 for the calculation of geometries of mno2 co3o4 text s3 provides a detailed description of the dft calculations 2 5 analytical methods the analytical methods for water quality parameters are described in text s4 dissolved ozone concentration in feed tank was determined by the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 gas ozone concentration was determined by using an ozone analyzer anseros ozomat gm germany the efom in permeate samples obtained from cm without ozone cm f cm o f and mn co cm o f was determined by cod uv254 fluorescence eem spectroscopy sf spectroscopy and mw distribution herein the main components of eem spectra were identified by parallel factor analysis parafac text s5 murphy et al 2013 scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi su 70 fesem hitachi high technologies america inc was used to characterize cm mn co cm and fouling layer the role of ozonation and catalytic ozonation in enhancing membrane fouling mitigation was elucidated from sf spectrum in combination with 2d cos zhang et al 2019a organic membrane foulants washed off physically or chemically from the membrane surface were identified by sf spectroscopy detailed analytical information was provided in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 insight into the driving force of membrane fouling mitigation in mn co cm the key to membrane fouling mitigation by catalytic membranes is the continuous generation of reactive oxygen groups ros at the membrane interface as reported by guo et al 2016 and hamid et al 2020 the generation of ros is dependent on the adsorption of molecular ozone by the active sites and the effective decomposition of molecular ozone yuan et al 2020 therefore the catalytic ozonation potential of mn co cm was investigated by dft calculations based on the analysis of xrd patterns fig s4 the most dominant crystal plane 311 of co3o4 and mno2 in the form of amorphous clusters were selected as shown in fig 1 a crystal plane of 311 of co3o4 and mn substituted crystal planes of 311 of co3o4 were constructed by material studio ½ the adsorption energy was calculated to be 1 72 ev for an ozone molecule adjacent to a co3o4 plane fig 1 a and a weak ring shaped adsorption structure of ozone molecule was formed the o1 o2 bond and o2 o3 bond were elongated from 1 29 å to 1 38 and 1 39 å table s1 respectively indicating the activation of the adsorbed ozone molecule wang et al 2020 the adsorption energy was calculated to be 1 68 ev for an ozone molecule adjacent to mn site of mn co nanoparticle mn co mn site fig 1 b yet a more unstable linear adsorption structure of o3 was formed compared with ring shaped adsorption structure this result suggested that it was easier to be decomposed on the surface of mn co mn site than that on the surface of pure co3o4 ma et al 2019b furthermore the coupling of mno2 could enhance the capacity of cobalt site for the molecular ozone adsorption the corresponding adsorption energies of the ozone molecule on cobalt site of mn co nanoparticle mn co co site fig 1 c and inter site of manganese and cobalt mn co inter site fig 1 d were increased to 2 41 and 1 88 ev respectively which further strengthens the catalytic potential of co3o4 more interestingly when an ozone molecule is absorbed by the vacancy oxygen vo of mn co nanoparticle mn co vo site fig 1 e the bond length of o1 o2 bond and o2 o3 bond is substantially elongated from 1 29 å to 3 14 å and 1 36 å table s1 respectively the above variation of the bond length will lead to the direct activation of ozone to form a surface bound atomic oxygen oad and a peroxide o2 ad eqs 8 and 9 through the formation of a weak co o bond with the mn co nanoparticle wang et al 2019 and the adsorption energy of an ozone molecule on mn co vo site was increased to 4 30 ev fig 1 f then the oad on the mn co vo site could be protonated by ambient water to form a oh on the catalyst surface oh eqs 10 and 11 bing et al 2017 this is consistent with our previously reported experimental results guo et al 2016 where the surface hydroxyl groups was suggested as the key reaction sites to catalytic ozone decomposition to form oh by surface chemical groups characterization and oh determination 8 o3 mn co vo mn co vo o3 ad δe 4 3 ev 9 mn co vo o3 ad oad o2 ad δe 0 81 ev 10 oad o2 ad oad o2 free δe 0 97 ev 11 oad ohad ohfree δe 0 25 ev these steps were further substantiated by dft calculation fig 1 f the reactions shown in eqs 8 and 10 are thermodynamically favorable the reaction shown in eq 11 exhibiting a free energy of 0 25 ev is endothermic and is thermodynamically feasible hong et al 2020 however the reaction shown in eq 9 requires an energy supply of 0 81 ev thus this step was considered to be the rate determining step in the generation of oh the active free electrons of mn co vo could compensate for this energy requirement and effectively stimulate further ozone decomposition song et al 2019 a total exothermic energy from the whole reaction process is 4 21 ev suggesting that oh could be easily produced from the interaction between mn co vo site and the molecular ozone therefore dft simulation results indicated that mn co cm with abundance of active sites should theoretically be an ideal catalytic membrane for oh generation and vo is the most promising active centers similarly lee et al 2019 also reported that vo were the active centers for catalytic ozonation in ce mn coated cm to remove foulants furthermore sem mapping images exhibited that mn co nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the cm surface fig 1 g the uniform distribution of manganese and cobalt elements from mn co nanoparticles i e the uniform coverage of active sites provides a nanofluidic platform for ozone adsorption and decomposition to produce oh fig 1 h 3 2 flux improvement induced by interfacial catalytic reaction the pure water flux of cm and mn co cm are 8 5 0 1 l m2 h kpa and 8 3 0 1 l m2 h kpa this suggests that surface coating with mn co nanoparticles did not change the permeability of the membrane the fluxes declined to 20 cm f and 18 mn co cm f of the initial values in the first filtration cycle respectively shown in fig 2 a there was no significant difference between the j j 0 values of cm and mn co cm p value 0 05 this result suggests that the change in cm surface properties due to the coating of mn co nanoparticles does not effectively improve the performance of cm in mitigating membrane fouling without any oxidant adding for an ozonation time of 8 0 min the flux of cm with ozone cm o f t8 was 2 4 greater than that observed with cm f 0 01 p value 0 05 however the longer ozonation times gave better flux improvements such as cm o f t20 and cm o f t40 the final j j 0 values increased to 28 and 35 respectively this indicated that more efom was oxidized by the molecular ozone mn co cm o f gave the best water flux improvement the j j 0 value obtained in mn co cm o f t8 was 1 2 times than that in cm o f t8 0 01 p value 0 05 compared to cm o f t20 the final j j 0 values of mn co cm o f t20 improved by 6 9 when prolonging the reaction time the final j j 0 values of mn co cm o f t40 is further increased by 15 the enhancement between cm o f and mn co cm o f was attributed to the in situ generation of oh from the catalytic reaction at the mn co cm interface eqs 8 11 and this performance can be further improved by extending the ozonation reaction time these reactions achieved the in situ mitigation of membrane fouling eqs 12 and 13 12 mn co cm efom mn co cm efom 13 mn co cm efom oh products the flux growth rates were investigated fig 2 b the results indicated that cm o f t8 showed only a 12 flux growth rate but mn co cm o f t8 showed a marked growth rate almost 3 5 times than that achieved with cm o f t8 when the ozonation time was prolonged the flux growth rates of cm o f t20 and mn co cm o f t20 increased to 43 and 94 respectively mn co cm o f t40 gave the best self cleaning performance with a 99 improvement compared to cm o f t40 3 3 enhanced removal efficiency of efom by catalytic ozonation 3 3 1 cod and uv254 the efficiencies of efom degradation in effluent from a wwtp by cm o f and mn co cm o f were investigated detailed information was shown in fig s5 and text s6 cm o f resulted in a significant decrease in the cod and uv254 of the permeate as compared to that observed with cm f the decrease is most likely due to reactions of the organic matters with ozone which targets aromatic and conjugated bonds mn co cm o f showed the best performance for the reduction of cod and uv254 of efom this further reduction in cod and uv254 values observed with mn co cm o f could be explained by generation of oh eqs 8 13 this study is consistent with that observed by guo et al 2016 where the mn co cm was observed to have good catalytic performance and was structurally stable this stable structure of mn co cm ensures the continuous production of oh and the stable and efficient degradation of efom 3 3 2 eem fluorescence eem spectroscopy provides important information on the reaction activity of efom zhang et al 2019a and mechanisms of membrane fouling mitigation zhao et al 2020 as shown in fig 3 the spectrum of efom mainly consisted of four significant fluorescence peaks including fulvic acid like substances c1 ex em of 240 400 nm fig 3 a hydrophobic humic acids like substances c2 ex em of 352 425 nm fig 3 b terrestrial humic like substances c3 ex em of 250 450 nm fig 3 c and protein like substances c4 ex em of 280 350 nm fig 3 d wen et al 2003 zhang et al 2021 cm f removed the c1 c2 c3 and c4 effluent components by 6 81 9 94 23 8 and 6 08 respectively the order of the removal performances of the fluorescent fractions was c3 c2 c1 c4 i e humic like substances was the most intercepted therefore humic like substances might be the main foulants fig 3 e h use of cm o f t8 showed improved removal efficiency of all four fluorescent components with 83 8 removal of c1 74 9 removal of c2 74 4 removal of c3 and 87 3 removal of c4 this improved removal efficiency indicated the decomposition of condensed aromatic structures and an increased number of electron withdrawing groups such as cooh in the aromatic compounds yu et al 2005 this degradation and chemical structural change of efom in cm o f is an important reason for the membrane flux improvement fig 2 it is worth noting that cm o f was more favorable for the removal of fulvic acid like and protein like substances with a 80 increase in performance but limited improvement 50 in the removal of humic acid like substances the main foulants humic acid like substances were not preferentially and efficiently removed by cm o f therefore cm o f showed limited flux development fig 2 removal of the four components improved with increasing ozonation reaction time with cm o f while the improvement in the removal efficiency of humic acid like substances was still least obviously this indicated that the effect of prolonged reaction time on fouling mitigation is limited in cm o f the efom reduction efficiency with mn co cm o f was higher than that with cm o f in the same ozonation reaction time for example the removal efficiencies of c1 c2 c3 and c4 increased to 95 5 91 8 95 8 and 97 0 respectively for mn co cm o f t8 being different with cm o f humic acid like substances being most likely to foul membrane were also efficiently removed in mn co cm o f therefore the components of efom that tend to form membrane fouling during cm f were more effectively removed by mn co cm o f previous research has proved that the reaction between oh and efom is non selective and occurs through electron transfer hydrogen abstraction or electrophilic addition chen et al 2017 the enhanced removal of efom with mn co cm o f especially for humic acid like substances is attributed to superior in situ catalytic activity this might be the important evidence for mn co cm o f showed best membrane fouling elimination 3 3 3 mw distribution the apparent mw distributions of raw water and permeate were investigated fig s9 raw water contains low mw substances mw 1000 da middle mw substances 1000 da mw 10 000 da and high mw substances mw 10 000 da respectively cm f was just able to effectively reject the high mw substances and secondly part of middle mw substances could be removed by cm f for mw 2000 da substances the rejection performance was very not obvious fig s9 as illustrated in fig s9 a cm o f t8 could also achieve the completely removal of high mw substances and cm o f t8 could further enhance the removal of some middle mw substances whereas the peaks intensity of some middle mw substances was significantly increased with the increase of ozonation time i e cm o f t20 middle mw substances was further reduced compared with cm o f t8 whereas the peaks intensity of some middle mw substances was still increased the increase intensity of these middle mw substances was due to the generation of molecules of lower mw by the decomposition of high mw substances the increase of these substances inevitably impedes the mitigation of membrane fouling only when the ozonation time was extended to 40 min i e cm o f t40 all mw membrane foulants were effectively removed which led to a further improvement in membrane flux fig 2 a similar phenomenon has been reported by cheng et al 2018 who found that uv pms treatment only slightly alleviate flux decline and this slight improvement in flux was mainly attributable to the structural changes of efom high mw substances were converted into lower molecules rather than to efficient removal of foulants mn co cm o f could also achieve the completely removal of high mw substances fig s9 b being different with cm o f mn co cm o f t8 directly reduces the peak intensity of all efom fractions obtained from permeate and exhibited a higher removal performance removal efficiencies of these substances further were improved by the increasing ozonation reaction time with mn co cm o f which was more conducive to the mitigation of membrane fouling fig 2 previous studies also reported that lower mw substances may cause more severe membrane fouling which would easily clog membrane pores and form irreversible fouling tang et al 2017 therefore the efficient removal of efom fractions obtained from permeate were further evidence for the membrane fouling mitigated by mn co cm o f 3 4 discussion of the three dimensional membrane fouling structure the membrane fouling layer formed in cm f was an uneven and dense structure with many large scale sediments yellow circles fig 4 a consisting mainly of organic matters and particulate deposition after further magnification the original membrane surface and the uniformly distributed pores were still not observed fig 4 b cross sectional sem images showed that the thickness of the foulants layer was 38 96 5 05 μm fig 4 c and a large amount of membrane foulants blocked in the membrane channels fig 4 d these results further explained the decrease in flux during cm f i e increased fouling resistance 2 2 1012 m 1 the membrane fouling layer formed in cm o f was a uniform and smooth structure with many small scale sediments yellow circles fig 4 e this consists mainly of organic matters and particulate deposition similar to cm f fig 4 b the original membrane surface and pore channels still cannot be observed after further magnification fig 4 f cross sectional sem images showed that the thickness of the foulants layer decreased to 18 52 1 70 μm fig 4 g in cm o f and small amounts of membrane foulants were observed to be blocked in the membrane channels fig 4 h decrease of foulants layer thickness reduces the fouling resistance 1 2 1012 m 1 in cm o f ma et al 2019a as a result cm o f was effective on improving flux in mn co cm o f an incomplete membrane fouling layer was observed with only a few small sized foulants randomly distributed on the membrane surface fig 4 i indeed in depth analysis of fig 4 j revealed that there are many regions indicated by circles where the underlying pore and original membrane were still visible cross sectional sem images also showed a complete cake layer was not formed fig 4 k and no residual foulants were found in the membrane channels fig 4 l the corresponding fouling resistance is further reduced to 0 87 1012 m 1 in summary mn co cm o f not only effectively removed membrane foulants from the permeate fig 3 but also removed foulants on the membrane surface table s2 the mn co cm o f surface did not form a complete layer of membrane fouling with many membrane pores still exposed on the surface and very clean inside the channels this effectively reduces the fouling resistance from 2 2 1012 m 1 of cm f to 0 87 1012 m 1 of mn co cm o f table s2 and allows j j 0 to increase from 20 of cm f to around 50 of mn co cm o f fig 2 cm o f only achieved efficient removal of foulants from the permeate fig 3 but a large amount of non negligible membrane foulants also remained on the membrane surface 18 52 1 70 μm thick layer of fouling shown in table s2 the corresponding membrane fouling resistance is 1 2 1012 m 1 table s2 therefore mn co cm o f exhibited a more outstanding ability to mitigate membrane fouling than cm o f fig 2 3 5 discussion on membrane fouling reversibility and foulants identification the water flux recovery of efom fouled membrane was determined after either physical or chemical cleaning fig 5 a detailed descriptions were shown in text s7 cm o f enhanced the water flux recovery after physical chemical cleaning which was depended on the reaction time this result suggested that foulants adhering to the membrane surface or clogged in the membrane pores were effectively removed by the oxidant including the ozone molecule and hydroxyl radical which will improve the flux recovery during physical or chemical cleaning sun et al 2018a as expected this effect was greater in mn co cm o f that developed the highest flux growth rate fig 2 b the fouling reversibility results were shown in fig 5 b detailed descriptions were shown in text s8 results showed chemical irreversible fouling played a dominant role in cm f fouling by efom cm o f dramatically decreased the proportion of irreversible fouling which was improved by the increase of ozonation reaction time the irreversible foulants attached to membrane pores or surfaces in mn co cm o f were removed more effectively by in situ formation of oh resulting in a further decline in the proportion of irreversible fouling from 48 75 in cm f to 20 2 in mn co cm o f t8 the lowest chemical irreversible fouling was therefore observed in mn co cm o f t40 and resulted in the highest flux improvement fig 2 a cheng et al 2017 showed that reducing chemical irreversible fouling clearly alleviated flux decline in mno2 cm o f as observed in this study the mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation could be further understood by identifying the reversible and irreversible foulants fig 5 c in cm f the physical reversible foulants included protein like 60 25 fulvic acid like 22 52 and humic acid like substances 17 22 chemical reversible foulants included protein like 71 43 and fulvic acid like substances 28 57 and chemical irreversible foulants included protein like 7 63 fulvic acid like 17 53 and humic acid like substances 74 84 it was concluded that protein like substances were the main component of reversible membrane fouling and that it piled up on the cm surface to form a cake layer humic acid like substances were the main component of irreversible membrane fouling and that it remained inside the membrane pores and caused standard blocking chang et al 2017 these conclusions are consistent with the results reported by song et al 2020 and zhao et al 2020 who reported that protein like substances were the main reversible membrane foulants zhao et al 2020 reported that a cm suffered mainly irreversible membrane fouling during filtration of humic acid like substances in physical reversible foulants of cm o f t8 the contribution ratios of protein like and fulvic acid like substances increased to 63 79 and 26 85 respectively whereas that of humic acid like substances decreased to 9 36 it was reported that fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances were more preferentially reacted with the ozone molecule than protein like substances chen et al 2017 the increase in the proportion of fulvic acid like substances in physical reversible foulants indicated that the change in nature of the fulvic acid like substances causing irreversible fouling resulting in adhesion between irreversible foulants such as fulvic acid like substances and the cm surface pores was destroyed by in situ ozonation ultimately allowing the fulvic acid like substances causing the irreversible fouling to be transformed into substances causing the reversible fouling i e the release of irreversible fouling chemical reversible foulants involved protein like 66 85 fulvic acid like 27 23 and humic acid like substances 5 91 appearing as a new component these results further indicated that the adhesion between irreversible fouling components such as humic acid like substances and the cm pores surfaces was destroyed by ozonation this is an important reason for flux improvement fig 2 when the reaction time was prolonged to 20 min cm o f t20 the components involved in physical reversible foulants changed to protein like 73 13 and fulvic acid like substances 26 87 those in chemical reversible foulants also changed to protein like 68 04 and fulvic acid like substances 31 96 no humic acid like substances were observed in physical or chemical reversible foulants when the reaction time was prolonged to 40 min the protein like substances content further increased to 91 55 and 83 in physical and chemical reversible foulants respectively the corresponding fulvic acid like substances contents decreased to 8 45 and 16 99 still no humic acid like substances were observed the release rate of humic acid like substances in chemical irreversible foulants was therefore much lower than the humic acid like substances degradation rate by ozonation it is therefore speculated that ozonation mainly removed the reversible foulants because the ozone molecules were first exposed to the cake layer song et al 2017 also reported that fouling mitigation by cm o f could be ascribed to the alleviation of cake layer fouling as shown by model fitting in addition the release of irreversible foulants was observed in cm o f but this performance is not significant due to the steric hinderance and competing reactions of the molecular ozone resulting in that many humic acid like substances remain on the membrane surface as irreversible foulants and lower the water flux in mn co cm o f t8 the ratios of protein like substances in physical and chemical reversible foulants decreased to 59 58 and 56 81 respectively this might be due to higher reactivity between protein like substances and the oh formed from interfacial catalytic ozonation phong and hur 2016 cake layer fouling was therefore significantly alleviated by mn co cm o f more importantly more humic acid like substances appeared in foulant of physical and chemical reversible compared with the result of cm o f t8 this interesting result indicated that destruction of the adhesion between irreversible foulants such as humic acid like substances and the cm pores surfaces was enhanced by interfacial catalytic ozonation because more of the oh produced in situ on the mn co cm pores surfaces could effectively degrade humic acid like substances the main component of irreversible membrane foulant in chemical irreversible foulants the irreversible fouling ratio in mn co cm o f therefore decreased more noticeably than that observed in cm o f fig 5 b this led to the highest flux improvement fig 2 when the reaction time increased to 20 min mn co cm o f t20 protein like 73 92 fulvic acid like 17 28 and humic acid like substances 8 8 were observed in physical reversible foulants this changed to protein like 75 19 fulvic acid like 22 4 and humic acid like substances 2 39 in chemical reversible foulants these variations in the components in physical and chemical reversible foulants indicated that fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances in the cake layer were removed more quickly than protein like substances cake layer fouling was mitigated in mn co cm o f t20 being different with cm o f t20 there was still new irreversible fouling components humic acid like substances released into the reversible fouling in mn co cm o f t20 since humic acid like substances was still observed in physical and chemical reversible fouling when the reaction time was increased to 40 min mn co cm o f t40 the amounts of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances involved in physical and chemical reversible foulants continued to decline but humic acid like substances was still involved in both physical and chemical reversible foulants these results showed that the release rate of humic acid like substances from the chemical irreversible foulants was higher than the degradation rate of humic acid like substances by interfacial catalytic ozonation chemical irreversible fouling therefore further declined in mn co cm o f fig 5 b due to that the humic acid like substances degradation rate by interfacial catalytic ozonation was much higher than that by ozonation fig 3 the humic acid like substances release rate in irreversible fouling by mn co cm o f was much higher than that by cm o f therefore mn co cm o f exhibited a lower proportion of irreversible fouling compared to cm o f fig 5 b yu et al 2016 reported that a combination of mno2 cm and ozone prevented membrane fouling due to the degradation of nom by oh however the release of humic acid like substances from irreversible fouling to reversible fouling is also crucial and was not discussed in detailed in interface aops on the surface of catalytic membrane zhao et al 2020 used extended xdlvo analysis to show that the total attractive interaction energy between oxidized humic acid like substances and cm in cufe2o4 cm decreased this is consistent with the results of this study 3 6 2d cos analysis on the mitigation behaviors of membrane fouling to further understand the mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation a set of process resolved 2d cos of sf spectrum fig s10 were shown in fig 6 cm o f could enhance the removal of efom based on synchronous map but the enhanced degree of removal efficiency of humic acid like substances was the weakest text s9 asynchronous spectrum exhibited that ozonation in cm o f preferentially enhances the removal efficiency of humic acid like firstly and then removed fulvic acid like and finally protein like substances because the molecular ozone reacts selectively with aromatic compounds e g humic acid like substances zhang et al 2019a jin et al 2012 also reported that humic acid like were more sensitive than protein like substances to ozonation therefore the enhanced removal of humic acid like by cm o f is theoretically more effective than the enhanced removal of protein like substances however based on the synchronous map cm o f showed a higher enhanced removal efficiency on protein like than humic acid like substances this contradictory phenomenon again suggested that the molecular ozone was first exposed to cake layer fouling where protein like and fulvic acid like substances as the main component of cake layer fouling fig 5 c consumed oxidant firstly fig 6 c which results in a better enhanced removal efficiency of protein like and fulvic acid like substances afterwards the humic acid like substances main component of irreversible fouling attached to the membrane surface or pores could be further attacked by the molecular ozone fig 6 c the irreversible foulant was eventually slowly released and then degraded shown in section 3 5 being better than cm o f mn co cm o f could further enhance the removal of efom based on synchronous map fig 6 d and the asynchronous spectrum showed that mn co cm o f preferentially enhances the removal of humic like substances firstly then fulvic like substances protein like substances finally fig 6 e this phenomenon again suggested that humic like substances that attached the membrane surface or pores were preferentially strength removed by catalytic ozonation in mn co cm o f as the in situ formation of oh at the membrane interface was first consumed by these humic like substances fig 6 f which leads to a fast release of irreversible foulants section 3 5 meanwhile all membrane foulants were further degraded rapidly by generated oh and molecular ozone fig 6 f resulting in only a small amount of foulants remaining on the membrane surface section 3 4 this is also the main reason for the lowest proportion of irreversible fouling in mn co cm o f fig 5 b overall both cm o f and mn co cm o f are preferentially enhancing the removal of irreversible foulants humic acid like substances but the mitigated mechanism of membrane fouling is quite different in cm o f the molecular ozone attacks the cake layer fouling firstly followed by the slow releasing and degradation of irreversible foulant as an outward to inward membrane fouling mitigation mechanism in mn co cm o f the in situ formation of oh enables rapid release and degradation of irreversible foulant meanwhile foulants on the membrane surface are efficiently degraded as an inside out mechanism to mitigate membrane fouling 4 conclusion taken together this study clearly shows a new insight into the mitigation mechanisms of membrane fouling by interface catalytic ozonation in mn co cm o f firstly dft calculations results demonstrated that mn co cm with abundance of vo as promising active sites that was formed due to the coupling of mno2 co3o4 is an ideal catalytic ozonation membrane for oh generation this is the driving force of membrane fouling mitigation which is also an important development on catalytic ozonation and its derived catalytic membrane technology secondly cm o f removed foulants from the permeate but also leave over some middle mw substances to affect the permeate flux in addition cm o f mainly removed cake layer fouling including protein like and fulvic acid like substances however due to the steric hinderance and competing reactions of molecular ozone many foulants e g humic acid like substances remain adhered to the membrane surface 18 52 1 70 μm thick layer of fouling causing a 1 2 1012 m 1 resistance to membrane fouling thirdly as an important development mn co cm o f achieved more efficient and rapid removal of foulants from permeate and membrane surface the nature of the irreversible foulant caused by humic acid like substances is altered by generated oh and adsorbed molecular ozone then preferentially it was released and rapidly removed in mn co cm o f reversible foulant protein like and fulvic acid like substances is also rapidly degraded based on these the fouling resistance reduced from 2 2 1012 m 1 in cm f to 0 87 1012 m 1 the flux growth rate of mn co cm o f is 3 5 times higher than that of cm o f as a promoting novel enhanced water purification technology declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15370,an efficient in situ self cleaning catalytic ceramic membrane tailored with mno2 co3o4 nanoparticles mn co cm was fabricated density functional theory calculations result substantiated that molecular ozone could be effectively adsorbed by oxygen vacancies ov on the mn co cm surface and then direct activated into a surface bound atomic oxygen oad and a peroxide o2 ad ultimately producing oh mn co cm coupling with ozone efficiently removed foulants from the permeate and the membrane surface simultaneously and leading to in situ formation of oh that changed the nature of the irreversible foulants and ultimately resulted in the rapid release and degradation of humic acid like substances causing irreversible fouling however the commercial cm with ozone mainly removed cake layer fouling including protein like and fulvic acid like substances followed by the slow release and degradation of irreversible foulant resulting in many humic acid like substances remain on the membrane surface as irreversible fouling based on these the flux growth rate of mn co cm was 3 5 times higher than that of cm with ozone this study provides new insights into the mechanism of in situ

a very effective means of membrane fouling mitigation in water treatment alpatova et al 2013 karnik et al 2005 kim et al 2009 park et al 2012 tang et al 2017 this coupled process was first reported by schlichter et al 2003 and revealed that cm o f was effective in improving water flux and extending backwash cycles wei et al 2016a reported that in situ ozonation accelerates organic degradation within the cm pores and therefore alleviates membrane pore blocking song et al 2017 demonstrated that in situ ozonation effectively mitigated both reversible and irreversible fouling most studies of membrane fouling elimination focus on the effects of varying the molecular weight mw of natural organic matter nom or effluent organic matter efom on membrane fouling zheng et al 2018 but it is not enough to understand the mitigation mechanism of membrane fouling karnik et al 2005 innovatively assembled iron oxide nanoparticles onto cm surfaces to construct a coupled ozone catalytic membrane process thus further enhancing the high reactivity of ozone with foulants and to mitigate fouling it was revealed that the efficient interfacial catalytic reaction develop the rate of flux recovery by reducing the binding force between nom and tio2 based catalytic membrane surface kim et al 2009 park et al 2012 found that iron oxide coated cm with ozone was able to achieve efficient mitigation of membrane fouling mainly attributed to the disruption of the nom structure and the concentration reduction after that more research has focused on the design and development of catalytic membranes with advanced catalytic properties ti mn zhu et al 2013 fe2o3 harman et al 2010 mno2 byun et al 2011 tio2 hu et al 2011 cumn2o4 guo et al 2018 ceo x lee et al 2019 mn ce oxide he et al 2022 and mn feox li et al 2022 have been deposited on the surfaces of cms to improve micropollutants mps degradation in addition to the degradation of mps the effective mitigation of membrane fouling remains one of the key bottlenecks limiting the development of catalytic membranes karnik et al 2007 used salicylic acid sa as a hydroxyl radical probe to highlight the importance of hydroxyl reactions in the ozone membrane filtration process the roles of molecular ozone in direct oxidation and of various radicals in indirect oxidation in in situ mitigation of membrane fouling should be studied in more detail at the molecular level to improve the understanding of the concept of in situ self cleaning of catalytic ozonation membranes this will further inspire the design of advanced catalytic membranes and facilitate the application of catalytic ozonation membrane regenerative water treatment processes herein mno2 co3o4 tailored cm mn co cm was used to study the mechanisms by which membrane fouling is mitigated when this catalytic ozonation membrane used in wastewater reusing process the prerequisite of membrane fouling mitigation by catalytic ozonation membrane is the in situ catalytic reaction at the interface of a catalytic membrane as the in situ formation of free radicals is the driving force for membrane fouling mitigation this driving force was revealed by density functional theoretical dft calculation the interaction between these free radicals and efom on the membrane surface or in the permeate is revealed by fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy synchronous fluorescence sf spectroscopy and mw distribution finally the membrane fouling mitigation behavior was studied by two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos and the mechanism of in situ self cleaning was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the commercial cms uf aiyuqi membrane technology co ltd nanjing china used in this study were tubes outer diameter 30 mm inner diameter 2 mm

sem mapping fig s1 al and zr were distributed uniformly on the uncoated cm surface and a 22 68 4 64 μm zro2 filter layer was observed all reagents were analytical grade or higher sinopharm group co

mn co cm in situ redox precipitation method synthesized mno2 co3o4 composite powder followed by the procedure established in our previous study guo et al 2016 were used for the fabrication of the reactive cm named as mn co cm that was fabricated according to the same reference 2 3 hybrid catalytic ozonation filtration procedure all cm experiments with or without ozone were conducted in a catalytic membrane reactor fig s2 details of the apparatus and experimental procedures are given in text s2 the permeate flux was measured with an electronic balance ohaus corp usa at certain time intervals the self cleaning performance of the membrane was evaluated from the normalized permeate flux j j 0 where j 0 is the pure water flux prior to fouling and j is the water flux in the presence of organic foulants the flux growth rate f g was obtained for the ozone dosed feed solution in the presence of wwtp effluent sun et al 2018 and calculated as 1 f g j 1 j j 100 where j 1 is the water flux after ozone dosing of the feed solution the water flux recovery ratio after phgysical cleaning fr p or chemical cleaning fr c sun et al 2018 was calculated by eqs 2 and 3 2 f r p j 2 j 0 100 3 f

analytical methods the analytical methods for water quality parameters are described in text s4 dissolved ozone concentration in feed tank was determined by the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 gas ozone concentration was determined by using an ozone analyzer anseros ozomat gm germany the efom in permeate samples obtained from cm without ozone cm f cm o f and mn co cm o f was determined by cod uv254 fluorescence eem spectroscopy sf spectroscopy and mw distribution herein the main components of eem spectra were identified by parallel factor analysis parafac text s5 murphy et al 2013 scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi su 70 fesem hitachi high technologies america inc was used to characterize cm mn co cm and fouling layer the role of ozonation and catalytic ozonation in enhancing membrane fouling mitigation was elucidated from sf spectrum in combination with 2d cos zhang et al 2019a organic membrane foulants washed off physically or chemically from the membrane surface were identified by sf spectroscopy detailed analytical information was provided in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 insight into the driving force of membrane fouling mitigation in mn co cm the key to membrane fouling mitigation by catalytic membranes is the continuous generation of reactive oxygen groups ros at the membrane interface as reported by guo et al 2016 and hamid et al 2020 the generation of ros is dependent on the adsorption of molecular ozone by the active sites and the effective decomposition of molecular ozone yuan et al 2020 therefore the catalytic ozonation potential of mn co cm was investigated by dft calculations based on the analysis of xrd patterns fig s4 the most dominant crystal plane 311 of co3o4 and mno2 in the form of amorphous clusters were selected as shown in fig 1 a crystal plane of 311 of co3o4 and mn substituted crystal planes of 311 of co3o4 were constructed by material studio ½ the adsorption energy was calculated to be 1 72 ev for an ozone molecule adjacent to a co3o4 plane fig 1 a and a weak ring shaped adsorption structure of ozone molecule was formed the o1 o2 bond and o2 o3 bond were elongated from 1 29 å to 1 38 and 1 39 å table s1 respectively indicating the activation of the adsorbed ozone molecule wang et al 2020 the adsorption energy was calculated to be 1 68 ev for an ozone molecule adjacent to mn site of mn co nanoparticle mn co mn site fig 1 b yet a more unstable linear adsorption structure of o3 was formed compared with ring shaped adsorption structure this result suggested that it was easier to be decomposed on the surface of mn co mn site than that on the surface of pure co3o4 ma et al 2019b furthermore the coupling of mno2 could enhance the capacity of cobalt site for the molecular ozone adsorption the corresponding adsorption energies of the ozone molecule on cobalt site of mn co nanoparticle mn co co site fig 1 c and inter site of manganese and cobalt mn co inter site fig 1 d were increased to 2 41 and 1 88 ev respectively which further strengthens the catalytic potential of co3o4 more interestingly when an ozone molecule is absorbed by the vacancy oxygen vo of mn co nanoparticle mn co vo site fig 1 e the bond length of o1 o2 bond and o2 o3 bond is substantially elongated from 1 29 å to 3 14 å and 1 36 å table s1 respectively the above variation of the bond length will lead to the direct activation of ozone to form a surface bound atomic oxygen oad and a peroxide o2 ad eqs 8 and 9 through the formation of a weak co o bond with the mn co nanoparticle wang et al 2019 and the adsorption energy of an ozone molecule on mn co vo site was increased to 4 30 ev fig 1 f then the oad on the mn co vo site could be protonated by ambient water to form a oh on the catalyst surface oh eqs 10 and 11 bing et al 2017 this is consistent with our previously reported experimental results guo et al 2016 where the surface hydroxyl groups was suggested as the key reaction sites to catalytic ozone decomposition to form oh by surface chemical groups characterization and oh determination 8 o3 mn co vo mn co vo o3 ad δe 4 3 ev 9 mn co vo o3 ad oad o2 ad δe 0 81 ev 10 oad o2 ad oad o2 free δe 0 97 ev 11 oad ohad ohfree δe 0 25 ev these steps were further substantiated by dft calculation fig 1 f the reactions shown in eqs 8 and 10 are thermodynamically favorable the reaction shown in eq 11 exhibiting a free energy of 0 25 ev is endothermic and is thermodynamically feasible hong et al 2020 however the reaction shown in eq 9 requires an energy supply of 0 81 ev thus this step was considered to be the rate determining step in the generation of oh the active free electrons of mn co vo could compensate for this energy requirement and effectively stimulate further ozone decomposition song et al 2019 a total exothermic energy from the whole reaction process is 4 21 ev suggesting that oh could be easily produced from the interaction between mn co vo site and the molecular ozone therefore dft simulation results indicated that mn co cm with abundance of active sites should theoretically be an ideal catalytic membrane for oh generation and vo is the most promising active centers similarly lee et al 2019 also reported that vo were the active centers for catalytic ozonation in ce mn coated cm to remove foulants furthermore sem mapping images exhibited that mn co nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the cm surface fig 1 g the uniform distribution of manganese and cobalt elements from mn co nanoparticles i e the uniform coverage of active sites provides a nanofluidic platform for ozone adsorption and decomposition to produce oh fig 1 h 3 2 flux improvement induced by interfacial catalytic reaction the pure water flux of cm and mn co cm are 8 5 0 1 l m2 h kpa and 8 3 0 1 l m2 h kpa this suggests that surface coating with mn co nanoparticles did not change the permeability of the membrane the fluxes declined to 20 cm f and 18 mn co cm f of the initial values in the first filtration cycle respectively shown in fig 2 a there was no significant difference between the j j 0 values of cm and mn co cm p value 0 05 this result suggests that the change in cm surface properties due to the coating of mn co nanoparticles does not effectively improve the performance of cm in mitigating membrane fouling without any oxidant adding for an ozonation time of 8 0 min the flux of cm with ozone cm o f t8 was 2 4 greater than that observed with cm f 0 01 p value 0 05 however the longer ozonation times gave better flux improvements such as cm o f t20 and cm o f t40 the final j j 0 values increased to 28 and 35 respectively this indicated that more efom was oxidized by the molecular ozone mn co cm o f gave the best water flux improvement the j j 0 value obtained in mn co cm o f t8 was 1 2 times than that in cm o f t8 0 01 p value 0 05 compared to cm o f t20 the final j j 0 values of mn co cm o f t20 improved by 6 9 when prolonging the reaction time the final j j 0 values of mn co cm o f t40 is further increased by 15 the enhancement between cm o f and mn co cm o f was attributed to the in situ generation of oh from the catalytic reaction at the mn co cm interface eqs 8 11 and this performance can be further improved by extending the ozonation reaction time these reactions achieved the in situ mitigation of membrane fouling eqs 12 and 13 12 mn co cm efom mn co cm efom 13 mn co cm efom oh products the flux growth rates were investigated fig 2 b the results indicated that cm o f t8 showed only a 12 flux growth rate but mn co cm o f t8 showed a marked growth rate almost 3 5 times than that achieved with cm o f t8 when the ozonation time was prolonged the flux growth rates of cm o f t20 and mn co cm o f t20 increased to 43 and 94 respectively mn co cm o f t40 gave the best self cleaning performance with a 99 improvement compared to cm o f t40 3 3 enhanced removal efficiency of efom by catalytic ozonation 3 3 1 cod and uv254 the efficiencies of efom degradation in effluent from a wwtp by cm o f and mn co cm o f were investigated detailed information was shown in fig s5 and text s6 cm o f resulted in a significant decrease in the cod and uv254 of the permeate as compared to that observed with cm f the decrease is most likely due to reactions of the organic matters with ozone which targets aromatic and conjugated bonds mn co cm o f showed the best performance for the reduction of cod and uv254 of efom this further reduction in cod and uv254 values observed with mn co cm o f could be explained by generation of oh eqs 8 13 this study is consistent with that observed by guo et al 2016 where the mn co cm was observed to have good catalytic performance and was structurally stable this stable structure of mn co cm ensures the continuous production of oh and the stable and efficient degradation of efom 3 3 2 eem fluorescence eem spectroscopy provides important information on the reaction activity of efom zhang et al 2019a and mechanisms of membrane fouling mitigation zhao et al 2020 as shown in fig 3 the spectrum of efom mainly consisted of four significant fluorescence peaks including fulvic acid like substances c1 ex em of 240 400 nm fig 3 a hydrophobic humic acids like substances c2 ex em of 352 425 nm fig 3 b terrestrial humic like substances c3 ex em of 250 450 nm fig 3 c and protein like substances c4 ex em of 280 350 nm fig 3 d wen et al 2003 zhang et al 2021 cm f removed the c1 c2 c3 and c4 effluent components by 6 81 9 94 23 8 and 6 08 respectively the order of the removal performances of the fluorescent fractions was c3 c2 c1 c4 i e humic like substances was the most intercepted therefore humic like substances might be the main foulants fig 3 e h use of cm o f t8 showed improved removal efficiency of all four fluorescent components with 83 8 removal of c1 74 9 removal of c2 74 4 removal of c3 and 87 3 removal of c4 this improved removal efficiency indicated the decomposition of condensed aromatic structures and an increased number of electron withdrawing groups such as cooh in the aromatic compounds yu et al 2005 this degradation and chemical structural change of efom in cm o f is an important reason for the membrane flux improvement fig 2 it is worth noting that cm o f was more favorable for the removal of fulvic acid like and protein like substances with a 80 increase in performance but limited improvement 50 in the removal of humic acid like substances the main foulants humic acid like substances were not preferentially and efficiently removed by cm o f therefore cm o f showed limited flux development fig 2 removal of the four components improved with increasing ozonation reaction time with cm o f while the improvement in the removal efficiency of humic acid like substances was still least obviously this indicated that the effect of prolonged reaction time on fouling mitigation is limited in cm o f the efom reduction efficiency with mn co cm o f was higher than that with cm o f in the same ozonation reaction time for example the removal efficiencies of c1 c2 c3 and c4 increased to 95 5 91 8 95 8 and 97 0 respectively for mn co cm o f t8 being different with cm o f humic acid like substances being most likely to foul membrane were also efficiently removed in mn co cm o f therefore the components of efom that tend to form membrane fouling during cm f were more effectively removed by mn co cm o f previous research has proved that the reaction between oh and efom is non selective and occurs through electron transfer hydrogen abstraction or electrophilic addition chen et al 2017 the enhanced removal of efom with mn co cm o f especially for humic acid like substances is attributed to superior in situ catalytic activity this might be the important evidence for mn co cm o f showed best membrane fouling elimination 3 3 3 mw distribution the apparent mw distributions of raw water and permeate were investigated fig s9 raw water contains low mw substances mw 1000 da middle mw substances 1000 da mw 10 000 da and high mw substances mw 10 000 da respectively cm f was just able to effectively reject the high mw substances and secondly part of middle mw substances could be removed by cm f for mw 2000 da substances the rejection performance was very not obvious fig s9 as illustrated in fig s9 a cm o f t8 could also achieve the completely removal of high mw substances and cm o f t8 could further enhance the removal of some middle mw substances whereas the peaks intensity of some middle mw substances was significantly increased with the increase of ozonation time i e cm o f t20 middle mw substances was further reduced compared with cm o f t8 whereas the peaks intensity of some middle mw substances was still increased the increase intensity of these middle mw substances was due to the generation of molecules of lower mw by the decomposition of high mw substances the increase of these substances inevitably impedes the mitigation of membrane fouling only when the ozonation time was extended to 40 min i e cm o f t40 all mw membrane foulants were effectively removed which led to a further improvement in membrane flux fig 2 a similar phenomenon has been reported by cheng et al 2018 who found that uv pms treatment only slightly alleviate flux decline and this slight improvement in flux was mainly attributable to the structural changes of efom high mw substances were converted into lower molecules rather than to efficient removal of foulants mn co cm o f could also achieve the completely removal of high mw substances fig s9 b being different with cm o f mn co cm o f t8 directly reduces the peak intensity of all efom fractions obtained from permeate and exhibited a higher removal performance removal efficiencies of these substances further were improved by the increasing ozonation reaction time with mn co cm o f which was more conducive to the mitigation of membrane fouling fig 2 previous studies also reported that lower mw substances may cause more severe membrane fouling which would easily clog membrane pores and form irreversible fouling tang et al 2017 therefore the efficient removal of efom fractions obtained from permeate were further evidence for the membrane fouling mitigated by mn co cm o f 3 4 discussion of the three dimensional membrane fouling structure the membrane fouling layer formed in cm f was an uneven and dense structure with many large scale sediments yellow circles fig 4 a consisting mainly of organic matters and particulate deposition after further magnification the original membrane surface and the uniformly distributed pores were still not observed fig 4 b cross sectional sem images showed that the thickness of the foulants layer was 38 96 5 05 μm fig 4 c and a large amount of membrane foulants blocked in the membrane channels fig 4 d these results further explained the decrease in flux during cm f i e increased fouling resistance 2 2 1012 m 1 the membrane fouling layer formed in cm o f was a uniform and smooth structure with many small scale sediments yellow circles fig 4 e this consists mainly of organic matters and particulate deposition similar to cm f fig 4 b the original membrane surface and pore channels still cannot be observed after further magnification fig 4 f cross sectional sem images showed that the thickness of the foulants layer decreased to 18 52 1 70 μm fig 4 g in cm o f and small amounts of membrane foulants were observed to be blocked in the membrane channels fig 4 h decrease of foulants layer thickness reduces the fouling resistance 1 2 1012 m 1 in cm o f ma et al 2019a as a result cm o f was effective on improving flux in mn co cm o f an incomplete membrane fouling layer was observed with only a few small sized foulants randomly distributed on the membrane surface fig 4 i indeed in depth analysis of fig 4 j revealed that there are many regions indicated by circles where the underlying pore and original membrane were still visible cross sectional sem images also showed a complete cake layer was not formed fig 4 k and no residual foulants were found in the membrane channels fig 4 l the corresponding fouling resistance is further reduced to 0 87 1012 m 1 in summary mn co cm o f not only effectively removed membrane foulants from the permeate fig 3 but also removed foulants on the membrane surface table s2 the mn co cm o f surface did not form a complete layer of membrane fouling with many membrane pores still exposed on the surface and very clean inside the channels this effectively reduces the fouling resistance from 2 2 1012 m 1 of cm f to 0 87 1012 m 1 of mn co cm o f table s2 and allows j j 0 to increase from 20 of cm f to around 50 of mn co cm o f fig 2 cm o f only achieved efficient removal of foulants from the permeate fig 3 but a large amount of non negligible membrane foulants also remained on the membrane surface 18 52 1 70 μm thick layer of fouling shown in table s2 the corresponding membrane fouling resistance is 1 2 1012 m 1 table s2 therefore mn co cm o f exhibited a more outstanding ability to mitigate membrane fouling than cm o f fig 2 3 5 discussion on membrane fouling reversibility and foulants identification the water flux recovery of efom fouled membrane was determined after either physical or chemical cleaning fig 5 a detailed descriptions were shown in text s7 cm o f enhanced the water flux recovery after physical chemical cleaning which was depended on the reaction time this result suggested that foulants adhering to the membrane surface or clogged in the membrane pores were effectively removed by the oxidant including the ozone molecule and hydroxyl radical which will improve the flux recovery during physical or chemical cleaning sun et al 2018a as expected this effect was greater in mn co cm o f that developed the highest flux growth rate fig 2 b the fouling reversibility results were shown in fig 5 b detailed descriptions were shown in text s8 results showed chemical irreversible fouling played a dominant role in cm f fouling by efom cm o f dramatically decreased the proportion of irreversible fouling which was improved by the increase of ozonation reaction time the irreversible foulants attached to membrane pores or surfaces in mn co cm o f were removed more effectively by in situ formation of oh resulting in a further decline in the proportion of irreversible fouling from 48 75 in cm f to 20 2 in mn co cm o f t8 the lowest chemical irreversible fouling was therefore observed in mn co cm o f t40 and resulted in the highest flux improvement fig 2 a cheng et al 2017 showed that reducing chemical irreversible fouling clearly alleviated flux decline in mno2 cm o f as observed in this study the mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation could be further understood by identifying the reversible and irreversible foulants fig 5 c in cm f the physical reversible foulants included protein like 60 25 fulvic acid like 22 52 and humic acid like substances 17 22 chemical reversible foulants included protein like 71 43 and fulvic acid like substances 28 57 and chemical irreversible foulants included protein like 7 63 fulvic acid like 17 53 and humic acid like substances 74 84 it was concluded that protein like substances were the main component of reversible membrane fouling and that it piled up on the cm surface to form a cake layer humic acid like substances were the main component of irreversible membrane fouling and that it remained inside the membrane pores and caused standard blocking chang et al 2017 these conclusions are consistent with the results reported by song et al 2020 and zhao et al 2020 who reported that protein like substances were the main reversible membrane foulants zhao et al 2020 reported that a cm suffered mainly irreversible membrane fouling during filtration of humic acid like substances in physical reversible foulants of cm o f t8 the contribution ratios of protein like and fulvic acid like substances increased to 63 79 and 26 85 respectively whereas that of humic acid like substances decreased to 9 36 it was reported that fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances were more preferentially reacted with the ozone molecule than protein like substances chen et al 2017 the increase in the proportion of fulvic acid like substances in physical reversible foulants indicated that the change in nature of the fulvic acid like substances causing irreversible fouling resulting in adhesion between irreversible foulants such as fulvic acid like substances and the cm surface pores was destroyed by in situ ozonation ultimately allowing the fulvic acid like substances causing the irreversible fouling to be transformed into substances causing the reversible fouling i e the release of irreversible fouling chemical reversible foulants involved protein like 66 85 fulvic acid like 27 23 and humic acid like substances 5 91 appearing as a new component these results further indicated that the adhesion between irreversible fouling components such as humic acid like substances and the cm pores surfaces was destroyed by ozonation this is an important reason for flux improvement fig 2 when the reaction time was prolonged to 20 min cm o f t20 the components involved in physical reversible foulants changed to protein like 73 13 and fulvic acid like substances 26 87 those in chemical reversible foulants also changed to protein like 68 04 and fulvic acid like substances 31 96 no humic acid like substances were observed in physical or chemical reversible foulants when the reaction time was prolonged to 40 min the protein like substances content further increased to 91 55 and 83 in physical and chemical reversible foulants respectively the corresponding fulvic acid like substances contents decreased to 8 45 and 16 99 still no humic acid like substances were observed the release rate of humic acid like substances in chemical irreversible foulants was therefore much lower than the humic acid like substances degradation rate by ozonation it is therefore speculated that ozonation mainly removed the reversible foulants because the ozone molecules were first exposed to the cake layer song et al 2017 also reported that fouling mitigation by cm o f could be ascribed to the alleviation of cake layer fouling as shown by model fitting in addition the release of irreversible foulants was observed in cm o f but this performance is not significant due to the steric hinderance and competing reactions of the molecular ozone resulting in that many humic acid like substances remain on the membrane surface as irreversible foulants and lower the water flux in mn co cm o f t8 the ratios of protein like substances in physical and chemical reversible foulants decreased to 59 58 and 56 81 respectively this might be due to higher reactivity between protein like substances and the oh formed from interfacial catalytic ozonation phong and hur 2016 cake layer fouling was therefore significantly alleviated by mn co cm o f more importantly more humic acid like substances appeared in foulant of physical and chemical reversible compared with the result of cm o f t8 this interesting result indicated that destruction of the adhesion between irreversible foulants such as humic acid like substances and the cm pores surfaces was enhanced by interfacial catalytic ozonation because more of the oh produced in situ on the mn co cm pores surfaces could effectively degrade humic acid like substances the main component of irreversible membrane foulant in chemical irreversible foulants the irreversible fouling ratio in mn co cm o f therefore decreased more noticeably than that observed in cm o f fig 5 b this led to the highest flux improvement fig 2 when the reaction time increased to 20 min mn co cm o f t20 protein like 73 92 fulvic acid like 17 28 and humic acid like substances 8 8 were observed in physical reversible foulants this changed to protein like 75 19 fulvic acid like 22 4 and humic acid like substances 2 39 in chemical reversible foulants these variations in the components in physical and chemical reversible foulants indicated that fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances in the cake layer were removed more quickly than protein like substances cake layer fouling was mitigated in mn co cm o f t20 being different with cm o f t20 there was still new irreversible fouling components humic acid like substances released into the reversible fouling in mn co cm o f t20 since humic acid like substances was still observed in physical and chemical reversible fouling when the reaction time was increased to 40 min mn co cm o f t40 the amounts of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances involved in physical and chemical reversible foulants continued to decline but humic acid like substances was still involved in both physical and chemical reversible foulants these results showed that the release rate of humic acid like substances from the chemical irreversible foulants was higher than the degradation rate of humic acid like substances by interfacial catalytic ozonation chemical irreversible fouling therefore further declined in mn co cm o f fig 5 b due to that the humic acid like substances degradation rate by interfacial catalytic ozonation was much higher than that by ozonation fig 3 the humic acid like substances release rate in irreversible fouling by mn co cm o f was much higher than that by cm o f therefore mn co cm o f exhibited a lower proportion of irreversible fouling compared to cm o f fig 5 b yu et al 2016 reported that a combination of mno2 cm and ozone prevented membrane fouling due to the degradation of nom by oh however the release of humic acid like substances from irreversible fouling to reversible fouling is also crucial and was not discussed in detailed in interface aops on the surface of catalytic membrane zhao et al 2020 used extended xdlvo analysis to show that the total attractive interaction energy between oxidized humic acid like substances and cm in cufe2o4 cm decreased this is consistent with the results of this study 3 6 2d cos analysis on the mitigation behaviors of membrane fouling to further understand the mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation a set of process resolved 2d cos of sf spectrum fig s10 were shown in fig 6 cm o f could enhance the removal of efom based on synchronous map but the enhanced degree of removal efficiency of humic acid like substances was the weakest text s9 asynchronous spectrum exhibited that ozonation in cm o f preferentially enhances the removal efficiency of humic acid like firstly and then removed fulvic acid like and finally protein like substances because the molecular ozone reacts selectively with aromatic compounds e g humic acid like substances zhang et al 2019a jin et al 2012 also reported that humic acid like were more sensitive than protein like substances to ozonation therefore the enhanced removal of humic acid like by cm o f is theoretically more effective than the enhanced removal of protein like substances however based on the synchronous map cm o f showed a higher enhanced removal efficiency on protein like than humic acid like substances this contradictory phenomenon again suggested that the molecular ozone was first exposed to cake layer fouling where protein like and fulvic acid like substances as the main component of cake layer fouling fig 5 c consumed oxidant firstly fig 6 c which results in a better enhanced removal efficiency of protein like and fulvic acid like substances afterwards the humic acid like substances main component of irreversible fouling attached to the membrane surface or pores could be further attacked by the molecular ozone fig 6 c the irreversible foulant was eventually slowly released and then degraded shown in section 3 5 being better than cm o f mn co cm o f could further enhance the removal of efom based on synchronous map fig 6 d and the asynchronous spectrum showed that mn co cm o f preferentially enhances the removal of humic like substances firstly then fulvic like substances protein like substances finally fig 6 e this phenomenon again suggested that humic like substances that attached the membrane surface or pores were preferentially strength removed by catalytic ozonation in mn co cm o f as the in situ formation of oh at the membrane interface was first consumed by these humic like substances fig 6 f which leads to a fast release of irreversible foulants section 3 5 meanwhile all membrane foulants were further degraded rapidly by generated oh and molecular ozone fig 6 f resulting in only a small amount of foulants remaining on the membrane surface section 3 4 this is also the main reason for the lowest proportion of irreversible fouling in mn co cm o f fig 5 b overall both cm o f and mn co cm o f are preferentially enhancing the removal of irreversible foulants humic acid like substances but the mitigated mechanism of membrane fouling is quite different in cm o f the molecular ozone attacks the cake layer fouling firstly followed by the slow releasing and degradation of irreversible foulant as an outward to inward membrane fouling mitigation mechanism in mn co cm o f the in situ formation of oh enables rapid release and degradation of irreversible foulant meanwhile foulants on the membrane surface are efficiently degraded as an inside out mechanism to mitigate membrane fouling 4 conclusion taken together this study clearly shows a new insight into the mitigation mechanisms of membrane fouling by interface catalytic ozonation in mn co cm o f firstly dft calculations results demonstrated that mn co cm with abundance of vo as promising active sites that was formed due to the coupling of mno2 co3o4 is an ideal catalytic ozonation membrane for oh generation this is the driving force of membrane fouling mitigation which is also an important development on catalytic ozonation and its derived catalytic membrane technology secondly cm o f removed foulants from the permeate but also leave over some middle mw substances to affect the permeate flux in addition cm o f mainly removed cake layer fouling including protein like and fulvic acid like substances however due to the steric hinderance and competing reactions of molecular ozone many foulants e g humic acid like substances remain adhered to the membrane surface 18 52 1 70 μm thick layer of fouling causing a 1 2 1012 m 1 resistance to membrane fouling thirdly as an important development mn co cm o f achieved more efficient and rapid removal of foulants from permeate and membrane surface the nature of the irreversible foulant caused by humic acid like substances is altered by generated oh and adsorbed molecular ozone then preferentially it was released and rapidly removed in mn co cm o f reversible foulant protein like and fulvic acid like substances is also rapidly degraded based on these the fouling resistance reduced from 2 2 1012 m 1 in cm f to 0 87 1012 m 1 the flux growth rate of mn co cm o f is 3 5 times higher than that of cm o f as a promoting novel enhanced water purification technology declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15371,the reuse of reclaimed water rw for river ecological restoration in global water shortage regions has inevitably brought some potential risks for groundwater however little is known about the effects of reclaimed water on the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater especially under long term infiltration conditions herein 11 years monitoring data 2007 2018 of reclaimed water and groundwater were adopted to analyze the characteristics and genesis of groundwater hydrochemical evolution under long term infiltration of reclaimed water from jian river to chaobai river in beijing the results showed that the hydrochemical components in groundwater totally performed a significant increase in na cl and k and decrease in ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentration after long term infiltration of reclaimed water meanwhile a significant hydrochemical evolution difference between the groundwater of jian river and chaobai river was observed in jian river the hydrochemical type in groundwater shifted gradually from hco3 ca mg to the type of hco3 cl na ca approaching reclaimed water in contrast the hydrochemical evolution in the chaobai river shows an obvious opposite trend from hco3 ca mg to hco3 cl na mg and finally deviating reclaimed water type of cl hco3 so4 na phreeqc simulation indicated that the differences in hydrochemical evolution were mediated synergically by sediment thickness and geochemical processes e g mixing and sulfate reduction in such mediators thinner sediment and strong mixing in the jian river were confirmed to be the genesis of groundwater hydrochemical evolution progressively approaching reclaimed water different from the jian river multiple regression analyses revealed that the genesis of groundwater hydrochemical evolution in the chaobai river was divided into two stages according to the increase of sediment thickness reclaimed water quality and infiltration amount are the leading proposed cause in the initial stage 2007 2008 due to thinner sediment formation contributing 53 5 and 29 8 within the 95 confidence interval respectively subsequently the rise in sediment thickness is proved to play a crucial role in groundwater hydrochemical evolution trend away from reclaimed water 2009 2018 with a contribution of 41 6 within the 95 confidence interval it is mainly attributed to the reduced reclaimed water infiltration rate and favorable sulfate reduction conditions these findings advance our understanding on groundwater hydrochemical evolution under long term infiltration of reclaimed water and also guide future prediction of evolution trends graphcial absract image graphical abstract keywords reclaimed water groundwater hydrochemical evolution phreeqc simulation genesis data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction reclaimed water utilization for ecological replenishment of rivers is considered to be an important way to improve river water ecology especially in water shortage or arid and semi arid areas connor et al 2017 morsy et al 2018 the reuse of reclaimed water can not only restore the landscape of river water ecology but also conserve ecological water sources by replenishing groundwater to relieve the drop in groundwater level busico et al 2021 jiang et al 2022 research conducted over the past decade has demonstrated that reclaimed water still contains nitrogen heavy metals and organic pollutants even after being treated li et al 2019 deng et al 2019 owing to the infiltration of these complex components page et al 2018 previous studies have reported that the infiltration of reclaimed water led to the detection of nitrate ammonia li et al 2019 antibiotic zhang et al 2019a ding et al 2020 and endocrine disruptors ma et al 2015 lu et al 2020 in groundwater the impact of reclaimed water infiltration on groundwater quality poses a potential threat to human health therefore it is of great significance to study the impact of reclaimed water infiltration on groundwater quality one critical aspect of fully understanding the effect of reclaimed water on groundwater quality is to determine the change of hydrochemical indicators or so called hydrochemical processes including ph total dissolved solids tds hardness th physical mixing and water rock interactions etc yu et al 2013 2017 prior studies of column experiments showed that the th increased and cation exchange between k in water and ca2 in soil occurred during the infiltration of the reclaimed water in the chaobai river later a field study found that the shallow groundwater around the river is gradually replaced by reclaimed water due to the physical mixing and the salinity of groundwater increased significantly li et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 recent studies reflected physical mixing and water rock interactions such as mineral dissolution precipitation and cation exchange are the main roles in changing shallow groundwater hydrochemistry in the chaobai river by using isotope technique and multivariate statistical analysis he et al 2021 li et al 2021 however in most studies short term 1 3 years monitoring data are used to analyze the impact of reclaimed water infiltration on groundwater hydrochemistry yin et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 li et al 2021 2022 zhang et al 2021 the hydrochemical evolution characteristics and genesis of groundwater under long term infiltration are rarely mentioned owing to laboratory tests fakhreddine et al 2015 schafer et al 2018 and short term field injection trials seibert et al 2014 2016 were usually used to explore the early warning signs of geochemistry dis equilibrium in the reclaimed reuse areas the interpretation of these results can be used to identify the geochemical mechanisms that control the groundwater quality evolution such as cation exchange adsorption redox action etc but short term experiments preclude the discovery of any geochemical mechanisms that rely on the long term reclaimed water recharge sun et al 2020 it is anticipated that long term infiltration is far more complex than short term infiltration although the groundwater long term evolution characteristics in the chaobai river were analyzed by li et al 2019 they focused on the evolution of nitrogen and the systematic analysis of groundwater hydrochemical evolution was not involved therefore a systematic analysis using long term data is necessary another important component in characterizing the impact of reclaimed water infiltration on groundwater is the measurement of infiltration efficiency jiang et al 2022 many studies found that sediment deposition during the infiltration process was the main reason for the decline in infiltration efficiency su et al 2014 liu et al 2017b except for the infiltration efficiency it also played an important role in controlling groundwater hydrochemical evolution at the reclaimed water infiltration site of qingyang river in beijing river sediment was proved to control cod and no3 n entering groundwater pan et al 2018 in addition the dissolved organic matter in the reclaimed water was removed more effectively with the increased sediment thickness discovered through a large column test thereby the amount of organic matter nitrogen etc entering the groundwater was reduced li et al 2012 liu et al 2017b especially in the long term monitoring of the nanhongmen reclaimed water use area in beijing the increase of nh4 n concentration in groundwater and the linear correlation of cl between groundwater and reclaimed water were found after the removal of river sediment reflecting that sediment thickness had an important impact on groundwater hydrochemical evolution yin et al 2016 besides the biogeochemical processes may also be changed in the hyporheic zone during the infiltration of reclaimed water mclachlan et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 the hyporheic zone is an active interfacial zone of surface water and groundwater within river corridors busato et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 where the quality and quantity of exchange fluxes are affected by recharge conditions and geochemical processes oyarzún et al 2014 mclachlan et al 2017 lewandowski et al 2020 guo et al 2022 in the hyporheic zone the distribution of organic carbon toc and dissolved oxygen do may exhibit spatial gradients and respond to reclaimed water infiltration a redox gradient associated with doc consumption and do depletion drives biogeochemical transformation such as denitrification and sulfate reduction by which release of co2 and oh may further affect other water rock interactions such as the carbonate mineral dissolution precipitation li et al 2021 therefore except for mixing and water rock interactions the sediment deposition and biogeochemical changes of the hyporheic zone caused by long term infiltration of reclaimed water should also be considered in this regard 11 years monitoring data 2007 2018 of reclaimed water and groundwater were adopted to analyze the characteristics and genesis of groundwater hydrochemical evolution under long term infiltration of reclaimed water from jian river to chaobai river in beijing the objectives of this study were to 1 identify the characteristics of groundwater hydrochemical evolution during the long term infiltration of reclaimed water 2007 2018 2 analyze the genesis of groundwater hydrochemical evolution systematically and quantify the relative contribution of these underlying factors the innovation of this paper is to use long term continuous reclaimed water and groundwater hydrochemical data to systematically consider the effects of reclaimed water quality hydrogeological conditions sediment deposition and biogeochemistry of subsurface flow zone on groundwater hydrochemical evolution these findings will shed light on the understanding of groundwater hydrochemical evolution under long term infiltration of reclaimed water and also guide the future safely reuse of reclaimed water through the prediction of evolution trends 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the jian river a tributary of the chaobai river in shunyi and the chaobai river section from xiangyang sluice gate to the rubber dam of henan village fig 1 a the jian river and the chaobai river used to be dry rivers before 2007 due to decades of drought and large scale exploitation of groundwater to restore the ecology of the chaobai river and supplement groundwater a water transfer project was implemented by the beijing water authority in 2006 in the project the urban sewage from the wenyu river was treated by an oxidation pond and membrane bioreactor mbr then transferred to the jian river through an underground pipeline and finally flowed into the chaobai river zheng et al 2015 the jian river is an artificial river with two sloping sides and a natural river bottom it intersects with the chaobai river downstream of the xiangyang sluice gate the chaobai river section between xiangyang sluice gate and the rubber dam of henan village is a water receiving section with a length of about 7 3 km in the south of the earth dam the river is recharged with rw throughout the year while in the north the river receives rw recharge only in summer at the initial stage until february 2012 the water was transported to the north continuously in general from 2007 to the end of 2018 the actual water transfer amount of the project is 278 million m3 after years of water replenishment the water depths of chaobai river in the south of the earth dam and jian river are maintained at 2 30 2 60 m and 0 64 1 70 m respectively he et al 2018 the chaobai river has formed a wide water surface due to the interception of the rubber dam of henan village with 300 m long and 2 7 m high moreover its interception resulted in a flow velocity of only 1 49 10 3 m s which may provide sufficient time for a series of hydrochemical reactions in the chaobai river to change the reclaimed water quality except for total nitrogen the main design effluent quality indexes of the project meet the water quality standard for scenic environment use gb t18921 02 groundwater recharge gb t19772 05 and environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 in china see table s1 for details the climate is a typical of temperate continental semi humid monsoon with hot and rainy summers and cold and dry winters the annual average temperature and precipitation are 11 5 c and 578 5 mm respectively and the evaporation is 1300 mm the soil types in the study area are mainly paddy soil and fluvo aquic soil and the soil texture is mainly loam from the perspective of hydrogeology the study area belongs to the middle segment of the chaobai alluvial diluvial fan and the groundwater flow direction is from southwest to northeast due to overexploitation of large groundwater sources located upstream in the north the geological cross section profile performed that the lithology of the shallow aquifer gradually changes from gravel sand to clay and fine silt sand from north to south fig 1 b correspondingly from west to east it changes from clay to gravel with sand the potential recharge sources of groundwater in this study area are mainly atmospheric precipitation and reclaimed water infiltration lateral runoff and irrigation have little effect since that lateral runoff mainly occurs in deeper confined aquifers and the lack of large scale irrigated farmland in this area zhai et al 2013 hence irrigation infiltration and lateral groundwater recharge were not considered besides the chaobai river section to the north of the earth dam was also not considered due to intermittent receiving the recharge of reclaimed water and the strong effect of anthropogenic disturbance six surface water monitoring cross sections j1 j4 of the jian river and c1 c2 of the chaobai river were set up from upstream to downstream along the transfer water flow direction the two groundwater monitoring wells 31 and 22 correspond to j1 and c1 cross sections which were set at 30 m away from jian river and chaobai river respectively two other remote monitoring wells 23 and 26 were located 50 m and 100 m north of 22 respectively these shallow groundwater wells were designed to monitor the long term changes in groundwater level and water quality the specific locations of the monitoring cross sections and wells are shown in fig 1 the location of the screen pipe of each monitoring well were shown in fig s1 2 2 sampling and testing sampling work including reclaimed water and groundwater sampling was carried out at a frequency of 4 year for a total of 11 years 2007 2018 the sampling time of each year is march may september and november which represent the dry intermediate and wet periods of a complete hydrological year for the sampling of reclaimed water in the river a vertical water sampler was used to collect from 20 cm below the river surface and stored in polyethylene bottles 500 ml in comparison with reclaimed water sampling the collection of groundwater samples should firstly determine the groundwater level by using a sounding probe after that groundwater samples were collected by using a submersible pump grundfos sq2 70 denmark and stored in polyethylene bottles 500 ml after pumping for 10 25 min samples collections storage transport and tests were all undertaken with strict adherence to the guidelines of the regulation for water environmental monitoring sl219 98 text s1 the water temperature ph total dissolved solids tds dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured in situ with a portable multi parameter tester hq40d hach usa all samples were transported to the laboratory on the day and preserved in a refrigerator at 4 c until analysis the cation na mg2 k ca2 fe concentrations in water samples were examined via icp oes 5110vdv agilent usa and the anion cl and so4 2 concentrations were analyzed via ion chromatography integrion thermofisher carbonate co3 2 and bicarbonate hco3 were tested by a titrino plus automatic potentiometric titrator metrohm 877 switzerland the charge balance and error of the samples are 5 the monitored nutrients such as total nitrogen tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n and chlorophyll a chla are determined by a spectrophotometer uv 1800 japan total organic carbon toc is measured by a total organic carbon analyzer toc v cpv japan cod is tested by the potassium dichromate method 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 calculation of reclaimed water infiltration amount and infiltration rate preliminary calculation of water balance was performed to evaluate the reclaimed water rw infiltration amount for water balance calculation rw diversion amount and atmospheric precipitation were selected as the input items while water surface evaporation amount river water storage and rw infiltration amount were chosen as output items the rw infiltration amount was calculated by using eq 1 yu et al 2017 jiang et al 2022 on this basis the rw infiltration rate was further calculated according to infiltration time and area eq 2 1 q i n f q d i v q p r e q e v q q s t o where qinf is the rw infiltration amount qdiv is the rw diversion amount qpre is the atmospheric precipitation qeva is the water surface evaporation amount in the equilibrium period and qsto is the river water storage which is estimated according to the water surface area of historical remote sensing images 2 q q i n f s t where q is the average daily infiltration rate qinf is the rw infiltration amount and s is the infiltration area t is the infiltration time 2 3 2 calculation of the mixing ratio and target component concentration as a conservative tracer ion cl is hardly affected by any biochemical reaction and adsorption during the infiltration process hence the concentration of cl can be used to estimate the proportions of the rw in the groundwater eq 3 on this basis the theoretical concentration of the target component in groundwater will be acquired through assuming the only occurrence of physical mixing eq 4 mienis and arye 2018 3 m r c m i x c b c i c b 4 c c a l m r c r w 1 m r c g w where mr is the fraction of the rw present in the aquifer cb is the cl background concentration in the groundwater ci is the input concentration of cl in the rw cmix is the cl concentration in groundwater after it is mixed with rw cgw is the background concentration of the target component in the groundwater crw is the input concentration of the target component in the rw and ccal is the calculated concentration of the target component in the groundwater 2 3 3 simulation analysis of water rock interaction geochemical evolution or inverse models were estimated using the geochemical code phreeqc inverse modeling is a process that finds sets of mineral and gas mole transfers that account for differences in the composition of an initial and final water within specified compositional uncertainty limits and is widely used in the hydrochemical simulation of groundwater flowlines hansen et al 2018 in recent years it has also been applied to analyze water rock interactions during the mixing of surface water with the initial groundwater into the monitoring well near the surface water body han et al 2011 walton day and mills 2015 jean baptist et al 2020 slama et al 2022 in this study the modeling seeks to describe the processes driving the chemical evolution from the physical mixing between rw and groundwater to the final groundwater in wells in each river segment the models of four mixing ratios 3 7 5 5 7 3 and 9 1 were constructed to reflect the characteristics of different infiltration stages table s2 the model included mineral dissolution precipitation cation exchange adsorption and redox reaction following the simulation the calculated results and measured results are compared to verify the reliability the mineral phase of the model is selected as follows firstly the mineral selection was determined by the main mineral composition in the study area table s3 the possible mineral facies k feldspar kalsi3o8 albite naalsi3o8 calcite caco3 dolomite camg co3 2 and ca montmorillonite ca0 165al2 33si3 67o10 oh 2 were selected then the hydrochemical indicators water temperature table s4 ph k ca2 na mg2 so4 2 cl hco3 etc were input into phreeqc to calculate the saturation index of the main minerals to force the minerals dissolution or precipitation in the reverse simulation secondly referring to previous column experiments cation exchange adsorption phases k and ca2 was added finally sulfate reduction and denitrification may occur during the rw infiltration so ch2o h2s n2 and co2 were used as mineral phases 2 3 4 multiple regression analysis multiple regression analysis mlr is applied to measure the relationship between multiple variables and predict the behavior of a dependent variable according to two or more independent variables mlr is frequently used as an approximating function or empirical model that allows a mathematical model to be established to describe a given actual phenomenon the mlr model is denoted as in eq 5 5 y i β 0 j 1 n β j x i j ε i i 1 m where yi is the dependent variable at the position i βj are the slope coefficients of the independent variable xij β0 is the intercept n is the number of independent variables m is the number of samples εi is the regression residual representing the unexplained part of the data the dependent variable that is groundwater hydrochemistry stabilizes the variance by natural logarithm transformation coefficients are calculated using ordinary least squares ols regression which weighed the effects of explanatory variables he et al 2019 mlr models were evaluated based on estimation coefficient p value of t test and determination coefficient r2 in model validation the predicted and observed values are plotted and compared with the 1 1 line to check the model fit and deviation the above analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics 24 0 software on this basis the relative contributions of independent variables are calculated to further analyze the relative importance of the impact of environmental variables on groundwater hydrochemical evolution eq 6 liu et al 2017a zhang et al 2019b 6 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 3 100 a 2 a 1 a 2 a 3 100 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 100 where a1 a2 a3 represent the contributions of three environment variables to the groundwater hydrochemical evolution respectively a 1 β 1 δx 1 a 2 β 2 δx 2 a 3 β 3 δx 3 δ is the standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental indicators of reclaimed water fig 2 shows the basic characteristics of reclaimed water quality in the jian river and chaobai river during the 11 year replenishment the ph values of jian river and chaobai river ranged from 8 18 0 46 and 8 67 0 60 respectively performing an increasing trend along the reclaimed water flow direction in contrast the tds decreased from 557 75 85 14 mg l to 458 18 85 87 mg l in the jian river and chaobai river implying the consumption of dissolved components in reclaimed water the th ca2 and hco3 showed similar variation trend with tds the characteristics of ph tds th ca2 and hco3 indicated that reclaimed water quality itself will also change when it was long term reused in the river channels this variation led to the obvious difference in the quality of reclaimed water between jian river and chaobai river fig s2 the cluster analysis results further supported this understanding two clusters were identified according to the reclaimed water quality throughout the river which still were jian river and chaobai river respectively text s2 the no3 n as the main component of tn maintained a higher level of 9 59 5 19 mg l in the jian river than chaobai river of 2 13 2 30 mg l while it was just opposite for codmn and chl a the average concentrations of codmn and chl a were 5 80 3 11 mg l and 46 86 103 22 μg l in the jian river and 8 65 3 84 mg l and 131 2 250 43 μg l in the chaobai river implying more organic carbon and algae in the chaobai river than jian river the change of reclaimed water quality itself after long term reused 2007 2018 in the river channels is also likely to have a potential impact on groundwater quality varieties in reclaimed water quality in rivers were mainly affected by the growth and reproduction of phytoplankton he et al 2017 several studies attributed phytoplankton growth and reproduction to excessive nutrient inputs carpenter and bennett 2011 némery et al 2016 in addition suitable sunlight and temperature can promote phytoplankton growth through photosynthesis and cell division respectively bowes et al 2016 lurling et al 2018 in the previous studies of our group temperature and sunlight determined the distribution of phytoplankton in the vertical direction of the river but the flow velocity was the most critical factor for phytoplankton growth and reproduction along the flow direction he et al 2017 similar to the construction of dams that significantly promoted the phytoplankton reproduction by slowing down the water flow rate némery et al 2016 the narrow channel and fast flow velocity of the jian river limited the reproduction of phytoplankton so the denitrification and photosynthesis were weak and the photosynthetic rate was close to the river sediment decomposition rate resulting in a less variety of ph and other water quality indicators and only a little sediment was generated thus the concentration of no3 n remained at a high level and the ph and concentration of toc were low in the jian river in addition the thin sediment produced in the river may be conducive to the infiltration of reclaimed water into groundwater and cause the quality of reclaimed water to have a great impact on the quality of groundwater compared with the jian river the wide channel and slow flow velocity in the chaobai river promoted the massive reproduction of phytoplankton meanwhile an anaerobic microenvironment favorable for denitrification was formed so the denitrification and photosynthesis were strong and the photosynthetic rate was higher than the sediment decomposition rate denitrification 2no3 10h hydrogen donor organic n2 2oh 4h2o and photosynthesis hco3 h2 ch2o oh o2 together increased the ph and toc significantly the high ph converted hco3 to co3 2 and co3 2 combined with ca2 to form caco3 therefore the above hydrochemical reactions reduced the no3 n tds th ca2 and hco3 concentration in the river he et al 2017 at the same time thick sediment was formed in the chaobai river reaching 1 08 m in the downstream and the organic matter increased to 9 43 g kg which were about 3 9 times of the background value fig s3 the thicker sediment may reduce the infiltration of reclaimed water and weaken the impacts of reclaimed water quality on groundwater quality thus the difference of reclaimed water quality between jian river and chaobai river and the formation of sediment are likely to have a potential impact on groundwater quality after long term infiltration 3 2 estimation of the amount of reclaimed water infiltration and the infiltration rate after the reclaimed water infiltrated the groundwater levels of the monitoring well 30 m away from jian river and chaobai river rose rapidly by about 1 m and 3 m respectively and then stabilized at about 28 m fig s4 to accurately assess the impact of long term infiltration of rw on groundwater two methods including water balance and chloride inversion were used to estimate the rw infiltration amount and rw infiltration rate fig 3 the water balance evaluation results demonstrated that the net infiltration amount qinft of rw was about 225 million m3 from 2007 to 2018 in the whole rw receiving area including the study area and outside the study area fig 3a the input items including rw diversion amount qdiv and the precipitation qpre were 278 and 42 million m3 respectively the water surface evaporation amount qeva and the water storage capacity qsto served as output items were 71 and 14 million m3 in the river channel during these net amount infiltration processes the rw infiltration rate performed a decrease trend from 0 032 m d to 0 008 m d fig 3b correspondingly the rw infiltration amount qinfs in this study area also decreased from 13 6 million m3 yr to 7 39 million m3 yr it was presumably related to the formation of sediment in the river in comparison with water balance evaluation results the results of chloride ion evaluation showed that the mixing ratio of rw to groundwater in the two river segments gradually increased to 80 90 2007 2018 fig 3c about 48 2 million m3 reclaimed water in the chaobai river seeped into the groundwater fig 3d the infiltration volume of 48 2 million m3 was similar to water balance evaluation result of 46 1 million m3 with only 4 4 relative error confirming the reliable of chloride ion evaluation results hence the chloride ion inversion was further used to explore the differences in infiltration between the jian river and the chaobai river text s3 fig 3e showed the change rate of the mixing ratio of reclaimed water and groundwater in the jian river and chaobai river it can be seen that the mixing ratio in the jian river increased more quickly than chaobai river especially the first two monitoring subsequently after 2008 an obvious decreased trend in the change rate of mixing ratio was observed in both jian river and chaobai river and the chaobai river decreased more sharply it is inferred that this change is likely to be related to the hydrogeological conditions and the formation of sediments the aquifer lithology of fine sand coupled with the deposition of thin sediments jointly result in a long term larger infiltration rate for the jian river in comparison the aquifer lithology of silty fine sand in chaobai river led to a slow reclaimed water infiltration rate this process was further exacerbated by the formation of thick sediments after may 2008 with a dramatic drop in infiltration rates this was also reflected in the changes in the groundwater level compared with jian river the groundwater level of chaobai river had a significant downward tendency since may 2008 however the infiltration volume of reclaimed water and the groundwater level increased slightly with the increase of reclaimed water supply in the later stage the difference in infiltration amount and infiltration rate of reclaimed water between jian river and chaobai river might also the potential factors affecting the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater 3 3 hydrochemical evolution of groundwater under long term reclaimed water infiltration according to the pre data analysis the three groundwater monitoring wells in section c1 had the same groundwater hydrochemical evolution trend moreover the groundwater hydrochemistry of the monitoring well closest to the river channel was more strongly changed and less affected by other anthropogenic factors text s4 therefore monitoring wells 31 and 22 were selected to better systematically explore the characteristics and mechanism of groundwater hydrochemical evolution under the influence of rw infiltration in jian river and chaobai river respectively fig 4 in the long term infiltration of rw in the jian river the results showed that the average ph of groundwater changed from 8 07 before infiltration to 8 00 0 33 tds changed from 562 to 549 7 51 6 mg l and th changed from 355 to 217 9 28 9 mg l finally there was no significant difference with ph of 7 97 0 22 tds of 557 5 56 9 mg l and th of 242 1 20 9 mg l of reclaimed water implying the basic hydrochemical index of groundwater in the jian river gradually approached to rw after long term infiltration it is inferred that mixing plays an important role in the jian river results from chaobai river showed that the average ph of groundwater increased from 7 7 before infiltration to 8 25 0 24 closed to rw ph of 8 40 0 43 differently the concentrations of tds and th performed a significant downward trend from 503 mg l before infiltration to 335 52 0 mg l and from 392 to 123 5 27 5 mg l respectively lower than that of 447 7 75 3 and 164 7 43 6 mg l in reclaimed water this finding confirmed that the hydrochemical evolution characteristics of groundwater varied in river segments moreover different from jian river chaobai river may have other geochemical effects in addition to mixing to gain insight into the groundwater hydrochemical evolution after reclaimed water infiltration stiff diagram was used to investigate the variation of the major ions composition in groundwater from 2007 to 2018 fig 5 in the jian river a significant increase trend in na cl k and so4 2 were observed the average concentrations of na cl k and so4 2 increased from 56 6 62 2 2 and 99 8 mg l before infiltration to 96 4 108 11 8 and 110 mg l respectively it was comparable to these indicators in reclaimed water 93 2 94 1 14 7 and 103 5 mg l indicating the infiltration of high salinity rw into groundwater contrary to na cl k and so4 2 the average ca2 mg2 and hco3 tended to decrease from 114 36 5 and 554 mg l to 57 2 24 4 and 254 mg l close to reclaimed water 59 3 22 7 and 219 9 mg l implying infiltration leading to the reduction of the hardness in groundwater with the action of these ions composition the hydrochemical type in groundwater shifted gradually from hco3 ca mg to the type of hco3 cl na ca approaching reclaimed water in the jian river accompanied by a decrease in tds compared with the hydrochemical evolution in the jian river the hydrochemical evolution of the chaobai river is obviously different from that of the jian river the average na cl and k in groundwater increased progressively from 21 2 to 80 1 mg l 30 5 to 96 mg l and 2 24 to 5 44 mg l after reclaimed water infiltration respectively nonetheless it was still lower than that of the rw especially k 14 4 mg l on one hand this probably related to the less infiltration caused by the thicker sediment and finer lithology of the chaobai river on the other hand some other reactions may have occurred the smaller increment of k concentration in groundwater of chaobai river than in the jian river is probably related to the strong cation exchange caused by the thicker sediment of chaobai river it is noteworthy that the infiltration resulted in a significant reduction of so4 2 from 57 8 mg l to 14 9 mg l even when so4 2 concentration in the reclaimed water was as high as 107 6 mg l implying the occurrence of sulfate reduction in groundwater of the chaobai river the concentration of ca2 mg2 and hco3 decreased from 113 26 and 468 mg l to 25 18 9 and 195 mg l after reclaimed water infiltration respectively finally the contents of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater were even lower than those in reclaimed water 32 2 and 21 4 mg l in fact the simple mixing and dilution of reclaimed water is not enough to cause the ca2 and mg2 content to drop to this level hence it is speculated that mineral precipitation has occurred under these complex water rock interactions hydrochemical evolution in chaobai river performed a significant difference from jian river the hydrochemical types in the chaobai river show an obvious opposite trend from hco3 ca mg to hco3 cl na mg and finally deviating reclaimed water type of cl hco3 so4 na 3 4 influence of water rock interactions on hydrochemical evolution of groundwater the comparison of theoretical calculation results of ionic concentration based on mixing ratio of reclaimed water infiltration and measured results was used to judge the potential geochemical processes fig s5 the results showed that the theoretical concentration of na was in good agreement with the measured concentration fully illustrating the existence of physical mixing and its dominant role in addition there are also some indicators show that the theoretical calculation results are inconsistent with the measured results such as ca2 mg2 hco3 k and so4 2 indicating the existence of other water rock interactions except physical mixing fig s5 to this end phreeqc reverse simulation was used to reveal these potential geochemical processes the calcite and dolomite were supersaturated in reclaimed water and groundwater table s5 thus the negative molar transfer value of calcite 0 13 0 708 and dolomite 0 028 0 335 reflected carbonate minerals precipitation is an inevitable process for hydrochemical evolution after reclaimed water infiltration table 1 the molar transfer of calcite and dolomite was two orders of magnitude higher than that of albite and ca montmorillonite further strengthening the effect of carbonate minerals precipitation on groundwater hydration the pco2 of groundwater decreased with the infiltration of reclaimed water illustrating that the infiltration of reclaimed water broke the carbonate balance in return the change of carbonate balance with mixing ratio of reclaimed water and groundwater will affect the molar transfer of calcite and dolomite galli et al 2014 romero et al 2019 the negative values of n2 0 191 0 772 and h2s 0 1 0 856 indicated the occurrence of denitrification and sulfate reduction in the infiltration process the negative molar transfer value of k 0 118 0 294 and positive value of ca2 0 059 0 147 indicated the exchange between k in reclaimed water and ca2 in sediment also has an impact on the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater the consistency of the actually measured results and phreeqc reverse simulation effectively confirmed the inferred reason for groundwater hydrochemical evolution under the influence of long term reclaimed water infiltration fig 6 specifically for jian river the gradually reduction of inorganic carbon in groundwater with increasing mixing ratio fully demonstrated the huge role of physical mixing and carbonate precipitation during infiltration fig 6a in contrast inorganic carbon in groundwater of chaobai river decreased first and then increased when mixing ratio reached 9 1 fig 6b this variation is mainly attributed to co2 absorption and carbonate minerals precipitation the pco2 of reclaimed water 3 17 0 54 was lower than that of groundwater 2 35 0 21 resulting in the absorption of co2 in soil by groundwater increased with the reclaimed water infiltration according to the carbonic acid balance principle the absorbed co2 could increase inorganic carbon by reducing the carbonate precipitation and ph thus alleviating the decrement of inorganic carbon in fact however the carbonate precipitation in the groundwater of jian river and chaobai river did not show a significant or a continuous decreasing trend fig 6c for jian river this is probably related to alkali production oh by denitrification the generation of n2 increased from 0 415 mmol l to 0 772 mmol l revealing the occurrence of denitrification and tended to intensify with the increase of mixing ratio table 1 for chaobai river the change in carbonate precipitation that first decreased and then increased is likely to be related to sulfate reduction the generation of h2s increased from 0 100 mmol l to 0 856 mmol l indicating the occurrence of desulphurization and tended to intensify after the mixing ratio reached 1 1 the cation exchange capacity of k and ca2 in the groundwater of chaobai river was higher than in jian river which is related to the thickness of sediment through the above analysis it can be known that the hydrochemical evolution caused by the long term infiltration of reclaimed water is the result of the joint action of multi geochemical processes the thinner sediment and strong mixing in the jian river were considered as the primary reasons of groundwater hydrochemical evolution progressively approaching reclaimed water different from jian river in addition to mixing the strong sulfate reduction in the chaobai river was considered also play an important role in the groundwater hydrochemical evolution fig 7 the high concentration of toc in reclaimed water 5 6 13 8 mg l and organic matter in sediment 9 43 g kg provided sufficient nutrients for sulfate reduction in addition the lower eh 118 3 mv do 3 4 mg l no3 n 0 03 mg l and higher nh4 n 2 26 mg l and fe 0 50 mg l indicated that the groundwater in the chaobai river was in a strong reductive environment huang et al 2022 in this situation sulfate reducing occurred to promote the reduction of so4 2 to h2s and produce co2 and oh cypionka et al 1995 jurado et al 2013 the high abundances of sulfate reducing bacteria proteobacteria 88 6 and desulfobacterota 1 1 reported in the groundwater of chaobai river also supported this perception li et al 2022 moreover during a recent site investigation sulfide was detected in the monitoring well 22 at a concentration of 0 022 mg l significantly higher than the concentration 0 005 mg l in groundwater monitoring wells in the upper chaobai river north of xiangyang sluice gate in conclusion mixing and sulfate reduction played a major role in the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in the chaobai river the research showed that the key influencing factors of groundwater hydrochemical evolution under long term reclaimed water infiltration included physical mixing carbonate mineral precipitation denitrification and sulfate reduction in addition a small amount of cation exchange and silicate minerals dissolution occurred except for sulfate reduction most of them were similar to the hydrochemical mechanism obtained in short term or long term studies yu et al 2013 2017 yin et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 li et al 2019 2021 see table s6 for details the above mentioned key factors not only determined the variation of main ion concentrations but also explained the evolution of comprehensive indexes such as ph tds and th in groundwater for example in the jian river the theoretical concentrations of ph tds and th were in good agreement with the measured concentration fig s5 fully illustrating the dominant role of physical mixing similar to a study in the huai river the concentrations of tds and other major hydrochemical components in groundwater were increased by mixing with reclaimed water yu et al 2017 in addition carbonate precipitation and denitrification had slight effects on ph tds and th concentrations such as tds and th concentrations decreased throughout the infiltration process due to carbonate precipitation for ph in the initial stage decreased by the h released from the carbonate precipitation which was consistent with another long term infiltration site research yin et al 2016 however in the later stage the ph gradually increased by denitrification in contrast for the chaobai river the increase of ph was significantly delayed with the mixing of reclaimed water and the concentrations of tds and th gradually decreased with infiltration but were significantly lower than the calculated concentrations in the later stage indicating that other than mixing water rock interactions also played a dominant role in the groundwater hydrochemical evolution the results showed that after mixing with reclaimed water groundwater absorbed more co2 from the soil during the early infiltration of reclaimed water effectively slowing down the trend of ph rise and carbonate precipitation however later the high concentration of toc in the reclaimed water and the accumulation of organic matter in the sediments promoted the generation of sulfate reduction sulfate reduction increased the ph and significantly decreased tds and th by reducing so4 2 and promoting carbonate precipitation implying that the hydrochemical mechanism reasonably explained the changes of the main ionic components and comprehensive indexes of groundwater during infiltration 3 5 genesis contribution of groundwater hydrochemical evolution in the chaobai river considering that the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in the jian river is relatively simple and has a well understanding of its genesis while the chaobai river is relatively complex therefore the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in chaobai river was further analyzed in mlr the dependent variable was groundwater quality represented by groundwater tds gwtds because tds is a comprehensive index of groundwater quality the independent variables influencing factors included rw quality rw infiltration amount and sediment thickness represented by rwtds rwtds groundwater depth change gwdh and rw permeability rate rwir respectively the reasons for choosing the above influencing factors are as follows according to the calculation the variation of groundwater tds was mainly controlled by physical mixing so rw quality and rw infiltration amount were selected as the influencing factors for physical mixing except for mixing the variation of seven major ion concentrations in groundwater accounted for 89 6 of the variation in tds concentration fig s6 indicating that this part of tds was mainly affected by water rock interactions since sediment thickness not only affected the infiltration rate but also the accumulated organic matter in the sediment facilitated sulfate reduction and thus carbonate precipitation the sediment thickness can be used as an influencing factor for groundwater quality the specific data of mlr are shown in fig s7 as early infiltration assessment in fig 3e the chaobai river was divided into two stages in the initial stage 2007 2008 that is the period when the sediment thickness was thin the mlr was used to investigate the relationship of rwtds and gwdh to gwtds fig 8 the results showed that the gwtds approached and fall into a surface dominated by rwtds and gwdh and all gwtds points were within the 95 confidence interval indicating the synergistic control of these two factors on groundwater quality in the initial stage 2007 2008 fig 8a the governing equation is expressed as gwtds 291 22 0 439rwtds 20 22gwdh r2 0 833 p 0 002 with a satisfactory goodness of fit proving by r2 p value and even model residuals fig 8b correspondingly the interpretation rate was 83 3 the comparison between the predicted values obtained from the expression and the observed values more intuitively shows the accuracy of the analysis results especially since the fitted line is close to the 1 1 line fig 8c finally the standardized coefficient eq 6 revealed that the contributions of rwtds and gwdh to gwtds were 53 5 and 29 8 respectively and the two factors explained 83 3 of the gwtds change in the second stage after the formation of sediment 2009 2018 the factors of rwtds and gwdh were found to be no longer sufficient to explain the changes in groundwater quality in this regard rwir was adopted to analyze the influence on groundwater quality together with rwtds and gwdh fig 9 a the results of mlr showed that gwtds could be expressed by gwtds 0 258rwtds 72 33gwdh 11 339 28rwir 57 195 r2 0 768 p 0 001 with 76 8 explanation of gwtds changes and even a satisfactory goodness fit of residuals fig 9b it can be firmed that the change of groundwater quality in the second stage is the result of the synergy of rwir rwtds and gwdh the comparison between the predicted values obtained from the expression and the observed values more intuitively shows the accuracy of the analysis results which is close to the 1 1 line fig 9c finally using the standardized coefficient eq 6 the contributions of rwtds gwdh and rwir to gwtds were 11 4 23 8 and 41 6 respectively indicating that the formation of sediment has a significant impact on the groundwater hydrochemical evolution based on the above research results it can be seen that the hydrochemistry evolution of groundwater was mainly controlled by rw quality and the rw infiltration amount in the first stage the less sediment formation led to more rw infiltration amount and thereby the strong mixing in groundwater hydrochemical evolution with the long term rw infiltration the impact of rw quality and rw infiltration amount on the groundwater hydrochemistry decreased progressively due to the gradual formation of the sediment similar to the mechanisms of groundwater chemical evolution in the long term infiltration zone of reclaimed water in the southern beijing plain human input significantly influenced groundwater chemistry in the thin aquitard however the existence of a thick aquitard greatly reduced the negative impact of reclaimed water on groundwater chemistry xiao et al 2017 in this study the main ionic components and comprehensive indexes of ph tds and th in groundwater changed significantly with sediment formation it was because thick sediments reduced the infiltration of reclaimed water and the organic matter accumulated in the sediments facilitated the removal of dissolved constituents by microbial mediated redox reactions this phenomenon was similar to the results of previous large scale column experiments in which thick sediments controlled the infiltration and water quality liu et al 2017b in addition for the long term reclaimed water infiltration site in nanhongmen beijing sediments also showed control on the groundwater hydrochemistry yin et al 2016 implying that sediment formation has a significant influence on the groundwater hydrochemical evolution during the long term reclaimed water infiltration 3 6 environmental implications water quality is influenced by water velocity when reclaimed water is replenished to the river lower flow rates led to a significant increase in ph which in turn affected water ecology he et al 2017 therefore slow water velocities should be avoided when using reclaimed water to replenish rivers or lakes during the long term infiltration of reclaimed water sediment formation has a significant impact on groundwater hydrochemical evolution yin et al 2016 pan et al 2018 for example the study area belongs to the middle segment of the chaobai alluvial diluvial fan the aquifer lithology of fine silt sand in the chaobai river is favorable for reclaimed water infiltration in the initial stage however with the formation of sediments the infiltration of reclaimed water reduced and the concentration of no3 n tds and th in groundwater decreased through water rock interactions which greatly weakened the negative impact of reclaimed water quality on groundwater while in the river sections with high permeability and low sediment formation such as jian river the no3 n concentration in groundwater increased and other groundwater hydrochemical components gradually approached that of reclaimed water indicating that reclaimed water should be used in appropriate areas to ensure safe utilization su et al 2014 alam et al 2021 such as areas with poor permeability in the lower reaches of the alluvial diluvial fan however if it is unavoidable to use in relatively sensitive river reaches similar to this study appropriate artificial anti seepage measures should be implemented to accelerate sediment deposition yu et al 2017 in conclusion even though it is difficult to effectively remove nitrogen and other constituents from reclaimed water at the current technological level selecting appropriate areas or implementing anti seepage measures may reduce the adverse impact of reclaimed water utilization on groundwater the study of macro components helps to understand the general evolution trends and control mechanism of groundwater hydrochemistry under long term reclaimed water infiltration and provides a preliminary reference for the safe utilization of reclaimed water however the evolution characteristics and hazards of trace constituents such as antibiotics and interferons are not clear detailed analysis of trace components should be conducted in the future to gain insight into the impact of reclaimed water infiltration on groundwater and provide support for the safe use of reclaimed water in addition the main limitation of this study is that the sulfate reduction obtained by analysis and simulation was only tentatively demonstrated by the microbial community analysis and sulfide sampling in groundwater conducted by predecessors in the chaobai river future research could collect sediment to analyze sulfate reduction products and analyze their role in controlling groundwater quality importantly only two groundwater monitoring wells near the river were analyzed in this study future studies could use multiple multi level monitoring wells attempt to simulate the hydrochemistry along a groundwater flowline and quantify redox zones by using phast or pht3d to better understand the impact mechanism of reclaimed water on the surrounding groundwater hydrochemistry 4 conclusion the monitoring data for 11 years showed that the reclaimed water quality was controlled by the water velocity in the river during long term infiltration of reclaimed water of different water quality differences of groundwater hydrochemical evolution characteristics were mediated synergically by sediment thickness and geochemical processes e g mixing and sulfate reduction in the jian river thinner sediment and strong mixing were confirmed to be the genesis of groundwater hydrochemical evolution progressively approaching reclaimed water in this case the quality of reclaimed water is very important however in the chaobai river reclaimed water quality and infiltration amount are the main influences on groundwater hydrochemistry in the initial stage 2007 2008 due to thinner sediment formation subsequently 2009 2018 with the increase in sediment thickness the infiltration rate of reclaimed water decreased and the concentration of macro components in groundwater decreased through water rock interactions leading to groundwater hydrochemical evolution trend away from reclaimed water indicating that the sediment formation may weaken the adverse impact of reclaimed water on groundwater which needs to be further confirmed in future studies these findings will shed light on the understanding of groundwater hydrochemical evolution under long term infiltration of reclaimed water which further guides the future safely reuse of reclaimed water through the prediction of evolution trends declaration of competing interest

15371,the reuse of reclaimed water rw for river ecological restoration in global water shortage regions has inevitably brought some potential risks for groundwater however little is known about the effects of reclaimed water on the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater especially under long term infiltration conditions herein 11 years monitoring data 2007 2018 of reclaimed water and groundwater were adopted to analyze the characteristics and genesis of groundwater hydrochemical evolution under long term infiltration of reclaimed water from jian river to chaobai river in beijing the results showed that the hydrochemical components in groundwater totally performed a significant increase in na cl and k and decrease in ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentration after long term infiltration of reclaimed water meanwhile a significant hydrochemical evolution difference between the groundwater of jian river and chaobai river was observed in jian river the hydrochemical type in groundwater shifted gradually from hco3 ca mg to the type of hco3 cl na ca approaching reclaimed water in contrast the hydrochemical evolution in the chaobai river shows an obvious opposite trend from hco3 ca mg to hco3 cl na mg and finally deviating reclaimed water type of cl hco3 so4 na phreeqc simulation indicated that the differences in hydrochemical evolution were mediated synergically by sediment thickness and geochemical processes e g mixing and sulfate reduction in such mediators thinner sediment and strong mixing in the jian river were confirmed to be the genesis of groundwater hydrochemical evolution progressively approaching reclaimed water different from the jian river multiple regression analyses revealed that the genesis of groundwater hydrochemical evolution in the chaobai river was divided into two stages according to the increase of sediment thickness reclaimed water quality and infiltration amount are the leading proposed cause in the initial stage 2007 2008 due to thinner sediment formation contributing 53 5 and 29 8 within the 95 confidence interval respectively subsequently the rise in sediment thickness is proved to play a crucial role in groundwater hydrochemical evolution trend away from reclaimed water 2009 2018 with a contribution of 41 6 within the 95 confidence interval it is mainly attributed to the reduced reclaimed water infiltration rate and favorable sulfate reduction conditions these findings advance our understanding on groundwater hydrochemical evolution under long term infiltration of reclaimed water and also guide future prediction of evolution trends graphcial absract image graphical abstract keywords reclaimed water groundwater hydrochemical evolution phreeqc simulation genesis data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction reclaimed water utilization for ecological replenishment of rivers is considered to be an important way to improve river water ecology especially in water shortage or arid and semi arid areas connor et al 2017 morsy et al 2018 the reuse of reclaimed water can not only restore the landscape of river water ecology but also conserve ecological water sources by replenishing groundwater to relieve the drop in groundwater level busico et al 2021 jiang et al 2022 research conducted over the past decade has demonstrated that reclaimed water still contains nitrogen heavy metals and organic pollutants even after being treated li et al 2019 deng et al 2019 owing to the infiltration of these complex components page et al 2018 previous studies have reported that the infiltration of reclaimed water led to the detection of nitrate ammonia li et al 2019 antibiotic zhang et al 2019a ding et al 2020 and endocrine disruptors ma et al 2015 lu et al 2020 in groundwater the impact of reclaimed water infiltration on groundwater quality poses a potential threat to human health therefore it is of great significance to study the impact of reclaimed water infiltration on groundwater quality one critical aspect of fully understanding the effect of reclaimed water on groundwater quality is to determine the change of hydrochemical indicators or so called hydrochemical processes including ph total dissolved solids tds hardness th physical mixing and water rock interactions etc yu et al 2013 2017 prior studies of column experiments showed that the th increased and cation exchange between k in water and ca2 in soil occurred during the infiltration of the reclaimed water in the chaobai river later a field study found that the shallow groundwater around the river is gradually replaced by reclaimed water due to the physical mixing and the salinity of groundwater increased significantly li et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 recent studies reflected physical mixing and water rock interactions such as mineral dissolution precipitation and cation exchange are the main roles in changing shallow groundwater hydrochemistry in the chaobai river by using isotope technique and multivariate statistical analysis he et al 2021 li et al 2021 however in most studies short term 1 3 years monitoring data are used to analyze the impact of reclaimed water infiltration on groundwater hydrochemistry yin et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 li et al 2021 2022 zhang et al 2021 the hydrochemical evolution characteristics and genesis of groundwater under long term infiltration are rarely mentioned owing to laboratory tests fakhreddine et al 2015 schafer et al 2018 and short term field injection trials seibert et al 2014 2016 were usually used to explore the early warning signs of geochemistry dis equilibrium in the reclaimed reuse areas the interpretation of these results can be used to identify the geochemical mechanisms that control the groundwater quality evolution such as cation exchange adsorption redox action etc but short term experiments preclude the discovery of any geochemical mechanisms that rely on the long term reclaimed water recharge sun et al 2020 it is anticipated that long term infiltration is far more complex than short term infiltration although the groundwater long term evolution characteristics in the chaobai river were analyzed by li et al 2019 they focused on the evolution of nitrogen and the systematic analysis of groundwater hydrochemical evolution was not involved therefore a systematic analysis using long term data is necessary another important component in characterizing the impact of reclaimed water infiltration on groundwater is the measurement of infiltration efficiency jiang et al 2022 many studies found that sediment deposition during the infiltration process was the main reason for the decline in infiltration efficiency su et al 2014 liu et al 2017b except for the infiltration efficiency it also played an important role in controlling groundwater hydrochemical evolution at the reclaimed water infiltration site of qingyang river in beijing river sediment was proved to control cod and no3 n entering groundwater pan et al 2018 in addition the dissolved organic matter in the reclaimed water was removed more effectively with the increased sediment thickness discovered through a large column test thereby the amount of organic matter nitrogen etc entering the groundwater was reduced li et al 2012 liu et al 2017b especially in the long term monitoring of the nanhongmen reclaimed water use area in beijing the increase of nh4 n concentration in groundwater and the linear correlation of cl between groundwater and reclaimed water were found after the removal of river sediment reflecting that sediment thickness had an important impact on groundwater hydrochemical evolution yin et al 2016 besides the biogeochemical processes may also be changed in the hyporheic zone during the infiltration of reclaimed water mclachlan et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 the hyporheic zone is an active interfacial zone of surface water and groundwater within river corridors busato et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 where the quality and quantity of exchange fluxes are affected by recharge conditions and geochemical processes oyarzún et al 2014 mclachlan et al 2017 lewandowski et al 2020 guo et al 2022 in the hyporheic zone the distribution of organic carbon toc and dissolved oxygen do may exhibit spatial gradients and respond to reclaimed water infiltration a redox gradient associated with doc consumption and do depletion drives biogeochemical transformation such as denitrification and sulfate reduction by which release of co2 and oh may further affect other water rock interactions such as the carbonate mineral dissolution precipitation li et al 2021 therefore except for mixing and water rock interactions the sediment deposition and biogeochemical changes of the hyporheic zone caused by long term infiltration of reclaimed water should also be considered in this regard 11 years monitoring data 2007 2018 of reclaimed water and groundwater were adopted to analyze the characteristics and genesis of groundwater hydrochemical evolution under long term infiltration of reclaimed water from jian river to chaobai river in beijing the objectives of this study were to 1 identify the characteristics of groundwater hydrochemical evolution during the long term infiltration of reclaimed water 2007 2018 2 analyze the genesis of groundwater hydrochemical evolution systematically and quantify the relative contribution of these underlying factors the innovation of this paper is to use long term continuous reclaimed water and groundwater hydrochemical data to systematically consider the effects of reclaimed water quality hydrogeological conditions sediment deposition and biogeochemistry of subsurface flow zone on groundwater hydrochemical evolution these findings will shed light on the understanding of groundwater hydrochemical evolution under long term infiltration of reclaimed water and also guide the future safely reuse of reclaimed water through the prediction of evolution trends 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the jian river a tributary of the chaobai river in shunyi and the chaobai river section from xiangyang sluice gate to the rubber dam of henan village fig 1 a the jian river and the chaobai river used to be dry rivers before 2007 due to decades of drought and large scale exploitation of groundwater to restore the ecology of the chaobai river and supplement groundwater a water transfer project was implemented by the beijing water authority in 2006 in the project the urban sewage from the wenyu river was treated by an oxidation pond and membrane bioreactor mbr then transferred to the jian river through an underground pipeline and finally flowed into the chaobai river zheng et al 2015 the jian river is an artificial river with two sloping sides and a natural river bottom it intersects with the chaobai river downstream of the xiangyang sluice gate the chaobai river section between xiangyang sluice gate and the rubber dam of henan village is a water receiving section with a length of about 7 3 km in the south of the earth dam the river is recharged with rw throughout the year while in the north the river receives rw recharge only in summer at the initial stage until february 2012 the water was transported to the north continuously in general from 2007 to the end of 2018 the actual water transfer amount of the project is 278 million m3 after years of water replenishment the water depths of chaobai river in the south of the earth dam and jian river are maintained at 2 30 2 60 m and 0 64 1 70 m respectively he et al 2018 the chaobai river has formed a wide water surface due to the interception of the rubber dam of henan village with 300 m long and 2 7 m high moreover its interception resulted in a flow velocity of only 1 49 10 3 m s which may provide sufficient time for a series of hydrochemical reactions in the chaobai river to change the reclaimed water quality except for total nitrogen the main design effluent quality indexes of the project meet the water quality standard for scenic environment use gb t18921 02 groundwater recharge gb t19772 05 and environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 in china see table s1 for details the climate is a typical of temperate continental semi humid monsoon with hot and rainy summers and cold and dry winters the annual average temperature and precipitation are 11 5 c and 578 5 mm respectively and the evaporation is 1300 mm the soil types in the study area are mainly paddy soil and fluvo aquic soil and the soil texture is mainly loam from the perspective of hydrogeology the study area belongs to the middle segment of the chaobai alluvial diluvial fan and the groundwater flow direction is from southwest to northeast due to overexploitation of large groundwater sources located upstream in the north the geological cross section profile performed that the lithology of the shallow aquifer gradually changes from gravel sand to clay and fine silt sand from north to south fig 1 b correspondingly from west to east it changes from clay to gravel with sand the potential recharge sources of groundwater in this study area are mainly atmospheric precipitation and reclaimed water infiltration lateral runoff and irrigation have little effect since that lateral runoff mainly occurs in deeper confined aquifers and the lack of large scale irrigated farmland in this area zhai et al 2013 hence irrigation infiltration and lateral groundwater recharge were not considered besides the chaobai river section to the north of the earth dam was also not considered due to intermittent receiving the recharge of reclaimed water and the strong effect of anthropogenic disturbance six surface water monitoring cross sections j1 j4 of the jian river and c1 c2 of the chaobai river were set up from upstream to downstream along the transfer water flow direction the two groundwater monitoring wells 31 and 22 correspond to j1 and c1 cross sections which were set at 30 m away from jian river and chaobai river respectively two other remote monitoring wells 23 and 26 were located 50 m and 100 m north of 22 respectively these shallow groundwater wells were designed to monitor the long term changes in groundwater level and water quality the specific locations of the monitoring cross sections and wells are shown in fig 1 the location of the screen pipe of each monitoring well were shown in fig s1 2 2 sampling and testing sampling work including reclaimed water and groundwater sampling was carried out at a frequency of 4 year for a total of 11 years 2007 2018 the sampling time of each year is march may september and november which represent the dry intermediate and wet periods of a complete hydrological year for the sampling of reclaimed water in the river a vertical water sampler was used to collect from 20 cm below the river surface and stored in polyethylene bottles 500 ml in comparison with reclaimed water sampling the collection of groundwater samples should firstly determine the groundwater level by using a sounding probe after that groundwater samples were collected by using a submersible pump grundfos sq2 70 denmark and stored in polyethylene bottles 500 ml after pumping for 10 25 min samples collections storage transport and tests were all undertaken with strict adherence to the guidelines of the regulation for water environmental monitoring sl219 98 text s1 the water temperature ph total dissolved solids tds dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured in situ with a portable multi parameter tester hq40d hach usa all samples were transported to the laboratory on the day and preserved in a refrigerator at 4 c until analysis the cation na mg2

cod is tested by the potassium dichromate method 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 calculation of reclaimed water infiltration amount and infiltration rate preliminary calculation of water balance was performed to evaluate the reclaimed water rw infiltration amount for water balance calculation rw diversion amount and atmospheric precipitation were selected as the input items while water surface evaporation amount river water storage and rw infiltration amount were chosen as output items the rw infiltration amount was calculated by using eq 1 yu et al 2017 jiang et al 2022 on this basis the rw infiltration rate was further calculated according to infiltration time and area eq 2 1 q i n f q d i v q p r e q e v q q s t o where qinf is the rw infiltration amount qdiv is the rw diversion amount qpre is the atmospheric precipitation qeva is the water surface evaporation amount in the equilibrium period and qsto is the river water storage which is estimated according to the water surface area of historical remote sensing images 2 q q i n f s t where q is the average daily infiltration rate qinf is the rw infiltration amount and s is the infiltration area t is the infiltration time 2 3 2 calculation of the mixing ratio and target component concentration as a conservative tracer ion cl is hardly affected by any biochemical reaction and adsorption during the infiltration process hence the concentration of cl can be used to estimate the proportions of the rw in the groundwater eq 3 on this basis the theoretical concentration of the target component in groundwater will be acquired through assuming the only occurrence of physical mixing eq 4 mienis and arye 2018 3 m r c m i x c b c i c b 4 c c a l m r c r w 1 m r c g w where mr is the fraction of the rw present in the aquifer cb

concentration of the target component in the groundwater crw is the input concentration of the target component in the rw and ccal is the calculated concentration of the target component in the groundwater 2 3 3 simulation analysis of water rock interaction geochemical evolution or inverse models were estimated using the geochemical code phreeqc inverse modeling is a process that finds sets of mineral and gas mole transfers that account for differences in the composition of an initial and final water within specified compositional uncertainty limits and is widely used in the hydrochemical simulation of groundwater flowlines hansen et al 2018 in recent years it has also been applied to analyze water rock interactions during the mixing of surface water with the initial groundwater into the monitoring well near the surface water body han et al 2011 walton day and mills 2015 jean baptist et al 2020 slama et al 2022 in this study the modeling seeks to describe the processes driving the chemical evolution from the physical mixing between rw and groundwater to the final groundwater in wells in each river segment the models of four mixing ratios 3 7 5 5 7 3 and 9 1 were constructed to reflect the characteristics of different infiltration stages table s2 the model included mineral dissolution precipitation cation exchange adsorption and redox reaction following the simulation the calculated results and measured results are compared to verify the reliability the mineral phase of the model is selected as follows firstly the mineral selection was determined by the main mineral composition in the study area table s3 the possible mineral facies k feldspar kalsi3o8 albite naalsi3o8 calcite caco3 dolomite camg co3 2 and ca montmorillonite ca0 165al2 33si3 67o10 oh 2 were selected then the hydrochemical indicators water temperature table s4 ph k ca2 na mg2 so4 2 cl hco3 etc were input into phreeqc to calculate the saturation index of the main minerals to force the minerals dissolution or precipitation in the reverse simulation secondly referring to previous column experiments cation exchange adsorption phases k and ca2 was added finally sulfate reduction and denitrification may occur during the rw infiltration so ch2o h2s n2 and co2 were used as mineral phases 2 3 4 multiple regression analysis multiple regression analysis mlr is applied to measure the relationship between multiple variables and predict the behavior of a dependent variable according to two or more independent variables mlr is frequently used as an approximating function or empirical model that allows a mathematical model to be established to describe a given actual phenomenon the mlr model is denoted as in eq 5 5 y i β 0 j 1 n β j x i j ε i i 1 m where yi is the dependent variable at the position i βj are the slope coefficients of the independent variable xij β0 is the intercept n is the number of independent variables m is the number of samples εi is the regression residual representing the unexplained part of the data the dependent variable that is groundwater hydrochemistry stabilizes the variance by natural logarithm transformation coefficients are calculated using ordinary least squares ols regression which weighed the effects of explanatory variables he et al 2019 mlr models were evaluated based on estimation coefficient p value of t test and determination coefficient r2 in model validation the predicted and observed values are plotted and compared with the 1 1 line to check the model fit and deviation the above analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics 24 0 software on this basis the relative contributions of independent variables are calculated to further analyze the relative importance of the impact of environmental variables on groundwater hydrochemical evolution eq 6 liu et al 2017a zhang et al 2019b 6 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 3 100 a 2 a 1 a 2 a 3 100 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 100 where a1 a2 a3 represent the contributions of three environment variables to the groundwater hydrochemical evolution respectively a 1 β 1 δx 1 a 2 β 2 δx 2 a 3 β 3 δx 3 δ is the standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental indicators of reclaimed water fig 2 shows the basic characteristics of reclaimed water quality in the jian river and chaobai river during the 11 year replenishment the ph values of jian river and chaobai river ranged from 8 18 0 46 and 8 67 0 60 respectively performing an increasing trend along the reclaimed water flow direction in contrast the tds decreased from 557 75 85 14 mg l to 458 18 85 87 mg l in the jian river and chaobai river implying the consumption of dissolved components in reclaimed water the th ca2 and hco3 showed similar variation trend with tds the characteristics of ph tds th ca2 and hco3 indicated that reclaimed water quality itself will also change when it was long term reused in the river channels this variation led to the obvious difference in the quality of reclaimed water between jian river and chaobai river fig s2 the cluster analysis results further supported this understanding two clusters were identified according to the reclaimed water quality throughout the river which still were jian river and chaobai river respectively text s2 the no3 n as the main component of tn maintained a higher level of 9 59 5 19 mg l in the jian river than chaobai river of 2 13 2 30 mg l while it was just opposite for codmn and chl a the average concentrations of codmn and chl a were 5 80 3 11 mg l and 46 86 103 22 μg l in the jian river and 8 65 3 84 mg l and 131 2 250 43 μg l in the chaobai river implying more organic carbon and algae in the chaobai river than jian river the change of reclaimed water quality itself after long term reused 2007 2018 in the river channels is also likely to have a potential impact on groundwater quality varieties in reclaimed water quality in rivers were mainly affected by the growth and reproduction of phytoplankton he et al 2017 several studies attributed phytoplankton growth and reproduction to excessive nutrient inputs carpenter and bennett 2011 némery et al 2016 in addition suitable sunlight and temperature can promote phytoplankton growth through photosynthesis and cell division respectively bowes et al 2016 lurling et al 2018 in the previous studies of our group temperature and sunlight determined the distribution of phytoplankton in the vertical direction of the river but the flow velocity was the most critical factor for phytoplankton growth and reproduction along the flow direction he et al 2017 similar to the construction of dams that significantly promoted the phytoplankton reproduction by slowing down the water flow rate némery et al 2016 the narrow channel and fast flow velocity of the jian river limited the reproduction of phytoplankton so the denitrification and photosynthesis were weak and the photosynthetic rate was close to the river sediment decomposition rate resulting in a less variety of ph and other water quality indicators and only a little sediment was generated thus the concentration of no3 n remained at a high level and the ph and concentration of toc were low in the jian river in addition the thin sediment produced in the river may be conducive to the infiltration of reclaimed water into groundwater and cause the quality of reclaimed water to have a great impact on the quality of groundwater compared with the jian river the wide channel and slow flow velocity in the chaobai river promoted the massive reproduction of phytoplankton meanwhile an anaerobic microenvironment favorable for denitrification was formed so the denitrification and photosynthesis were strong and the photosynthetic rate was higher than the sediment decomposition rate denitrification 2no3 10h hydrogen donor organic n2 2oh 4h2o and photosynthesis hco3 h2 ch2o oh o2 together increased the ph and toc significantly the high ph converted hco3 to co3 2 and co3 2 combined with ca2 to form caco3 therefore the above hydrochemical reactions reduced the no3 n tds th ca2 and hco3 concentration in the river he et al 2017 at the same time thick sediment was formed in the chaobai river reaching 1 08 m in the downstream and the organic matter increased to 9 43 g kg which were about 3 9 times of the background value fig s3 the thicker sediment may reduce the infiltration of reclaimed water and weaken the impacts of reclaimed water quality on groundwater quality thus the difference of reclaimed water quality between jian river and chaobai river and the formation of sediment are likely to have a potential impact on groundwater quality after long term infiltration 3 2 estimation of the amount of reclaimed water infiltration and the infiltration rate after the reclaimed water infiltrated the groundwater levels of the monitoring well 30 m away from jian river and chaobai river rose rapidly by about 1 m and 3 m respectively and then stabilized at about 28 m fig s4 to accurately assess the impact of long term infiltration of rw on groundwater two methods including water balance and chloride inversion were used to estimate the rw infiltration amount and rw infiltration rate fig 3 the water balance evaluation results demonstrated that the net infiltration amount qinft of rw was about 225 million m3 from 2007 to 2018 in the whole rw receiving area including the study area and outside the study area fig 3a the input items including rw diversion amount qdiv and the precipitation qpre were 278 and 42 million m3 respectively the water surface evaporation amount qeva and the water storage capacity qsto served as output items were 71 and 14 million m3 in the river channel during these net amount infiltration processes the rw infiltration rate performed a decrease trend from 0 032 m d to 0 008 m d fig 3b correspondingly the rw infiltration amount qinfs in this study area also decreased from 13 6 million m3 yr to 7 39 million m3 yr it was presumably related to the formation of sediment in the river in comparison with water balance evaluation results the results of chloride ion evaluation showed that the mixing ratio of rw to groundwater in the two river segments gradually increased to 80 90 2007 2018 fig 3c about 48 2 million m3 reclaimed water in the chaobai river seeped into the groundwater fig 3d the infiltration volume of 48 2 million m3 was similar to water balance evaluation result of 46 1 million m3 with only 4 4 relative error confirming the reliable of chloride ion evaluation results hence the chloride ion inversion was further used to explore the differences in infiltration between the jian river and the chaobai river text s3 fig 3e showed the change rate of the mixing ratio of reclaimed water and groundwater in the jian river and chaobai river it can be seen that the mixing ratio in the jian river increased more quickly than chaobai river especially the first two monitoring subsequently after 2008 an obvious decreased trend in the change rate of mixing ratio was observed in both jian river and chaobai river and the chaobai river decreased more sharply it is inferred that this change is likely to be related to the hydrogeological conditions and the formation of sediments the aquifer lithology of fine sand coupled with the deposition of thin sediments jointly result in a long term larger infiltration rate for the jian river in comparison the aquifer lithology of silty fine sand in chaobai river led to a slow reclaimed water infiltration rate this process was further exacerbated by the formation of thick sediments after may 2008 with a dramatic drop in infiltration rates this was also reflected in the changes in the groundwater level compared with jian river the groundwater level of chaobai river had a significant downward tendency since may 2008 however the infiltration volume of reclaimed water and the groundwater level increased slightly with the increase of reclaimed water supply in the later stage the difference in infiltration amount and infiltration rate of reclaimed water between jian river and chaobai river might also the potential factors affecting the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater 3 3 hydrochemical evolution of groundwater under long term reclaimed water infiltration according to the pre data analysis the three groundwater monitoring wells in section c1 had the same groundwater hydrochemical evolution trend moreover the groundwater hydrochemistry of the monitoring well closest to the river channel was more strongly changed and less affected by other anthropogenic factors text s4 therefore monitoring wells 31 and 22 were selected to better systematically explore the characteristics and mechanism of groundwater hydrochemical evolution under the influence of rw infiltration in jian river and chaobai river respectively fig 4 in the long term infiltration of rw in the jian river the results showed that the average ph of groundwater changed from 8 07 before infiltration to 8 00 0 33 tds changed from 562 to 549 7 51 6 mg l and th changed from 355 to 217 9 28 9 mg l finally there was no significant difference with ph of 7 97 0 22 tds of 557 5 56 9 mg l and th of 242 1 20 9 mg l of reclaimed water implying the basic hydrochemical index of groundwater in the jian river gradually approached to rw after long term infiltration it is inferred that mixing plays an important role in the jian river results from chaobai river showed that the average ph of groundwater increased from 7 7 before infiltration to 8 25 0 24 closed to rw ph of 8 40 0 43 differently the concentrations of tds and th performed a significant downward trend from 503 mg l before infiltration to 335 52 0 mg l and from 392 to 123 5 27 5 mg l respectively lower than that of 447 7 75 3 and 164 7 43 6 mg l in reclaimed water this finding confirmed that the hydrochemical evolution characteristics of groundwater varied in river segments moreover different from jian river chaobai river may have other geochemical effects in addition to mixing to gain insight into the groundwater hydrochemical evolution after reclaimed water infiltration stiff diagram was used to investigate the variation of the major ions composition in groundwater from 2007 to 2018 fig 5 in the jian river a significant increase trend in na cl k and so4 2 were observed the average concentrations of na cl k and so4 2 increased from 56 6 62 2 2 and 99 8 mg l before infiltration to 96 4 108 11 8 and 110 mg l respectively it was comparable to these indicators in reclaimed water 93 2 94 1 14 7 and 103 5 mg l indicating the infiltration of high salinity rw into groundwater contrary to na cl k and so4 2 the average ca2 mg2 and hco3 tended to decrease from 114 36 5 and 554 mg l to 57 2 24 4 and 254 mg l close to reclaimed water 59 3 22 7 and 219 9 mg l implying infiltration leading to the reduction of the hardness in groundwater with the action of these ions composition the hydrochemical type in groundwater shifted gradually from hco3 ca mg to the type of hco3 cl na ca approaching reclaimed water in the jian river accompanied by a decrease in tds compared with the hydrochemical evolution in the jian river the hydrochemical evolution of the chaobai river is obviously different from that of the jian river the average na cl and k in groundwater increased progressively from 21 2 to 80 1 mg l 30 5 to 96 mg l and 2 24 to 5 44 mg l after reclaimed water infiltration respectively nonetheless it was still lower than that of the rw especially k 14 4 mg l on one hand this probably related to the less infiltration caused by the thicker sediment and finer lithology of the chaobai river on the other hand some other reactions may have occurred the smaller increment of k concentration in groundwater of chaobai river than in the jian river is probably related to the strong cation exchange caused by the thicker sediment of chaobai river it is noteworthy that the infiltration resulted in a significant reduction of so4 2 from 57 8 mg l to 14 9 mg l even when so4 2 concentration in the reclaimed water was as high as 107 6 mg l implying the occurrence of sulfate reduction in groundwater of the chaobai river the concentration of ca2 mg2 and hco3 decreased from 113 26 and 468 mg l to 25 18 9 and 195 mg l after reclaimed water infiltration respectively finally the contents of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater were even lower than those in reclaimed water 32 2 and 21 4 mg l in fact the simple mixing and dilution of reclaimed water is not enough to cause the ca2 and mg2 content to drop to this level hence it is speculated that mineral precipitation has occurred under these complex water rock interactions hydrochemical evolution in chaobai river performed a significant difference from jian river the hydrochemical types in the chaobai river show an obvious opposite trend from hco3 ca mg to hco3 cl na mg and finally deviating reclaimed water type of cl hco3 so4 na 3 4 influence of water rock interactions on hydrochemical evolution of groundwater the comparison of theoretical calculation results of ionic concentration based on mixing ratio of reclaimed water infiltration and measured results was used to judge the potential geochemical processes fig s5 the results showed that the theoretical concentration of na was in good agreement with the measured concentration fully illustrating the existence of physical mixing and its dominant role in addition there are also some indicators show that the theoretical calculation results are inconsistent with the measured results such as ca2 mg2 hco3 k and so4 2 indicating the existence of other water rock interactions except physical mixing fig s5 to this end phreeqc reverse simulation was used to reveal these potential geochemical processes the calcite and dolomite were supersaturated in reclaimed water and groundwater table s5 thus the negative molar transfer value of calcite 0 13 0 708 and dolomite 0 028 0 335 reflected carbonate minerals precipitation is an inevitable process for hydrochemical evolution after reclaimed water infiltration table 1 the molar transfer of calcite and dolomite was two orders of magnitude higher than that of albite and ca montmorillonite further strengthening the effect of carbonate minerals precipitation on groundwater hydration the pco2 of groundwater decreased with the infiltration of reclaimed water illustrating that the infiltration of reclaimed water broke the carbonate balance in return the change of carbonate balance with mixing ratio of reclaimed water and groundwater will affect the molar transfer of calcite and dolomite galli et al 2014 romero et al 2019 the negative values of n2 0 191 0 772 and h2s 0 1 0 856 indicated the occurrence of denitrification and sulfate reduction in the infiltration process the negative molar transfer value of k 0 118 0 294 and positive value of ca2 0 059 0 147 indicated the exchange between k in reclaimed water and ca2 in sediment also has an impact on the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater the consistency of the actually measured results and phreeqc reverse simulation effectively confirmed the inferred reason for groundwater hydrochemical evolution under the influence of long term reclaimed water infiltration fig 6 specifically for jian river the gradually reduction of inorganic carbon in groundwater with increasing mixing ratio fully demonstrated the huge role of physical mixing and carbonate precipitation during infiltration fig 6a in contrast inorganic carbon in groundwater of chaobai river decreased first and then increased when mixing ratio reached 9 1 fig 6b this variation is mainly attributed to co2 absorption and carbonate minerals precipitation the pco2 of reclaimed water 3 17 0 54 was lower than that of groundwater 2 35 0 21 resulting in the absorption of co2 in soil by groundwater increased with the reclaimed water infiltration according to the carbonic acid balance principle the absorbed co2 could increase inorganic carbon by reducing the carbonate precipitation and ph thus alleviating the decrement of inorganic carbon in fact however the carbonate precipitation in the groundwater of jian river and chaobai river did not show a significant or a continuous decreasing trend fig 6c for jian river this is probably related to alkali production oh by denitrification the generation of n2 increased from 0 415 mmol l to 0 772 mmol l revealing the occurrence of denitrification and tended to intensify with the increase of mixing ratio table 1 for chaobai river the change in carbonate precipitation that first decreased and then increased is likely to be related to sulfate reduction the generation of h2s increased from 0 100 mmol l to 0 856 mmol l indicating the occurrence of desulphurization and tended to intensify after the mixing ratio reached 1 1 the cation exchange capacity of k and ca2 in the groundwater of chaobai river was higher than in jian river which is related to the thickness of sediment through the above analysis it can be known that the hydrochemical evolution caused by the long term infiltration of reclaimed water is the result of the joint action of multi geochemical processes the thinner sediment and strong mixing in the jian river were considered as the primary reasons of groundwater hydrochemical evolution progressively approaching reclaimed water different from jian river in addition to mixing the strong sulfate reduction in the chaobai river was considered also play an important role in the groundwater hydrochemical evolution fig 7 the high concentration of toc in reclaimed water 5 6 13 8 mg l and organic matter in sediment 9 43 g kg provided sufficient nutrients for sulfate reduction in addition the lower eh 118 3 mv do 3 4 mg l no3 n 0 03 mg l and higher nh4 n 2 26 mg l and fe 0 50 mg l indicated that the groundwater in the chaobai river was in a strong reductive environment huang et al 2022 in this situation sulfate reducing occurred to promote the reduction of so4 2 to h2s and produce co2 and oh cypionka et al 1995 jurado et al 2013 the high abundances of sulfate reducing bacteria proteobacteria 88 6 and desulfobacterota 1 1 reported in the groundwater of chaobai river also supported this perception li et al 2022 moreover during a recent site investigation sulfide was detected in the monitoring well 22 at a concentration of 0 022 mg l significantly higher than the concentration 0 005 mg l in groundwater monitoring wells in the upper chaobai river north of xiangyang sluice gate in conclusion mixing and sulfate reduction played a major role in the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in the chaobai river the research showed that the key influencing factors of groundwater hydrochemical evolution under long term reclaimed water infiltration included physical mixing carbonate mineral precipitation denitrification and sulfate reduction in addition a small amount of cation exchange and silicate minerals dissolution occurred except for sulfate reduction most of them were similar to the hydrochemical mechanism obtained in short term or long term studies yu et al 2013 2017 yin et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 li et al 2019 2021 see table s6 for details the above mentioned key factors not only determined the variation of main ion concentrations but also explained the evolution of comprehensive indexes such as ph tds and th in groundwater for example in the jian river the theoretical concentrations of ph tds and th were in good agreement with the measured concentration fig s5 fully illustrating the dominant role of physical mixing similar to a study in the huai river the concentrations of tds and other major hydrochemical components in groundwater were increased by mixing with reclaimed water yu et al 2017 in addition carbonate precipitation and denitrification had slight effects on ph tds and th concentrations such as tds and th concentrations decreased throughout the infiltration process due to carbonate precipitation for ph in the initial stage decreased by the h released from the carbonate precipitation which was consistent with another long term infiltration site research yin et al 2016 however in the later stage the ph gradually increased by denitrification in contrast for the chaobai river the increase of ph was significantly delayed with the mixing of reclaimed water and the concentrations of tds and th gradually decreased with infiltration but were significantly lower than the calculated concentrations in the later stage indicating that other than mixing water rock interactions also played a dominant role in the groundwater hydrochemical evolution the results showed that after mixing with reclaimed water groundwater absorbed more co2 from the soil during the early infiltration of reclaimed water effectively slowing down the trend of ph rise and carbonate precipitation however later the high concentration of toc in the reclaimed water and the accumulation of organic matter in the sediments promoted the generation of sulfate reduction sulfate reduction increased the ph and significantly decreased tds and th by reducing so4 2 and promoting carbonate precipitation implying that the hydrochemical mechanism reasonably explained the changes of the main ionic components and comprehensive indexes of groundwater during infiltration 3 5 genesis contribution of groundwater hydrochemical evolution in the chaobai river considering that the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in the jian river is relatively simple and has a well understanding of its genesis while the chaobai river is relatively complex therefore the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in chaobai river was further analyzed in mlr the dependent variable was groundwater quality represented by groundwater tds gwtds because tds is a comprehensive index of groundwater quality the independent variables influencing factors included rw quality rw infiltration amount and sediment thickness represented by rwtds rwtds groundwater depth change gwdh and rw permeability rate rwir respectively the reasons for choosing the above influencing factors are as follows according to the calculation the variation of groundwater tds was mainly controlled by physical mixing so rw quality and rw infiltration amount were selected as the influencing factors for physical mixing except for mixing the variation of seven major ion concentrations in groundwater accounted for 89 6 of the variation in tds concentration fig s6 indicating that this part of tds was mainly affected by water rock interactions since sediment thickness not only affected the infiltration rate but also the accumulated organic matter in the sediment facilitated sulfate reduction and thus carbonate precipitation the sediment thickness can be used as an influencing factor for groundwater quality the specific data of mlr are shown in fig s7 as early infiltration assessment in fig 3e the chaobai river was divided into two stages in the initial stage 2007 2008 that is the period when the sediment thickness was thin the mlr was used to investigate the relationship of rwtds and gwdh to gwtds fig 8 the results showed that the gwtds approached and fall into a surface dominated by rwtds and gwdh and all gwtds points were within the 95 confidence interval indicating the synergistic control of these two factors on groundwater quality in the initial stage 2007 2008 fig 8a the governing equation is expressed as gwtds 291 22 0 439rwtds 20 22gwdh r2 0 833 p 0 002 with a satisfactory goodness of fit proving by r2 p value and even model residuals fig 8b correspondingly the interpretation rate was 83 3 the comparison between the predicted values obtained from the expression and the observed values more intuitively shows the accuracy of the analysis results especially since the fitted line is close to the 1 1 line fig 8c finally the standardized coefficient eq 6 revealed that the contributions of rwtds and gwdh to gwtds were 53 5 and 29 8 respectively and the two factors explained 83 3 of the gwtds change in the second stage after the formation of sediment 2009 2018 the factors of rwtds and gwdh were found to be no longer sufficient to explain the changes in groundwater quality in this regard rwir was adopted to analyze the influence on groundwater quality together with rwtds and gwdh fig 9 a the results of mlr showed that gwtds could be expressed by gwtds 0 258rwtds 72 33gwdh 11 339 28rwir 57 195 r2 0 768 p 0 001 with 76 8 explanation of gwtds changes and even a satisfactory goodness fit of residuals fig 9b it can be firmed that the change of groundwater quality in the second stage is the result of the synergy of rwir rwtds and gwdh the comparison between the predicted values obtained from the expression and the observed values more intuitively shows the accuracy of the analysis results which is close to the 1 1 line fig 9c finally using the standardized coefficient eq 6 the contributions of rwtds gwdh and rwir to gwtds were 11 4 23 8 and 41 6 respectively indicating that the formation of sediment has a significant impact on the groundwater hydrochemical evolution based on the above research results it can be seen that the hydrochemistry evolution of groundwater was mainly controlled by rw quality and the rw infiltration amount in the first stage the less sediment formation led to more rw infiltration amount and thereby the strong mixing in groundwater hydrochemical evolution with the long term rw infiltration the impact of rw quality and rw infiltration amount on the groundwater hydrochemistry decreased progressively due to the gradual formation of the sediment similar to the mechanisms of groundwater chemical evolution in the long term infiltration zone of reclaimed water in the southern beijing plain human input significantly influenced groundwater chemistry in the thin aquitard however the existence of a thick aquitard greatly reduced the negative impact of reclaimed water on groundwater chemistry xiao et al 2017 in this study the main ionic components and comprehensive indexes of ph tds and th in groundwater changed significantly with sediment formation it was because thick sediments reduced the infiltration of reclaimed water and the organic matter accumulated in the sediments facilitated the removal of dissolved constituents by microbial mediated redox reactions this phenomenon was similar to the results of previous large scale column experiments in which thick sediments controlled the infiltration and water quality liu et al 2017b in addition for the long term reclaimed water infiltration site in nanhongmen beijing sediments also showed control on the groundwater hydrochemistry yin et al 2016 implying that sediment formation has a significant influence on the groundwater hydrochemical evolution during the long term reclaimed water infiltration 3 6 environmental implications water quality is influenced by water velocity when reclaimed water is replenished to the river lower flow rates led to a significant increase in ph which in turn affected water ecology he et al 2017 therefore slow water velocities should be avoided when using reclaimed water to replenish rivers or lakes during the long term infiltration of reclaimed water sediment formation has a significant impact on groundwater hydrochemical evolution yin et al 2016 pan et al 2018 for example the study area belongs to the middle segment of the chaobai alluvial diluvial fan the aquifer lithology of fine silt sand in the chaobai river is favorable for reclaimed water infiltration in the initial stage however with the formation of sediments the infiltration of reclaimed water reduced and the concentration of no3 n tds and th in groundwater decreased through water rock interactions which greatly weakened the negative impact of reclaimed water quality on groundwater while in the river sections with high permeability and low sediment formation such as jian river the no3 n concentration in groundwater increased and other groundwater hydrochemical components gradually approached that of reclaimed water indicating that reclaimed water should be used in appropriate areas to ensure safe utilization su et al 2014 alam et al 2021 such as areas with poor permeability in the lower reaches of the alluvial diluvial fan however if it is unavoidable to use in relatively sensitive river reaches similar to this study appropriate artificial anti seepage measures should be implemented to accelerate sediment deposition yu et al 2017 in conclusion even though it is difficult to effectively remove nitrogen and other constituents from reclaimed water at the current technological level selecting appropriate areas or implementing anti seepage measures may reduce the adverse impact of reclaimed water utilization on groundwater the study of macro components helps to understand the general evolution trends and control mechanism of groundwater hydrochemistry under long term reclaimed water infiltration and provides a preliminary reference for the safe utilization of reclaimed water however the evolution characteristics and hazards of trace constituents such as antibiotics and interferons are not clear detailed analysis of trace components should be conducted in the future to gain insight into the impact of reclaimed water infiltration on groundwater and provide support for the safe use of reclaimed water in addition the main limitation of this study is that the sulfate reduction obtained by analysis and simulation was only tentatively demonstrated by the microbial community analysis and sulfide sampling in groundwater conducted by predecessors in the chaobai river future research could collect sediment to analyze sulfate reduction products and analyze their role in controlling groundwater quality importantly only two groundwater monitoring wells near the river were analyzed in this study future studies could use multiple multi level monitoring wells attempt to simulate the hydrochemistry along a groundwater flowline and quantify redox zones by using phast or pht3d to better understand the impact mechanism of reclaimed water on the surrounding groundwater hydrochemistry 4 conclusion the monitoring data for 11 years showed that the reclaimed water quality was controlled by the water velocity in the river during long term infiltration of reclaimed water of different water quality differences of groundwater hydrochemical evolution characteristics were mediated synergically by sediment thickness and geochemical processes e g mixing and sulfate reduction in the jian river thinner sediment and strong mixing were confirmed to be the genesis of groundwater hydrochemical evolution progressively approaching reclaimed water in this case the quality of reclaimed water is very important however in the chaobai river reclaimed water quality and infiltration amount are the main influences on groundwater hydrochemistry in the initial stage 2007 2008 due to thinner sediment formation subsequently 2009 2018 with the increase in sediment thickness the infiltration rate of reclaimed water decreased and the concentration of macro components in groundwater decreased through water rock interactions leading to groundwater hydrochemical evolution trend away from reclaimed water indicating that the sediment formation may weaken the adverse impact of reclaimed water on groundwater which needs to be further confirmed in future studies these findings will shed light on the understanding of groundwater hydrochemical evolution under long term infiltration of reclaimed water which further guides the future safely reuse of reclaimed water through the prediction of evolution trends declaration of competing interest

15372,aerobic methane oxidation coupled with denitrification ame d executed in membrane biofilm bioreactors mbfrs provides a high promise for simultaneously mitigating methane ch4 emissions and removing nitrate in wastewater however systematically experimental investigation on how oxygen partial pressure affects the development and characteristics of counter diffusional biofilm as well as its spatial stratification profiles and the cooperative interaction of the biofilm microbes is still absent in this study we combined optical coherence tomography oct with confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm to in situ characterize the development of counter diffusion biofilm in the mbfr for the first time it was revealed that oxygen partial pressure onto the mbfr was capable of manipulating biofilm thickness and spatial stratification and then managing the distribution of functional microbes with the optimized oxygen partial pressure of 5 5 psig 25 oxygen content the manipulated counter diffusional biofilm in the ame d process obtained the highest denitrification efficiency due mainly to that this biofilm had the proper dynamic balance between the aerobic layer and anoxic layer where suitable o2 gradient and sufficient aerobic methanotrophs were achieved in aerobic layer to favor methane oxidation and complete o2 depletion and accessible organic sources were kept to avoid constraining denitrification activity in anoxic layer by using metagenome analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish staining the spatial distribution of the functional microbes within counter diffused biofilm was successfully evidenced and rhodocyclaceae one typical aerobic denitrifier was found to survive and gradually enriched in the aerobic layer and played a key role in denitrification aerobically this in situ biofilm visualization and characterization evidenced directly for the first time the cooperative path of denitrification for ame d in the counter diffused biofilm which involved aerobic methanotrophs heterotrophic aerobic denitrifiers and heterotrophic anoxic denitrifiers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ame d biofilm stratification cooperation mechanism mbfr oxygen partial pressure data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction methane ch4 the second largest contributor to the global warming effect has increased to 1800 ppb in global atmospheric concentrations representing an increase of 250 in comparison to the pre industrial level kirschke et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 wastewater treatment plants wwtps and landfills are identified as the important sources of methane emissions which are responsible for over 16 of global anthropogenic methane emissions nie et al 2019 scheutz et al 2022 ch4 is mainly generated in the process of the anaerobic sludge digestion in wwtps and bio solids degradation in landfills modin et al 2007 additionally nitrate removal based on biological denitrification is one of the most essential objectives in municipal wastewater and landfill leachate treatment xing et al 2018 during which biodegradable organics existing in wastewater can serve as an electron donor for heterotrophic microorganisms to complete biological denitrification however biodegradable organics are always insufficient in municipal wastewater or landfill leachate and thus additional electron donor is highly required modin et al 2010a methane has been successfully demonstrated to be a potential electron donor to replace traditional carbon sources for biological denitrification by executing aerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification ame d process modin et al 2007 zhu et al 2016 therefore applying the ame d process in wwtps and landfills is a potentially economical and simple way of simultaneously removing nitrate and mitigating methane emissions modin et al 2007 membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs have been successfully employed to execute the ame d process for nitrate removal in wastewater lee et al 2019 martin and nerenberg 2012 modin et al 2007 during the ame d process executed in mbfrs gaseous substrates i e ch4 and o2 are directly transferred from the membrane lumen to biofilms formed on the outer surface of the membrane while the complementary nitrate substrate diffuses from the bulk liquid into the interior of the biofilm martin and nerenberg 2012 modin et al 2010b this unique counter diffusional behavior in the biofilm of mbfrs tends to create the aerobic space where aerobic methane oxidation takes place and the anoxic space where traditional denitrification can occur by using organic compounds released by the aerobic methanotrophs modin et al 2008 in this biofilm based ame d process the biofilm often harbors complex substrates transfer microbial community distribution and metabolic reactions carrying out its own function thus reasonable biofilm management by controlling mbfrs operation parameters is expected to ensure the proper microbial community and spatial distribution which then help to sustain the most favorable metabolism and interactions that can contribute to the efficiency of the ame d process ontiveros valencia et al 2018 the primary goal of the ame d process in mbfrs is to remove nitrate in wastewater where oxygen is one of the most important operational parameters affecting denitrification modin et al 2007 zhu et al 2017 excellent o2 availability is required for aerobic methanotrophs to utilize ch4 effectively whereas excessive oxygen is undesirable because it would inhibit denitrification liu et al 2021 to explore the proper o2 supplement for the ame d process most previous efforts mainly concerned the effects of varied oxygen supply regimes or different oxygen content injected in the headspace of serum bottles on microbial communities and denitrification efficiency of co diffusional suspended sludge table 1 as for the counter diffusional biofilm based ame d process controlling oxygen supply through oxygen partial pressure in the membrane lumen may be capable of manipulating the biofilm s structure and the distribution of aerobic and anoxic space within the biofilm rishell et al 2004 to date however a systematically experimental evaluation on the effects of oxygen partial pressure in the mbfrs on the counter diffusional biofilm characteristics especially for the aspects of morphology and composition characteristics spatial stratification and interaction mechanisms in the ame d process is rarely investigated especially in situ capturing the development of counter diffusional biofilm with the operation of mbfrs at different oxygen partial pressures will be very helpful to enlighten the linkages in oxygen partial pressure factor to biofilm development to denitrification function in this study the objectives are to reveal the dynamic development of biofilm characteristics at different oxygen partial pressure and investigate the biological cooperative mechanisms for denitrification in the ame d process six laboratory scale mbfrs with different oxygen partial pressures were operated in parallel to compare biofilm development and denitrification performance firstly the dynamic differences in biofilm morphology characteristics were visually evaluated in situ by combining confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm and optical coherence tomography oct and then the biofilm composition including extracellular polymeric substances eps and 16 s rrna analysis were also conducted secondly the responses of the biofilm spatial stratification to oxygen partial pressure were examined by using microelectrodes and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis to in depth unveil the microbial distributions and metabolism behaviors finally comprehensive metagenome analysis was performed to identify the cooperative interactions involved in methane oxidation and denitrification during the ame d process the obtained results can not only provide directly visual evidence for the biofilm management and stratification in the counter diffusional mbfr but also identified the actual microbes involved in the ame d process which are significant to the methane based bioreactor development and application and to in depth understand the ame d process 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbfr configuration each laboratory scale mbfr chamber was made from plexiglas tube with a total volume of 650 ml 8 cm in diameter and 13 cm in height and a working volume of 600 ml each mbfr was equipped with seven bundles of gas permeable polypropylene pp membrane tm 830y teijin ltd japan fig s1 each bundle consisted of ten hollow fibers 200 μm outer diameter and 50 μm inner diameter with a length of 20 cm and its ends were carefully sealed within a polyurethane pu tube that acts as an individual membrane module to facilitate biofilm growth and sampling two ends of each membrane module were fed with mixed gaseous substrates in which ch4 o2 and he were separately supplied by gas cylinder 99 99 shente gas co ltd china the gaseous substrate flowrates were accurately adjusted in its specific proportions by using pressure flow meters mic21 beijing jes technology co ltd china liquid re circulation at a flowrate of 6 l min 1 was applied through a magnetic circulating pump to ensure the inoculum biomass remained completely suspended and their fully contact with the membrane surface thereby to facilitate the initial adhesion of microorganisms on the membrane surface and subsequent biofilm formation during the operational period more than 90 suspended biomass including inoculated and detached from biofilm were discharged from mbfrs at the end of each stage by exchanging with fresh nms medium detailed description in section 2 2 therefore the role of the suspended inoculum biomass was mainly to provide microbe sources for initial adhesion on the membrane surface during operational stage i the bulk ph and dissolved oxygen do were real time monitored using ph and do sensor remond china respectively the feeding bottle containing synthetic nitrate mineral salt nms medium was used to replenish nutrients required for biofilm development through a peristaltic pump bt100 longerpump china before the beginning of every operation stage the related operation time and duration were given in detailed in section 2 2 six equal equipment aforementioned mbfrs were operated in parallel with different o2 partial pressures to study the responses of biofilm characteristics 2 2 biofilm characterization in mbfrs initially six mbfrs were separately inoculated with 60 ml of acclimated biomass to provide the microbe sources for initial adhesion of microorganisms onto the membrane surface lu et al 2021 and the detailed description on the acclimated biomass was given in supporting information to prevent biomass loss through effluent and to form biofilm steady all mbfrs were operated at batch mode by periodically exchanging nms medium with a constant no3 n concentration of 40 mg l 1 and other necessary elements for microorganisms growth nie et al 2021 the period of nsm medium exchange was maintained at 6 10 days to facilitate to capture the dynamic biofilm characteristics during its development process under each oxygen partial pressure applied once the mbfr performed a relatively steady nitrate removal flux the oct observation on the biofilm thickness was conducted once each day for three consecutive days if the standard deviations of the biofilm thickness were less than 10 of the average values and nitrate removal flux remained relatively stable for at least one week the biofilm was deemed to be mature and then the operation of mbfrs was completed overall all mbfrs were operated for five batch periods by periodical nsm medium exchanges all batch periods were consistently maintained for the same operational conditions and nsm content after assessing denitrification performance and biofilm characteristics thickness and coverage factor of all mbfrs at different periods five batch periods were simply divided into four stages named as stage i days 1 6 stage ii days 7 15 stage iii days 16 25 and stage iv days 26 34 and 35 41 respectively stages i to iii was consistent with nms exchanged period whereas stage iv consisted of two periods to ensure that all mbfrs remained a relatively stable level for at least one week more than 90 volume of the suspension was exchanged with fresh nms medium through a peristaltic pump bt100 longerpump china before the next stage began the detailed compositions of the feeding nms medium containing phosphate buffer and essential trace elements were given in table s1 the six mbfrs were separately supplied with pre determined mixed gaseous substrates with different ratios of he o2 ch4 table 2 the total pressure of gaseous mixtures in the membrane lumen was consistently kept at 22 psig by using a pressure relief valve r13 gentec china the temperature and ph of all mbfrs were maintained at 35 2 c and 7 0 0 5 throughout the operation stages 2 3 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm observation biofilm segments of the mbfrs were regularly collected at the end of each operation stage by cutting off about 1 cm in length at the top middle and bottom of the randomly selected membrane all biofilm samples were immediately stained with live dead biofilm viability kit invitrogen ca according to the manufacturer instructions and then visualized the biofilm morphological structure by using confocal laser scanning microscopy observation clsm air mp nikon japan to quantify the spatial morphology differences in the biofilm among different mbfrs during their operations stages the modified method for estimating the coverage area occupied by microbes on the membrane was adopted by referring to the solutions to quantify bacterial populations vázquez padín et al 2010 the clsm images were analyzed by imagej software the coverage area of microbes on the membrane surface corresponding to the fluorescence area of each clsm image was estimated based on the total area of all pixels above one manually determined value yang et al 2018 the biofilm coverage factor was calculated according to eq 1 1 b i o f i l m c o v e r a g e f a c t o r b i o f i l m f l u o r e s c

thickness of biofilm by using fourier domain optical coherence tomography oct thorlabs gan620c1 usa at the end of each operating stage three dimensional 3 d biofilm images were constructed by allowing the light source from the oct probe to scan a rectangular region of 1 00 mm 4 25 mm including the membrane surface corresponding to a physical depth of 2 75 mm the captured images were collected and processed by using thorimageoct 5 2 1 software thorlabs gan620c1 usa the two dimensional 2 d horizontal images were exported by setting the image direction to x z slice and y slice value to half of available range dreszer et al 2014 the calculated values of the biofilm thickness refer to the average of several measurements captured at the top middle and bottom of each biofilm sample 2 5 eps extraction quantification and characterization each collected biofilm sample was firstly placed in a 10 ml centrifuge tube and then re suspended to 8 ml by adding distilled water the obtained suspension was vortexed for 10 min to keep the biomass homogeneously mixed half of this mixture was taken to measure volatile suspended solids vss and another half was subject to eps extraction and characterization as well as its fractions measurement including polysaccharide and protein tian and yu 2020 in brief the biofilm sample for eps analysis was firstly centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min to remove its supernatant 5804r eppendorf germany and to extract eps by modified heating method from the description by lai et al lai et al 2018 the polysaccharide and protein fractions in the collected eps were measured by the anthrone sulfuric and the lowry method respectively dubois et al 1956 frolund et al 1996 luminescence spectrometer f 4700 hitachi japan was employed to acquire the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra and the obtained eem data were processed by origin software 2 6 microelectrode measurements the do concentration gradient along the biofilm depth was measured in situ by using a microelectrodes sensor ox 10 unisense denmark that was connected to a picoammeter microsensor multimeter unisense aarhus denmark for data acquisition the microsensor with a tip diameter of 10 μm was calibrated with oxygen free and saturated water prior to do profile measurements as previously described schreiber et al 2009 the microelectrode was mounted on a motor driven micromanipulator which was precisely controlled using sensor trace pro software mm meter unisense denmark the microsensor was advanced by the motor at 5 μm depth steps along with the biofilm thickness from the membrane surface to the bulk liquid the depth profiles of do distribution were acquired by controlling the microsensor for 15 s to reach a steady state followed by measuring for 15 s to collect five replicates at each position and then moved forwards to the next position accordingly the visualized observation by using dissection microscopy was conducted to estimate the relative position of the microsensor and biofilm three selected sites including the top middle and bottom of each biofilm were measured to ensure the data reproducibility 2 7 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish in order to identify the spatial distribution of functional microbes in biofilm formed at different oxygen partial pressure the biofilm samples were collected at the end of steady state at stage iv and carefully kept the original form and intactness the fixation and hybridization of the collected biofilm sample were conducted according to the previous report gottshall et al 2021 the biofilm samples were fixed firstly with 4 paraformaldehyde solution for 60 min at room temperature and subsequently washed out with a mixture solution of ethanol and pbs 50 50 w v the fixed biofilm samples were mounted on anti slip glass slides and dried in the hybridization oven at 46 c for 30 min hybridization was performed with oligonucleotide probes targeting the 16 s rna genes of type i mγ84 mγ705 and ii methanotrophs mγ450 and denitrifiers den67 tbd1419 as previously described modin et al 2010b xu et al 2020 table s2 all oligonucleotide probes labeled with specific fluorescence stains were purchased from big tech co ltd beijing china and used to hybridize with the concentration of 10 ng μl 1 hybridized biofilm slides were visualized by using laser scanning confocal microscope clsm tcs sp8 leica germany with 570 670 and 520 nm lasers the visualized images were obtained and processed by using las af lite software 2 8 biomass sampling dna extraction and metagenome analysis for all mbfrs operated under varied o2 partial pressure biofilm samples were collected at the end of each stage to conduct 16s rrna sequencing meanwhile a portion of the biofilm sample collected at stage iv was also used for metagenome analysis to well represent the average microbial profiles a mixed biofilm sample was collected from six random locations of membrane bundle for each mbfr dna of all mixed biofilm samples was extracted by using fastdna spin kit for soil mobio laboratories inc carlsbad usa according to the manufacture protocol and assayed by novogene science and technology co ltd beijing china 16s rrna sequencing was conducted with forward primer 338f and reverse primers 806r according to previous description lu et al 2021 a total of 9 68 g paired end raw reads for each metagenome sample was obtained by sequencing forward and reverse strands of dna fragments raw reads of samples were trimmed by using trimmomatic v0 39 software the software implements a sliding window method to remove bases with low qualities and discard short reads less than 50 bp qualified reads were then assembled into contigs by using spades v3 1 5 3 under the mode meta protein coding genes were identified by using prodigal v2 6 3 software which were blast against the ncbi database by using diamond v2 0 8 software for taxonomy assignment genes related to mod and denitrification pathways were

toc was measured to analysis the solution organic concentration by combustion catalytic oxidation method at 680 c by using an online toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 biofilm temporal development under varied oxygen partial pressure in the counter diffusional biofilm based ame d process the mbfrs performance was closely related to the biofilm characteristics yuan et al 2021 visualized characteristics of biofilm spatial morphology including microbial coverage factor and thickness along the biofilm development process under different oxygen partial pressure via clsm and in situ oct imaging were presented in fig 1 additionally to explore the changes in biofilm compositions key microbes communities and eps constituents at distinct development stages were shown in fig 2 and fig 3 3 1 1 biofilm spatial morphology development under varied oxygen partial pressure based on the biofilm s morphology characteristics comprehensively reflected in microbial coverage factor represented as clsm images and biofilm thickness represented as oct images at different stages figs 1 and s2 oxygen partial pressure strongly affect the biofilm development initial colonization mainly occurred during stage i some microbes shown as green dots representing active cells attached on the gas transfer membrane surface and constructed the biofilm with a certain thickness initiating the biofilm development process oxygen partial pressure determining the oxygen availability displayed significant effects on microbial initial colonization which was better reflected by the difference in biofilm coverage factor fig 1a than the biofilm thickness fig 1b high oxygen availability determined by high oxygen partial pressure indeed resulted in a high microbial coverage factor and the highest coverage factor at stage i was observed in r6 and reached up to 34 6 5 8 about 2 times that in the r1 fig 1a the biofilm thicknesses of all mbfrs had insignificant differences at stage i and fluctuated in the range of 17 2 5 6 to 23 6 3 4 μm fig 1b by combining the clsm and oct observations it was recognized that increasing oxygen partial pressure is beneficial to the initial colonization of microorganisms on the membrane surface for the ame d process biofilm grew and accumulated rapidly on the membrane surface at stage ii and iii as the green dots continuously expanded on the membrane surface in every mbfr accompanying with the significant increases in both biofilm coverage factor and thickness figs 1c 1d 1e 1f and s2 during stage ii the biofilm coverage factor in bioreactor r1 to r6 continually increased within the range from 2 12 to 2 43 folds and the biofilm thickness significantly increased to 3 27 3 56 3 72 3 98 4 97 and 4 14 folds respectively these results evidenced that increasing oxygen partial pressure from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig resulted in faster biomass growth rate figs 1c 1d and s2 on the occasions from stage iii although both biofilm coverage factor and thickness continually increased in every mbfr this biofilm growth rate under higher oxygen partial pressure tended to decrease in compare with that in stage ii the coverage factor increased to 2 15 2 10 1 89 1 60 1 34 and 1 19 folds fig 1c and fig 1e respectively while the biofilm thickness increased to about 1 5 folds fig 1d and fig 1f in contrast to the corresponding value of r1 to r6 at stage ii respectively the biofilm growth rates in all mbfrs were lower in stage iv than both stage ii and iii fig s2 meanwhile all mbfrs performed a relatively steady nitrate removal flux at stage iv for at least one week and the biofilm thickness remained relatively constant meaning the biofilm matured and adapted to a quasi equilibrium state in this stage for the mature biofilm there were insignificant differences in the mbfrs biofilm coverage factor as biofilm almost covered over 91 of the membrane surface in all mbfrs fig 1g on the contrary oxygen availability manipulated by the oxygen partial pressure strongly affected the thickness of the mature biofilm which increased from 93 4 9 3 μm to 206 2 13 4 μm when the oxygen partial pressure was increased from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig but slightly decreased to 198 6 9 7 μm when oxygen partial pressure was further increased from 5 5 psig to 6 6 psig attributing mainly to that excessive oxygen concentrations supplied would result in slow growth of the anoxic layer biofilm it was then clearly noted that the mature biofilm formed at the oxygen partial pressure of 6 6 psig presented granular like agglomeration profile as a response to lessen the oxygen exposure of denitrifiers at the high oxygen concentration level zhu et al 2017 in summary controlling oxygen partial pressure is believed to manipulate biofilm development and spatial morphology characteristics and an increase of oxygen partial pressure from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig accelerated the initial biofilm colonization and growth rates during the stage i and ii and then formed a thicker biofilm for the ame d process 3 1 2 biofilm compositions variation under varied oxygen partial pressure as one complex biological matrix biofilm is mainly composed of microbes and eps produced and secreted by the microbes flemming and wingender 2010 exploring the elusively dynamic succession of key microbe communities in the biofilm under different oxygen partial pressure further expounds the linkages between the key microbe interactions at the microscale and denitrification performance at the macroscale based on summarized previous studies methylococcaceae cao et al 2019 liu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 methylocystaceae alrashed et al 2018 xu et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 methylophilaceae cao et al 2019 liu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 verrucomicrobiaceae liu et al 2021 zhu et al 2016 comamonadaceae alrashed et al 2018 cao et al 2019 liu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 hyphomicrobiaceae xu et al 2020 rhodocyclaceae liu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 and xanthomonadaceae alrashed et al 2018 cao et al 2019 xu et al 2020 were identified as key families involved in ame d in this study and their dynamic variations in the relative abundances were shown in fig 2 at the initial biofilm colonization process in stage i the relative abundances of all key microorganisms were rather low and appeared not to be appreciably affected by varied oxygen partial pressures as the differences in biofilm coverage factor at this stage did not affect the selection and colonization of all key microbes fig 1a and 1b this phenomenon might be attributed to the initial colonization with a rather low biomass directly occurred on the membrane surface where the sources of gaseous substrates were adequate at each oxygen partial pressure with further development of biofilm the relative abundances of all key microbes under every oxygen partial pressure significantly increased with the rapid biomass accumulation meaning biofilm development was accompanied well by the key microbes enrichment and interaction during stage ii methylococcaceae as a type i aerobic methanotrophs displayed a higher increase in relative abundance than typical denitrifiers such as hyphomicrobiaceae and xanthomonadaceae fig 2 meanwhile the relative abundance of methylococcaceae in all mbfrs continuously increased and then slightly decreased whereas traditional denitrifiers performed a consistently increasing trend above results indicated that aerobic methanotrophs were enriched more quickly than traditional denitrifiers in the former stages of biofilm development these traditional denitrifiers then reversely surpassed the aerobic methanotrophs at the latter stage fig 2 this might be related to that aerobic space was dominant in the former stage providing the effective habitats for the accumulation of aerobic methanotrophs and after that anoxic space gradually forming with the consumption of oxygen facilitating the survival of traditional denitrifiers modin et al 2008 the above results could also well explain why the rational increases in oxygen partial pressure accelerated biomass growth at stage ii fig 1 with biofilm matured at stage iv fig 1g and 1h oxygen partial pressure demonstrated a notable effect on the accumulation of key microbes for aerobic methanotrophs methylococcaceae initially achieved the high relative abundance at high oxygen partial pressure during stage ii and this trend remained until stage iv it was noticeable that the relative abundance of methylococcaceae did not further increase when oxygen partial pressure was continuously increased from 5 5 psig to 6 6 psig this meant the increase in oxygen partial pressure from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig had a positive effect on the enrichment of aerobic methanotrophs as for denitrifiers the relative abundance of comamonadaceae and xanthomonadaceae at stage iv both displayed an increasing trend when the oxygen partial pressure increased from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig and then sharply dropped with the continual increase to 6 6 psig this might be due to the excessive oxygen being present the biofilm would result in a disadvantageous habitat for denitrifiers enrichment in comparison the relative abundance of hyphomicrobiaceae at stage iv remained at a comparable level under varied oxygen partial pressures moreover the relative abundance of rhodocyclaceae was positively related to the oxygen partial pressure possibly because rhodocyclaceae contains many species that play major roles in aerobic denitrification fig 7 chen et al 2012 considering the denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo process is likely to occur in an anoxic environment in the presence of both ch4 and nitrate nitrite damo microorganisms were also considered in this study m oxyfera bacteria belongs to nc10 phylum is mainly responsible for the damo process ettwig et al 2010 the microbial community abundance at phylum level was given in fig s3 and the result showed that there was no nc10 phylum in microbial community in all mbfrs therefore it can be concluded that no damo microorganism m oxyfera took part in the methane oxidation and nitrite removal although eps is not metabolically active it plays important roles in constructing and maintaining biofilm structure ontiveros valencia et al 2018 the effects of oxygen partial pressure on the biofilm s eps contents and compositions at different operating stages were carried out fig 3 compared to stage i the eps contents under each oxygen partial pressure were significantly increased at stage ii and iii and then slightly decreased at stage iv which displayed similar trends for the biofilm growth rate figs 1 and s2 this might be due to the high microbial biomass growth rate which accelerated eps production and secretion to cement the biofilm rittmann 2018 importantly the ratio of polysaccharides to protein varied significantly during the biofilm development process the highest ratio was observed at stage iii in all mbfrs except for r5 fig s4 indicating that the content of polysaccharides in eps increased more than that of protein in this stage thus polysaccharides even with a lower content in comparison with proteins was believed to play an important role in triggering biofilm formation in stage iii by enhancing microbe adhesion and consolidating biofilm physical strength yuan et al 2021 once the biofilm matured eps production was decelerated as the decreased biofilm growth rates celmer et al 2008 flemming and wingender 2010 notwithstanding at stage iv it was found that the relative higher oxygen partial pressures supplied i e 4 4 5 5 and 6 6 psig could promote the mature biofilm to produce more eps which mainly due to that the relatively thicker mature biofilms have been formed at such high oxygen partial pressures fig 1h previous study also reported that a higher eps production rate have been observed in the thicker biofilm celmer et al 2008 two major eps components were identified by 3d eem i e tryptophan and humic acid corresponding to peak a and peak b respectively fig s5 for each mbfr peak a representing tryptophan demonstrated a high intensity in all stages implying that tryptophan was probably the main component of the proteins in eps which was also recognized in other studies lai et al 2018 at the same time the peak a intensity in 3d eem increased from stage i to iii at each oxygen partial pressure and then decrease at stage iv fig s5 additionally the variations in peak a intensity with the increase in oxygen partial pressure supplied at each stage fig s5 were similar to the variations in the protein content of eps fig 3 3 2 the optimal oxygen partial pressure for denitrification after being inoculated with enriched biomass six mbfrs were operated for 41 days in batch mode to investigate the effect of oxygen partial pressure in mixed gaseous substrates on nitrate removal performance fig 4 the measured nitrate concentration in the mbfrs effluent were shown in fig 4a and the sudden increases in nitrate concentrations resulted from exchanging nms medium periodically additionally nitrite concentrations measured in all mbfrs during operating stages were consistently less than 0 3 mg l 1 which was in accordance with our previous study lu et al 2021 alrashed et al 2018 and lee et al 2019 also found the low level of nitrite in the ame d process and attributed to nitrite reduction is relatively faster than nitrate reduction in the ame d process previous studies also founded less n2o was generated in the ame d process kits et al 2015 indicating that incomplete denitrification process also existed to accumulate n2o in stage i all mbfrs performed low denitrification efficiency as well as low surface nitrate removal flux of around 120 mg n m 2 d 1 because rather limited biofilm biomass and few key microbes fig 1a 1b and fig 2 inhibited the methane oxidation and denitrification directly fig 4c with biofilm gradually growing and covering the membrane surface and key microbes gradually enriching in the biofilm the nitrate removal flux increased at stage ii for all mbfrs especially for r1 and r2 whose calculated surface nitrate removal flux reached over 250 mg n m 2 d 1 representing about 1 09 1 37 2 28 and 3 39 fold in comparison to the corresponding value of r3 r4 r5 and r6 respectively therefore it was found that more biomass accumulation induced by high oxygen partial pressure would not lead to a higher nitrate removal flux in stage ii fig 1c 1d and fig 4b because excessive oxygen constrained denitrification fig 4c which could also be confirmed by the more toc accumulation observed in the mbfrs with high oxygen partial pressure fig 4d in stage iii the nitrate removal maintained a continually increasing trend in all mbfrs it was worth noting that the nitrate removal flux of r1 and r2 reached a stable level firstly at around 260 mg n m 2 d 1 on day 18 and 290 mg n m 2 d 1 on day 21 respectively this well supported the result that the biofilm would be mature in a short time under relatively low oxygen partial pressure conditions fig 1 in comparison r3 and r4 began to perform an advantage in nitrate removal flux over other mbfrs until the end of stage iii the nitrate removal flux of r3 and r4 reached approximately 320 mg n m 2 d 1 mainly due to the co effects of continual accumulation of biofilm biomass and increasing relative abundance of key microbes as well as the proper anoxic circumstance fig 1e 1f and fig 4c the largest increase in nitrate removal flux was observed in r5 at stage iii which was increased from 118 mg n m 2 d 1 to 316 mg n m 2 d 1 however r6 with high biofilm biomass accumulation still showed a relatively limited nitrate removal flux of 201 mg n m 2 d 1 fig 1e 1f and fig 4b suggesting that denitrification was strongly constrained as there were high do and toc concentrations within its bulk fig 4c and 4d upon the biofilm matured and adapted to a quasi equilibrium state at stage iv both r3 and r4 achieved a stable nitrate removal flux reaching 310 mg n m 2 d 1 and 320 mg n m 2 d 1 on day 27 respectively the nitrate removal flux in r5 consistently continued to increase and finally reached as high as 370 mg n m 2 d 1 on day 32 in comparison the nitrate removal flux in the r6 were insignificant changes from stage iii to iv which was finally stable at 240 mg n m 2 d 1 at steady state when the biofilm matured r5 had the highest denitrification efficiency over other mbfrs representing 1 45 1 28 1 19 1 16 and 1 54 times higher than the corresponding value of r1 r2 r3 r4 and r6 respectively when oxygen partial pressure increased from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig all mature biofilm formed anoxic space fig 5 a in which biofilm biomass and its contained key microbes could reduce nitrate through the denitrification process similarly knowles 2005 and liu et al 2021 also reported that the high concentration of oxygen supply was beneficial for the methanotrophs to provide more carbon sources for denitrifiers thus improving denitrification efficiency however the nitrate removal flux of r6 with 6 6 psig oxygen partial pressure was rather lower than those of r5 as its bulk do concentration over 0 36 mg l 1 severely inhibited the activity of denitrifiers modin et al 2007 sun et al 2013 therefore for counter diffusion biofilm for the ame d process the oxygen partial pressure of 5 5 psig 25 oxygen content was found to be the optimal level for mbfr performance which obtained high biofilm biomass and proper spatial stratification to sustain excellent methane oxidation and denitrification these results also indicated that enhancement of ame d performance in mbfrs could be well manipulated by managing the biofilm characteristics through precisely controlling oxygen partial pressure additionally the maximum nitrate removal flux corresponding to the surface nitrate removal flux of 370 mg n m 2 d 1 was observed in r5 with an oxygen partial pressure of 5 5 psig 25 oxygen content this result indicated that when the membrane packing density of r5 was about 810 1350 m2 m 3 0 81 1 35 m2 l 1 which is rather lower than that of the commercial mbfrs with a packing density of above 2000 m2 m 3 lee et al 2018 r5 can then achieve a comparable volumetric denitrification rate of the normal practical denitrification rate in wwtp which is approximately 300 500 mg no3 n l 1 d 1 lee et al 2019 additionally alrashed et al 2022 also founded that nitrogen removal in ch4 based mbfrs under hypoxic conditions could be comparable or even better than those of conventional nitrogen removal processes therefore the ame d process executed in the mbfrs possesses great potential for engineering application for wastewater treatment to address challenging issues pertaining to nitrate removal 3 3 response of the spatial stratification of biofilm to oxygen partial pressure the do concentration gradient along the biofilm thickness direction determined the stratified location of aerobic space and anoxic space within the biofilm which is important to understand the key microbial spatial distributions and co metabolism behaviors fig 5a with the gradual consumption of do near the membrane side of the biofilm the observed oxygen concentration exhibited a clear decline trend along the biofilm thickness direction and gradually reached a stable low level given that once a certain space within the biofilm exist some aerobic bacteria e g aerobic methanotrophs oxygen will be consumed in this space therefore in order to more accurately investigate the spatial distribution of aerobic methanotrophs whether oxygen consumption occurs within the biofilm is also a vital consideration for distinguishing the aerobic anoxic layer of the biofilm based ame d process only the space within the biofilm with oxygen concentrations is less than 0 5 mg l 1 and with no oxygen consumption was deemed as the anoxic layer when oxygen partial pressure increased from 1 1 psig to 6 6 psig the lowest do concentration within mature biofilm in r1 to r6 were 0 08 0 01 0 07 0 02 0 09 0 02 0 09 0 03 0 07 0 01 and 0 38 0 03 mg l 1 corresponding to the initially identified measuring point at 55 5 μm 65 5 μm 80 5 μm 100 5 μm 120 5 μm and 120 5 μm within the biofilm respectively due to the lowest do level measured in each biofilm was less than 0 5 mg l 1 the stratified boundary between the aerobic and anoxic layers could be estimated based on the initial measured position of the lowest do concentration as depicted in fig 5b the increase in the total biofilm thickness was accompanied by not only the expansion of aerobic layer biofilm thickness but also the increase in anoxic layer biofilm thickness when oxygen partial pressure increased from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig these phenomena evidenced the cooperative interactions existing among the microorganisms separately located in aerobic and anoxic layers zhu et al 2016 the thickness of anoxic layer within the biofilm was slightly decrease with oxygen partial pressure further increased from 5 5 psig to 6 6 psig fig 5b as do concentration within the biofilm was over 0 38 0 03 mg l 1 at oxygen partial pressure of 6 6 psig and hardly formed an anoxic circumstance fig 5a to further explore the spatial distribution of key microorganisms within aerobic anoxic stratified biofilm fish staining was conducted and represented in figs 5c and s4 aerobic methanotrophs including type i and ii were prevalent in the stratified biofilm and preferably formed aerobic biofilm close to the membrane surface which was well supported by previous studies that the membrane surface was mainly dominated by type i methanotrophs modin et al 2010b the layer of aerobic methanotrophs biofilm became thicker with oxygen partial pressure increased from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig and then became slightly thinner with oxygen partial pressure further increased to 6 6 psig which was well in accordance with the variations of aerobic layer thickness fig 5b this was well validation for the previous speculation that aerobic methanotrophs biofilm preferentially formed at the aerobic space close to the membrane surface modin et al 2008 interestingly denitrifiers were found to not be strictly confined in the anoxic layer of the biofilm as the fish image showed that denitrifiers were also found in the aerobic layer biofilm figs 5 and s6d which was different from the previous study that deduced denitrifiers were preferable to survive in the anoxic space of biofilm modin et al 2008 thus from in situ visualization of key microorganisms it is evidenced firstly that denitrifiers existed in both aerobic and anoxic layers of biofilm for the ame d process this phenomenon aroused extra concern and further discussion based on metagenomics analysis was given in section 3 4 the spatial distribution of key microorganisms was mainly affected by the oxygen partial pressure applied the oxygen partial pressure of 5 5 psig regulated properly the functional microbes to perform the highest denitrification efficiency for the ame d process fig 4 it was believed that there is an optimal balance between aerobic layer and anoxic layer biofilm that would ensure not only sufficient o2 and aerobic methanotrophs in the aerobic layer to assure oxidation of methane but also complete o2 depletion sufficient biodegradable carbon sources and denitrifiers in the anoxic layer for effective denitrification 3 4 conceptual mechanisms for ame d process involving aerobic denitrifier to further explore whether oxygen partial pressure affected the cooperative interaction for the ame d process in the mbfr key functional genes encoding enzymes related to the paths for methane oxidation and nitrate metabolism were carried out by performing metagenomics analysis a detailed description of the metabolic paths and related enzymes was provided in supporting information fig s7 aerobic methane oxidation from ch4 to co2 mainly involves four steps modin et al 2007 during which the key functional genes abundance and taxonomic origins related to each step at different oxygen partial pressures were identified fig 6 the first methane oxidation step is one oxygen atom derived from o2 reacts with ch bond of ch4 to produce methanol ch3oh by involving methane monooxygenase mmo encoded by pmoa gene shi et al 2021 it was noticeable that pmoa gene abundance became higher with the increase in oxygen partial pressure fig 6a the corresponding microbial taxonomic origins analysis displayed that methylococcaceae was the primary source of pmoa gene which was in accordance with previous study lee et al 2019 additionally a small proportion of pmoa gene originated from methylocystaceae which were consistent with the 16 s rrna fig 2 and fish results figs 5c and s4 in comparison the other key genes varied irregularly with the increase in oxygen partial pressure fig 6 possibly because the related metabolism steps did not involve oxygen shi et al 2021 methylococcaceae methlophilaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae were the primary sources of mxaf xoxf and mtdb genes in all mbfrs and played key roles in methane oxidation as shown in fig s7a the complete oxidation of methane to co2 invloves four oxidation steps from ch4 to ch3oh to cho to cooh and to co2 during which the involved enzymes include methane monooxygenase enzyme pmmo encoded by pmoa gene methanol dehydrogenase mdh encoded by mxaf xoxf gene formaldehyde dehydrogenase related enzymes fdh related encoded by foid fdhb gene and formate dehydrogenase fadh encoded by fdhb gene generally the expected family would simultaneously possess all four enzymes pmmo mdh fdh related and fadh to independently complete methane oxidation process although some of these enzymes can be encoded by multiple genes the related oxidation step can be performed in the presence of all or some of these genes in this case it can be recognized that the microorganisms possess the essential gene some or all to carry out the oxidation step therefore the expected families should simultaneously possess all essential genes i e pmoa mxaf and or xoxf foid and or fdhb fadh encoding four enzymes to ensure methane oxidation process could be independently completed however microbial taxonomic origins analysis corresponding to key functional genes in fig 6b showed that there were not any families have all essential genes encoding four enzymes implying that complete methane oxidation process was mainly executed via syntrophic interactions among different microorganisms alrashed et al 2018 as for the denitrification process the key genes and microbial taxonomic origins were also analyzed fig 7 during the ame d process nitrate reduction to n2 involves four steps nitrate reductase encoded by narg napa is the first enzyme involved in denitrification process as shown in fig 7a narg gene abundance decreased with the increase in oxygen partial pressure which mainly due to the synthesis and expression of this enzyme encoded by narg gene could be constrained by the high oxygen concentration rajta et al 2020 on the contrary increasing oxygen partial pressure resulted in an increased abundance of napa genes fig 7b there were irregular variations for the other key genes related to denitrification paths at the different oxygen partial pressures implying these genes were less sensitive to the oxygen concentration the microbial taxonomic origins analysis also revealed that traditional denitrifiers including hyphomicrobiaceae and comamonadaceae and aerobic methanotrophs including methylococcaceae and methlophilaceae were the primary sources of nitrate metabolism genes and harbored complete genes taking responsible for denitrification paths according to a previous classification method of microbial community for the ame d process lee et al 2019 microorganism involved in the ame d process in this study were mainly categorized into three groups i e sole methane oxidation group sole denitrification group and methane oxidation coupled to denitrification mod group as previously described lee et al 2019 the expected aerobic methanotrophs should simultaneously contain all essential genes i e pmoa mxaf and or xoxf foid and or fdhb fadh and be capable to complete independently methane oxidation process but not all aerobic methanotrophs possess all essential genes some methanotrophs only contain some essential genes and are involved in partial steps of methane oxidation process in this study the sole methane oxidation group refers to microorganisms harboring all or some necessary genes required by complete oxidation process and taking part in partial complete oxidation steps the sole methane oxidation group members mainly included chitinophagaceae nitrosomonadaceae and zoogloeaceae similarly the sole denitrification group refers to microorganisms harboring all or some essential genes required by complete denitrification process and carring out partial complete nitrate reduction process mainly included comamonadaceae flavobacteriaceae pseudomonadaceae xanthomonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae the mod group refers to microorganisms being capable of simultaneously carrying out both partial complete methane oxidation process and partial complete denitrification process by harboring multi functional genes i e all or some essential genes of both complete methane oxidation and denitrification process the mod group members were mainly comprised of hyphomicrobiaceae methylococcaceae and methylophilaceae suggesting that the co existence of multi functional microorganisms for the ame d process was prevalent alrashed et al 2018 lee et al 2019 in addition the taxonomic origins of each key functional gene of either methane oxidation process or denitrification process also indicated that varied oxygen partial pressures had only a certain impact on the relative abundance of microbial communities corresponding to each functional gene however the microbial community structure corresponding to each functional gene had an insignificant difference under different oxygen partial pressures indicating that the microorganism families involved in mutual cooperation for the ame d process has not changed significantly this indicated that oxygen partial pressures varied in the range of 1 1 psig to 6 6 psig had rarely effect on the cooperative mechanism of biofilm based ame d process denitrifiers were prevalently observed in the aerobic layer in the maturebiofilm under a wide range of oxygen partial pressure from 1 1 psig to 6 6 psig fig 5c this phenomenon has aroused our extra concern previous studies pointed out some denitrifiers were capable of executing heterotrophic aerobic denitrification bernet and moletta 1997 cao et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 which inspired that aerobic denitrification might occur in stratified biofilm based ame d process in this study the metagenome analysis of the key genes related to nitrate metabolism and the dominant microbes also verified that aerobic denitrification occurred fig 7 it is universally recognized that the main difference between aerobic denitrification and traditional denitrification is nitrate reductase enzymes nar related to the conversion of nitrate to nitrite this enzyme consists of two major types membrane bound nitrate reductase nar and periplasmic nitrate reductase nap the former one encoded by narg gene plays a key role in anoxic denitrification whereas the latter one encoded by napa gene is associated with aerobic denitrification rajta et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 the difference in taxonomic origins between narg and napa genes revealed that some families only carry out conventional anoxic heterotrophic denitrification and some play a vital role in aerobic denitrification for example anaerolineaceae and nitrospiraceae harboring narg genes rather than napa genes are most likely to only inhabit anoxic space and conduct anoxic denitrification whereas rhodocyclaceae only harboring napa genes preferred to inhabit at aerobic layer and carry out aerobic denitrification previous studies also found rhodocyclaceae contains many species that play major roles in aerobic denitrification chen et al 2012 for certain families harboring both narg and napa genes such as comamonadaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae it possess a potential to inhabit in either aerobic space to conduct aerobic denitrification or anoxic space to perform anoxic denitrification cao et al 2021 etchebehere et al 2002 as the aerobic denitrification has been observed as long as oxygen concentration is lower than 5 mg l 1 rajta et al 2020 the highest do concentration within the biofilm in this study was less than 2 75 mg l 1 fig 5a meaning the biofilm would provide a suitable environment for aerobic denitrification moreover increased abundance of napa genes and decreased abundance of narg genes with the increase in oxygen partial pressure also demonstrated that nitrate could be reduced by the co effect of aerobic denitrification and traditional anoxic denitrification considering the spatial distribution of aerobic methanotrophs fig 5c it is reasonable to deem that co occurrence involving aerobic methane oxidation aerobic denitrification and anoxic denitrification have occurred within biofilm for the ame d process fig 8 which was supported by previous speculation that ame d process was likely to conduct cooperative metabolism involving methane oxidation and anaerobic anoxic denitrification under high oxygen stress cao et al 2021 based on the above discussion a new cooperative path for the ame d process fig 8 was proposed aerobic methanotrophs located in aerobic space oxidize methane to produce and release organic intermediates these released organics act as carbon sources and are then utilized for not only heterotrophic aerobic denitrification at this aerobic layer but also heterotrophic traditional denitrification at adjacent anoxic layer from an ecological perspective being located in aerobic layer offers aerobic denitrifiers an ecological advantage ontiveros valencia et al 2018 which might also promote the transfer efficiency of organic intermediates from methanotrophs to aerobic denitrifiers modin et al 2010a xu et al 2020 4 conclusion in the counter diffused biofilm ame d process oxygen partial pressure in the membrane lumen performed a significant effect on denitrification performance by manipulating biofilm development process and spatial characteristics clsm and oct observations indicated increasing oxygen partial pressure from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig accelerated the initial biofilm colonization and accumulation rates and then result in a thicker biofilm formation after relative longer mature time with further increase to 6 6 psig excessive oxygen supply would result in the formed biofilm presented granular like agglomeration profiles to lessen the oxygen exposure of denitrifiers further analysis based on microelectrode measurement and fish image revealed that the manipulated counter diffusional biofilm obtained highest denitrification performance at the oxygen partial pressure of 5 5 psig mainly due to the optimal dynamic balance between the aerobic layer and anoxic layer where suitable o2 gradient and sufficient aerobic methanotrophs were achieved in aerobic layer to favor methane oxidation and complete o2 depletion and accessible organic sources were kept to avoid constraining denitrification activity in anoxic layer additionally metagenome analysis combined with fish image evidently demonstrated that spatial stratification of functional microbes occurred in the biofilm and rhodocyclaceae was prone to live in the aerobic layer and played a major role in aerobic denitrification providing proofs of the novel cooperative mechanism that ame d process was co conducted by aerobic methanotrophs heterotrophic aerobic denitrifiers and heterotrophic anoxic denitrifiers for the ame d process the studies regarding c and n elements flows methane utilization efficiency and electron generation and consumption profiles during the ame d process should be highly concerned which are extremely important to reduce secondary methane emissions and promote the practical application of the ame d process meanwhile considering the ame d process in the mbfrs should target the real application future studies should get closer to real application such as using real wastewater and real gas especially the biogas for methane and air for oxygen which would be a key step toward the practical application of the ame d process credit authorship contribution statement jian jiang lu investigation data curation writing original draft hao

15372,aerobic methane oxidation coupled with denitrification ame d executed in membrane biofilm bioreactors mbfrs provides a high promise for simultaneously mitigating methane ch4 emissions and removing nitrate in wastewater however systematically experimental investigation on how oxygen partial pressure affects the development and characteristics of counter diffusional biofilm as well as its spatial stratification profiles and the cooperative interaction of the biofilm microbes is still absent in this study we combined optical coherence tomography oct with confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm to in situ characterize the development of counter diffusion biofilm in the mbfr for the first time it was revealed that oxygen partial pressure onto the mbfr was capable of manipulating biofilm thickness and spatial stratification and then managing the distribution of functional microbes with the optimized oxygen partial pressure of 5 5 psig 25 oxygen content the manipulated counter diffusional biofilm in the ame d process obtained the highest denitrification efficiency due mainly to that this biofilm had the proper dynamic balance between the aerobic layer and anoxic layer where suitable o2 gradient and sufficient aerobic methanotrophs were achieved in aerobic layer to favor methane oxidation and complete o2 depletion and accessible organic sources were kept to avoid constraining denitrification activity in anoxic layer by using metagenome analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish staining the spatial distribution of the functional microbes within counter diffused biofilm was successfully evidenced and rhodocyclaceae one typical aerobic denitrifier was found to survive and gradually enriched in the aerobic layer and played a key role in denitrification aerobically this in situ biofilm visualization and characterization evidenced directly for the first time the cooperative path of denitrification for ame d in the counter diffused biofilm which involved aerobic methanotrophs heterotrophic aerobic denitrifiers and heterotrophic anoxic denitrifiers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ame d biofilm stratification cooperation mechanism mbfr oxygen partial pressure data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction methane ch4 the second largest contributor to the global warming effect has increased to 1800 ppb in global atmospheric concentrations representing an increase of 250 in comparison to the pre industrial level kirschke et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 wastewater treatment plants wwtps and landfills are identified as the important sources of methane emissions which are responsible for over 16 of global anthropogenic methane emissions nie et al 2019 scheutz et al 2022 ch4 is mainly generated in the process of the anaerobic sludge digestion in wwtps and bio solids degradation in landfills modin et al 2007 additionally nitrate removal based on biological denitrification is one of the most essential objectives in municipal wastewater and landfill leachate treatment xing et al 2018 during which biodegradable organics existing in wastewater can serve as an electron donor for heterotrophic microorganisms to complete biological denitrification however biodegradable organics are always insufficient in municipal wastewater or landfill leachate and thus additional electron donor is highly required modin et al 2010a methane has been successfully demonstrated to be a potential electron donor to replace traditional carbon sources for biological denitrification by executing aerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification ame d process modin et al 2007 zhu et al 2016 therefore applying the ame d process in wwtps and landfills is a potentially economical and simple way of simultaneously removing nitrate and mitigating methane emissions modin et al 2007 membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs have been successfully employed to execute the ame d process for nitrate removal in wastewater lee et al 2019 martin and nerenberg 2012 modin et al 2007 during the ame d process executed in mbfrs gaseous substrates i e ch4 and o2 are directly transferred from the membrane lumen to biofilms formed on the outer surface of the membrane while the complementary nitrate substrate diffuses from the bulk liquid into the interior of the biofilm martin and nerenberg 2012 modin et al 2010b this unique counter diffusional behavior in the biofilm of mbfrs tends to create the aerobic space where aerobic methane oxidation takes place and the anoxic space where traditional denitrification can occur by using organic compounds released by the aerobic methanotrophs modin et al 2008 in this biofilm based ame d process the biofilm often harbors complex substrates transfer microbial community distribution and metabolic reactions carrying out its own function thus reasonable biofilm management by controlling mbfrs operation parameters is expected to ensure the proper microbial community and spatial distribution which then help to sustain the most favorable metabolism and interactions that can contribute to the efficiency of the ame d process ontiveros valencia et al 2018 the primary goal of the ame d process in mbfrs is to remove nitrate in wastewater where oxygen is one of the most important operational parameters affecting denitrification modin et al 2007 zhu et al 2017 excellent o2 availability is required for aerobic methanotrophs to utilize ch4 effectively whereas excessive oxygen is undesirable because it would inhibit denitrification liu et al 2021 to explore the proper o2 supplement for the ame d process most previous efforts mainly concerned the effects of varied oxygen supply regimes or different oxygen content injected in the headspace of serum bottles on microbial communities and denitrification efficiency of co diffusional suspended sludge table 1 as for the counter diffusional biofilm based ame d process controlling oxygen supply through oxygen partial pressure in the membrane lumen may be capable of manipulating the biofilm s structure and the distribution of aerobic and anoxic space within the biofilm rishell et al 2004 to date however a systematically experimental evaluation on the effects of oxygen partial pressure in the mbfrs on the counter diffusional biofilm characteristics especially for the aspects of morphology and composition characteristics spatial stratification and interaction mechanisms in the ame d process is rarely investigated especially in situ capturing the development of counter diffusional biofilm with the operation of mbfrs at different oxygen partial pressures will be very helpful to enlighten the linkages in oxygen partial pressure factor to biofilm development to denitrification function in this study the objectives are to reveal the dynamic development of biofilm characteristics at different oxygen partial pressure and investigate the biological cooperative mechanisms for denitrification in the ame d process six laboratory scale mbfrs with different oxygen partial pressures were operated in parallel to compare biofilm development and denitrification performance firstly the dynamic differences in biofilm morphology characteristics were visually evaluated in situ by combining confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm and optical coherence tomography oct and then the biofilm composition including extracellular polymeric substances eps and 16 s rrna analysis were also conducted secondly the responses of the biofilm spatial stratification to oxygen partial pressure were examined by using microelectrodes and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis to in depth unveil the microbial distributions and metabolism behaviors finally comprehensive metagenome analysis was performed to identify the cooperative interactions involved in methane oxidation and denitrification during the ame d process the obtained results can not only provide directly visual evidence for the biofilm management and stratification in the counter diffusional mbfr but also identified the actual microbes involved in the ame d process which are significant to the methane based bioreactor development and application and to in depth understand the ame d process 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbfr configuration each laboratory scale mbfr chamber was made from plexiglas tube with a total volume of 650 ml 8 cm in diameter and 13 cm in height and a working volume of 600 ml each mbfr was equipped with seven bundles of gas permeable polypropylene pp membrane tm 830y teijin ltd japan fig s1 each bundle consisted of ten hollow fibers 200 μm outer diameter and 50 μm inner diameter with a length of 20 cm and its ends were carefully sealed within a polyurethane pu tube that acts as an individual membrane module to facilitate biofilm growth and sampling two ends of each membrane module were fed with mixed gaseous substrates in which ch4 o2 and he were separately supplied by gas cylinder 99 99 shente gas co ltd china the gaseous substrate flowrates were accurately adjusted in its specific proportions by using pressure flow meters mic21 beijing jes technology co ltd china liquid re circulation at a flowrate of 6 l min 1 was applied through a magnetic circulating pump to ensure the inoculum biomass remained completely suspended and their fully contact with the membrane surface thereby to facilitate the initial adhesion of microorganisms on the membrane surface and subsequent biofilm formation during the operational period more than 90 suspended biomass including inoculated and detached from biofilm were discharged from mbfrs at the end of each stage by exchanging with fresh nms medium detailed description in section 2 2 therefore the role of the suspended inoculum biomass was mainly to provide microbe sources for initial adhesion on the membrane surface during operational stage i the bulk ph and dissolved oxygen do were real time monitored using ph and do sensor remond china respectively the feeding bottle containing synthetic nitrate mineral salt nms medium was used to replenish nutrients required for biofilm development through a peristaltic pump bt100 longerpump china before the beginning of every operation stage the related operation time and duration were given in detailed in section 2 2 six equal equipment aforementioned mbfrs were operated in parallel with different o2 partial pressures to study the responses of biofilm characteristics 2 2 biofilm characterization in mbfrs initially six mbfrs were separately inoculated with 60 ml of acclimated biomass to provide the microbe sources for initial adhesion of microorganisms onto the membrane surface lu et al 2021 and the detailed description on the acclimated biomass was given in supporting information to prevent biomass loss through effluent and to form biofilm steady all mbfrs were operated at batch mode by periodically exchanging nms medium with a constant no3 n concentration of 40 mg l 1 and other necessary elements for microorganisms growth nie et al 2021 the period of nsm medium exchange was maintained at 6 10 days to facilitate to capture the dynamic biofilm characteristics during its development process under each oxygen partial pressure applied once the mbfr performed a relatively steady nitrate removal flux the oct observation on the biofilm thickness was conducted once each day for three consecutive days if the standard deviations of the biofilm thickness were less than 10 of the average values and nitrate removal flux remained relatively stable for at least one week the biofilm was deemed to be mature and then the operation of mbfrs was completed overall all mbfrs were operated for five batch periods by periodical nsm medium exchanges all batch periods were consistently maintained for the same operational conditions and nsm content after assessing denitrification performance and biofilm characteristics thickness and coverage factor of all mbfrs at different periods five batch periods were simply divided into four stages named as stage i days 1 6 stage ii days 7 15 stage iii days 16 25 and stage iv days 26 34 and 35 41 respectively stages i to iii was consistent with nms exchanged period whereas stage iv consisted of two periods to ensure that all mbfrs remained a relatively stable level for at least one week more than 90 volume of the suspension was exchanged with fresh nms medium through a peristaltic pump bt100 longerpump china before the next stage began the detailed compositions of the feeding nms medium containing phosphate buffer and essential trace elements were given in table s1 the six mbfrs were separately supplied with pre determined mixed gaseous substrates with different ratios of he o2 ch4 table 2 the total pressure of gaseous mixtures in the membrane lumen was consistently kept at 22 psig by using a pressure relief valve r13 gentec china the temperature and ph of all mbfrs were maintained at 35 2 c and 7 0 0 5 throughout the operation stages 2 3 confocal laser scanning microscopy

processed by using thorimageoct 5 2 1 software thorlabs gan620c1 usa the two dimensional 2 d horizontal images were exported by setting the image direction to x z slice and y slice value to half of available range dreszer et al 2014 the calculated values of the biofilm thickness refer to the average of several measurements captured at the top middle and bottom of each biofilm sample 2 5 eps

suspension was vortexed for 10 min to keep the biomass homogeneously mixed half of this mixture was taken to measure volatile suspended solids vss and another half was subject to eps extraction and characterization as well as its fractions measurement including polysaccharide and protein tian and yu 2020 in brief the biofilm sample for eps analysis was firstly centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min to remove its supernatant 5804r eppendorf germany and to extract eps by modified heating method from the description by lai et al lai et al 2018 the polysaccharide and protein fractions in the collected eps were measured by the anthrone sulfuric and the lowry method respectively dubois et al 1956 frolund et al 1996 luminescence spectrometer f 4700 hitachi japan was employed to acquire the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra and the obtained eem data were processed by origin software 2 6 microelectrode measurements the do concentration gradient along the biofilm depth was measured in situ by using a microelectrodes sensor ox 10 unisense denmark that was connected to a picoammeter microsensor multimeter unisense aarhus denmark for data acquisition the microsensor with a tip diameter of 10 μm was calibrated with oxygen free and saturated water prior to do profile measurements as previously described schreiber et al 2009 the microelectrode was mounted on a motor driven micromanipulator which was precisely controlled using sensor trace pro software mm meter unisense denmark the microsensor was advanced by the motor at 5 μm depth steps along with the biofilm thickness from the membrane surface to the bulk liquid the depth profiles of do distribution were acquired by controlling the microsensor for 15 s to reach a steady state followed by measuring for 15 s to collect five replicates at each position and then moved forwards to the next position accordingly the visualized observation by using dissection microscopy was conducted to estimate the relative position of the microsensor and biofilm three selected sites including the top middle and bottom of each biofilm were measured to ensure the data reproducibility 2 7 fluorescence in situ hybridization

purchased from big tech co ltd beijing china and used to hybridize with the concentration of 10 ng μl 1 hybridized biofilm slides were visualized by using laser scanning confocal microscope clsm tcs sp8 leica germany with 570 670 and 520 nm lasers the visualized images were obtained and processed by using las af lite software 2 8 biomass sampling dna extraction and metagenome analysis for all mbfrs operated under varied o2 partial pressure biofilm samples were collected at the end of each stage to conduct 16s rrna sequencing meanwhile a portion of the biofilm sample collected at stage iv was also used for metagenome analysis to well represent the average microbial profiles a mixed biofilm sample was collected from six random locations of membrane bundle for each mbfr dna of all mixed biofilm samples was extracted by using fastdna spin kit for soil mobio laboratories inc carlsbad usa according to the manufacture protocol and assayed by novogene science and technology co ltd beijing china 16s rrna sequencing was conducted with forward primer 338f and reverse primers 806r according to previous description lu et al 2021 a total of 9 68 g paired end raw reads for each metagenome

biofilm temporal development under varied oxygen partial pressure in the counter diffusional biofilm based ame d process the mbfrs performance was closely related to the biofilm characteristics yuan et al 2021 visualized characteristics of biofilm spatial morphology including microbial coverage factor and thickness along the biofilm development process under different oxygen partial pressure via clsm and in situ oct imaging were presented in fig 1 additionally to explore the changes in biofilm compositions key microbes communities and eps constituents at distinct development stages were shown in fig 2 and fig 3 3 1 1 biofilm spatial morphology development under varied oxygen partial pressure based on the biofilm s morphology characteristics comprehensively reflected in microbial coverage factor represented as clsm images and biofilm thickness represented as oct images at different stages figs 1 and s2 oxygen partial pressure strongly affect the biofilm development initial colonization mainly occurred during stage i some microbes shown as green dots representing active cells attached on the gas transfer membrane surface and constructed the biofilm with a certain thickness initiating the biofilm development process oxygen partial pressure determining the oxygen availability displayed significant effects on microbial initial colonization which was better reflected by the difference in biofilm coverage factor fig 1a than the biofilm thickness fig 1b high oxygen availability determined by high oxygen partial pressure indeed resulted in a high microbial coverage factor and the highest coverage factor at stage i was observed in r6 and reached up to 34 6 5 8 about 2 times that in the r1 fig 1a the biofilm thicknesses of all mbfrs had insignificant differences at stage i and fluctuated in the range of 17 2 5 6 to 23 6 3 4 μm fig 1b by combining the clsm and oct observations it was recognized that increasing oxygen partial pressure is beneficial to the initial colonization of microorganisms on the membrane surface for the ame d process biofilm grew and accumulated rapidly on the membrane surface at stage ii and iii as the green dots continuously expanded on the membrane surface in every mbfr accompanying with the significant increases in both biofilm coverage factor and thickness figs 1c 1d 1e 1f and s2 during stage ii the biofilm coverage factor in bioreactor r1 to r6 continually increased within the range from 2 12 to 2 43 folds and the biofilm thickness significantly increased to 3 27 3 56 3 72 3 98 4 97 and 4 14 folds respectively these results evidenced that increasing oxygen partial pressure from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig resulted in faster biomass growth rate figs 1c 1d and s2 on the occasions from stage iii although both biofilm coverage factor and thickness continually increased in every mbfr this biofilm growth rate under higher oxygen partial pressure tended to decrease in compare with that in stage ii the coverage factor increased to 2 15 2 10 1 89 1 60 1 34 and 1 19 folds fig 1c and fig 1e respectively while the biofilm thickness increased to about 1 5 folds fig 1d and fig 1f in contrast to the corresponding value of r1 to r6 at stage ii respectively the biofilm growth rates in all mbfrs were lower in stage iv than both stage ii and iii fig s2 meanwhile all mbfrs performed a relatively steady nitrate removal flux at stage iv for at least one week and the biofilm thickness remained relatively constant meaning the biofilm matured and adapted to a quasi equilibrium state in this stage for the mature biofilm there were insignificant differences in the mbfrs biofilm coverage factor as biofilm almost covered over 91 of the membrane surface in all mbfrs fig 1g on the contrary oxygen availability manipulated by the oxygen partial pressure strongly affected the thickness of the mature biofilm which increased from 93 4 9 3 μm to 206 2 13 4 μm when the oxygen partial pressure was increased from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig but slightly decreased to 198 6 9 7 μm when oxygen partial pressure was further increased from 5 5 psig to 6 6 psig attributing mainly to that excessive oxygen concentrations supplied would result in slow growth of the anoxic layer biofilm it was then clearly noted that the mature biofilm formed at the oxygen partial pressure of 6 6 psig presented granular like agglomeration profile as a response to lessen the oxygen exposure of denitrifiers at the high oxygen concentration level zhu et al 2017 in summary controlling oxygen partial pressure is believed to manipulate biofilm development and spatial morphology characteristics and an increase of oxygen partial pressure from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig accelerated the initial biofilm colonization and growth rates during the stage i and ii and then formed a thicker biofilm for the ame d process 3 1 2 biofilm compositions variation under varied oxygen partial pressure as one complex biological matrix biofilm is mainly composed of microbes and eps produced and secreted by the microbes flemming and wingender 2010 exploring the elusively dynamic succession of key microbe communities in the biofilm under different oxygen partial pressure further expounds the linkages between the key microbe interactions at the microscale and denitrification performance at the macroscale based on summarized previous studies methylococcaceae cao et al 2019 liu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 methylocystaceae alrashed et al 2018 xu et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 methylophilaceae cao et al 2019 liu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 verrucomicrobiaceae liu et al 2021 zhu et al 2016 comamonadaceae alrashed et al 2018 cao et al 2019 liu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 hyphomicrobiaceae xu et al 2020 rhodocyclaceae liu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 and xanthomonadaceae alrashed et al 2018 cao et al 2019 xu et al 2020 were identified as key families involved in ame d in this study and their dynamic variations in the relative abundances were shown in fig 2 at the initial biofilm colonization process in stage i the relative abundances of all key microorganisms were rather low and appeared not to be appreciably affected by varied oxygen partial pressures as the differences in biofilm coverage factor at this stage did not affect the selection and colonization of all key microbes fig 1a and 1b this phenomenon might be attributed to the initial colonization with a rather low biomass directly occurred on the membrane surface where the sources of gaseous substrates were adequate at each oxygen partial pressure with further development of biofilm the relative abundances of all key microbes under every oxygen partial pressure significantly increased with the rapid biomass accumulation meaning biofilm development was accompanied well by the key microbes enrichment and interaction during stage ii methylococcaceae as a type i aerobic methanotrophs displayed a higher increase in relative abundance than typical denitrifiers such as hyphomicrobiaceae and xanthomonadaceae fig 2 meanwhile the relative abundance of methylococcaceae in all mbfrs continuously increased and then slightly decreased whereas traditional denitrifiers performed a consistently increasing trend above results indicated that aerobic methanotrophs were enriched more quickly than traditional denitrifiers in the former stages of biofilm development these traditional denitrifiers then reversely surpassed the aerobic methanotrophs at the latter stage fig 2 this might be related to that aerobic space was dominant in the former stage providing the effective habitats for the accumulation of aerobic methanotrophs and after that anoxic space gradually forming with the consumption of oxygen facilitating the survival of traditional denitrifiers modin et al 2008 the above results could also well explain why the rational increases in oxygen partial pressure accelerated biomass growth at stage ii fig 1 with biofilm matured at stage iv fig 1g and 1h oxygen partial pressure demonstrated a notable effect on the accumulation of key microbes for aerobic methanotrophs methylococcaceae initially achieved the high relative abundance at high oxygen partial pressure during stage ii and this trend remained until stage iv it was noticeable that the relative abundance of methylococcaceae did not further increase when oxygen partial pressure was continuously increased from 5 5 psig to 6 6 psig this meant the increase in oxygen partial pressure from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig had a positive effect on the enrichment of aerobic methanotrophs as for denitrifiers the relative abundance of comamonadaceae and xanthomonadaceae at stage iv both displayed an increasing trend when the oxygen partial pressure increased from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig and then sharply dropped with the continual increase to 6 6 psig this might be due to the excessive oxygen being present the biofilm would result in a disadvantageous habitat for denitrifiers enrichment in comparison the relative abundance of hyphomicrobiaceae at stage iv remained at a comparable level under varied oxygen partial pressures moreover the relative abundance of rhodocyclaceae was positively related to the oxygen partial pressure possibly because rhodocyclaceae contains many species that play major roles in aerobic denitrification fig 7 chen et al 2012 considering the denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo process is likely to occur in an anoxic environment in the presence of both ch4 and nitrate nitrite damo microorganisms were also considered in this study m oxyfera bacteria belongs to nc10 phylum is mainly responsible for the damo process ettwig et al 2010 the microbial community abundance at phylum level was given in fig s3 and the result showed that there was no nc10 phylum in microbial community in all mbfrs therefore it can be concluded that no damo microorganism m oxyfera took part in the methane oxidation and nitrite removal although eps is not metabolically active it plays important roles in constructing and maintaining biofilm structure ontiveros valencia et al 2018 the effects of oxygen partial pressure on the biofilm s eps contents and compositions at different operating stages were carried out fig 3 compared to stage i the eps contents under each oxygen partial pressure were significantly increased at stage ii and iii and then slightly decreased at stage iv which displayed similar trends for the biofilm growth rate figs 1 and s2 this might be due to the high microbial biomass growth rate which accelerated eps production and secretion to cement the biofilm rittmann 2018 importantly the ratio of polysaccharides to protein varied significantly during the biofilm development process the highest ratio was observed at stage iii in all mbfrs except for r5 fig s4 indicating that the content of polysaccharides in eps increased more than that of protein in this stage thus polysaccharides even with a lower content in comparison with proteins was believed to play an important role in triggering biofilm formation in stage iii by enhancing microbe adhesion and consolidating biofilm physical strength yuan et al 2021 once the biofilm matured eps production was decelerated as the decreased biofilm growth rates celmer et al 2008 flemming and wingender 2010 notwithstanding at stage iv it was found that the relative higher oxygen partial pressures supplied i e 4 4 5 5 and 6 6 psig could promote the mature biofilm to produce more eps which mainly due to that the relatively thicker mature biofilms have been formed at such high oxygen partial pressures fig 1h previous study also reported that a higher eps production rate have been observed in the thicker biofilm celmer et al 2008 two major eps components were identified by 3d eem i e tryptophan and humic acid corresponding to peak a and peak b respectively fig s5 for each mbfr peak a representing tryptophan demonstrated a high intensity in all stages implying that tryptophan was probably the main component of the proteins in eps which was also recognized in other studies lai et al 2018 at the same time the peak a intensity in 3d eem increased from stage i to iii at each oxygen partial pressure and then decrease at stage iv fig s5 additionally the variations in peak a intensity with the increase in oxygen partial pressure supplied at each stage fig s5 were similar to the variations in the protein content of eps fig 3 3 2 the optimal oxygen partial pressure for denitrification after being inoculated with enriched biomass six mbfrs were operated for 41 days in batch mode to investigate the effect of oxygen partial pressure in mixed gaseous substrates on nitrate removal performance fig 4 the measured nitrate concentration in the mbfrs effluent were shown in fig 4a and the sudden increases in nitrate concentrations resulted from exchanging nms medium periodically additionally nitrite concentrations measured in all mbfrs during operating stages were consistently less than 0 3 mg l 1 which was in accordance with our previous study lu et al 2021 alrashed et al 2018 and lee et al 2019 also found the low level of nitrite in the ame d process and attributed to nitrite reduction is relatively faster than nitrate reduction in the ame d process previous studies also founded less n2o was generated in the ame d process kits et al 2015 indicating that incomplete denitrification process also existed to accumulate n2o in stage i all mbfrs performed low denitrification efficiency as well as low surface nitrate removal flux of around 120 mg n m 2 d 1 because rather limited biofilm biomass and few key microbes fig 1a 1b and fig 2 inhibited the methane oxidation and denitrification directly fig 4c with biofilm gradually growing and covering the membrane surface and key microbes gradually enriching in the biofilm the nitrate removal flux increased at stage ii for all mbfrs especially for r1 and r2 whose calculated surface nitrate removal flux reached over 250 mg n m 2 d 1 representing about 1 09 1 37 2 28 and 3 39 fold in comparison to the corresponding value of r3 r4 r5 and r6 respectively therefore it was found that more biomass accumulation induced by high oxygen partial pressure would not lead to a higher nitrate removal flux in stage ii fig 1c 1d and fig 4b because excessive oxygen constrained denitrification fig 4c which could also be confirmed by the more toc accumulation observed in the mbfrs with high oxygen partial pressure fig 4d in stage iii the nitrate removal maintained a continually increasing trend in all mbfrs it was worth noting that the nitrate removal flux of r1 and r2 reached a stable level firstly at around 260 mg n m 2 d 1 on day 18 and 290 mg n m 2 d 1 on day 21 respectively this well supported the result that the biofilm would be mature in a short time under relatively low oxygen partial pressure conditions fig 1 in comparison r3 and r4 began to perform an advantage in nitrate removal flux over other mbfrs until the end of stage iii the nitrate removal flux of r3 and r4 reached approximately 320 mg n m 2 d 1 mainly due to the co effects of continual accumulation of biofilm biomass and increasing relative abundance of key microbes as well as the proper anoxic circumstance fig 1e 1f and fig 4c the largest increase in nitrate removal flux was observed in r5 at stage iii which was increased from 118 mg n m 2 d 1 to 316 mg n m 2 d 1 however r6 with high biofilm biomass accumulation still showed a relatively limited nitrate removal flux of 201 mg n m 2 d 1 fig 1e 1f and fig 4b suggesting that denitrification was strongly constrained as there were high do and toc concentrations within its bulk fig 4c and 4d upon the biofilm matured and adapted to a quasi equilibrium state at stage iv both r3 and r4 achieved a stable nitrate removal flux reaching 310 mg n m 2 d 1 and 320 mg n m 2 d 1 on day 27 respectively the nitrate removal flux in r5 consistently continued to increase and finally reached as high as 370 mg n m 2 d 1 on day 32 in comparison the nitrate removal flux in the r6 were insignificant changes from stage iii to iv which was finally stable at 240 mg n m 2 d 1 at steady state when the biofilm matured r5 had the highest denitrification efficiency over other mbfrs representing 1 45 1 28 1 19 1 16 and 1 54 times higher than the corresponding value of r1 r2 r3 r4 and r6 respectively when oxygen partial pressure increased from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig all mature biofilm formed anoxic space fig 5 a in which biofilm biomass and its contained key microbes could reduce nitrate through the denitrification process similarly knowles 2005 and liu et al 2021 also reported that the high concentration of oxygen supply was beneficial for the methanotrophs to provide more carbon sources for denitrifiers thus improving denitrification efficiency however the nitrate removal flux of r6 with 6 6 psig oxygen partial pressure was rather lower than those of r5 as its bulk do concentration over 0 36 mg l 1 severely inhibited the activity of denitrifiers modin et al 2007 sun et al 2013 therefore for counter diffusion biofilm for the ame d process the oxygen partial pressure of 5 5 psig 25 oxygen content was found to be the optimal level for mbfr performance which obtained high biofilm biomass and proper spatial stratification to sustain excellent methane oxidation and denitrification these results also indicated that enhancement of ame d performance in mbfrs could be well manipulated by managing the biofilm characteristics through precisely controlling oxygen partial pressure additionally the maximum nitrate removal flux corresponding to the surface nitrate removal flux of 370 mg n m 2 d 1 was observed in r5 with an oxygen partial pressure of 5 5 psig 25 oxygen content this result indicated that when the membrane packing density of r5 was about 810 1350 m2 m 3 0 81 1 35 m2 l 1 which is rather lower than that of the commercial mbfrs with a packing density of above 2000 m2 m 3 lee et al 2018 r5 can then achieve a comparable volumetric denitrification rate of the normal practical denitrification rate in wwtp which is approximately 300 500 mg no3 n l 1 d 1 lee et al 2019 additionally alrashed et al 2022 also founded that nitrogen removal in ch4 based mbfrs under hypoxic conditions could be comparable or even better than those of conventional nitrogen removal processes therefore the ame d process executed in the mbfrs possesses great potential for engineering application for wastewater treatment to address challenging issues pertaining to nitrate removal 3 3 response of the spatial stratification of biofilm to oxygen partial pressure the do concentration gradient along the biofilm thickness direction determined the stratified location of aerobic space and anoxic space within the biofilm which is important to understand the key microbial spatial distributions and co metabolism behaviors fig 5a with the gradual consumption of do near the membrane side of the biofilm the observed oxygen concentration exhibited a clear decline trend along the biofilm thickness direction and gradually reached a stable low level given that once a certain space within the biofilm exist some aerobic bacteria e g aerobic methanotrophs oxygen will be consumed in this space therefore in order to more accurately investigate the spatial distribution of aerobic methanotrophs whether oxygen consumption occurs within the biofilm is also a vital consideration for distinguishing the aerobic anoxic layer of the biofilm based ame d process only the space within the biofilm with oxygen concentrations is less than 0 5 mg l 1 and with no oxygen consumption was deemed as the anoxic layer when oxygen partial pressure increased from 1 1 psig to 6 6 psig the lowest do concentration within mature biofilm in r1 to r6 were 0 08 0 01 0 07 0 02 0 09 0 02 0 09 0 03 0 07 0 01 and 0 38 0 03 mg l 1 corresponding to the initially identified measuring point at 55 5 μm 65 5 μm 80 5 μm 100 5 μm 120 5 μm and 120 5 μm within the biofilm respectively due to the lowest do level measured in each biofilm was less than 0 5 mg l 1 the stratified boundary between the aerobic and anoxic layers could be estimated based on the initial measured position of the lowest do concentration as depicted in fig 5b the increase in the total biofilm thickness was accompanied by not only the expansion of aerobic layer biofilm thickness but also the increase in anoxic layer biofilm thickness when oxygen partial pressure increased from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig these phenomena evidenced the cooperative interactions existing among the microorganisms separately located in aerobic and anoxic layers zhu et al 2016 the thickness of anoxic layer within the biofilm was slightly decrease with oxygen partial pressure further increased from 5 5 psig to 6 6 psig fig 5b as do concentration within the biofilm was over 0 38 0 03 mg l 1 at oxygen partial pressure of 6 6 psig and hardly formed an anoxic circumstance fig 5a to further explore the spatial distribution of key microorganisms within aerobic anoxic stratified biofilm fish staining was conducted and represented in figs 5c and s4 aerobic methanotrophs including type i and ii were prevalent in the stratified biofilm and preferably formed aerobic biofilm close to the membrane surface which was well supported by previous studies that the membrane surface was mainly dominated by type i methanotrophs modin et al 2010b the layer of aerobic methanotrophs biofilm became thicker with oxygen partial pressure increased from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig and then became slightly thinner with oxygen partial pressure further increased to 6 6 psig which was well in accordance with the variations of aerobic layer thickness fig 5b this was well validation for the previous speculation that aerobic methanotrophs biofilm preferentially formed at the aerobic space close to the membrane surface modin et al 2008 interestingly denitrifiers were found to not be strictly confined in the anoxic layer of the biofilm as the fish image showed that denitrifiers were also found in the aerobic layer biofilm figs 5 and s6d which was different from the previous study that deduced denitrifiers were preferable to survive in the anoxic space of biofilm modin et al 2008 thus from in situ visualization of key microorganisms it is evidenced firstly that denitrifiers existed in both aerobic and anoxic layers of biofilm for the ame d process this phenomenon aroused extra concern and further discussion based on metagenomics analysis was given in section 3 4 the spatial distribution of key microorganisms was mainly affected by the oxygen partial pressure applied the oxygen partial pressure of 5 5 psig regulated properly the functional microbes to perform the highest denitrification efficiency for the ame d process fig 4 it was believed that there is an optimal balance between aerobic layer and anoxic layer biofilm that would ensure not only sufficient o2 and aerobic methanotrophs in the aerobic layer to assure oxidation of methane but also complete o2 depletion sufficient biodegradable carbon sources and denitrifiers in the anoxic layer for effective denitrification 3 4 conceptual mechanisms for ame d process involving aerobic denitrifier to further explore whether oxygen partial pressure affected the cooperative interaction for the ame d process in the mbfr key functional genes encoding enzymes related to the paths for methane oxidation and nitrate metabolism were carried out by performing metagenomics analysis a detailed description of the metabolic paths and related enzymes was provided in supporting information fig s7 aerobic methane oxidation from ch4 to co2 mainly involves four steps modin et al 2007 during which the key functional genes abundance and taxonomic origins related to each step at different oxygen partial pressures were identified fig 6 the first methane oxidation step is one oxygen atom derived from o2 reacts with ch bond of ch4 to produce methanol ch3oh by involving methane monooxygenase mmo encoded by pmoa gene shi et al 2021 it was noticeable that pmoa gene abundance became higher with the increase in oxygen partial pressure fig 6a the corresponding microbial taxonomic origins analysis displayed that methylococcaceae was the primary source of pmoa gene which was in accordance with previous study lee et al 2019 additionally a small proportion of pmoa gene originated from methylocystaceae which were consistent with the 16 s rrna fig 2 and fish results figs 5c and s4 in comparison the other key genes varied irregularly with the increase in oxygen partial pressure fig 6 possibly because the related metabolism steps did not involve oxygen shi et al 2021 methylococcaceae methlophilaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae were the primary sources of mxaf xoxf and mtdb genes in all mbfrs and played key roles in methane oxidation as shown in fig s7a the complete oxidation of methane to co2 invloves four oxidation steps from ch4 to ch3oh to cho to cooh and to co2 during which the involved enzymes include methane monooxygenase enzyme pmmo encoded by pmoa gene methanol dehydrogenase mdh encoded by mxaf xoxf gene formaldehyde dehydrogenase related enzymes fdh related encoded by foid fdhb gene and formate dehydrogenase fadh encoded by fdhb gene generally the expected family would simultaneously possess all four enzymes pmmo mdh fdh related and fadh to independently complete methane oxidation process although some of these enzymes can be encoded by multiple genes the related oxidation step can be performed in the presence of all or some of these genes in this case it can be recognized that the microorganisms possess the essential gene some or all to carry out the oxidation step therefore the expected families should simultaneously possess all essential genes i e pmoa mxaf and or xoxf foid and or fdhb fadh encoding four enzymes to ensure methane oxidation process could be independently completed however microbial taxonomic origins analysis corresponding to key functional genes in fig 6b showed that there were not any families have all essential genes encoding four enzymes implying that complete methane oxidation process was mainly executed via syntrophic interactions among different microorganisms alrashed et al 2018 as for the denitrification process the key genes and microbial taxonomic origins were also analyzed fig 7 during the ame d process nitrate reduction to n2 involves four steps nitrate reductase encoded by narg napa is the first enzyme involved in denitrification process as shown in fig 7a narg gene abundance decreased with the increase in oxygen partial pressure which mainly due to the synthesis and expression of this enzyme encoded by narg gene could be constrained by the high oxygen concentration rajta et al 2020 on the contrary increasing oxygen partial pressure resulted in an increased abundance of napa genes fig 7b there were irregular variations for the other key genes related to denitrification paths at the different oxygen partial pressures implying these genes were less sensitive to the oxygen concentration the microbial taxonomic origins analysis also revealed that traditional denitrifiers including hyphomicrobiaceae and comamonadaceae and aerobic methanotrophs including methylococcaceae and methlophilaceae were the primary sources of nitrate metabolism genes and harbored complete genes taking responsible for denitrification paths according to a previous classification method of microbial community for the ame d process lee et al 2019 microorganism involved in the ame d process in this study were mainly categorized into three groups i e sole methane oxidation group sole denitrification group and methane oxidation coupled to denitrification mod group as previously described lee et al 2019 the expected aerobic methanotrophs should simultaneously contain all essential genes i e pmoa mxaf and or xoxf foid and or fdhb fadh and be capable to complete independently methane oxidation process but not all aerobic methanotrophs possess all essential genes some methanotrophs only contain some essential genes and are involved in partial steps of methane oxidation process in this study the sole methane oxidation group refers to microorganisms harboring all or some necessary genes required by complete oxidation process and taking part in partial complete oxidation steps the sole methane oxidation group members mainly included chitinophagaceae nitrosomonadaceae and zoogloeaceae similarly the sole denitrification group refers to microorganisms harboring all or some essential genes required by complete denitrification process and carring out partial complete nitrate reduction process mainly included comamonadaceae flavobacteriaceae pseudomonadaceae xanthomonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae the mod group refers to microorganisms being capable of simultaneously carrying out both partial complete methane oxidation process and partial complete denitrification process by harboring multi functional genes i e all or some essential genes of both complete methane oxidation and denitrification process the mod group members were mainly comprised of hyphomicrobiaceae methylococcaceae and methylophilaceae suggesting that the co existence of multi functional microorganisms for the ame d process was prevalent alrashed et al 2018 lee et al 2019 in addition the taxonomic origins of each key functional gene of either methane oxidation process or denitrification process also indicated that varied oxygen partial pressures had only a certain impact on the relative abundance of microbial communities corresponding to each functional gene however the microbial community structure corresponding to each functional gene had an insignificant difference under different oxygen partial pressures indicating that the microorganism families involved in mutual cooperation for the ame d process has not changed significantly this indicated that oxygen partial pressures varied in the range of 1 1 psig to 6 6 psig had rarely effect on the cooperative mechanism of biofilm based ame d process denitrifiers were prevalently observed in the aerobic layer in the maturebiofilm under a wide range of oxygen partial pressure from 1 1 psig to 6 6 psig fig 5c this phenomenon has aroused our extra concern previous studies pointed out some denitrifiers were capable of executing heterotrophic aerobic denitrification bernet and moletta 1997 cao et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 which inspired that aerobic denitrification might occur in stratified biofilm based ame d process in this study the metagenome analysis of the key genes related to nitrate metabolism and the dominant microbes also verified that aerobic denitrification occurred fig 7 it is universally recognized that the main difference between aerobic denitrification and traditional denitrification is nitrate reductase enzymes nar related to the conversion of nitrate to nitrite this enzyme consists of two major types membrane bound nitrate reductase nar and periplasmic nitrate reductase nap the former one encoded by narg gene plays a key role in anoxic denitrification whereas the latter one encoded by napa gene is associated with aerobic denitrification rajta et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 the difference in taxonomic origins between narg and napa genes revealed that some families only carry out conventional anoxic heterotrophic denitrification and some play a vital role in aerobic denitrification for example anaerolineaceae and nitrospiraceae harboring narg genes rather than napa genes are most likely to only inhabit anoxic space and conduct anoxic denitrification whereas rhodocyclaceae only harboring napa genes preferred to inhabit at aerobic layer and carry out aerobic denitrification previous studies also found rhodocyclaceae contains many species that play major roles in aerobic denitrification chen et al 2012 for certain families harboring both narg and napa genes such as comamonadaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae it possess a potential to inhabit in either aerobic space to conduct aerobic denitrification or anoxic space to perform anoxic denitrification cao et al 2021 etchebehere et al 2002 as the aerobic denitrification has been observed as long as oxygen concentration is lower than 5 mg l 1 rajta et al 2020 the highest do concentration within the biofilm in this study was less than 2 75 mg l 1 fig 5a meaning the biofilm would provide a suitable environment for aerobic denitrification moreover increased abundance of napa genes and decreased abundance of narg genes with the increase in oxygen partial pressure also demonstrated that nitrate could be reduced by the co effect of aerobic denitrification and traditional anoxic denitrification considering the spatial distribution of aerobic methanotrophs fig 5c it is reasonable to deem that co occurrence involving aerobic methane oxidation aerobic denitrification and anoxic denitrification have occurred within biofilm for the ame d process fig 8 which was supported by previous speculation that ame d process was likely to conduct cooperative metabolism involving methane oxidation and anaerobic anoxic denitrification under high oxygen stress cao et al 2021 based on the above discussion a new cooperative path for the ame d process fig 8 was proposed aerobic methanotrophs located in aerobic space oxidize methane to produce and release organic intermediates these released organics act as carbon sources and are then utilized for not only heterotrophic aerobic denitrification at this aerobic layer but also heterotrophic traditional denitrification at adjacent anoxic layer from an ecological perspective being located in aerobic layer offers aerobic denitrifiers an ecological advantage ontiveros valencia et al 2018 which might also promote the transfer efficiency of organic intermediates from methanotrophs to aerobic denitrifiers modin et al 2010a xu et al 2020 4 conclusion in the counter diffused biofilm ame d process oxygen partial pressure in the membrane lumen performed a significant effect on denitrification performance by manipulating biofilm development process and spatial characteristics clsm and oct observations indicated increasing oxygen partial pressure from 1 1 psig to 5 5 psig accelerated the initial biofilm colonization and accumulation rates and then result in a thicker biofilm formation after relative longer mature time with further increase to 6 6 psig excessive oxygen supply would result in the formed biofilm presented granular like agglomeration profiles to lessen the oxygen exposure of denitrifiers further analysis based on microelectrode measurement and fish image revealed that the manipulated counter diffusional biofilm obtained highest denitrification performance at the oxygen partial pressure of 5 5 psig mainly due to the optimal dynamic balance between the aerobic layer and anoxic layer where suitable o2 gradient and sufficient aerobic methanotrophs were achieved in aerobic layer to favor methane oxidation and complete o2 depletion and accessible organic sources were kept to avoid constraining denitrification activity in anoxic layer additionally metagenome analysis combined with fish image evidently demonstrated that spatial stratification of functional microbes occurred in the biofilm and rhodocyclaceae was prone to live in the aerobic layer and played a major role in aerobic denitrification providing proofs of the novel cooperative mechanism that ame d process was co conducted by aerobic methanotrophs heterotrophic aerobic denitrifiers and heterotrophic anoxic denitrifiers for the ame d process the studies regarding c and n elements flows methane utilization efficiency and electron generation and consumption profiles during the ame d process should be highly concerned which are extremely important to reduce secondary methane emissions and promote the practical application of the ame d process meanwhile considering the ame d process in the mbfrs should target the real application future studies should get closer to real application such as using real wastewater and real gas especially the biogas for methane and air for oxygen which would be a key step toward the practical application of the ame d process credit authorship contribution statement jian jiang lu investigation data curation writing original draft hao

15373,nitrate stimulation is widely used in sediment remediation to eliminate sulfides degrade organic pollutants and immobilize phosphorus however the environmental risks of nitrate escape and the subsequent release of pollutants e g nitrite ammonium and trace metals to water bodies during its application has received less attention in this study controlled release nitrate pellets sedcan pellets were manufactured and applied at different sediment depths to examine their effectiveness in controlling the risk of nitrate escape and subsequent pollutant release the germination of submerged plant was also analyzed to assess the ecological risks associated with the remediated sediment the results showed that the sedcan pellets slowly released calcium nitrate which led to denitrifying sulfide oxidation organic matter degradation and the immobilization of phosphorus as a calcium bound species gas production by denitrification increased the sediment porosity 0 3 2 2 and led to the concomitant release of nitrite ammonium and heavy metals creating secondary risks application of the sedcan pellets at depth decreased the nitrate escape and the secondary risks presumably by means of a capping effect of the upper sediment the release of nitrate ammonium ni and cu were partially limited by 91 6 19 0 61 6 and 57 4 when sedcan pellets were incorporated into deeper sediments 7 9 cm moreover the range of sulfide oxidation extended to the upper and lower sediments in the profile column while the sulfide oxidation efficiency reached 85 9 95 0 finally increased germination of bacopa monnieri 20 0 26 demonstrated that in comparison to reference materials the ecological risks of the treated sediments was reduced and the habitat function of sediment was restored after nitrate stimulating remediation the results of this study provide valuable guidelines for nitrate stimulating remediation of sulfide rich black odor sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrate stimulation sulfide oxidation controlled release risk control sediment remediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction black odor pollution is a phenomenon that has been or is being suffered by the rivers in both developing and developed cities during the process of urbanization duval and ludlam 2001 hua and marsuki 2014 cao et al 2020 excessive sulfides e g h2s and fes are the main reason for the black odor characteristic of the sediments cao et al 2020 the concentration of avs could reach more than 1000 mgs kg in the polluted sediments table s1 the enrichment of these sulfides is often attributed to the reduction of sulfur containing pollutants from continuous domestic and industrial inputs which also deplete electron acceptors in the sediment chen et al 2020 natural restoration of the sediment depends on the reoxygenation capacity of the river however the natural recovery of the sediments is typically a long process because of the low solubility of oxygen and difficulty of oxygen moving into the sediments across the water sediment interface even under artificial aeration oxygen can only enter the upper few millimeters of sediment nielsen et al 2010 nitrate is the preferred electron acceptor of microbial anaerobic respiration bombach et al 2010 and drives autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers to oxidize sulfide no3 s2 n2 so4 2 and organic carbon no3 organic carbon n2 co2 in sediments burgin and hamilton 2007 yang et al 2012 xu et al 2014 2015 therefore nitrate is often considered as a biostimulant to oxidize excess sulfide yin et al 2019 and promote the degradation of organic pollutants yang et al 2018 2020 for sediment remediation around the world ripl 1976 chen et al 2013 sun et al 2018 cao et al 2020 calcium ferric and ferrous nitrate are the main forms of nitrate that are applied to sediments because these cations can also inhibit the release of phosphorus and arsenic from the sediments yamada et al 2012 liu et al 2017 lin et al 2021 hemond and lin 2010 sun et al 2018 numerous studies have demonstrated the environmental effectiveness and microbial response caused by nitrate stimulation he et al 2018 yin et al 2019 yang et al 2020 he et al 2021 however the environmental risks of applying nitrate as an additional agent have received less attention nitrate is soluble in water making it difficult for nitrate to effectively reach the remediation target sediment at an effective concentration during actual remediation projects thus its use in remediation often requires the addition of 2 3 times the theoretical dosage of nitrate to the sediment he et al 2018 yin et al 2019 several studies have observed however the release of high concentrations of nitrate to the surface water after it has been applied liu et al 2017 tang et al 2018 the released nitrate may potentially be toxic to aquatic organisms sueitt et al 2015 the controlled release of nitrate may be a way to address the risks associated with the high solubility of nitrate ureña amate et al 2011 berber and hafez 2018 but to our knowledge no study has investigated the application and effectiveness of controlled release nitrate to sediment remediation moreover it is known that the use of nitrate for sediment remediation possesses potential risks which have yet to be adequately addressed several studies have observed for example that ammonium and nitrite are released from nitrate stimulated sediments liu et al 2015 li et al 2019 yin et al 2019 while shao et al 2009 and janke et al 2011 found increased mobility of sediment associated metals after the addition of nitrate however present researches just pointed out the potential risks from nitrate stimulation there is little discussion on the risk control and even did not explain the reason about the release of the subsequent pollutants risk control is a significant component of remediation projects in fact it makes remedial technologies feasible duan et al 2015 song et al 2017 controlling the release of nitrate and other subsequent pollutants from the sediment is a potentially viable approach to controlling the risk of sediment remediation by nitrate stimulation in this study sediment based nitrate pellets were manufactured with the intent to control the release of nitrate through time thereby reducing the risk of nitrate release moreover the study 1 explores the use of the pellets to control against the release of subsequent pollutants and 2 used an ecotoxicological test based on the germination of aquatic plants to evaluate the recovery of the sediments habitat functions which is an important goal of sediment remediation the results provide strategies for controlling the primary nitrate escape and secondary produced pollutants release risks of using the nitrate stimulating approaches for sulfide polluted sediment remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 manufacture of the controlled release nitrate pellet the pellet manufactured for the controlled release of calcium nitrate is named the sedcan pellet it was manufactured from denitrified sediment calcium nitrate and several agents that are responsible for the controlled release function including polyvinyl alcohol pva and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose cmc na table 1 fig s1 the controlled release nitrate ca no3 2 4 h2o forms 35 of the sedcan pellets and was expected to promote dormant denitrifiers in the dentrified sediment a detailed description of the manufacturing procedure for the sedcan pellets is presented in supplementary information si method 1 the microbial community in the denitrified sediment was analyzed as described in our previous study yang et al

electron microscope tescan mira lms czech republic at 5 kev the fourier transform infrared spectra of a sedcan pellet and its precursor materials was obtained using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy tensor ii bruker co germany with a horizontal attenuated total reflectance cell possessing a 45 znse atr crystal pike tech the quantity of nitrate released from the sedcan pellets and the calcium nitrate tetrahydrate crystals were determined in a bottle containing 500 ml of deionized water water samples of the aliquots 0 5 ml were collected at the same position 5 cm above the pellets and analyzed for nitrate concentrations within 6 days of collection the nitrate release data were fitted by a first order reaction kinetic model 2 2 experimental sediment column design grab samples of sediment were collected from the shengtang river in foshan city china the sediments were black odor sediments containing an average of 1971 24 56 97 mg kg of acid volatile sulfide avs the fresh samples were mixed and sieved through a 0 2 mm stainless steel sieve after which the sediments were placed into a column polymeric methyl methacrylate φ 45 mm h 250 mm to a height of 150 mm a total of 250 ml of filtered 0 45 μm river water h 165 mm was then added to the column over the sediment and allowed to remain stable for two days two series of batch experiment were conducted 1 different dosages of sedcan pellets 0 5 10 and 15 g were placed on the surface of the sediment column and named treatments ck t5 t10 and t15 2 the same dosage of sedcan pellets 10 g was placed at different depths in the sediment column and named treatments t top 1 3 cm m middle 7 9 cm and b bottom 12 14 cm the dosages were based on the previous application experiments xu et al 2014 triplicate columns were broken and tested at 0 1 2 4 and 8 weeks for each treatment the samples included surface water within 3 cm of the water sediment interface interstitial water and sediment at the three depths 1 3 7 9 and 12 14 cm before sampling the color of the sediment columns was photographed and the height of the sediment columns was measured 2 3 physical and chemical analysis the bulk density and porosity of the sediments were measured using the cutting ring method si method 2 the cutting rings were previously set at the corresponding depth of the column container sediment color hue saturation and lightness hsl was extracted from the photographs concentrations of nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n ammonium nh4 n and sulfate in surface and interstitial waters were detected using ion chromatography metrohm 882 metrohm ag herisau switzerland the calcium bound phosphorus ca p in the sediments were extracted with 1 mol l naoh according to the methods reported by williams et al 1980 total phosphorus tp in sediment was extracted using ay nitric acid perchloric acid and hydrofluoric acid digestion under 200 c sommers and nelson 1972 si method 3 the extracted ca p and digested tp were measured by molybdenum blue spectrophotometry murphy and riley 1962 concentration of total organic carbon toc in the surface water was determined using a toc analyzer ssm 500 tomy japan the labile and recalcitrant pools of organic carbon loc and roc in the sediments were measured according to the method reported by cheng et al 2007 avs and the simultaneously extracted metals sem in the sediments were extracted using 6 mol l of hcl and measured using a method modified from allen et al 1993 si method 4 nickel ni and copper cu were the dominant heavy metals in the contaminated sediment in the sampled river table s2 the concentrations of ni and cu in the surface water the sem extractions the acetic acid extractions and sediments were determined using an icp ms 7800 agilent technologies inc usa according to the method described in the si method 5 2 4 germination test the germination rate of bacopa monnieri was used to assess the effectiveness of the sediment remediation b monnieri grows in wetlands and has been used in many case studies of phytoremediation because of its high environmental adaptability dineshkumar et al 2019 tabassum abbasi et al 2020 the surface sediment in treatments ck t5 t10 and t15 were selected as the test objects three untreated sediments with corresponding concentration of nitrate added calcium nitrate were analyzed as references that consider the fertilizer efficiency of nitrate they are referred to as bl5 bl10 and bl15 in addition clean silica sand was used as the blank matrix bl0 the analysis conducted in triplicate involved the placement of 25 g of sediment or silica sand in containers with 20 ml of surface water fifty seeds of b monnieri were settled onto the surface of the sediment or silica sand the number of sprouted plants was counted at the 10th and 20th day of the experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 risk control against nitrate escape the high solubility of nitrate enables it to penetrate into the sediment for tens of centimeters xu et al 2015 and stimulate the microbial oxidation of sulfide and organic matters but also makes its excessive release from the sediments causing a eutrophic risk beutel et al 2016 and potentially impact to the aquatic biota sueitt et al 2015 to address this issue we used a controlled release scheme intended to reduce the risk of nitrate escape during it application in sediment remediation nitrate was first mixed with a pva solution during which nitrate was expected to be encapsulated in the molecular voids of the pva fig 1 a the mixture exists as a physical cross linked complex because the functional groups of the pva when mixed with nitrate did not shift fig 1b the nitrate pva solution was then mixed with a powdered sediment and manufactured into a pellet sedcan fig s1 the nitrate pva complex filled the pores of the pellet which further reduce the contact probability between nitrate and water fig 1c shows that the release half life of nitrate was increased by 18 9 h in sediment the sedcan pellets would slowly break down allowing the internal nitrate to be released gradually fig s1 in addition the sedcan pellets have the potential to promote biological activities by enriching denitrifying bacteria during the treatment of denitrified sediment fig 1d thiobacillus spp sulfurimonas spp dechloromonas spp and sulfurimonas spp which are typical denitrifying sulfide oxidizers increased between 0 41 and 1 72 and became dominate after the denitrified treatment fig 1d these bacteria are considered to play an important role in sediment sulfur oxidation he et al 2018 luo et al 2018 lahme et al 2020 yang et al 2012 2020 the sedcan pellets can serve as a bio stimulant for the remediation of sulfide rich sediment three dosages of sedcan pellets were settled on the sediment column to test their remediation effects fig 2 a and fig s2 show that the color of the sediment significantly changed within 3 days of the sedcan treatment values of hue decreased by 120 subsequently saturation and lightness values gradually increased resulting in a change in sediment color from black to brown to yellow the sediment essentially returned to its normal color fig 2a fig s2 accordingly sediment associated sulfides were oxidized to sulfate by autotrophic denitrifying bacteria fig 2b and 2c in which the sulfide oxidation rate ranged between 37 2 and 55 1 organic matter was also consumed decreasing from 6 80 to 5 29 to 5 72 by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria fig 2d these results are comparable to those of previous studies liu et al 2017 tang et al 2018 moreover we found that sedcan not only promoted the reduction of loc from 6 53 to 5 24 to 5 58 but also significantly reduced roc from 0 28 to 0 05 to 0 13 fig 2d this is consistent with our previous studies which found that nitrate drove the biodegradation of persistent organic pollutants e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons xu et al 2015 yang et al 2018 2020 the binding effect of phosphorus was also significant tp decreased significantly in the surface water 31 8 46 3 p 0 05 whereas the ca p in the sediment increased with time and with an increase of the calcium nitrate dosage 17 1 55 9 p 0 05 fig 2e and 2f therefore the degree to which the controlled release calcium nitrate sedcan could remediate contaminated sediment was comparable to the results obtained by previous studies which used bulk calcium nitrate xu et al 2015 liu et al 2017 tang et al 2018 yin et al 2019 lin et al 2021 however it is not feasible to apply the sedcan pellets on sediment surface directly as fig 3 a shows nitrate increased to 203 6 360 1 mgn l during the first two weeks and then maintained at a high concentration in the surface water the high concentrations were related to the low volume of the overlying water leading to overestimate the nitrate concentration instead of the nitrate concentration the rate of nitrate escape was employed when applied the sedcan pellets on the sediment surface 14 5 24 5 of the nitrate escaped from the upside surface of the pellets causing the loss of effective dosage and the increase of the ecological risk in order to improve the utilization rate and reduce the escape of calcium nitrate previous studies tried to mix the calcium nitrate into sediment before introducing the overlying water liu et al 2015 tang et al 2018 li et al 2019 tang et al 2018 observed that 29 of nitrate would escape from the water sediment interface without additional controlled release technologies it is obvious that the control effect of sedcan pellets on nitrate release was better than bulk calcium nitrate adding but additional methods should be investigated to control the nitrate escaped from the upside surface of the pellets an additional method the application of sedcan pellets at depth was used in this study and discussed in following section 3 2 control against subsequent pollutant releases the release of pollutants following the use of nitrate also need to be concerned when sedcan was applied on the surface of the sediments nitrite and ammonium concentrations increased in the surface water as function of the increase in nitrate dosage fig 3b and 3c specifically concentrations of nitrite were increased to 16 0 20 2 mgn l following the nitrate release fig 3a and 3b while the ammonium increased up to 4 92 fold 5 1 mgn l during the first week before quickly returning to a low concentration 0 8 1 7 mgn l fig 3c this phenomenon has been observed in other studies when using bulk calcium nitrate liu et al 2015 tang et al 2018 li et al 2019 yin et al 2019 liu et al 2015 for example found that nitrite and ammonium in surface water increased to concentrations of 3 5 and 30 mgn l respectively after calcium nitrate was added to sulfide rich river sediments tang et al 2018 observed an increase in ammonium by 2 fold in surface water at the beginning of their experiment in a manner similar to our results fig 3b the accumulation of nitrite might be attributed to the low effects of denitrification in surface water while nitrite was not detected in the sediment because of the high activities of sediment microbial community but the release of ammonium was considered to be blown from the sediments through the vertical development of sediment cracks by nitrogen gas a denitrification product liu et al 2015 zhan et al 2020 however these studies did not investigate the hypothesis the release of subsequent pollutants was attributed to the alteration of the physical structure of the sediment we observed that the oxidized sediment layer expanded during the nitrate stimulating remediation period fig s2 moreover bulk density of the sediment decreased between 5 9 and 15 9 whereas sediment porosity increased from 76 3 to 76 6 to 78 5 with an increase in the nitrate dosage during the first two weeks of the experiment fig 3d and 3e the increase in porosity was due to nitrate stimulated denitrification in which the produced nitrogen gas made the sediment fluffy and formed channels fig s2 as the results the specific surface area at the sediment water interface increased allowing for an increased possibility of pollutant releases from the sediment the application of sedcan pellets at depth could potentially control the release of nitrate and subsequent pollutants when the sedcan pellets are placed on the sediment surface about half of the volume of the pellets are exposed to the surface water resulting in an increase in nitrate in the water in aqueous form fig 3a and fig 4 a if the sedcan pellets were buried in the sediment the direct release of nitrate from the pellets to the water could be avoided the nitrate concentration in the surface water in the middle and bottom layer treatments was only 8 3 and 2 2 of that observed for the top layer treatment fig 4a in these cases the nitrate escape rates were reduced to 0 28 and 0 13 respectively the results indicated that the scheme of application of sedcan pellet at depth was more effective on controlling nitrate release compared to the sediment capping technology liu et al 2015 and li et al 2019 conducted 6 cm and 1 cm of clean sediment capping on the nitrate mixed sediment however still about 9 and 16 4 of nitrate were escaped respectively in fact the capping effects of upper sediment also exhibited in this study the sediment columns became more compact exhibiting smaller heights when the sedcan pellets were place in the middle and bottom of the sediment fig 4b which limited the release of subsequent pollutants the releases of ammonium and heavy metals were lower during the middle and bottom treatments than during the surface treatments fig 4c and 4d while nitrite was not observed in the sediment profiles the placement of sedcan pellets below the sediment surface were also more effective with regards to sediment remediation as shown in fig 4e pellet placement in the middle layer not only oxidized the avs in the layer 94 3 but also removed the avs in the top and bottom layers 85 9 and 95 0 moreover a larger range of color change over the entire sediment column was observed during the middle layer application of the sedcan pellets fig s3 and fig 4f therefore we propose that the deep placement of pellets is an effective way to maximize the remediation effects of nitrate and minimize the risk of nitrate and subsequent pollutant releases the pellets could be applied by sowing them into the sediment e g using the seeding machine or they could be covered by capping material after surface placement in fact the in situ application of sedcan pellets was combined with the clean sand capping of a black odor river and the remediation project resulted in good effectiveness si case 3 3 risk assessment related to ecological function several studies have suggested that ecological risks would be increased by the treatment of sediment by nitrate stimulation because the bioavailability of heavy metals would increase when insoluble metal sulfides were oxidized and dissolved by nitrate driven denitrification shao et al 2009 liu et al 2016 insoluble metal sulfides oxidizable fraction are considered as the stable fraction of divalent metals and tend to be less bioavailable the molar ratio of sem and avs was used to determine the content of the metal sulfides allen et al 1993 and can be used as an indicator of sediment ecological toxicity hansen et al 1996 yu et al 2001 shao et al 2009 observed that the sem avs ratio increased from 0 03 to 3 1 after nitrate driven sulfide oxidation which implies that the ecological risk of the treated sediment increased in this study the sem avs ratio also increased from 0 32 to 1 02 as the added nitrate dosage increased fig 5 a the unbound metals produced during sulfide oxidation are dissolve in their ionic phase and subsequently scavenged by exchangeable and reducible phases liu et al 2016 as shown in fig 4d metals were released into the water when the sedcan pellets were applied to the top layer of the sediment while the placement of the sedcan pellets at depth alleviated the risk in addition the exchangeable phase of ni and cu did not change significantly which implies that a stable species of the metals might be rebuilt after 8 weeks of remediation the germination rate of aquatic plants is widely used in ecotoxicological assessment oppts us epa 1996 mee china 2013 which was applied to evaluate the performance of the sediment remediation process this approach assumes that the sediments serve as a habitat for aquatic biota after sediment remediation as fig 5b shows the germination rate of b monnieri increased t5 15 vs ck 20 0 26 0 significantly p 0 05 after nitrate stimulating remediation bl group vs t group in fig 5b not only because nitrate acted as a nitrogen fertilizer that promoted growth but also because of the remedial effect of the pellets on the sediment these data demonstrated that nitrate stimulating remediation sedcan pellet could reduce the ecological risks of pollutants in the sediment the elimination of sulfide contributed to the restoration of sediment in terms of its habitat function because sulfide is toxic to aquatic plants sederias and colman 2009 in this study sulfide elimination significantly figs 2b and 4e reduced the pressure for b monnieri while the remobilized heavy metals did not override the benefits of sulfide elimination the results also suggest that the sem avs ratio may not be suitable for evaluating the ecological risk of nitrate stimulating sediment remediation because the increase in the sem avs ratio caused by the decrease in avs could not accurately express the alteration in risk during the remediation process the risk from toxic trace metals depended on the initial concentration in the sediment and which were ultimately released 4 conclusions the pva sediment based pellets sedcan pellets fixed soluble calcium nitrate into a controlled release form that could quickly settle to the sediment surface and that reduced the escape of nitrate the efficiency of sulfide oxidation organic matter degradation and phosphorus fixation increased with the dosage of the sedcan pellets applied to the sediment however gas produced by denitrification expanded the sediment pores 0 3 2 2 and created channels through the sediment layer which increased the release of subsequence pollutants during the remediation process these released pollutants create a secondary risk during remediation the placement of the sedcan pellets at depth is suggested to control the nitrate escape and the secondary risk the upper sediment or other capping materials may limit the expansion of the sediment and decrease the release of the nitrate 91 6 and the subsequent pollutants including nitrite 0 ammonium 19 0 ni 61 6 and cu 57 4 moreover the effectiveness of the remediation approach when the sedcan pellets were placed a depth was better than that of their surface application 88 9 95 6 of the sulfide was oxidized through the entire sediment column 15 cm with the oxidation of sulfides the toxic stress applied to b monnieri decreased significantly germination increased 20 0 26 0 which indicates that the overall ecological risk of the sediment was reduced after remediation by nitrate stimulation therefore the deep application of the controlled release pellets could be a strategy to improve the practicality of nitrate stimulating remediation technologies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

submerged plant was also analyzed to assess the ecological risks associated with the remediated sediment the results showed that the sedcan pellets slowly released calcium nitrate which led to denitrifying sulfide oxidation organic matter degradation and the immobilization of phosphorus as a calcium bound species gas production by denitrification increased the sediment porosity 0 3 2 2 and led to the concomitant release of nitrite ammonium and heavy metals creating secondary risks application of the sedcan pellets at depth decreased the nitrate escape and the secondary risks presumably by means of a capping effect of the upper sediment the release of nitrate ammonium ni and cu were partially limited by 91 6 19 0 61 6 and 57 4 when sedcan pellets were incorporated into deeper sediments 7 9 cm moreover the range of sulfide oxidation extended to the upper and lower sediments in the profile column while the sulfide oxidation efficiency reached 85 9 95 0 finally increased germination of bacopa monnieri 20 0 26 demonstrated that in comparison to reference materials the ecological risks of the treated sediments was reduced and the habitat function of sediment was restored after nitrate stimulating remediation the results of this study provide valuable guidelines for nitrate stimulating remediation of sulfide rich black odor sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrate stimulation sulfide oxidation controlled release risk control sediment remediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction black odor pollution is a phenomenon that has been or is being suffered by the rivers in both developing and developed cities during the process of urbanization duval and ludlam 2001 hua and marsuki 2014 cao et al 2020 excessive sulfides e g h2s and fes are the main reason for the black odor characteristic of the sediments cao et al 2020 the concentration of avs could reach more than 1000 mgs kg in the polluted sediments table s1 the enrichment of these sulfides is often attributed to the reduction of sulfur containing pollutants from continuous domestic and industrial inputs which also deplete electron acceptors in the sediment chen et al 2020 natural restoration of the sediment depends on the reoxygenation capacity of the river however the natural recovery of the sediments is typically a long process because of the low solubility of oxygen and difficulty of oxygen moving into the sediments across the water sediment interface even under artificial aeration oxygen can only enter the upper few millimeters of sediment nielsen et al 2010 nitrate is the preferred electron acceptor of microbial anaerobic respiration bombach et al 2010 and drives autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers to oxidize sulfide no3 s2 n2 so4 2 and organic carbon no3 organic carbon n2 co2 in sediments burgin and hamilton 2007 yang et al 2012 xu et al 2014 2015 therefore nitrate is often considered as a biostimulant to oxidize excess sulfide yin et al 2019 and promote the degradation of organic pollutants yang et al 2018 2020 for sediment remediation around the world ripl 1976 chen et al 2013 sun et al 2018 cao et al 2020 calcium ferric and ferrous nitrate are the main forms of nitrate that are applied to sediments because these cations can also inhibit the release of phosphorus and arsenic from the sediments yamada et al 2012 liu et al 2017 lin et al 2021 hemond and lin 2010 sun et al 2018 numerous studies have demonstrated the environmental effectiveness and microbial response caused by nitrate stimulation he et al 2018 yin et al 2019 yang et al 2020 he et al 2021 however the environmental risks of applying nitrate as an additional agent have received less attention nitrate is soluble in water making it difficult for nitrate to effectively reach the remediation target sediment at an effective concentration during actual remediation projects thus its use in remediation often requires the addition of 2 3 times the theoretical dosage of nitrate to the sediment he et al 2018 yin et al 2019 several studies have observed however the release of high concentrations of nitrate to the surface water after it has been applied liu et al 2017 tang et al 2018 the released nitrate may potentially be toxic to aquatic organisms sueitt et al 2015 the controlled release of nitrate may be a way to address the risks associated with the high solubility of nitrate ureña amate et al 2011 berber and hafez 2018 but to our knowledge no study has investigated the application and effectiveness of controlled release nitrate to sediment remediation moreover it is known that the use of nitrate for sediment remediation possesses potential risks which have yet to be adequately addressed several studies have observed for example that ammonium and nitrite are released from nitrate stimulated sediments liu et al 2015 li et al 2019 yin et al 2019 while shao et al 2009 and janke et al 2011 found increased mobility of sediment associated metals after the addition of nitrate however present researches just pointed out the potential risks from nitrate stimulation there is little discussion on the risk control and even did not explain the reason about the release of the subsequent pollutants risk control is a significant component of remediation projects in fact it makes remedial technologies feasible duan et al 2015 song et al 2017 controlling the release of nitrate and other subsequent pollutants from the sediment is a potentially viable approach to controlling the risk of sediment remediation by nitrate stimulation in this study sediment based nitrate pellets were manufactured with the intent to control the release of nitrate through time thereby reducing the risk of nitrate release moreover the study 1 explores the use of the pellets to control against the release of subsequent pollutants and 2 used an ecotoxicological test based on the germination of aquatic plants to evaluate the recovery of the sediments habitat functions which is an important goal of sediment remediation the results provide strategies for controlling the primary nitrate escape and secondary produced pollutants release risks of using the nitrate stimulating approaches for sulfide polluted sediment remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 manufacture of the controlled release nitrate pellet the pellet manufactured for the controlled release of calcium nitrate is named the sedcan pellet it was manufactured from denitrified sediment calcium nitrate and several agents that are responsible for the controlled release function including polyvinyl alcohol pva and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose cmc na table 1 fig s1 the controlled release nitrate ca no3 2 4 h2o forms 35 of the sedcan pellets and was expected to promote dormant denitrifiers in the dentrified sediment a detailed description of the manufacturing procedure for the sedcan pellets is presented in supplementary information si method 1 the microbial community in the denitrified sediment was analyzed as described in our previous study yang et al

electron microscope tescan mira lms czech republic at 5 kev the fourier transform infrared spectra of a sedcan pellet and its precursor materials was obtained using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy tensor ii bruker co germany with a horizontal attenuated total reflectance cell possessing a 45 znse atr crystal pike tech the quantity of nitrate released from the sedcan pellets and the calcium nitrate tetrahydrate crystals were determined in a bottle containing 500 ml of deionized water water samples of the aliquots 0 5 ml were collected at the same position 5 cm above the pellets and analyzed for nitrate concentrations within 6 days of collection the nitrate release data were fitted by a first order reaction kinetic model 2 2 experimental sediment column design grab samples of sediment were collected from the shengtang river in foshan city china the sediments were black odor sediments containing an average of 1971 24 56 97 mg kg of acid volatile sulfide avs the fresh samples were mixed and sieved through a 0 2 mm stainless steel sieve after which the sediments were placed into a column polymeric methyl methacrylate φ 45 mm h 250 mm to a height of 150 mm a total of 250 ml of filtered 0 45 μm river water h 165 mm was then added to the column over the sediment and allowed to remain stable for two days two series of batch experiment were conducted 1 different dosages of sedcan pellets 0 5 10 and 15 g were placed on the surface of the sediment column and named treatments ck t5 t10 and t15 2 the same dosage of sedcan pellets 10 g was placed at different depths in the sediment column and named treatments t top 1 3 cm m middle 7 9 cm and b bottom 12 14 cm the dosages were based on the previous application experiments xu et al 2014 triplicate columns were broken and tested at 0 1 2 4 and 8 weeks for each treatment the samples included surface water within 3 cm of the water sediment interface interstitial water and sediment at the three depths 1 3 7 9 and 12 14 cm before sampling the color of the sediment columns was photographed and the height of the sediment columns was measured 2 3 physical and chemical analysis the bulk density and porosity of the sediments were measured using the cutting ring method si method 2 the cutting rings were previously set at the corresponding depth of the column container sediment color hue saturation and lightness hsl was extracted from the photographs concentrations of nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n ammonium nh4 n and sulfate in surface and interstitial waters were detected using ion chromatography metrohm 882 metrohm ag herisau switzerland the calcium bound phosphorus ca p in the sediments were extracted with 1 mol l naoh according to the methods reported by williams et al 1980 total phosphorus tp in sediment was extracted using ay nitric acid perchloric acid and hydrofluoric acid digestion under 200 c sommers and nelson 1972 si method 3 the extracted ca p and digested tp were measured by molybdenum blue spectrophotometry murphy and riley 1962 concentration of total organic carbon toc in the surface water was determined using a toc analyzer ssm 500 tomy japan the labile and recalcitrant pools of organic carbon loc and roc in the sediments were measured according to the method reported by cheng et al 2007 avs and the simultaneously extracted metals sem in the sediments were extracted using 6 mol l of hcl and measured using a method modified from allen et al 1993 si method 4 nickel ni and copper cu were the dominant heavy metals in the contaminated sediment in the sampled river table s2 the concentrations of ni and cu in the surface water the sem extractions the acetic acid extractions and sediments were determined using an icp ms 7800 agilent technologies inc usa according to the method described in the si method 5 2 4 germination test the germination rate of bacopa monnieri was used to assess the effectiveness of the sediment remediation b monnieri grows in wetlands and has been used in many case studies of phytoremediation because of its high environmental adaptability dineshkumar et al 2019 tabassum abbasi et al 2020 the surface sediment in treatments ck t5 t10 and t15 were selected as the test objects three untreated sediments with corresponding concentration of nitrate added calcium nitrate were analyzed as references that consider the fertilizer efficiency of nitrate they are referred to as bl5 bl10 and bl15 in addition clean silica sand was used as the blank matrix bl0 the analysis conducted in triplicate involved the placement of 25 g of sediment or silica sand in containers with 20 ml of surface water fifty seeds of b monnieri were settled onto the surface of the sediment or silica sand the number of sprouted plants was counted at the 10th and 20th day of the experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 risk control against nitrate escape the high solubility of nitrate enables it to penetrate into the sediment for tens of centimeters xu et al 2015 and stimulate the microbial oxidation of sulfide and organic matters but also makes its excessive release from the sediments causing a eutrophic risk beutel et al 2016 and potentially impact to the aquatic biota sueitt et al 2015 to address this issue we used a controlled release scheme intended to reduce the risk of nitrate escape during it application in sediment remediation nitrate was first mixed with a pva solution during which nitrate was expected to be encapsulated in the molecular voids of the pva fig 1 a the mixture exists as a physical cross linked complex because the functional groups of the pva when mixed with nitrate did not shift fig 1b the nitrate pva solution was then mixed with a powdered sediment and manufactured into a pellet sedcan fig s1 the nitrate pva complex filled the pores of the pellet which further reduce the contact probability between nitrate and water fig 1c shows that the release half life of nitrate was increased by 18 9 h in sediment the sedcan pellets would slowly break down allowing the internal nitrate to be released gradually fig s1 in addition the sedcan pellets have the potential to promote biological activities by enriching denitrifying bacteria during the treatment of denitrified sediment fig 1d thiobacillus spp sulfurimonas spp dechloromonas spp and sulfurimonas spp which are typical denitrifying sulfide oxidizers increased between 0 41 and 1 72 and became dominate after the denitrified treatment fig 1d these bacteria are considered to play an important role in sediment sulfur oxidation he et al 2018 luo et al 2018 lahme et al 2020 yang et al 2012 2020 the sedcan pellets can serve as a bio stimulant for the remediation of sulfide rich sediment three dosages of sedcan pellets were settled on the sediment column to test their remediation effects fig 2 a and fig s2 show that the color of the sediment significantly changed within 3 days of the sedcan treatment values of hue decreased by 120 subsequently saturation and lightness values gradually increased resulting in a change in sediment color from black to brown to yellow the sediment essentially returned to its normal color fig 2a fig s2 accordingly sediment associated sulfides were oxidized to sulfate by autotrophic denitrifying bacteria fig 2b and 2c in which the sulfide oxidation rate ranged between 37 2 and 55 1 organic matter was also consumed decreasing from 6 80 to 5 29 to 5 72 by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria fig 2d these results are comparable to those of previous studies liu et al 2017 tang et al 2018 moreover we found that sedcan not only promoted the reduction of loc from 6 53 to 5 24 to 5 58 but also significantly reduced roc from 0 28 to 0 05 to 0 13 fig 2d this is consistent with our previous studies which found that nitrate drove the biodegradation of persistent organic pollutants e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons xu et al 2015 yang et al 2018 2020 the binding effect of phosphorus was also significant tp decreased significantly in the surface water 31 8 46 3 p 0 05 whereas the ca p in the sediment increased with time and with an increase of the calcium nitrate dosage 17 1 55 9 p 0 05 fig 2e and 2f therefore the degree to which the controlled release calcium nitrate sedcan could remediate contaminated sediment was comparable to the results obtained by previous studies which used bulk calcium nitrate xu et al 2015 liu et al 2017 tang et al 2018 yin et al 2019 lin et al 2021 however it is not feasible to apply the sedcan pellets on sediment surface directly as fig 3 a shows nitrate increased to 203 6 360 1 mgn l during the first two weeks and then maintained at a high concentration in the surface water the high concentrations were related to the low volume of the overlying water leading to overestimate the nitrate concentration instead of the nitrate concentration the rate of nitrate escape was employed when applied the sedcan pellets on the sediment surface 14 5 24 5 of the nitrate escaped from the upside surface of the pellets causing the loss of effective dosage and the increase of the ecological risk in order to improve the utilization rate and reduce the escape of calcium nitrate previous studies tried to mix the calcium nitrate into sediment before introducing the overlying water liu et al 2015 tang et al 2018 li et al 2019 tang et al 2018 observed that 29 of nitrate would escape from the water sediment interface without additional controlled release technologies it is obvious that the control effect of sedcan pellets on nitrate release was better than bulk calcium nitrate adding but additional methods should be investigated to control the nitrate escaped from the upside surface of the pellets an additional method the application of sedcan pellets at depth was used in this study and discussed in following section 3 2 control against subsequent pollutant releases the release of pollutants following the use of nitrate also need to be concerned when sedcan was applied on the surface of the sediments nitrite and ammonium concentrations increased in the surface water as function of the increase in nitrate dosage fig 3b and 3c specifically concentrations of nitrite were increased to 16 0 20 2 mgn l following the nitrate release fig 3a and 3b while the ammonium increased up to 4 92 fold 5 1 mgn l during the first week before quickly returning to a low concentration 0 8 1 7 mgn l fig 3c this phenomenon has been observed in other studies when using bulk calcium nitrate liu et al 2015 tang et al 2018 li et al 2019 yin et al 2019 liu et al 2015 for example found that nitrite and ammonium in surface water increased to concentrations of 3 5 and 30 mgn l respectively after calcium nitrate was added to sulfide rich river sediments tang et al 2018 observed an increase in ammonium by 2 fold in surface water at the beginning of their experiment in a manner similar to our results fig 3b the accumulation of nitrite might be attributed to the low effects of denitrification in surface water while nitrite was not detected in the sediment because of the high activities of sediment microbial community but the release of ammonium was considered to be blown from the sediments through the vertical development of sediment cracks by nitrogen gas a denitrification product liu et al 2015 zhan et al 2020 however these studies did not investigate the hypothesis the release of subsequent pollutants was attributed to the alteration of the physical structure of the sediment we observed that the oxidized sediment layer expanded during the nitrate stimulating remediation period fig s2 moreover bulk density of the sediment decreased between 5 9 and 15 9 whereas sediment porosity increased from 76 3 to 76 6 to 78 5 with an increase in the nitrate dosage during the first two weeks of the experiment fig 3d and 3e the increase in porosity was due to nitrate stimulated denitrification in which the produced nitrogen gas made the sediment fluffy and formed channels fig s2 as the results the specific surface area at the sediment water interface increased allowing for an increased possibility of pollutant releases from the sediment the application of sedcan pellets at depth could potentially control the release of nitrate and subsequent pollutants when the sedcan pellets are placed on the sediment surface about half of the volume of the pellets are exposed to the surface water resulting in an increase in nitrate in the water in aqueous form fig 3a and fig 4 a if the sedcan pellets were buried in the sediment the direct release of nitrate from the pellets to the water could be avoided the nitrate concentration in the surface water in the middle and bottom layer treatments was only 8 3 and 2 2 of that observed for the top layer treatment fig 4a in these cases the nitrate escape rates were reduced to 0 28 and 0 13 respectively the results indicated that the scheme of application of sedcan pellet at depth was more effective on controlling nitrate release compared to the sediment capping technology liu et al 2015 and li et al 2019 conducted 6 cm and 1 cm of clean sediment capping on the nitrate mixed sediment however still about 9 and 16 4 of nitrate were escaped respectively in fact the capping effects of upper sediment also exhibited in this study the sediment columns became more compact exhibiting smaller heights when the sedcan pellets were place in the middle and bottom of the sediment fig 4b which limited the release of subsequent pollutants the releases of ammonium and heavy metals were lower during the middle and bottom treatments than during the surface treatments fig 4c and 4d while nitrite was not observed in the sediment profiles the placement of sedcan pellets below the sediment surface were also more effective with regards to sediment remediation as shown in fig 4e pellet placement in the middle layer not only oxidized the avs in the layer 94 3 but also removed the avs in the top and bottom layers 85 9 and 95 0 moreover a larger range of color change over the entire sediment column was observed during the middle layer application of the sedcan pellets fig s3 and fig 4f therefore we propose that the deep placement of pellets is an effective way to maximize the remediation effects of nitrate and minimize the risk of nitrate and subsequent pollutant releases the pellets could be applied by sowing them into the sediment e g using the seeding machine or they could be covered by capping material after surface placement in fact the in situ application of sedcan pellets was combined with the clean sand capping of a black odor river and the remediation project resulted in good effectiveness si case 3 3 risk assessment related to ecological function several studies have suggested that ecological risks would be increased by the treatment of sediment by nitrate stimulation because the bioavailability of heavy metals would increase when insoluble metal sulfides were oxidized and dissolved by nitrate driven denitrification shao et al 2009 liu et al 2016 insoluble metal sulfides oxidizable fraction are considered as the stable fraction of divalent metals and tend to be less bioavailable the molar ratio of sem and avs was used to determine the content of the metal sulfides allen et al 1993 and can be used as an indicator of sediment ecological toxicity hansen et al 1996 yu et al 2001 shao et al 2009 observed that the sem avs ratio increased from 0 03 to 3 1 after nitrate driven sulfide oxidation which implies that the ecological risk of the treated sediment increased in this study the sem avs ratio also increased from 0 32 to 1 02 as the added nitrate dosage increased fig 5 a the unbound metals produced during sulfide oxidation are dissolve in their ionic phase and subsequently scavenged by exchangeable and reducible phases liu et al 2016 as shown in fig 4d metals were released into the water when the sedcan pellets were applied to the top layer of the sediment while the placement of the sedcan pellets at depth alleviated the risk in addition the exchangeable phase of ni and cu did not change significantly which implies that a stable species of the metals might be rebuilt after 8 weeks of remediation the germination rate of aquatic plants is widely used in ecotoxicological assessment oppts us epa 1996 mee china 2013 which was applied to evaluate the performance of the sediment remediation process this approach assumes that the sediments serve as a habitat for aquatic biota after sediment remediation as fig 5b shows the germination rate of b monnieri increased t5 15 vs ck 20 0 26 0 significantly p 0 05 after nitrate stimulating remediation bl group vs t group in fig 5b not only because nitrate acted as a nitrogen fertilizer that promoted growth but also because of the remedial effect of the pellets on the sediment these data demonstrated that nitrate stimulating remediation sedcan pellet could reduce the ecological risks of pollutants in the sediment the elimination of sulfide contributed to the restoration of sediment in terms of its habitat function because sulfide is toxic to aquatic plants sederias and colman 2009 in this study sulfide elimination significantly figs 2b and 4e reduced the pressure for b monnieri while the remobilized heavy metals did not override the benefits of sulfide elimination the results also suggest that the sem avs ratio may not be suitable for evaluating the ecological risk of nitrate stimulating sediment remediation because the increase in the sem avs ratio caused by the decrease in avs could not accurately express the alteration in risk during the remediation process the risk from toxic trace metals depended on the initial concentration in the sediment and which were ultimately released 4 conclusions the pva sediment based pellets sedcan pellets fixed soluble calcium nitrate into a controlled release form that could quickly settle to the sediment surface and that reduced the escape of nitrate the efficiency of sulfide oxidation organic matter degradation and phosphorus fixation increased with the dosage of the sedcan pellets applied to the sediment however gas produced by denitrification expanded the sediment pores 0 3 2 2 and created channels through the sediment layer which increased the release of subsequence pollutants during the remediation process these released pollutants create a secondary risk during remediation the placement of the sedcan pellets at depth is suggested to control the nitrate escape and the secondary risk the upper sediment or other capping materials may limit the expansion of the sediment and decrease the release of the nitrate 91 6 and the subsequent pollutants including nitrite 0 ammonium 19 0 ni 61 6 and cu 57 4 moreover the effectiveness of the remediation approach when the sedcan pellets were placed a depth was better than that of their surface application 88 9 95 6 of the sulfide was oxidized through the entire sediment column 15 cm with the oxidation of sulfides the toxic stress applied to b monnieri decreased significantly germination increased 20 0 26 0 which indicates that the overall ecological risk of the sediment was reduced after remediation by nitrate stimulation therefore the deep application of the controlled release pellets could be a strategy to improve the practicality of nitrate stimulating remediation technologies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15374,neonicotinoid insecticides nnis are the most popular insecticides worldwide yet their spatiotemporal distribution and fates during the urban water cycle remain limited on a large watershed scale thus we investigated ten kinds of nnis in surface water from the lower reaches of the yangtze river and hubs of the urban water cycle in all seasons in brief eight out of ten nnis were detected and thiamethoxam thm imidacloprid imi and dinotefuran dnt were the most abundant nnis in surface water with concentrations of 0 29 48 15 ng l 1 69 20 57 ng l and 0 98 25 32 ng l respectively the average concentrations of total nnis in summer were 1 96 4 41 folds higher than those in other seasons nnis in the effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps were lower than those in surface water while the average concentrations of total nnis in the effluents of industrial wwtps were 1 56 6 86 folds higher than those in surface water indicating that insecticide production is an important source for nnis in surface water dnt was the most recalcitrant nni in wwtps with an average removal efficiency of 49 89 while in drinking water treatment plants dwtps the removal efficiencies of most nnis were limited except for clothianidin clo 90 risk assessment showed that nnis posed medium or high risks to aquatic life and dnt contributed 26 86 51 48 to the cumulative risks of detected nnis this study investigates the spatiotemporal distribution and risks of nnis and provides information for the supervision of nnis in the yangtze river basin china graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords neonicotinoid insecticides spatiotemporal distribution urban cycle yangtze river ecological risk 1 introduction since the first launch of imidacloprid imi in 1990 neonicotinoid insecticides nnis have gradually replaced traditional insecticides i e organophosphates and carbamates becoming the most popular class in the world for various urban and agricultural applications myers and hill 2014 thompson et al 2020 in 2014 the sales of nnis accounted for over 25 of the total global insecticide sales and contributed approximately 3 7 billion u s dollars to the global market value bass et al 2015 gerwick and sparks 2014 due to their high solubility in the water and persistence or pseudo persistence nnis are likely to migrate from production and application areas to the surface water through overland runoff or discharge of wastewater treatment plants wwtps hladik et al 2014 webb et al 2021 thus nnis have been frequently detected in surface water worldwide for instance berens et al 2021 detected four kinds of nnis in surface water in minnesota u s with concentrations at the ng l level struger et al 2017 also reported that five kinds of nnis were found in surface water of canada with the highest concentration of 1 34 μg l a report showed that 93 of samples in surface water of australia contained two or more nnis in the range of 0 06 4 5 μg l sanchez bayo and hyne 2014 however few studies have simultaneously investigated the occurrence fates and risks of nnis during the urban water cycle on a large watershed scale the yangtze river is the longest river in china and the third longest river globally several studies have reported the contamination status of nnis in surface water of the yangtze river and the results showed that 95 of the nnis released into the east china sea resulted from heavy agricultural use in the yangtze river basin chen et al 2019 pan et al 2020 as an essential region with rapid economic development the lower reaches of the yangtze river is one of the most critical regions for the production of industrial agriculture and residential activities in china and even worldwide yang et al 2009 yu et al 2020 nevertheless limited data is available about nnis in the lower reaches of the yangtze river moreover the yangtze river not only receives runoff from agricultural sources but also the discharge of wwtps including both industrial and municipal wwtps previous studies have investigated the fates of nnis in wwtps and most of them only focused on municipal wwtps but underestimated the impact of industrial wwtps berens et al 2021 iancu and radu 2018 webb et al 2021 zhi et al 2022 in addition the lower reaches of the yangtze river also serves as the primary drinking water supply for more than 50 million people along the river and the potential impacts of nnis on human beings should also be considered nnis are designed to selectively kill target insects because their structure can bind more strongly to insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nachrs than mammalian nachrs tomizawa and casida 2005 nevertheless with the extensive use of nnis increasing evidence suggests that nnis are not as safe as first thought for the environment and non target organisms and contribute to the devastating losses of honeybees seltenrich 2017 except for insects nnis are also toxic to vertebrate wildlife gibbons et al 2015 and aquatic organisms including algae malev et al 2012 invertebrates morrissey et al 2015 and fish ma et al 2019 besides nni exposure was found to cause some sublethal toxicity to mammals such as reproductive toxicity hepatotoxicity genotoxicity carcinogenicity neurotoxicity and endocrine effects thompson et al 2020 in addition some transformation products of nnis were proven to be more harmful to non target organisms than parent compounds for instance the toxicity of imine derivatives of imi and thcp to vertebrate cells was higher than that of imi and thcp themselves tomizawa and casida 2000 overall the occurrence fates and especially risks of nnis during the urban water cycle deserve more attention the present study aimed to investigate the occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of nnis in water samples from the lower reaches of the yangtze river and the influents and effluents of industrial wwtps municipal wwtps and drinking water treatment plants dwtps along

chosen as typical and new nnis mahai et al 2021 the potential risks of nnis in surface water and effluents of the water treatment plants to aquatic ecosystems and humans were also estimated this data provides a better understanding of the occurrence and fates of nnis during the urban water cycle in the lower reaches of the yangtze river highlight the need for integrated water environment management and provide opinions for choosing better wastewater treatment processes to mitigate nnis contaminations 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents standards of imi dnt ace flo clo

dryness under a gentle nitrogen stream at 35 c and reconstituted with 1 ml of methanol the nylon filters were applied to remove suspended solids in the samples before instrumental analysis 2 4 instrumental analysis detection of nnis was performed on an ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry uplcclass xevo tq ms waters u s with a c18 column 1 7 μm 2

than the mql were regarded as below the detection level bdl the detailed method performance parameters are summarized in table s6 2 6 ecological risk assessment and estimation of human exposure for surface water and effluents from wwtps each nni s risk quotient rq was calculated according to the eq 1 the cumulative risks of detected nnis were the sum of each rq value according to the criteria for ecological risk assessment rqs less than 0 1 between 0 1 and 1 0 and greater than 1 0 indicate low medium and high risks respectively palma et al 2014 1 rq mec pnec where mec and pnec represent the measured environmental concentration and predicted no effect concentration respectively the pnecs were assessed by dividing the toxicity values by an assessment factor af based on the european technical guidance document tgd af equal to 100 50 or 10 is assigned when one two or three trophic levels of chronic no observed effect concentrations noec values are available and an af of 1000 is assigned when ec50 or lc50 is obtained the toxicity data were obtained from the pesticide properties database ppdb https sitem herts ac uk aeru ppdb en the toxicity estimation software tool 5 1 1 0 was applied to calculate their toxicity based on their structures for chemicals with limited toxicity data the most sensitive species was selected as the target organism for each nni to reflect the worst case scenario the toxicity data used in this study are presented in table s7 for effluents of dwtps the estimated daily intake edi pg kg body weight bw d of each nni through drinking water consumption was calculated to assess human exposure potential using the eq 2 mahai et al 2021 the daily water ingestion rate dwir l kg bw d and the absorption rate ar after oral administration of the

were expressed as the mean standard deviation and analyzed with pasw statistics 18 spss inc chicago u s one way analysis of variance anova was conducted to detect the significant differences across different samples and the significance level was set at p 0 05 principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted using r software version 4 0 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of nnis in surface water in total 8 out of the 10 targeted nnis were detected in surface water except for thcp and sul ace showed a detection frequency of 91 91 in winter and all other analytes were present at all sampling sites during the four seasons table s8 in brief thm was the most abundant nni in surface water with concentrations ranging from 0 29 to 48 15 ng l followed by imi 1 69 20 57 ng l dnt 0 98 25 32 ng l ntp 0 42 8 00 ng l clo 0 32 3 9 ng l imit 0 28 3 62 ng l flo bdl 2 47 ng l and ace bdl 1 63 ng l fig 2 and s1 these results are in accordance with the report of bass et al 2015 assuming that thm and imi were the most popular nnis with market shares of 37 6 and 33 5 among the total market share of nnis in 2012 respectively thm and imi were detected in the lower reaches of the yangtze river in 2016 with median concentrations of 9 1 and 41 44 ng l respectively peng et al 2018 which is comparable to the present study the occurrence of nnis in surface water is highly associated with local use preference a previous study revealed that the most prevalent nnis in the u s were clo imi and thm thompson et al 2021 and thus they were most frequently detected ones in surface water hladik et al 2014 the minimum median mean maximum concentrations and frequencies of detection of individual nni for each season are detailed in table s8 in brief the results showed seasonal differences of nni contamination in surface water from the lower reaches of the yangtze river fig 3 a and the order of the average nnis concentrations in surface water for different seasons was summer 56 67 ng l spring 28 88 ng l fall 18 85 ng l winter 12 85 ng l table s8 these results are consistent with previous studies on the central yangtze river in china mahai et al 2019 the pearl river in china zhang et al 2019 and the ave and sousa rivers in portugal sousa et al 2019 showing the occurrence of the highest nnis in summer spring to summer is the peak period for agricultural pesticide use because seed coating often occurs in spring and seed spraying occurs in summer mahai et al 2019 in addition surface runoff extensively contributes to the mobility of the nnis chretien et al 2017 and the precipitation in summer is heavier than that in other seasons overall agricultural application and rainfall likely account for this study s seasonal variation according to the hydrological characteristics the study area is divided into the upper middle and lower reaches fig 1 the confidence circles for the three sections almost overlap fig 3b indicating no spatial distribution differences in the lower reaches of the yangtze river the climate and main crops rice wheat potatoes corn soybeans in these adjacent cities are similar qiu et al 2009 leading to similar nnis use and pollution mahai et al 2019 studied the occurrence of 6 kinds of nnis in surface water from the central yangtze river in 2015 and found that ace imi and thm were the dominant nnis and dnt was not detected at any sampling site conversely dnt was ubiquitous and had high concentrations in surface water from the lower reaches of the yangtze river in this study this may be because dnt is mainly applied in rice cultivation watanabe et al 2011 and rice is the prime agricultural crop in the study area similarly xiong et al 2021 detected ace clo dnt thm and imi in the poyang lake china and found that dnt was the most dominant nni with a mean concentration up to 200 296 ng l yamamoto et al 2012 also reported that dnt was the most frequently detected and most abundant nni in japan due to the japanese wet paddy rice agriculture 3 2 fate of nnis in water treatment plants the same eight kinds of nnis detected in surface water were also found in the water treatment plants fig s2 the average concentrations of nnis in influents of industrial wwtps were 22 and 141 times higher than those in municipal wwtps and dwtps while effluents of industrial wwtps were 5 and 17 times higher than those in municipal wwtps and dwtps respectively table 1 industrial park is one of the primary modes of chinese industry and is an important contributor to china s economic growth gao et al 2022 wwtps in industrial parks provide centralized treatment for wastewater from various industrial plants thus the quality of the influent from industrial wwtps largely depends on the industrial plants in the park in the present study the influents of industrial wwtps i1 i4 showed higher nnis concentrations than other wwtps especially for thm ntp and clo reflecting that there are manufacturers in their located industrial parks and this was also confirmed by the field investigation the main nnis in each industrial wwtp varied in different seasons indicating the periodic production of nnis in these industrial parks although industrial wwtps could remove most nnis after a series of treatment processes nnis in some effluents were still high threatening the receiving water bodies for instance the total nnis in the effluents of i1 and i3 in spring reached 201 99 ng l and 481 29 ng l respectively which were dramatically higher than those in the influents 11 83 164 32 ng l and effluents 3 23 88 67 ng l of municipal wwtps table 1 the nnis in the influents of municipal wwtps may come from the usage of household pest control li et al 2011 and urban greening sadof et al 2021 as shown in table s8 except for imi 95 24 thm 95 24 and dnt 95 24 the most frequently detected nni in the municipal wwtp influents was ace 85 71 whose concentration in surface water was relatively low in addition to their primary use in agriculture thm imi and ace are commonly used in urban greening such as lawns trees and flowers piao et al 2015 among all the detected nnis flo was the most abundant one in the influents of municipal wwtps in winter and fall with a range of 9 65 35 28 ng l flo can effectively prevent attacks by insect pests during the growth of cabbage wang et al 2018 which is commonly planted in fall and winter interestingly imit in the influent of m2 in spring was 126 34 ng l which was relatively higher than other samples imit is used to prevent vegetables fruits and cereal crops from insects tao et al 2021 and the reason why it showed an extensively high concentration in this municipal wwtp may be the result of occasional events e g leakages during transportation or storage noticeably the concentrations of nnis in the effluents of municipal wwtps were lower than those in surface water fig s3 similar results were also found in spain gusmaroli et al 2019 implying that nnis pollution in surface water is rarely generated in urban life while other pathways e g discharge of industrial wwtps and runoff should be responsible for the nnis entering the freshwater ecosystem some studies implied that municipal wwtps were important point sources of nnis for the aquatic environment perkins et al 2021 sadaria et al 2017 teerlink et al 2017 webb et al 2021 which was different from the results derived from this study moreover imi thm dnt and ace were the most popular nnis in municipal wwtps throughout the year and flo mainly dominated in fall and winter for dwtps the total nnis in the influents ranged from 1 61 ng l to 21 07 ng l table 1 similar to those in surface water while the total nnis in the effluents ranged from bdl to 13 98 ng l the most abundant nnis in the dwtps were flo thm dnt and imi matching the above results the removal efficiencies for total nnis in industrial wwtps municipal wwtps and dwtps were 52 21 99 82 35 60 83 63 and 5 30 56 77 respectively fig 4 among the detected nnis dnt showed the lowest average removal efficiency in industrial and municipal wwtps 49 89 followed by ace 57 89 and thm 68 54 sadaria et al 2016 investigated the fate of three nnis imi ace and clo in 13 wwtps in the u s and found that the removal of imi was insignificant and that only limited ace could be eliminated another study found that thm was the most recalcitrant one removal 20 followed by imi 22 dnt 23 and ace 23 iancu and radu 2018 in dwtps the removal efficiencies of most nnis were approximately 30 while the median removal efficiency of clo was the highest 90 lu et al 2020 reported that a dwtp in hangzhou china could remove more than 50 of nnis in untreated surface water but the individual removal efficiency was absent kim et al 2021 investigated 7 nnis in dtwps in south korea and found that over 91 of the nnis could be removed except for dnt 70 and thm 74 which was significantly higher than this study this difference may be result from the initial concentrations of nnis in source water because trace amounts of organics are difficult to remove the total nni concentrations in raw water from south korea were 20 4 166 ng l median 118 ng l kim et al 2021 obviously higher than those in this study 1 61 21 67 ng l median 6 86 ng l activated carbon adsorption is widely adopted in dwtps and was found to effectively remove nnis in previous studies webb et al 2022 webb et al 2020 although all dwtps in this study adopted the activated carbon process limited nnis were removed which may be due to the relatively lower concentrations of nnis in the influents of dwtps for instance klarich et al 2017 suggested that granular activated carbon filtration could significantly remove nnis in drinking water whose initial concentration was generally over ten times that of this study pcoa was conducted to further analyze the difference of the removal efficiencies between seasons and types of water treatment plants as shown in fig s4a there was no difference between winter and spring but they all showed differences between summer and fall usually the removal efficiencies of wwtps in summer are higher than those in winter bryszewski et al 2020 the reasons are likely to be temperature related as warmer temperatures can enhance organic chemical biotransformation trinh et al 2016 meanwhile there were significant differences of the removal efficiencies between the different water treatment plants fig s4b industrial wwtps showed the best removal of nnis followed by municipal wwtps and dwtps this difference may be due to the initial nnis concentrations in the water a higher initial concentration of organic pollutants in wastewater may improve its removal efficiencies of the water treatment process alharbi et al 2019 in addition such discrimination may be result from different treatment units table s3 wwtps have more biological treatment processes than dwtps such as anaerobic anoxic oxic and biological oxidation ditches which contribute greatly to the degradation of most organics wang et al 2012 in comparison with municipal wwtps industrial wwtps applied more pretreatment processes such as hydrolysis acidification theoretically hydrolysis acidification can reduce toxic compounds and change the composition of refractory organic pollutants thus creating suitable conditions for the subsequent anaerobic process chen et al 2020 in addition most of the industrial wwtps applied ozonation as a deep treatment process other than chlorination or uv ozonation is a promising technique to considerably reduce the micropollutant loads of full scale wwtps luo et al 2014 and was proven to be more effective than chlorination and uv photolysis nam et al 2017 besides the chlorination process has the potential to form chlorinated byproducts of nnis which exhibit more significant mammalian toxicity than their parent compounds wong et al 2019 by associating the removal efficiencies and the treatment units we suppose that compared with traditional wastewater treatment processes applying pretreatments such as hydrolysis acidification or advanced treatments such as ozonation helps to eliminate nnis in wastewater 3 3 assessment of ecological risk and human exposure considering that the effluents from wwtps will eventually be discharged into the yangtze river and the effluents from dwtps will be used for residents daily lives we assessed the ecological risk of surface water and effluents of wwtps and calculated the human exposure to nnis through drinking water 3 3 1 ecological risk the rqs of each and total nnis in surface water and effluents from wwtps were calculated for each site as shown in fig 5 a d imi and thm showed medium risks in surface water year round dnt showed medium risks in winter and spring but some sites in summer showed high risks the other five nnis showed low risks during the four sampling campaigns at every site in contrast to the results of this study a recent study found that nnis posed high risks to invertebrates in an effluent dominated stream zhi et al 2022 we suppose that such a difference may be because the fact that the yangtze river is not effluent dominated and its huge water flow rate plays an essential role in diluting the pollutants from wastewater effluents except for in winter the rqs of total nnis in some effluents from wwtps showed high risk and the most dangerous nnis were dnt imi and thm contributing to 26 86 51 48 4 89 43 28 and 5 01 39 17 respectively fig 5e h the threat posed by nnis to the ecosystem has already caused great concern worldwide and an increasing number of countries and regions have introduced regulations to restrict the use of nnis for example the european commission restricted clo imi and thm to treat seeds in 2013 commission 2013 and completely forbade their outdoor use in 2018 commission 2018a e b c to protect aquatic invertebrates canada restricted the use of clo imi and thm in 2018 canada 2018a h b regrettably there are no local regulations about the use of nnis in china which should draw more attention 3 3 2 exposure estimation for humans according to the nnis concentrations in the effluents from the dwtps the nni edis for people of different ages were estimated fig s5 overall the edi of the nnis decreased with increasing age which depended on the daily water intake although for all the dwtps we investigated the nnis concentration in the effluents is far below the recommended single pesticide value 100 ng l by the european union commission 1998 the potential risk posed by nnis and other emerging pollutants in drinking water should not be neglected nnis were proven to induce cytotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity to mammals and humans baysal and atli eklioglu 2021 xu et al 2022 in addition the combined toxic effects of nnis with many other pollutants are unclear cheng et al 2020 yan et al 2021 more importantly after ingestion nnis in human bodies can be transferred to many toxic metabolites which may also threaten human health han et al 2018 for example the concentrations of n desmethyl acetamiprid a metabolite of ace in urine were associated with the increased prevalence of neurologic symptoms including memory loss finger tremors and headache mario et al 2015 chlorination is a common disinfection unit during drinking water treatment however it has been proven that chlorination has the potential to form chlorinated byproducts of nnis which exhibit more significant mammalian toxicity than their parent compounds wong et al 2019 in this case the toxic effect of nnis in drinking water on humans especially on sensitive groups children and pregnant women needs further investigation 4 conclusions 1 the most abundant nnis in surface water from the river basin were thm imi and dnt the highest concentrations of nnis in surface water occurred in summer and no spatial variations were observed in the study area 2 the concentrations of nnis in most industrial wwtps are remarkably higher than those in municipal wwtps and dwtps which may be an important source of nnis in surface water in addition to surface runoff 3 dnt thm and ace are the most recalcitrant nnis in wwtps and higher removal efficiencies were observed in summer which may be ascribed to the higher temperature the dwtps showed limited removal efficiencies for the nnis 4 industrial wwtps showed better performance in eliminating nnis than the municipal wwtps in wastewater 5 nnis contamination presented a medium or high risk

15374,neonicotinoid insecticides nnis are the most popular insecticides worldwide yet their spatiotemporal distribution and fates during the urban water cycle remain limited on a large watershed scale thus we investigated ten kinds of nnis in surface water from the lower reaches of the yangtze river and hubs of the urban water cycle in all seasons in brief eight out of ten nnis were detected and thiamethoxam thm imidacloprid imi and dinotefuran dnt were the most abundant nnis in surface water with concentrations of 0 29 48 15 ng l 1 69 20 57 ng l and 0 98 25 32 ng l respectively the average concentrations of total nnis in summer were 1 96 4 41 folds higher than those in other seasons nnis in the effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps were lower than those in surface water while the average concentrations of total nnis in the effluents of industrial wwtps were 1 56 6 86 folds higher than those in surface water indicating that insecticide production is an important source for nnis in surface water dnt was the most recalcitrant nni in wwtps with an average removal efficiency of 49 89 while in drinking water treatment plants dwtps the removal efficiencies of most nnis were limited except for clothianidin clo 90 risk assessment showed that nnis posed medium or high risks to aquatic life and dnt contributed 26 86 51 48 to the cumulative risks of detected nnis this study investigates the spatiotemporal distribution and risks of nnis and provides information for the supervision of nnis in the yangtze river basin china graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords neonicotinoid insecticides spatiotemporal distribution urban cycle yangtze river ecological risk 1 introduction since the first launch of imidacloprid imi in 1990 neonicotinoid insecticides nnis have gradually replaced traditional insecticides i e organophosphates and carbamates becoming the most popular class in the world for various urban and agricultural applications myers and hill 2014 thompson et al 2020 in 2014 the sales of nnis accounted for over 25 of the total global insecticide sales and contributed approximately 3 7 billion u s dollars to the global market value bass et al 2015 gerwick and sparks 2014 due to their high solubility in the water and persistence or pseudo persistence nnis are likely to migrate from production and application areas to the surface water through overland runoff or discharge of wastewater treatment plants wwtps hladik et al 2014 webb et al 2021 thus nnis have been frequently detected in surface water worldwide for instance berens et al 2021 detected four kinds of nnis in surface water in minnesota u s with concentrations at the ng l level struger et al 2017 also reported that five kinds of nnis were found in surface water of canada with the highest concentration of 1 34 μg l a report showed that 93 of samples in surface water of australia contained two or more nnis in the range of 0 06 4 5 μg l sanchez bayo and hyne 2014 however few studies have simultaneously investigated the occurrence fates and risks of nnis during the urban water cycle on a large watershed scale the yangtze river is the longest river in china and the third longest river globally several studies have reported the contamination status of nnis in surface water of the yangtze river and the results showed that 95 of the nnis released into the east china sea resulted from heavy agricultural use in the yangtze river basin chen et al 2019 pan et al 2020 as an essential region with rapid economic development the lower reaches of the yangtze river is one of the most critical regions for the production of industrial agriculture and residential activities in china and even worldwide yang et al 2009 yu et al 2020 nevertheless limited data is available about nnis in the lower reaches of the yangtze river moreover the yangtze river not only receives runoff from agricultural sources but also the discharge of wwtps including both industrial and municipal wwtps previous studies have investigated the fates of nnis in wwtps and most of them only focused on municipal wwtps but underestimated the impact of industrial wwtps berens et al 2021 iancu and radu 2018 webb et al 2021 zhi et al 2022 in addition the lower reaches of the yangtze river also serves as the primary drinking water supply for more than 50 million people along the river and the potential impacts of nnis on human beings should also be considered nnis are designed to selectively kill target insects because their structure can bind more strongly to insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nachrs than mammalian nachrs tomizawa and casida 2005 nevertheless with the extensive use of nnis increasing evidence suggests that nnis are not as safe as first thought for the environment and non target organisms and contribute to the devastating losses of honeybees seltenrich 2017 except for insects nnis are also toxic to vertebrate wildlife gibbons et al 2015 and aquatic organisms including algae malev et al 2012 invertebrates morrissey et al 2015 and fish ma et al 2019 besides nni exposure was found to cause some sublethal toxicity to mammals such as reproductive toxicity hepatotoxicity genotoxicity carcinogenicity neurotoxicity and endocrine effects thompson et al 2020 in addition some transformation products of nnis were proven to be more harmful to non target organisms than parent compounds for instance the toxicity of imine derivatives of imi and thcp to vertebrate cells was higher than that of imi and thcp themselves tomizawa and casida 2000 overall the occurrence fates and especially risks of nnis during the urban water cycle deserve more attention the present study aimed to investigate the occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of nnis in water samples from the lower reaches of the yangtze river and the influents and effluents of industrial wwtps municipal wwtps and drinking water treatment plants dwtps along the river basin ten nnis including imi dinotefuran dnt acetamiprid ace flonicamid flo clothianidin clo thiacloprid thcp imidaclothiz imit nitenpyram ntp sulfoxaflor sul and thiamethoxam thm were chosen as typical and new nnis mahai et al 2021 the potential risks of nnis in surface water and effluents of the water treatment plants to aquatic ecosystems and humans were also estimated this data provides a better understanding of the occurrence and fates of nnis during the urban water cycle in the lower reaches of the yangtze river highlight the need for integrated water environment management and provide opinions for choosing better wastewater treatment processes to mitigate nnis contaminations 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents standards of imi dnt ace flo clo

except for fall the water sample in november at site s18 was missed due to the influence of the covid 19 epidemic five liters of water sample from each site were collected with a stainless steel bucket approximately 20 m away from the bank and 1 m below the surface for surface water and then transferred into a clean brown glass bottle the bucket and the bottles were rinsed three times with water from the sampling sites before sampling in addition twenty eight water samples in winter and thirty four water samples in spring summer and fall from water treatment plants including influents and effluents were collected because two industrial wwtps and one dwtp were added after the first sampling campaign five liters of water samples from each site were collected with a stainless steel bucket or taken directly from water valves on sampling ports and then transferred into a clean brown glass bottle after collection all the water samples were immediately transported back to the

followed by imi 1 69 20 57 ng l dnt 0 98 25 32 ng l ntp 0 42 8 00 ng l clo 0 32 3 9 ng l imit 0 28 3 62 ng l flo bdl 2 47 ng l and ace bdl 1 63 ng l fig 2 and s1 these results are in accordance with the report of bass et al 2015 assuming that thm and imi were the most popular nnis with market shares of 37 6 and 33 5 among the total market share of nnis in 2012 respectively thm and imi were detected in the lower reaches of the yangtze river in 2016 with median concentrations of 9 1 and 41 44 ng l respectively peng et al 2018 which is comparable to the present study the occurrence of nnis in surface water is highly associated with local use preference a previous study revealed that the most prevalent nnis in the u s were clo imi and thm thompson et al 2021 and thus they were most frequently detected ones in surface water hladik et al 2014 the minimum median mean maximum concentrations and frequencies of detection of individual nni for each season are detailed in table s8 in brief the results showed seasonal differences of nni contamination in surface water from the lower reaches of the yangtze river fig 3 a and the order of the average nnis concentrations in surface water for different seasons was summer 56 67 ng l spring 28 88 ng l fall 18 85 ng l winter 12 85 ng l table s8 these results are consistent with previous studies on the central yangtze river in china mahai et al 2019 the pearl river in china zhang et al 2019 and the ave and sousa rivers in portugal sousa et al 2019 showing the occurrence of the highest nnis in summer spring to summer is the peak period for agricultural pesticide use because seed coating often occurs in spring and seed spraying occurs in summer mahai et al 2019 in addition surface runoff extensively contributes to the mobility of the nnis chretien et al 2017 and the precipitation in summer is heavier than that in other seasons overall agricultural application and rainfall likely account for this study s seasonal variation according to the hydrological characteristics the study area is divided into the upper middle and lower reaches fig 1 the confidence circles for the three sections almost overlap fig 3b indicating no spatial distribution differences in the lower reaches of the yangtze river the climate and main crops rice wheat potatoes corn soybeans in these adjacent cities are similar qiu et al 2009 leading to similar nnis use and pollution mahai et al 2019 studied the occurrence of 6 kinds of nnis in surface water from the central yangtze river in 2015 and found that ace imi and thm were the dominant nnis and dnt was not detected at any sampling site conversely dnt was ubiquitous and had high concentrations in surface water from the lower reaches of the yangtze river in this study this may be because dnt is mainly applied in rice cultivation watanabe et al 2011 and rice is the prime agricultural crop in the study area similarly xiong et al 2021 detected ace clo dnt thm and imi in the poyang lake china and found that dnt was the most dominant nni with a mean concentration up to 200 296 ng l yamamoto et al 2012 also reported that dnt was the most frequently detected and most abundant nni in japan due to the japanese wet paddy rice agriculture 3 2 fate of nnis in water treatment plants the same eight kinds of nnis detected in surface water were also found in the water treatment plants fig s2 the average concentrations of nnis in influents of industrial wwtps were 22 and 141 times higher than those in municipal wwtps and dwtps while effluents of industrial wwtps were 5 and 17 times higher than those in municipal wwtps and dwtps respectively table 1 industrial park is one of the primary modes of chinese industry and is an important contributor to china s economic growth gao et al 2022 wwtps in industrial parks provide centralized treatment for wastewater from various industrial plants thus the quality of the influent from industrial wwtps largely depends on the industrial plants in the park in the present study the influents of industrial wwtps i1 i4 showed higher nnis concentrations than other wwtps especially for thm ntp and clo reflecting that there are manufacturers in their located industrial parks and this was also confirmed by the field investigation the main nnis in each industrial wwtp varied in different seasons indicating the periodic production of nnis in these industrial parks although industrial wwtps could remove most nnis after a series of treatment processes nnis in some effluents were still high threatening the receiving water bodies for instance the total nnis in the effluents of i1 and i3 in spring reached 201 99 ng l and 481 29 ng l respectively which were dramatically higher than those in the influents 11 83 164 32 ng l and effluents 3 23 88 67 ng l of municipal wwtps table 1 the nnis in the influents of municipal wwtps may come from the usage of household pest control li et al 2011 and urban greening sadof et al 2021 as shown in table s8 except for imi 95 24 thm 95 24 and dnt 95 24 the most frequently detected nni in the municipal wwtp influents was ace 85 71 whose concentration in surface water was relatively low in addition to their primary use in agriculture thm imi and ace are commonly used in urban greening such as lawns trees and flowers piao et al 2015 among all the detected nnis flo was the most abundant one in the influents of municipal wwtps in winter and fall with a range of 9 65 35 28 ng l flo can effectively prevent attacks by insect pests during the growth of cabbage wang et al 2018 which is commonly planted in fall and winter interestingly imit in the influent of m2 in spring was 126 34 ng l which was relatively higher than other samples imit is used to prevent vegetables fruits and cereal crops from insects tao et al 2021 and the reason why it showed an extensively high concentration in this municipal wwtp may be the result of occasional events e g leakages during transportation or storage noticeably the concentrations of nnis in the effluents of municipal wwtps were lower than those in surface water fig s3 similar results were also found in spain gusmaroli et al 2019 implying that nnis pollution in surface water is rarely generated in urban life while other pathways e g discharge of industrial wwtps and runoff should be responsible for the nnis entering the freshwater ecosystem some studies implied that municipal wwtps were important point sources of nnis for the aquatic environment perkins et al 2021 sadaria et al 2017 teerlink et al 2017 webb et al 2021 which was different from the results derived from this study moreover imi thm dnt and ace were the most popular nnis in municipal wwtps throughout the year and flo mainly dominated in fall and winter for dwtps the total nnis in the influents ranged from 1 61 ng l to 21 07 ng l table 1 similar to those in surface water while the total nnis in the effluents ranged from bdl to 13 98 ng l the most abundant nnis in the dwtps were flo thm dnt and imi matching the above results the removal efficiencies for total nnis in industrial wwtps municipal wwtps and dwtps were 52 21 99 82 35 60 83 63 and 5 30 56 77 respectively fig 4 among the detected nnis dnt showed the lowest average removal efficiency in industrial and municipal wwtps 49 89 followed by ace 57 89 and thm 68 54 sadaria et al 2016 investigated the fate of three nnis imi ace and clo in 13 wwtps in the u s and found that the removal of imi was insignificant and that only limited ace could be eliminated another study found that thm was the most recalcitrant one removal 20 followed by imi 22 dnt 23 and ace 23 iancu and radu 2018 in dwtps the removal efficiencies of most nnis were approximately 30 while the median removal efficiency of clo was the highest 90 lu et al 2020 reported that a dwtp in hangzhou china could remove more than 50 of nnis in untreated surface water but the individual removal efficiency was absent kim et al 2021 investigated 7 nnis in dtwps in south korea and found that over 91 of the nnis could be removed except for dnt 70 and thm 74 which was significantly higher than this study this difference may be result from the initial concentrations of nnis in source water because trace amounts of organics are difficult to remove the total nni concentrations in raw water from south korea were 20 4 166 ng l median 118 ng l kim et al 2021 obviously higher than those in this study 1 61 21 67 ng l median 6 86 ng l activated carbon adsorption is widely adopted in dwtps and was found to effectively remove nnis in previous studies webb et al 2022 webb et al 2020 although all dwtps in this study adopted the activated carbon process limited nnis were removed which may be due to the relatively lower concentrations of nnis in the influents of dwtps for instance klarich et al 2017 suggested that granular activated carbon filtration could significantly remove nnis in drinking water whose initial concentration was generally over ten times that of this study pcoa was conducted to further analyze the difference of the removal efficiencies between seasons and types of water treatment plants as shown in fig s4a there was no difference between winter and spring but they all showed differences between summer and fall usually the removal efficiencies of wwtps in summer are higher than those in winter bryszewski et al 2020 the reasons are likely to be temperature related as warmer temperatures can enhance organic chemical biotransformation trinh et al 2016 meanwhile there were significant differences of the removal efficiencies between the different water treatment plants fig s4b industrial wwtps showed the best removal of nnis followed by municipal wwtps and dwtps this difference may be due to the initial nnis concentrations in the water a higher initial concentration of organic pollutants in wastewater may improve its removal efficiencies of the water treatment process alharbi et al 2019 in addition such discrimination may be result from different treatment units table s3 wwtps have more biological treatment processes than dwtps such as anaerobic anoxic oxic and biological oxidation ditches which contribute greatly to the degradation of most organics wang et al 2012 in comparison with municipal wwtps industrial wwtps applied more pretreatment processes such as hydrolysis acidification theoretically hydrolysis acidification can reduce toxic compounds and change the composition of refractory organic pollutants thus creating suitable conditions for the subsequent anaerobic process chen et al 2020 in addition most of the industrial wwtps applied ozonation as a deep treatment process other than chlorination or uv ozonation is a promising technique to considerably reduce the micropollutant loads of full scale wwtps luo et al 2014 and was proven to be more effective than chlorination and uv photolysis nam et al 2017 besides the chlorination process has the potential to form chlorinated byproducts of nnis which exhibit more significant mammalian toxicity than their parent compounds wong et al 2019 by associating the removal efficiencies and the treatment units we suppose that compared with traditional wastewater treatment processes applying pretreatments such as hydrolysis acidification or advanced treatments such as ozonation helps to eliminate nnis in wastewater 3 3 assessment of ecological risk and human exposure considering that the effluents from wwtps will eventually be discharged into the yangtze river and the effluents from dwtps will be used for residents daily lives we assessed the ecological risk of surface water and effluents of wwtps and calculated the human exposure to nnis through drinking water 3 3 1 ecological risk the rqs of each and total nnis in surface water and effluents from wwtps were calculated for each site as shown in fig 5 a d imi and thm showed medium risks in surface water year round dnt showed medium risks in winter and spring but some sites in summer showed high risks the other five nnis showed low risks during the four sampling campaigns at every site in contrast to the results of this study a recent study found that nnis posed high risks to invertebrates in an effluent dominated stream zhi et al 2022 we suppose that such a difference may be because the fact that the yangtze river is not effluent dominated and its huge water flow rate plays an essential role in diluting the pollutants from wastewater effluents except for in winter the rqs of total nnis in some effluents from wwtps showed high risk and the most dangerous nnis were dnt imi and thm contributing to 26 86 51 48 4 89 43 28 and 5 01 39 17 respectively fig 5e h the threat posed by nnis to the ecosystem has already caused great concern worldwide and an increasing number of countries and regions have introduced regulations to restrict the use of nnis for example the european commission restricted clo imi and thm to treat seeds in 2013 commission 2013 and completely forbade their outdoor use in 2018 commission 2018a e b c to protect aquatic invertebrates canada restricted the use of clo imi and thm in 2018 canada 2018a h b regrettably there are no local regulations about the use of nnis in china which should draw more attention 3 3 2 exposure estimation for humans according to the nnis concentrations in the effluents from the dwtps the nni edis for people of different ages were estimated fig s5 overall the edi of the nnis decreased with increasing age which depended on the daily water intake although for all the dwtps we investigated the nnis concentration in the effluents is far below the recommended single pesticide value 100 ng l by the european union commission 1998 the potential risk posed by nnis and other emerging pollutants in drinking water should not be neglected nnis were proven to induce cytotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity to mammals and humans baysal and atli eklioglu 2021 xu et al 2022 in addition the combined toxic effects of nnis with many other pollutants are unclear cheng et al 2020 yan et al 2021 more importantly after ingestion nnis in human bodies can be transferred to many toxic metabolites which may also threaten human health han et al 2018 for example the concentrations of n desmethyl acetamiprid a metabolite of ace in urine were associated with the increased prevalence of neurologic symptoms including memory loss finger tremors and headache mario et al 2015 chlorination is a common disinfection unit during drinking water treatment however it has been proven that chlorination has the potential to form chlorinated byproducts of nnis which exhibit more significant mammalian toxicity than their parent compounds wong et al 2019 in this case the toxic effect of nnis in drinking water on humans especially on sensitive groups children and pregnant women needs further investigation 4 conclusions 1 the most abundant nnis in surface water from the river basin were thm imi and dnt the highest concentrations of nnis in surface water occurred in summer and no spatial variations were observed in the study area 2 the concentrations of nnis in most industrial wwtps are remarkably higher than those in municipal wwtps and dwtps which may be an important source of nnis in surface water in addition to surface runoff 3 dnt thm and ace are the most recalcitrant nnis in wwtps and higher removal efficiencies were observed in summer which may be ascribed to the higher temperature the dwtps showed limited removal efficiencies for the nnis 4 industrial wwtps showed better performance in eliminating nnis than the municipal wwtps in wastewater 5 nnis contamination presented a medium or high risk
