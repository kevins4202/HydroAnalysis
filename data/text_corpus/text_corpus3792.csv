water by uv irradiation in the uv system the irradiation of water with uv 185 nm caused water molecules to decompose into hydroxyl radicals hydrogen atoms and solvated electrons eq 1 and eq 2 the quantum yields φ of these reactions are 0 33 and 0 045 respectively zoschke et al 2014 1 h 2 o o h h at 185 nm 2 h 2 o o h h e e q at 185 nm the hydroxyl radical that is formed by the photolysis of water acts as an oxidant to degrade organic compounds into water eq 3 this indicates that contaminants in water can be oxidized to co2 and h2o by uv 185 without any chemical injection residual hydroxyl radicals that were not used to degrade organic carbons reacted with each other to produce h2o2 eq 4 which is why h2o2 is observed in the effluent of uv reactors that are used for toc reduction in upw production systems kutschera et al 2009 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011a in addition hydrogen atoms and solvated electrons eqs 1 and 2 can react with do to form superoxide radicals such as ho2 radical and o2 radical which can react to form to h2o2 eqs 5 7 oppenländer 2003 gonzalez et al 2004 oppenländer 2003 reported that ho2 radical had a significantly higher molar absorption coefficient than h2o2 itself and as a consequence efficiently competes for uv protons and dissociates with the formation of hydroxyl radials and oxygen anion radicals the existence of these superoxide radicals implicates the existence of additional organic carbon degradation in a uv reactor 3 c x h y o z o h h 2 o c o 2 4 o h o h h 2 o 2 5 h o 2 h o 2 6 h o 2 h 2 o h 3 o o 2 7 h o 2 o 2 h 2 o o 2 h 2 o 2 o h in this work the effect of uv and do on the formation of h2o2 at low levels of toc toc 1 μg l was initially evaluated to provide a better understanding of the mechanism by which uv irradiation generates h2o2 fig 2 a shows the results of control tests in which upw alone was exposed to uv 185 the uv dosage and flow rate were set to 289 mw sec cm2 and 3 l minute respectively the concentrations of toc and h2o2 in the uv reactor feed solution were 1 μg l and 0 5 μg l respectively the do concentration varied from 3 to 100 μg l at do concentrations of 3 16 38 60 and 100 μg l the concentration of h2o2 that was produced from uv 185 irradiation was relatively constant approximately 54 μg l do concentrations decreased by varying degrees when water was exposed to uv 185 which depended on the initial oxygen concentration as shown in fig 2a these results support the conclusion that h2o2 was produced mainly from reactions between hydroxyl radicals eq 4 during uv 185 irradiation even though the amount of h2o2 that was produced was not affected by the oxygen concentration the effect of flow rate uv dosage on the formation of h2o2 was investigated the results are shown in fig 2b these tests were also conducted under conditions of no methanol addition the flow rates of the uv reactor were set to 1 2 3 4 and 5 l minute which were equivalent to uv doses of 866 433 289 216 and 173 mw sec cm2 respectively at the same do concentration greater production of h2o2 was observed at higher flow rates of the uv reactor these results differ significantly from the general phenomenon that the efficiency of uv irradiation is proportional to the uv dosage this result can be explained by the concept of the mixing effect in the uv reactor gandhi et al 2011 because water can strongly adsorb uv 185 approximately 90 of uv 185 is adsorbed within 5 mm thickness of water from the sleeve of the lamp han et al 2004 also the oh radical that was produced on the surface of the sleeve was not properly spread to the water in the uv reactor because the life time of the oh radical is too short implying that oh radicals exist only near the surface of the sleeve zoschke et al 2014 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011b hence it can be assumed that the turbulence that is caused by the high flow rate in the uv reactor created efficient mixing conditions in the reactor increasing the likelihood of reactants being replenished on the surface of the sleeve resulting in high levels of h2o2 production thus the uv reactor design and appropriate flow intensity are important factors for achieving efficient toc reduction in the upw production process zoschke et al 2014 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011c dobrović et al 2007 h2o2 production was affected by do concentration when the flow rate was less than 3 l minute whereas h2o2 production was relatively constant at approximately 55 μg l at a high flow rate 3 l minute regardless of do concentration fig 2b in addition a higher h2o2 concentration was observed at a do concentration of 16 μg l compared with the lower do concentration of 3 μg l at a low flow rate this evidence indicates that additional reactions generate h2o2 in addition to oh radicals reacting to form h2o2 these ancillary reactions may be involved in the reaction between oxygen and hydrogen as shown in eqs 5 7 azrague et al 2005 observed that the concentration of h2o2 was twice as high in the presence of oxygen than in its absence however an unexpected decrease in h2o2 concentration between 40 and 100 μg l of do was observed in this study fig 2b for reasons that are unknown 3 2 effect of uv dosage methanol degradation experiments with uv 185 irradiation were conducted in this study the effects of do and uv dosage were evaluated at a methanol concentration of 70 μg l the results are presented in fig 3 a the efficiency of toc removal from the upw improved linearly with increasing do concentrations the efficiency of determination r2 for the linearity of the slopes was 0 99 data not shown the effluent do concentration was 1 μg l in all cases fig 3a which was much lower compared with those in the control test this result was expected because many researchers have observed a faster degradation rate of organic compounds by uv in solution in the presence of oxygen shirayama et al 2001 azrague et al 2005 tasaki et al 2009 in shirayama et al 2001 when a chlorinated hydrocarbon solution was exposed to uv 185 the ratio of degradation rate constants in an oxygenated solution versus those in a deoxygenated solution was 1 3 18 3 the effect of uv intensity on the efficiency of toc reduction in the upw was investigated the toc removal efficiency at 3 μg l of do increased from 15 to 47 when the uv dosage rose from 173 mw sec cm2 to 433 mw sec cm2 as can be seen in fig 3a the slope of toc removal efficiency versus do concentration at 433 mw sec cm2 was 0 294 which is slightly lower than the those 0 376 0 373 and 0 387 at uv intensities 289 mw sec cm2 this result indicates that toc degradation was limited by high uv intensity which was equivalent to a low flow rate especially when the oxygen concentration was high with respect to do this finding is analogous to the those in fig 3b of h2o2 production that resulted from the degradation of methanol by uv irradiation the h2o2 concentration at a uv intensity of 433 mw sec cm2 declined with increasing do concentrations whereas the concentrations of h2o2 that was produced at 289 and 216 mw sec cm2 were relatively constant at 55 μg l regardless of do concentration presumably attributed to the high toc removal efficiency at high uv intensity and high oxygen concentration the oh radical that was produced from uv irradiation of water was consumed in the degradation of methanol to formic acid and co2 indicating that as larger amounts of organic materials were oxidized lower levels of oh radicals remained hence it was expected that the reaction of oh radicals to produce h2o2 eq 4 would be limited resulting in less formation of h2o2 in addition at a flow rate of 2 l minute for a uv dosage of 433 mw sec cm2 it was assumed that complete mixing was not achieved in the uv reactor therefore we presumed that lower production of h2o2 was indirectly affected by the non homogeneous conditions in the uv reactor due to the low flow rate a fast flow rate can establish well mixed conditions and better mass transfer of the reactants in the uv reactor resulting in fast degradation kinetics of organic materials dobrović et al 2007 the amount of h2o2 that was produced in the presence of organic compounds was equal to or lower than that in the absence of organic compounds at the same uv intensity and do concentration an h2o2 concentration of 16 5 μg l was effected by uv irradiation during methanol degradation 433 mw sec cm2 2 l minute and 100 μg l o2 fig 3b whereas it was 40 μg l in the control test fig 2b this result was expected because the produced oh radical was primarily used in methanol degradation instead of h2o2 production especially when the rate of oh radical formation was slower than that of oh radical consumption due to the low flow rate the opposite result was reported by azrague et al 2005 in which the concentration of h2o2 in the oxalic solution was twice as high as the concentration in pure water in the early stages of the reaction azrague et al 2005 however it is difficult to compare these two sets of results directly because the reaction period in our study was 2 orders of magnitude less than results in azrague et al 2005 3 3 effect of methanol concentration experiments for determining the effect of initial methanol concentration on toc removal efficiency were conducted the results are shown in fig 4 the methanol concentrations varied from 17 to 70 μg l at a uv dosage of 289 mw sec cm2 3 l minute the effect of do was also measured at the same time as shown in fig 4a and b the concentration of organic carbon that was transformed to co2 by uv irradiation increased with rising toc concentrations in the influent even though toc removal efficiency fell at higher toc concentrations do concentration influenced the degradation efficiency of toc by uv 185 in fig 4b the amount of toc that was removed was relatively independent of the initial toc concentration at a low do concentration 3 μg l the amount of toc that was removed ranged from 18 to 23 μg l however the standard deviation of toc that was removed among do concentrations became larger with increasing toc concentration and ultimately the amount of toc that was removed at 70 μg l at an initial toc and 100 μg l of do was 3 times higher than that at 3 μg l ofdo additionally the oxygen concentration in the effluent was 0 55 μg l in all cases as shown in fig 4 indicating that the oxygen in solution was involved in the oxidation of methanol by uv irradiation and in the production of h2o2 h2o2 production during methanol degradation by uv 185 at various initial toc and do concentrations was also examined the results are presented in fig 4c when the initial toc was 70 μg l h2o2 production was 50 μg l which was relatively constant at various do concentrations whereas greater h2o2 production was observed at higher do concentrations for other initial toc concentrations to understand the mechanism of h2o2 production during the degradation of organic material by uv 185 the data in fig 4c were re plotted to show the relationship between h2o2 formation and the amount of toc that was removed as seen in fig 4d the production of h2o2 was higher when more toc was removed in contrast to the hypothesis in section 3 1 which opined that the oh radical that was produced by uv irradiation is initially consumed to degrade organic material in a solution after which the remaining radicals react to form h2o2 this difference is caused by superoxide radicals such as ho2 and o2 which reacted between themselves to form h2o2 as shown in eq 7 the phenomenon which is similar to our experimental results was reported by other researchers oppenländer 2003 stefan 2017 mierzwa et al 2018 the presence of organic free radicals intermediates of methanol degradation by uv also influenced the formation of h2o2 organic free radicals can react with do to form superoxide radicals imoberdorf and mohseni 2011a azrague et al 2005 3 4 degradation by product analysis the organic compound that was exposed to uv 185 was oxidized to less oxidized forms and ultimately to co2 methanol the model compound in this study was oxidized in the following order formaldehyde formic acid and co2 as final product gonzalez et al 2004 choi et al 2016 among these by products the organic materials that contained a carboxyl group e g formic acid in methanol degradation are removed by anion exchange resin oh type strong anion exchange resin due to their negative charge in solution or at the surface of the anion exchange resin because the ion exchange resin is positioned behind uv oxidation the concentration of toc after ion exchange is lower than that after uv oxidation one reason why ion exchange resin is placed after the uv oxidation unit in the upw production process the following calculation was used to determine the type of organic matter that remained after uv irradiation 8 methanol and formaldehyde concentration toc after ion exchange resin 9 formic acid concentration toc after uv treatment toc after ion exchange treatment 10 co2 concentration toc in feed toc after uv treatment this method was used in the author s previous study choi et al 2016 the experiments were conducted using a uv dosage of 289 mw sec cm2 and an initial toc concentration of 70 μg l the level of dissolved oxygen varied from 3 to 100 μg l as shown in fig 5 the amount of methanol or formaldehyde and formic acid decreased with increasing do concentration based on the by product measurements we confirmed that the higher do concentration resulted in greater toc removal 4 conclusions the effect of do concentration on the removal of methanol in upw by a uv oxidation process under various operational conditions was investigated a continuously operated experimental setup was designed and used in this study consisting of a uv reactor an ion exchange column and an online toc analyzer to obtain valuable engineering data and conduct several experiments under conditions that approximated those in actual upw production processes methanol was selected as a source of toc because it is one of the most frequently detected low molecular weight organic compounds in the influent of a uv oxidation unit in a upw production process a control test was initially conducted in the absence of methanol to verify the mechanism of h2o2 production on exposure of water to uv 185 and understand the function of do in the production of h2o2 the results showed that the production of h2o2 was affected by flow rate of upw rather than do concentration we presumed that the high flow rate induced complete mixing in the uv reactor which promoted the formation of oh radicals in water and the subsequent production of h2o2 on the surface of the uv 185 lamp in addition oxygen reduction by uv irradiation did not contribute directly to h2o2 production in the methanol degradation tests the efficiency of toc removal was proportional to the do concentration and uv intensity wherein more toc was oxidized at higher do concentrations and uv intensities the difference in toc removal efficiency based on uv intensity declined with increasing do concentration h2o2 production was not significantly affected by methanol degradation especially when efficient mixing conditions were maintained the effect of do on the degradation of methanol by uv 185 was more clearly observed at the various methanol concentrations in which more toc was degraded at higher initial methanol concentrations and higher do concentration in addition more h2o2 was produced when methanol degradation levels were higher versus lower thus organic free radicals which are intermediates of methanol degradation might have function in h2o2 production

510 hach usa the do sensor was placed in the influent or effluent of the uv reactor and do was measured in real time the do sensor was calibrated using the in air calibration mode in which the sensor was placed in water saturated air the concentration of h2o2 was measured by the hyperizer samsung engineering an h2o2 analyzer that is used to measure sub ppb levels of h2o2 in upw the hypereizer uses a chemiluminescence method to measure h2o2 in which h2o2 reacts with luminol in the presence of a catalyst horseradish peroxidase to emit light díaz et al 1998 the detection limit of h2o2 by the hyperizer was 0 5 ppb in this study methanol concentration was measured with a purge and trap gas chromatograph gc 7890n agilent technology usa that was equipped with db 624 columns 0 32 mm inner diameter 1 8 μm thickness 30 m length the helium pressure was 120 kpa the temperature of the flame ionization detection fid system was initially maintained at 45 c for 9 min followed by a ramp up of 10 c min to 90 c and a subsequent ramp up of 20 c min to 260 c dwell time of 10 min formic acid concentration was measured by an ion chromatograph dionex 3000 camberley u k that was equipped with an ionpac ice as1 analytical column and an ionpac ice as1 guard column the eluent was 0 5 mm heptafluorobutyric acid introduced at a flow rate of 0 16 ml min 3 results and discussion 3 1 photolysis of water by uv irradiation in the uv system the irradiation of water with uv 185 nm caused water molecules to decompose into hydroxyl radicals hydrogen atoms and solvated electrons eq 1 and eq 2 the quantum yields φ of these reactions are 0 33 and 0 045 respectively zoschke et al 2014 1 h 2 o o h h at 185 nm 2 h 2 o o h h e e q at 185 nm the hydroxyl radical that is formed by the photolysis of water acts as an oxidant to degrade organic compounds into water eq 3 this indicates that contaminants in water can be oxidized to co2 and h2o by uv 185 without any chemical injection residual hydroxyl radicals that were not used to degrade organic carbons reacted with each other to produce h2o2 eq 4 which is why h2o2 is observed in the effluent of uv reactors that are used for toc reduction in upw production systems kutschera et al 2009 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011a in addition hydrogen atoms and solvated electrons eqs 1 and 2 can react with do to form superoxide radicals such as ho2 radical and o2 radical which can react to form to h2o2 eqs 5 7 oppenländer 2003 gonzalez et al 2004 oppenländer 2003 reported that ho2 radical had a significantly higher molar absorption coefficient than h2o2 itself and as a consequence efficiently competes for uv protons and dissociates with the formation of hydroxyl radials and oxygen anion radicals the existence of these superoxide radicals implicates the existence of additional organic carbon degradation in a uv reactor 3 c x h y o z o h h 2 o c o 2 4 o h o h h 2 o 2 5 h o 2 h o 2 6 h o 2 h 2 o h 3 o o 2 7 h o 2 o 2 h 2 o o 2 h 2 o 2 o h in this work the effect of uv and do on the formation of h2o2 at low levels of toc toc 1 μg l was initially evaluated to provide a better understanding of the mechanism by which uv irradiation generates h2o2 fig 2 a shows the results of control tests in which upw alone was exposed to uv 185 the uv dosage and flow rate were set to 289 mw sec cm2 and 3 l minute respectively the concentrations of toc and h2o2 in the uv reactor feed solution were 1 μg l and 0 5 μg l respectively the do concentration varied from 3 to 100 μg l at do concentrations of 3 16 38 60 and 100 μg l the concentration of h2o2 that was produced from uv 185 irradiation was relatively constant approximately 54 μg l do concentrations decreased by varying degrees when water was exposed to uv 185 which depended on the initial oxygen concentration as shown in fig 2a these results support the conclusion that h2o2 was produced mainly from reactions between hydroxyl radicals eq 4 during uv 185 irradiation even though the amount of h2o2 that was produced was not affected by the oxygen concentration the effect of flow rate uv dosage on the formation of h2o2 was investigated the results are shown in fig 2b these tests were also conducted under conditions of no methanol addition the flow rates of the uv reactor were set to 1 2 3 4 and 5 l minute which were equivalent to uv doses of 866 433 289 216 and 173 mw sec cm2 respectively at the same do concentration greater production of h2o2 was observed at higher flow rates of the uv reactor these results differ significantly from the general phenomenon that the efficiency of uv irradiation is proportional to the uv dosage this result can be explained by the concept of the mixing effect in the uv reactor gandhi et al 2011 because water can strongly adsorb uv 185 approximately 90 of uv 185 is adsorbed within 5 mm thickness of water from the sleeve of the lamp han et al 2004 also the oh radical that was produced on the surface of the sleeve was not properly spread to the water in the uv reactor because the life time of the oh radical is too short implying that oh radicals exist only near the surface of the sleeve zoschke et al 2014 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011b hence it can be assumed that the turbulence that is caused by the high flow rate in the uv reactor created efficient mixing conditions in the reactor increasing the likelihood of reactants being replenished on the surface of the sleeve resulting in high levels of h2o2 production thus the uv reactor design and appropriate flow intensity are important factors for achieving efficient toc reduction in the upw production process zoschke et al 2014 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011c dobrović et al 2007 h2o2 production was affected by do concentration when the flow rate was less than 3 l minute whereas h2o2 production was relatively constant at approximately 55 μg l at a high flow rate 3 l minute regardless of do concentration fig 2b in addition a higher h2o2 concentration was observed at a do concentration of 16 μg l compared with the lower do concentration of 3 μg l at a low flow rate this evidence indicates that additional reactions generate h2o2 in addition to oh radicals reacting to form h2o2 these ancillary reactions may be involved in the reaction between oxygen and hydrogen as shown in eqs 5 7 azrague et al 2005 observed that the concentration of h2o2 was twice as high in the presence of oxygen than in its absence however an unexpected decrease in h2o2 concentration between 40 and 100 μg l of do was observed in this study fig 2b for reasons that are unknown 3 2 effect of uv dosage methanol degradation experiments with uv 185 irradiation were conducted in this study the effects of do and uv dosage were evaluated at a methanol concentration of 70 μg l the results are presented in fig 3 a the efficiency of toc removal from the upw improved linearly with increasing do concentrations the efficiency of determination r2 for the linearity of the slopes was 0 99 data not shown the effluent do concentration was 1 μg l in all cases fig 3a which was much lower compared with those in the control test this result was expected because many researchers have observed a faster degradation rate of organic compounds by uv in solution in the presence of oxygen shirayama et al 2001 azrague et al 2005 tasaki et al 2009 in shirayama et al 2001 when a chlorinated hydrocarbon solution was exposed to uv 185 the ratio of degradation rate constants in an oxygenated solution versus those in a deoxygenated solution was 1 3 18 3 the effect of uv intensity on the efficiency of toc reduction in the upw was investigated the toc removal efficiency at 3 μg l of do increased from 15 to 47 when the uv dosage rose from 173 mw sec cm2 to 433 mw sec cm2 as can be seen in fig 3a the slope of toc removal efficiency versus do concentration at 433 mw sec cm2 was 0 294 which is slightly lower than the those 0 376 0 373 and 0 387 at uv intensities 289 mw sec cm2 this result indicates that toc degradation was limited by high uv intensity which was equivalent to a low flow rate especially when the oxygen concentration was high with respect to do this finding is analogous to the those in fig 3b of h2o2 production that resulted from the degradation of methanol by uv irradiation the h2o2 concentration at a uv intensity of 433 mw sec cm2 declined with increasing do concentrations whereas the concentrations of h2o2 that was produced at 289 and 216 mw sec cm2 were relatively constant at 55 μg l regardless of do concentration presumably attributed to the high toc removal efficiency at high uv intensity and high oxygen concentration the oh radical that was produced from uv irradiation of water was consumed in the degradation of methanol to formic acid and co2 indicating that as larger amounts of organic materials were oxidized lower levels of oh radicals remained hence it was expected that the reaction of oh radicals to produce h2o2 eq 4 would be limited resulting in less formation of h2o2 in addition at a flow rate of 2 l minute for a uv dosage of 433 mw sec cm2 it was assumed that complete mixing was not achieved in the uv reactor therefore we presumed that lower production of h2o2 was indirectly affected by the non homogeneous conditions in the uv reactor due to the low flow rate a fast flow rate can establish well mixed conditions and better mass transfer of the reactants in the uv reactor resulting in fast degradation kinetics of organic materials dobrović et al 2007 the amount of h2o2 that was produced in the presence of organic compounds was equal to or lower than that in the absence of organic compounds at the same uv intensity and do concentration an h2o2 concentration of 16 5 μg l was effected by uv irradiation during methanol degradation 433 mw sec cm2 2 l minute and 100 μg l o2 fig 3b whereas it was 40 μg l in the control test fig 2b this result was expected because the produced oh radical was primarily used in methanol degradation instead of h2o2 production especially when the rate of oh radical formation was slower than that of oh radical consumption due to the low flow rate the opposite result was reported by azrague et al 2005 in which the concentration of h2o2 in the oxalic solution was twice as high as the concentration in pure water in the early stages of the reaction azrague et al 2005 however it is difficult to compare these two sets of results directly because the reaction period in our study was 2 orders of magnitude less than results in azrague et al 2005 3 3 effect of methanol concentration experiments for determining the effect of initial methanol concentration on toc removal efficiency were conducted the results are shown in fig 4 the methanol concentrations varied from 17 to 70 μg l at a uv dosage of 289 mw sec cm2 3 l minute the effect of do was also measured at the same time as shown in fig 4a and b the concentration of organic carbon that was transformed to co2 by uv irradiation increased with rising toc concentrations in the influent even though toc removal efficiency fell at higher toc concentrations do concentration influenced the degradation efficiency of toc by uv 185 in fig 4b the amount of toc that was removed was relatively independent of the initial toc concentration at a low do concentration 3 μg l the amount of toc that was removed ranged from 18 to 23 μg l however the standard deviation of toc that was removed among do concentrations became larger with increasing toc concentration and ultimately the amount of toc that was removed at 70 μg l at an initial toc and 100 μg l of do was 3 times higher than that at 3 μg l ofdo additionally the oxygen concentration in the effluent was 0 55 μg l in all cases as shown in fig 4 indicating that the oxygen in solution was involved in the oxidation of methanol by uv irradiation and in the production of h2o2 h2o2 production during methanol degradation by uv 185 at various initial toc and do concentrations was also examined the results are presented in fig 4c when the initial toc was 70 μg l h2o2 production was 50 μg l which was relatively constant at various do concentrations whereas greater h2o2 production was observed at higher do concentrations for other initial toc concentrations to understand the mechanism of h2o2 production during the degradation of organic material by uv 185 the data in fig 4c were re plotted to show the relationship between h2o2 formation and the amount of toc that was removed as seen in fig 4d the production of h2o2 was higher when more toc was removed in contrast to the hypothesis in section 3 1 which opined that the oh radical that was produced by uv irradiation is initially consumed to degrade organic material in a solution after which the remaining radicals react to form h2o2 this difference is caused by superoxide radicals such as ho2 and o2 which reacted between themselves to form h2o2 as shown in eq 7 the phenomenon which is similar to our experimental results was reported by other researchers oppenländer 2003 stefan 2017 mierzwa et al 2018 the presence of organic free radicals intermediates of methanol degradation by uv also influenced the formation of h2o2 organic free radicals can react with do to form superoxide radicals imoberdorf and mohseni 2011a azrague et al 2005 3 4 degradation by product analysis the organic compound that was exposed to uv 185 was oxidized to less oxidized forms and ultimately to co2 methanol the model compound in this study was oxidized in the following order formaldehyde formic acid and co2 as final product gonzalez et al 2004 choi et al 2016 among these by products the organic materials that contained a carboxyl group e g formic acid in methanol degradation are removed by anion exchange resin oh type strong anion exchange resin due to their negative charge in solution or at the surface of the anion exchange resin because the ion exchange resin is positioned behind uv oxidation the concentration of toc after ion exchange is lower than that after uv oxidation one reason why ion exchange resin is placed after the uv oxidation unit in the upw production process the following calculation was used to determine the type of organic matter that remained after uv irradiation 8 methanol and formaldehyde concentration toc after ion exchange resin 9 formic acid concentration toc after uv treatment toc after ion exchange treatment 10 co2 concentration toc in feed toc after uv treatment this method was used in the author s previous study choi et al 2016 the experiments were conducted using a uv dosage of 289 mw sec cm2 and an initial toc concentration of 70 μg l the level of dissolved oxygen varied from 3 to 100 μg l as shown in fig 5 the amount of methanol or formaldehyde and formic acid decreased with increasing do concentration based on the by product measurements we confirmed that the higher do concentration resulted in greater toc removal 4 conclusions the effect of do concentration on the removal of methanol in upw by a uv oxidation process under various operational conditions was investigated a continuously operated experimental setup was designed and used in this study consisting of a uv reactor an ion exchange column and an online toc analyzer to obtain valuable engineering data and conduct several experiments under conditions that approximated those in actual upw production processes methanol was selected as a source of toc because it is one of the most frequently detected low molecular weight organic compounds in the influent of a uv oxidation unit in a upw production process a control test was initially conducted in the absence of methanol to verify the mechanism of h2o2 production on exposure of water to uv 185 and understand the function of do in the production of h2o2 the results showed that the production of h2o2 was affected by flow rate of upw rather than do concentration we presumed that the high flow rate induced complete mixing in the uv reactor which promoted the formation of oh radicals in water and the subsequent production of h2o2 on the surface of the uv 185 lamp in addition oxygen reduction by uv irradiation did not contribute directly to h2o2 production in the methanol degradation tests the efficiency of toc removal was proportional to the do concentration and uv intensity wherein more toc was oxidized at higher do concentrations and uv intensities the difference in toc removal efficiency based on uv intensity declined with increasing do concentration h2o2 production was not significantly affected by methanol degradation especially when efficient mixing conditions were maintained the effect of do on the degradation of methanol by uv 185 was more clearly observed at the various methanol concentrations in which more toc was degraded at higher initial methanol concentrations and higher do concentration in addition more h2o2 was produced when methanol degradation levels were higher versus lower thus organic free radicals which are intermediates of methanol degradation might have function in h2o2 production 
18961,a new in situ pre enrichment system was developed for trace analysis of radioactive cs in environmental water such as rivers ponds and seas where the radioactive cs is separated into suspended substances ss and dissolved substances ds the ss component was collected as the enrichment slurry by cross flow filtration thereby compact systems were realized the ds component was collected in a small cartridge filled with a non woven fiber with immobilized adsorbent nanoparticles the recovery rate was estimated at around 95 the size distribution of the ss and the concentration of radioactive cs after enrichment were the same as that of the raw water before enrichment the condensed ss can be used for other evaluations such as ignition loss from the field test at a pond in the fukushima area the cs concentration of the ss was found to be 4 5 times higher than that of the sediment in the same pond the organic content estimated by ignition loss was also three times higher graphical abstract image 1 keywords radioactive cesium adsorption trace analysis prussian blue cross filter 1 introduction various substances are contained in environmental water depending on their concentration these substances may have a significant influence on the ecosystem substances in environmental water occur in the suspended state suspended substances ss and dissolved state dissolved substances ds both are important in water quality management but the impact on the ecosystem is different for example ss decrease the light transmittance and the volume of the sediment in rivers and lakes bilotta and brazier 2008 notably when the ss have a high concentration of organic matter om this om can decompose in water and consume the dissolved oxygen in the water resulting in a large effect on ecosystems and their inhabitants such as fish ryan 1991 on the other hand ds have other characteristics such as high uptake by plants based on these factors it is necessary to evaluate and analyze ds and ss separately in order to comprehend the dynamics of each substance in environmental water this study focuses on the trace analysis of radioactive cs both cs 134 and cs 137 in environmental water radioactive cs introduced into the environment mainly through atmospheric testing of nuclear bombs or by accidents at nuclear power plants that lead to radioisotope release in recent years because no atmospheric nuclear bomb tests have been conducted leakage accidents at nuclear power plants have become the major concern cs 137 is the most harmful in leakage accidents at nuclear power plants environment 2006 kinoshita et al 2011 radioactive cs in environmental water also comprises ds and ss as described above cesium is extremely soluble and occurs in the dissolved state in pure water but also exists in the ss form where cs can be adsorbed to suspended solids such as clay in environmental water generally because the amount of ss is larger than that of ds analysis of the ss is important for analysis of the dynamics of substances in the environment on the other hand it has been reported that the uptake of ds by plants is four times or more than that of ss ministry of agriculture 2014 and the influence of ds on plants may be higher for these reasons it is necessary to analyze ss and ds separately the concentration of radioactive cs in the environment is low and in such a case enrichment is necessary as a pretreatment prior to evaluation of the radioactivity we derive various advantages of the enrichment we can decrease the detection limit the time for the measurement by germanium ge semiconductor detector can be decreased in addition we need to take only small samples after the enrichment to a laboratory instead of the huge volume of water samples resulting in drastic decrease of the transfer cost for example the results of a 2013 survey performed two years after the 2011 nuclear power plant accident in fukushima japan showed that the cs 137 concentrations in the ss and ds of many rivers were about 50 mbq l 1 and 30 mbq l 1 respectively tsuji et al 2014b to separate and analyze ss and ds in such low concentrations in environmental water a pretreatment technique for separating and enriching each component is necessary it is desirable to achieve a concentration ratio of 1000 10 000 fold that is to enrich a 0 1 1 m3 environmental water sample to 100 ml in the case of ds a method for the facile analysis of cesium via adsorption by passing 0 1 1 m3 of environmental water through 100 ml of adsorbent has recently been reported yasutaka et al 2016 2013 on the other hand filtration of a suspension using a filter paper or membrane for enrichment of ss is a generally employed technique and technology for achieving this goal has also been proposed tsuji et al 2014a however when the ss concentration is high such as in the situation immediately after rainfall this technique is difficult to implement for reasons such as blockage of the filters although there are reports on multi stage end flow filters and devices that employ centrifugal separation as solutions to these problems sakaguchi et al 2015 there is an issue whereby measurement becomes difficult in the field etc because the size of the apparatus becomes large therefore in this study we develop a separating and concentrating apparatus using a cross flow filter for separating ss and ds for the purpose of developing a more compact and long life device by using this device radioactive cs in ds and ss can be recovered from a large amount of environmental water including fresh water such as river and pond water the device can be expected to be used as a pretreatment device for evaluating the concentration of radioactive cs a cross flow filter is used to separate the suspension from the environmental water the cross flow filter allows the suspension in the water to flow horizontally with respect to the filtration surface with minimal accumulation of solids in the filter thus it is possible to avoid blockage by using this backwashing approach this is also the effective method of the evaluation of the radioactivity of muddy water based on the separation of ss and ds although there are previous studies using the cross flow filter to condense radioactive materials in the treatment of radioactive waste mann and todd 2000 sylvester et al 2013 zakrzewska trznadel 2013 zakrzewska trznadel and harasimowicz 2004 and for condensing inorganic and organic colloids or soluble species in seawater for use in environmental water research cho et al

important difference between our method and the previous studies is that the ss and ds can be collected separately and in situ furthermore the apparatus is that very highly concentrated ss can be easily obtained as a result various evaluations such as compositional analysis and structural analysis as well as radioactivity analysis become possible in this study the ignition loss is measured as an example of a further application and its significance is demonstrated 2 material and methods 2 1 apparatus a schematic diagram and photograph of the developed cs concentrating apparatus model dbw

ss concentrate does not go out from the apparatus with the buffer vessel for independent in situ operation it also runs with batteries it is also possible to install a ds concentrating column cs 13zn japan vilene co ltd for measuring radioactive cs in the ds form after solid liquid separation yasutaka et al 2016 2015 2013 in this study the developed column was installed for ds enrichment kitajima et al 2014 in this column nonwoven with prussian blue nanoparticles was introduced in the u8 container the details of the column was described in the previous report kitajima et al 2014 by using the column it is possible to collect almost of radioactive cs from 100 300 l of environmental water with the concentration of 0 02 bq l 1 2 2 laboratory test before the field test the performance of the system was evaluated in our laboratory using simulated environmental water sew the procedure for sew preparation is shown in fig 2 general commercial soil and arakida soil horticultural soil from tochigi pref japan were used as suspended substances in the sew arakida soil is a generally commercial clay soil in japan consists of 1 sand 63 silt 36 clay and has a true specific gravity of 2 69 g cm 3 kurimura 1972 distilled water and arakida soil were introduced into the water tank and stirred thoroughly after 1 h only the upper water layer up to 60 mm below the water surface was sampled having an ss concentration of about 1000 2000 mg l 1 and settling velocity of 1 mm min 1 or less a lower concentration suspension was prepared from the upper water layer by diluting with distilled water to 500 mg l 1 half of the suspension was directly dead end filtered through 17 25 sheets of glass fiber filter pore size 1 μm and the weight of the solid collected on the filter was measured for the measurement of the weight the weight of all the glass fiber filters was measured before and after the filtering and drying the weight of the collected solid was evaluated as the difference between before and after the treatment the other half was mixed with distilled water for preparation of the sew with an ss concentration of 50 mg l 1 or 100 mg l 1 the concentration was evaluated by using a turbidimeter the ratio of ss recovery by dbw 24 was confirmed in the laboratory analysis of the sew sample the sew was condensed as follows 50 l of sew was condensed using dbw 24 and the concentrate about 0 4 l was collected the concentrate remaining in the dead volume inside dbw 24 was washed out with 0 5 l of distilled water and recovered as post washing solution the 0 4 l concentrate and 0 5 l post washing solution were combined and denoted as the recovery solution 0 9 l the recovery solution was filtered with 11 20 sheets of glass fiber filter pore size 1 μm for evaluation of the mass of suspended substances ss mass as with the above weights of all the glass fiber filters before and after filtering and drying was measured and the increased weight was taken as ss mass the interior of the dbw 24 apparatus including the cross flow filter was washed with 1 8 l of distilled water and the mass of the solid was also evaluated by using the same method applied to the recovery solution the rate of ss recovery was evaluated by comparing the mass of the solid in the suspension before preparation of the sew with the weight of the solid recovered by dbw 24 the particle size distribution of each sample was measured using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer sald 2300 shimadzu co 2 3 field test enrichment of pond water as environmental water samples containing radioactive cs was carried out at ponds a and b in fukushima prefecture water of both ponds would be contaminated by radioactive cs caused by inflow pond a has an area of about 186 m2 and water inflow from upstream pond b has area of about 125 m2 and water inflows from the surroundings when rain etc in order to confirm the ss recovery ratio about 20 l of pond water was directly collected from pond a and the same volume of pond water was condensed using dbw 24 after enrichment we obtained 1 45 l of the recovery solution comprising 0 45 l of the concentrate and 1 0 l of the post washing solution in order to evaluate the ss mass dead end filtration was performed using a 0 45 μm membrane filter the raw water 20 l and the recovery solution 1 45 l were respectively filtered the difference in mass of all filters before and after filtration and drying was defined as ss mass after measurement of the weight of ss radioactive cs on membrane filter with ss attached was measured with a ge semiconductor detector at 2000 3000 s the concentration ratio of cs 134 cs 137 in all samples was about 1 2 for the field test at pond b water sampling and enrichment were performed using dbw 24 over the course of one day to investigate the reproducibility of recovery of the ss concentrated water at a flow rate of 0 12 l min 1 the pond water was sampled 5 10 cm below the surface of the pond generating 1 45 l of the recovery solution comprising 0 45 l of the concentrate and 1 0 l of the post washing solution from 168 l of pond water in the laboratory the recovery solution was dead end filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane filter to evaluate the ss mass and the concentration of radioactive cs in ss we concluded that the difference of the pore size of the filter between 0 45 μm and 1 μm is not serious because we could take most of the ss in the water even in using 1 μm filter as described later in order to confirm the difference between the sediment and suspended solid the sediments a depth of 0 15 cm in the same place were also sampled for evaluation of the ignition loss both the suspension and sediment were heated at 600 c for 2 h 3 results 3 1 laboratory test 3 1 1 rate of recovery from simulated suspension water simulated environmental water sew containing commercial soil at concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l 1 was prepared as described above the sew was condensed by dbw 24 followed by measurement of the ss mass in the recovery solution comprising the concentrate and the post washing solution as shown in fig 3 the rate of ss mass recovery was around 95 in all cases in order to estimate the ss mass remaining in dbw 24 after acquiring the recovery solution the relevant region of the apparatus was washed again the second post washing solution was obtained using 1 8 l of water the ss mass in the second post washing solution was only about 1 of ss in the sew indicating that more than 95 of suspended solids in the sew could be condensed and recovered it was confirmed that low concentrations of ss can be enriched to high concentrations at a recovery rate of about 95 although it is necessary to evaluate uncertainty for further detailed discussion the rate of recovery of the ss mass in the concentrate 0 4 l and that in the post washing solution 0 5 l was evaluated to be 86 1 and 12 3 respectively the particle size distributions of the raw water the concentrate and the recovery solution are shown in fig 4 indicating almost no difference in the particle size distribution as far as the particle size distribution is concerned suspended solids having the same properties as the raw water could be recovered both from the concentrate and the recovery solution 3 1 2 field tests field tests were performed with real environmental water at ponds a and b in fukushima prefecture as shown in fig 5 the ss mass in the raw water was largely recovered by the enrichment process using dbw 24 further the concentration of radioactive cs in the recovered ss was almost the same as that in the raw water the distribution of the ss mass and radioactive cs in the concentrate post washing solution and second post washing solution were also investigated as shown in fig 6 the mass distribution and that of the radioactive cs were the almost same in addition very little ss and radioactive cs remained in the second washing solution indicating that evaluation of only the concentrated and the first washing solution is sufficient to determine the ss mass and radioactive cs it was confirmed that the recovery rate achieved with dbw 24 was almost the same as that of existing collection methods and that there was little difference in the radioactive cs recovery from solution by dbw 24 thus pond water was condensed and collected from pond b for about 1 day at a flow rate of 0 12 l min 1 in order to evaluate the radioactive cs in the ds a ds concentrating column was also installed by installing a cross flow filter and backwash in dbw 24 the decline in the filtration flow rate was reduced i e 0 1 l min 1 16 drop after operating for about 1 day eventually 168 l of the pond water was condensed to 1 45 l of recovery solution as shown in table 1 the concentration of radioactive cs for each form in each pond could be evaluated less than 1 bq l 1 in particular for pond b although the flow volume reached 168 l and the collected ss was about 3 g the concentrations of radioactive cs in each form were successfully determined indicating that the developed method is robust for increasing the ss mass such robustness enables the collection of a large amount of ss and evaluation of the various properties of the ss for example we evaluated the ignition loss of the ss for the pond b sample as well as the concentration of radioactive cs as shown in fig 7 the values of these parameters differed significantly from those of the sediment of the same pond even though the concentration of radioactive cs in the sediment was less than 8000 bq kg 1 the concentration in the suspended solid was very high about 35 000 bq kg 1 the difference of the cs concentration would originate from the smaller particle size of ss than that of the sediment in the radioactive cs from the power plant accident the cs concentration tends to larger in the case of the large surface area of ss the ignition loss was about three times larger for the collected ss than the sediment this indicates that the organic component was three times larger in the ss in the pond water than in the sediment finally the ss concentration in the concentrate from the successful enrichment trial using dbw 24 is shown in fig 8 indicating that the maximum concentration in the concentrate after enrichment was 11 200 mg l 1 from these results enrichment up to 10 000 mg l 1 should be possible for various water based suspensions 4 conclusion in this study an apparatus for the pre enrichment of suspended environmental water was developed the recovery rate of ss mass estimated from the laboratory test was about 95 the size distribution of ss in the raw water and in the concentrate was almost the same in the field test at ponds in the fukushima area almost complete recovery of both the ss mass and the radioactive cs in the suspended solids was achieved it was also found that the ss in the recovered water has quite different properties from the sediment i e the concentration of radioactive cs was 4 5 times higher and the organic component was three times larger in the latter the concentration of radioactive cs could be simultaneously evaluated by installing the ds concentrating column these results indicate that our method makes it possible to evaluate the trace concentration of radioactive cs with dividing into ss and ds form although further evaluation is necessary to examine whether our method is applicable for any environmental water or not for example if the environmental water has a certain amount of the ss 0 45 μm we would need to use another cross flow filter with the smaller pore size finally concerning the ss concentration of other radioactive isotope this method would be applicable because the enrichment method is independent from the isotope properties acknowledgement the part of this research was supported by strategic funds for the promotion of science and technology japan 
18961,a new in situ pre enrichment system was developed for trace analysis of radioactive cs in environmental water such as rivers ponds and seas where the radioactive cs is separated into suspended substances ss and dissolved substances ds the ss component was collected as the enrichment slurry by cross flow filtration thereby compact systems were realized the ds component was collected in a small cartridge filled with a non woven fiber with immobilized adsorbent nanoparticles the recovery rate was estimated at around 95 the size distribution of the ss and the concentration of radioactive cs after enrichment were the same as that of the raw water before enrichment the condensed ss can be used for other evaluations such as ignition loss from the field test at a pond in the fukushima area the cs concentration of the ss was found to be 4 5 times higher than that of the sediment in the same pond the organic content estimated by ignition loss was also three times higher graphical abstract image 1 keywords radioactive cesium adsorption trace analysis prussian blue cross filter 1 introduction various substances are contained in environmental water depending on their concentration these substances may have a significant influence on the ecosystem substances in environmental water occur in the suspended state suspended substances ss and dissolved state dissolved substances ds both are important in water quality management but the impact on the ecosystem is different for example ss decrease the light transmittance and the volume of the sediment in rivers and lakes bilotta and brazier 2008 notably when the ss have a high concentration of organic matter om this om can decompose in water and consume the dissolved oxygen in the water resulting in a large effect on ecosystems and their inhabitants such as fish ryan 1991 on the other hand ds have other characteristics such as high uptake by plants based on these factors it is necessary to evaluate and analyze ds and ss separately in order to comprehend the dynamics of each substance in environmental water this study focuses on the trace analysis of radioactive cs both cs 134 and cs 137 in environmental water radioactive cs introduced into the environment mainly through atmospheric testing of nuclear bombs or by accidents at nuclear power plants that lead to radioisotope release in recent years because no atmospheric nuclear bomb tests have been conducted leakage accidents at nuclear power plants have become the major concern cs 137 is the most harmful in leakage accidents at nuclear power plants environment 2006 kinoshita et al 2011 radioactive cs in environmental water also comprises ds and ss as described above cesium is extremely soluble and occurs in the dissolved state in pure water but also exists in the ss form where cs can be adsorbed to suspended solids such as clay in environmental water generally because the amount of ss is larger than that of ds analysis of the ss is important for analysis of the dynamics of substances in the environment on the other hand it has been reported that the uptake of ds by plants is four times or more than that of ss ministry of agriculture 2014 and the influence of ds on plants may be higher for these reasons it is necessary to analyze ss and ds separately the concentration of radioactive cs in the environment is low and in such a case enrichment is necessary as a pretreatment prior to evaluation of the radioactivity we derive various advantages of the enrichment we can decrease the detection limit the time for the measurement by germanium ge semiconductor detector can be decreased in addition we need to take only small samples after the enrichment to a laboratory instead of the huge volume of water samples resulting in drastic decrease of the transfer cost for example the results of a 2013 survey performed two years after the 2011 nuclear power plant accident in fukushima japan showed that the cs 137 concentrations in the ss and ds of many rivers were about 50 mbq l 1 and 30 mbq l 1 respectively tsuji et al 2014b to separate and analyze ss and ds in such low concentrations in environmental water a pretreatment technique for separating and enriching each component is necessary it is desirable to achieve a concentration ratio of 1000 10 000 fold that is to enrich a 0 1 1 m3 environmental water sample to 100 ml in the case of ds a method for the facile analysis of cesium via adsorption by passing 0 1 1 m3 of environmental water through 100 ml of adsorbent has recently been reported yasutaka et al 2016 2013 on the other hand filtration of a suspension using a filter paper or membrane for enrichment of ss is a generally employed technique and technology for achieving this goal has also been proposed tsuji et al 2014a however when the ss concentration is high such as in the situation immediately after rainfall this technique is difficult to implement for reasons such as blockage of the filters although there are reports on multi stage end flow filters and devices that employ centrifugal separation as solutions to these problems sakaguchi et al 2015 there is an issue whereby measurement becomes difficult in the field etc because the size of the apparatus becomes large therefore in this study we develop a separating and concentrating apparatus using a cross flow filter for separating ss and ds for the purpose of developing a more compact and long life device by using this device radioactive cs in ds and ss can be recovered from a large amount of environmental water including fresh water such as river and pond water the device can be expected to be used as a pretreatment device for evaluating the concentration of radioactive cs a cross flow filter is used to separate the suspension from the environmental water the cross flow filter allows the suspension in the water to flow horizontally with respect to the filtration surface with minimal accumulation of solids in the filter thus it is possible to avoid blockage by using this backwashing approach this is also the effective method of the evaluation of the radioactivity of muddy water based on the separation of ss and ds although there are previous studies using the cross flow filter to condense radioactive materials in the treatment of radioactive waste mann and todd 2000 sylvester et al 2013 zakrzewska trznadel 2013 zakrzewska trznadel and harasimowicz 2004 and for condensing inorganic and organic colloids or soluble species in seawater for use in environmental water research cho et al 1999 hassellöv et al 1999 larsson et al 2002 liu et al 2005 prihasto et al 2009 reitmeyer et al 1996 schlosser and croot 2008 whitehouse et al 1986 yeats et al 1990 zularisam et al 2006 the most important difference between our method and the previous studies is that the ss and ds can be collected separately and in situ furthermore the apparatus is that very highly concentrated ss can be easily obtained as a result various evaluations such as compositional analysis and structural analysis as well as radioactivity analysis become possible in this study the ignition loss is measured as an example of a further application and its significance is demonstrated 2 material and methods 2 1 apparatus a schematic diagram and photograph of the developed cs concentrating apparatus model dbw

aichi tokei denki co gas liquid separator prevents generation of gas in ss enrichment part the ss enrichment part with the internal volume of 500 ml was composed of the cross flow filter a circulation pump a flow meter and tubes connecting them the water in the filtrate tank was used as backwashing water in backwashing water does not pass through the ds enrichment column by solenoid valves and the ss concentrate does not go out from the apparatus with the buffer vessel for independent in situ operation it also runs with batteries it is also possible to install a ds concentrating column cs 13zn japan vilene co ltd for measuring radioactive cs in the ds form after solid liquid separation yasutaka et al 2016 2015 2013 in this study the developed column was installed for ds enrichment kitajima et al 2014 in this column nonwoven with prussian blue nanoparticles was introduced in the u8 container the details of the column was described in the previous report kitajima et al 2014 by using the column it is possible to collect almost of radioactive cs from 100 300 l of environmental water with the concentration of 0 02 bq l 1 2 2 laboratory test before the field test the performance of the system was evaluated in our laboratory using simulated environmental water sew the procedure for sew preparation is shown in fig 2 general commercial soil and arakida soil horticultural soil from tochigi pref japan were used as suspended substances in the sew arakida soil is a generally commercial clay soil in japan consists of 1 sand 63 silt 36 clay and has a true specific gravity of 2 69 g cm 3 kurimura 1972 distilled water and arakida soil were introduced into the water tank and stirred thoroughly after 1 h only the upper water layer up to 60 mm below the water surface was sampled having an ss concentration of about 1000 2000 mg l 1 and settling velocity of 1 mm min 1 or less a lower concentration suspension was prepared from the upper water layer by diluting with distilled water to 500 mg l 1 half of the suspension was directly dead end filtered through 17 25 sheets of glass fiber filter pore size 1 μm and the weight of the solid collected on the filter was measured for the measurement of the weight the weight of all the glass fiber filters was measured before and after the filtering and drying the weight of the collected solid was evaluated as the difference between before and after the treatment the other half was mixed with distilled water for preparation of the sew with an ss concentration of 50 mg l 1 or 100 mg l 1 the concentration was evaluated by using a turbidimeter the ratio of ss recovery by dbw 24 was confirmed in the laboratory analysis of the sew sample the sew was condensed as follows 50 l of sew was condensed using dbw 24 and the concentrate about 0 4 l was collected the concentrate remaining in the dead volume inside dbw 24 was washed out with 0 5 l of distilled water and recovered as post washing solution the 0 4 l concentrate and 0 5 l post washing solution were combined and denoted as the recovery solution 0 9 l the recovery solution was filtered with 11 20 sheets of glass fiber filter pore size 1 μm for evaluation of the mass of suspended substances ss mass as with the above weights of all the glass fiber filters before and after filtering and drying was measured and the increased weight was taken as ss mass the interior of the dbw 24 apparatus including the cross flow filter was washed with 1 8 l of distilled water and the mass of the solid was also evaluated by using the same method applied to the recovery solution the rate of ss recovery was evaluated by comparing the mass of the solid in the suspension before preparation of the sew with the weight of the solid recovered by dbw 24 the particle size distribution of each sample was measured using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer sald 2300 shimadzu co 2 3 field test enrichment of pond water as environmental water samples containing radioactive cs was carried out at ponds a and b in fukushima prefecture water of both ponds would be contaminated by radioactive cs caused by inflow pond a has an area of about 186 m2 and water inflow from upstream pond b has area of about 125 m2 and water inflows from the surroundings when rain etc in order to confirm the ss recovery ratio about 20 l of pond water was directly collected from pond a and the same volume of pond water was condensed using dbw 24 after enrichment we obtained 1 45 l of the recovery solution comprising 0 45 l of the concentrate and 1 0 l of the post washing solution in order to evaluate the ss mass dead end filtration was performed using a 0 45 μm membrane filter the raw water 20 l and the recovery solution 1 45 l were respectively filtered the difference in mass of all filters before and after filtration and drying was defined as ss mass after measurement of the weight of ss radioactive cs on membrane filter with ss attached was measured with a ge semiconductor detector at 2000 3000 s the concentration ratio of cs 134 cs 137 in all samples was about 1 2 for the field test at pond b water sampling and enrichment were performed using dbw 24 over the course of one day to investigate the reproducibility of recovery of the ss concentrated water at a flow rate of 0 12 l min 1 the pond water was sampled 5 10 cm below the surface of the pond generating 1 45 l of the recovery solution comprising 0 45 l of the concentrate and 1 0 l of the post washing solution from 168 l of pond water in the laboratory the recovery solution was dead end filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane filter to evaluate the ss mass and the concentration of radioactive cs in ss we concluded that the difference of the pore size of the filter between 0 45 μm and 1 μm is not serious because we could take most of the ss in the water even in using 1 μm filter as described later in order to confirm the difference between the sediment and suspended solid the sediments a depth of 0 15 cm in the same place were also sampled for evaluation of the ignition loss both the suspension and sediment were heated at 600 c for 2 h 3 results 3 1 laboratory test 3 1 1 rate of recovery from simulated suspension water simulated environmental water sew containing commercial soil at concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l 1 was prepared as described above the sew was condensed by dbw 24 followed by measurement of the ss mass in the recovery solution comprising the concentrate and the post washing solution as shown in fig 3 the rate of ss mass recovery was around 95 in all cases in order to estimate the ss mass remaining in dbw 24 after acquiring the recovery solution the relevant region of the apparatus was washed again the second post washing solution was obtained using 1 8 l of water the ss mass in the second post washing solution was only about 1 of ss in the sew indicating that more than 95 of suspended solids in the sew could be condensed and recovered it was confirmed that low concentrations of ss can be enriched to high concentrations at a recovery rate of about 95 although it is necessary to evaluate uncertainty for further detailed discussion the rate of recovery of the ss mass in the concentrate 0 4 l and that in the post washing solution 0 5 l was evaluated to be 86 1 and 12 3 respectively the particle size distributions of the raw water the concentrate and the recovery solution are shown in fig 4 indicating almost no difference in the particle size distribution as far as the particle size distribution is concerned suspended solids having the same properties as the raw water could be recovered both from the concentrate and the recovery solution 3 1 2 field tests field tests were performed with real environmental water at ponds a and b in fukushima prefecture as shown in fig 5 the ss mass in the raw water was largely recovered by the enrichment process using dbw 24 further the concentration of radioactive cs in the recovered ss was almost the same as that in the raw water the distribution of the ss mass and radioactive cs in the concentrate post washing solution and second post washing solution were also investigated as shown in fig 6 the mass distribution and that of the radioactive cs were the almost same in addition very little ss and radioactive cs remained in the second washing solution indicating that evaluation of only the concentrated and the first washing solution is sufficient to determine the ss mass and radioactive cs it was confirmed that the recovery rate achieved with dbw 24 was almost the same as that of existing collection methods and that there was little difference in the radioactive cs recovery from solution by dbw 24 thus pond water was condensed and collected from pond b for about 1 day at a flow rate of 0 12 l min 1 in order to evaluate the radioactive cs in the ds a ds concentrating column was also installed by installing a cross flow filter and backwash in dbw 24 the decline in the filtration flow rate was reduced i e 0 1 l min 1 16 drop after operating for about 1 day eventually 168 l of the pond water was condensed to 1 45 l of recovery solution as shown in table 1 the concentration of radioactive cs for each form in each pond could be evaluated less than 1 bq l 1 in particular for pond b although the flow volume reached 168 l and the collected ss was about 3 g the concentrations of radioactive cs in each form were successfully determined indicating that the developed method is robust for increasing the ss mass such robustness enables the collection of a large amount of ss and evaluation of the various properties of the ss for example we evaluated the ignition loss of the ss for the pond b sample as well as the concentration of radioactive cs as shown in fig 7 the values of these parameters differed significantly from those of the sediment of the same pond even though the concentration of radioactive cs in the sediment was less than 8000 bq kg 1 the concentration in the suspended solid was very high about 35 000 bq kg 1 the difference of the cs concentration would originate from the smaller particle size of ss than that of the sediment in the radioactive cs from the power plant accident the cs concentration tends to larger in the case of the large surface area of ss the ignition loss was about three times larger for the collected ss than the sediment this indicates that the organic component was three times larger in the ss in the pond water than in the sediment finally the ss concentration in the concentrate from the successful enrichment trial using dbw 24 is shown in fig 8 indicating that the maximum concentration in the concentrate after enrichment was 11 200 mg l 1 from these results enrichment up to 10 000 mg l 1 should be possible for various water based suspensions 4 conclusion in this study an apparatus for the pre enrichment of suspended environmental water was developed the recovery rate of ss mass estimated from the laboratory test was about 95 the size distribution of ss in the raw water and in the concentrate was almost the same in the field test at ponds in the fukushima area almost complete recovery of both the ss mass and the radioactive cs in the suspended solids was achieved it was also found that the ss in the recovered water has quite different properties from the sediment i e the concentration of radioactive cs was 4 5 times higher and the organic component was three times larger in the latter the concentration of radioactive cs could be simultaneously evaluated by installing the ds concentrating column these results indicate that our method makes it possible to evaluate the trace concentration of radioactive cs with dividing into ss and ds form although further evaluation is necessary to examine whether our method is applicable for any environmental water or not for example if the environmental water has a certain amount of the ss 0 45 μm we would need to use another cross flow filter with the smaller pore size finally concerning the ss concentration of other radioactive isotope this method would be applicable because the enrichment method is independent from the isotope properties acknowledgement the part of this research was supported by strategic funds for the promotion of science and technology japan 
18962,the results of this sampling campaign on pilot scale processes aim to evaluate the occurrence and behavior of trace organic micro pollutants and metal elements during anion exchange treatment of surface water and the subsequent treatment of generated spent brine with two types of electrodialysis membrane pairs this knowledge is relevant to assess the quality and reusability of secondary products created during brine treatment specifically the excess of sodium chloride to be recycled onsite and the natural organic matter mostly consisting of humic substances which find multiple applications in the agricultural industry this study highlights that 1 the attachment mechanism of organic micro pollutants to anion exchange resin occurs through electrostatic interaction and the subsequent transfer through ion exchange membranes is restricted by size exclusion and 2 the complexation of trace metals compounds with the natural organic matter partly explains their removal by anion exchange complexes remain stable during treatment of the brine with electrodialysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords metal traces organic micro pollutants anion exchange electrodialysis humic

and odor it also minimizes the formation of disinfection by products and increases the treatability of the water for downstream processes kingsbury and singer 2013 metcalfe et al 2015 the generation of a spent brine inherent to the process probably constitutes its main drawback these brines streams are characterized by a high conductivity and color due the excess of sodium chloride from the regenerant solution and the desorbed nom and inorganic anions from the raw water their disposal can be considered difficult and expensive which favored the development of technologies for brine treatment ariono et al 2016 more often the problem is turned around by creating useful secondary products from brine components sodium chloride is the first possible secondary product that can be reused directly onsite reducing in consequence the production transportation and spill of chemicals amini et al 2015 choe et al 2015 the nom fraction in the spent brine that essentially consists of smaller and charged fractions due to resin selectivity is often classified as humic or fulvic acids when that is the case they constitute a potentially valuable secondary product in circular economies

are worth the research and development effort for separation technologies capable of recovering these fractions the authors realize that the actual purity of recovered hs will dictate the benefits of the recovered fractions in this work the separation of spent brine components and recovery of secondary products is proposed with the use of a two stages process of electrodialysis ed a first stage for recycling a sodium chloride solution and a second stage for recovering the humic substances ed has previously been referred to as a suitable technology to separate inorganics from organic compounds kabsch korbutowicz et al 2011 zhang y pinoy l meesschaert b van der bruggen 2011 zhang et al 2009 for the recovery of nacl the anion exchange membranes can be made monovalent selective

transportation which highlights membrane deposition and neutral complex formation phenomena previously disregarded in artificial waters onorato et al 2017 finally the passage of organic micro pollutants through ion exchange membranes was isolated in vanoppen et al 2015 in which diffusion is designated as the main transportation mechanism to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first attempt to apply and compare the theories and observations from laboratory scale on the fate of trace pollutants in aix and ed to industrial or pilot scale using natural and un spiked water furthermore this study differentiates from other studies by offering a complete assessment of trace pollutants in the combination of relevant technologies recreated on pilot scale anion exchange resin and ion exchange membranes may in fact experience synergetic or complementary effects in compounds interactions the sampling results also relates to the operational process conditions and to the molecular properties to highlight trends in the transport of trace pollutants including an attempt to evaluate the consequences on contamination of secondary products 2 material and methods 2 1

regeneration cycle of aix resin occurring immediately after a sufficient contact time more details on the use of nacl solution leading to brine production is available in galjaard and koreman 2015 in the ed pilots operated in batch mode sample points include influent brine 4 effluent brines numbered 6 and 7 for ed1 and ed 2 respectively and effluent concentrates 5 and 8 2 1 2 trace pollutants for consistency trace pollutants were sampled within a day the study uses three aix units available at andijk with slight differences in kinetics due to their different scales two generations of pilots and one full scale the operational parameters for each aix units are given below in detail the brine from pilot 2 table 2 was manually collected to be further treated with ed in two consecutive batches 2 1 3 process performance routine samples were taken weekly in pilot 2 and the obtained analytical results from these samples were used to express the continuous aix performances over a period of six months for ed running in either in batch mode or feed and bleed mode the sampling time affected the results therefore a representative batch was chosen to determine the performance ed routinely runs using brine from full scale 2 2 ion exchange pilots all three pilot and full scale ion exchange units in this study are six processes developed by pwnt koreman and galjaard 2016 operating continuously on the parameters in table 1 during six operation the resin is dosed in the raw water kept in suspension during a fixed residence time separated from effluent water through lamellas and fully regenerated before being used in the next cycle 2 3 electrodialysis pilot the ed pilot includes two stacks operated in subsequent batch mode at a constant voltage of 45 v for 5 h in both batches the concentrate initially consists of 60 l of water produced by reverse osmosis in which the transferred salts will accumulate overtime the diluate of ed 1 consists of 150 l of brine produced on aix pilot 2 which will transfer to ed 2 to be further treated table 2 summarizes the operational parameters applied 2 4 membrane characterization membranes were characterized to determine differences in structural properties at the time of the study parameters evaluated include membrane thickness perm selectivity electrical resistance water content and contact angle determined with the captive bubble method results are presented in table 3 and more information on the method is available from supporting information i the difference between the two types of anion exchange membranes is an additional layer on the surface of the monovalent selective membranes this can be observed from a difference in the determined membranes thicknesses between the two types of ed membranes table 3 ge et al 2014 saracco and zanetti 1994 suggest that this additional layer is a tighter cross linked polymer which is deposited onto the pvc internal structure to physically block the passage of larger molecules characterization data show that the monovalent selective and standard membranes have a similar water content despite differences in membrane thickness in addition a higher contact angle for the monovalent selective membrane indicates a lower hydrophilicity both characteristics could in fact result from a lower density of active groups caused by an additional layer of polymers kumar et al 2009 in any case an improved mono selectivity of the neosepta membrane was confirmed by the difference in electrical resistance in a nacl solution 10 ω cm2 or in a mgso4 solution 87 ω cm2 the standard pc cell membranes display a constant electrical resistance around 2 ω cm2 in both solutions 2 5 analytical method trace elements 2 5 1 pre treatment of samples all samples were filtered using 0 20 μm

adsorption of a compound calculated by equation 1 as the difference in concentrations entering and exiting the aix contactor relatively to the concentration entering secondly the percentage of compounds in the brine presumably transported from raw water through adsorption desorption is calculated as a ratio between the two in equation 2 under the assumption that the fresh nacl solution for regeneration is not contaminated with trace pollutants 1 removal from the raw water c 1 f 1 c 2 f 2 c 1 f 1 100 2 transport to the brine c 4 f 4 c 1 f 1 100 in both equations c refers to the concentration and f to flows of either ion exchange influent referred to as stream 1 in fig 1 the effluent stream 2 or the brine stream 4 theoretically the difference between equations 1 and 2 represents the percentage of compounds permanently adsorbed on the resin beads similar mass balance equations were adapted for the trace pollutants transport in the ed processes for each of the two ed steps equations 3 and 4 express the removal in by ion exchange transfer as a difference between the concentrations in the brine at the beginning and the end of treatment relatively to the initial concentrations in the brine the percentage recovered in the concentrate stream at the end of either the first stage or the second stage ed are expressed with equations 5 and 6 respectively the initial

diluate containing the nom in solution 3 results 3 1 ion exchange performance in drinking water treatment the selected resin lewatit s5128 is designed for the adsorption and desorption of negatively charged dissolved organic matter lewatit lenntech 2015 however the charged quaternary ammonium functional groups results in the adsorption onto the resin material of both nom and anions present in the raw water removal eq 1 and transport eq 2 percentages calculated over pilot 2 are displayed in table 4 the data show a preferential order of removal of anions from the ijssel lake as so4 2 doc no3 hpo42 hco3 doc dissolved organic carbon represents the nom half of the doc is removed during the treatment which can be explained by the selectivity of the resin towards charged compounds with a low molecular weight referred to as the humic fraction of nom this selectivity is indicated by lc ocd used for nom fractionation metcalfe et al 2015 for this study the focus is the fate of trace contaminants nom fractionation was not used the percentages of compounds removed from the raw water eq 1 almost match the percentage transported in the brine eq 2 as an indication of a near complete regeneration the production of brine constitutes in volume about 0 5 of the water treated 3 2 organic micro pollutants transport in anion exchange pilot twenty three organic micro pollutants were detected with lc ms ms and the 81 screened with qtof in the ijssel lake only 27 species were quantified in the aix influent effluent and or brine and the removal eq 1 and transport eq 2 were calculated the species detected under quantifiable limits are listed in supporting information iii transport determined in pilot 2 are presented in fig 2 with similar trends for pilot 1 and full scale in supporting information iv all species caring negative charges except for gabapentine were transported substantially 5 5 30 to the brine stream whereas only a limited amount 0 7 5 of the neutral species and none of the positively charged metroprolol and tetrapropylammonium were transported other parameters related to the organic micro pollutants in the ijssel lake in the ranges summed up below could not be correlated with their removal molecular weight with values between 119 and 390 g mol initial concentration in ijssel lake between 0 1 μ g l and 0 61 μ g l the octanol water coefficient log p between 1 7 most hydrophilic and 4 26 most hydrophobic van der waals radius between 99 and 368 å pka between 1 16 and 15 96 as a measure of the acidity this observation tends to indicate that in practice the transport of organic micro pollutants in aix is dominantly driven by electrostatic interactions with the quaternary ammonium group of the regenerated aix resin material to a lesser degree physical interactions occur as well as was indicated by the transport of neutral compound metazachlor esa 3 3 trace metals compounds removal in anion exchange pilot metal cations in solution are not expected to adsorb on the resin because of charge repulsion effects unless a ligand is present or negatively charged metal oxides are formed in ijssel lake water the hs which contain a high density of carboxylic and other binding groups in their structure can be considered as ligands they are even often referred to as chelating agents which involves the ability to form multiple bonds with a single metallic element increasing the strength of the complex many studies davis 1984 mantoura et al 1978a 1978b olivier pourret mélanie davranche gérard gruau 2007 ram and raman 1984 have theorized the complexation of trace metals compounds with humic substances and the effect of surrounding conditions ph temperature concentrations and competition mechanisms to verify the attachment of trace metal compounds on lewatit s5128 in the presence of hs removal eq 1 and transport eq 2 were calculated transport across pilot 2 are presented in fig 3 results with pilot 1 and full scale showed similar trends and are displayed in supporting information v the results are organized by groups of elements according to the periodic table to highlight possible group behaviors the analysis revealed over 36 elements among them sodium magnesium potassium and calcium entering the process ranging from 5 to 94 mg l while others range from 0 1 to 340 μg l sodium is here deliberately excluded from the calculations since it is added in large amounts during regeneration the transition metals as a group and arsenic selenium and uranium display the highest transport to the brine to confirm they originate from ijssel lake rather than from the salt solution their removal eq 1 and transport eq 2 are compared in supporting information v only tungsten and zirconium could not be traced back because there were not quantifiable in raw water despite higher initial concentrations the transport of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals is low all transported ions have in common a favorable electronic configuration towards complex or oxyanions formation aqueous forms of the transition metals are too numerous to be considered all vanadium molybdenum tungsten copper and cobalt displaying the highest transport are discussed below as examples the first three elements share similar properties 1 as a result of redox reaction they are mostly found in surface waters as in oxyanions h2vo4 moo4 2 wo4 2 which adsorption on the resin is possible 2 there is also evidence of humic material partially reducing mo v and w to form weak organometallic complexes crans and tracey 1998 lazaridis et al 2003 smedley and kinniburgh 2017 world health organisation 2000 but for copper and cobalt which occur in surface water in their free cu2 and co2 forms transport to the brine can only take place through complexation with organic molecules 3 4 performances of the two stage electrodialysis the performance of ed during routine operation on full scale brine is displayed in table 5 desalination data is provided in supporting information vi a high removal of chloride and nitrate a moderate removal of bicarbonate and a low removal sulphate and doc was observed during the first stage ed separation the second stage of ed reduced the total inorganic content of the brine even further with a relatively limited loss of organics 3 5 micro pollutants removal in electrodialysis all micro pollutants detected in the brine in pilot 2 were retrieved in the ed mass balance fig 4 displays their distribution between the different effluents the recovery equations 5 and 6 illustrate the fractions transported to the concentrates after the monovalent a and standard b stacks respectively equation 4 is used to assess the compounds remaining in the brine at the end of the two stage treatment c on the x axis the micro pollutants are ordered by increasing van der waals volume a clear cut off in removal is observed after the passage of 2 4 dinitrophenol at 141 85 å over the monovalent ed stack compounds with a bigger radius were not found to be significantly transported such a cut off was not observed with the standard ed stack and previously strictly retained micro pollutants on the monovalent ed stack such as cyclamate 154 å mcpa 172 å benzaton 202 å or sulamethoxazole 211 å could be transferred to the concentrate of the standard ed stack the difference in removal over the two stacks could be attributed to the additional polymer layer on the surface of monovalent selective anion exchange membranes table 3 of which separation was based on size exclusion at the end of the two stage ed treatment only the largest compounds remain in the brine the zwitterion gabapentine is also noticeably retained throughout the two stages ed whilst being relatively small this could be explained by the double positive and negative charges which may lead to ineffective transport under the electrical current as illustrated in supporting documents vii other molecular properties of the organic micro pollutants e g molecular weight concentration in brine octanol water coefficient log p pka and charge did not affect the removal considerably 3 6 trace metals removal in electrodialysis the hypothesis of metal cations transport through aix process involved organometallic complexes and oxyanions that would have formed in surface water once in the brine changes in salinity and ph can affect the stability of the complexes lores and pennock 1998 rehemanjiang wufuera et al 2014 and possible modification of the bonding mechanisms could be observed during ed treatment the 36 elements screened in the brine were retrieved in the ed pilot the results in fig 5 display the distribution of metal elements between the three effluents i e the removal over the monovalent selective ed stack a the standard ed stack b and the retention in the brine after the two stacks c equations 4 6 are respectively used for the calculations fig 5 shows that alkali metals and alkaline earth metals transfer relatively easily under the electrical current in the first stage ed a and the second stage b with the noticeable exception of calcium whereas the transition metals and other elements at the right side of the periodic element table are mostly retained by both ed stacks with the noticeable exceptions of 1 rhenium palladium and ruthenium in ed stage 1 and 2 basic and semi metals groups and transition metals tungsten molybdenum and vanadium in ed stage 2 the ease of transport of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals confirms their presence in an ionic form in the brine the combined removal of calcium over the two stages did not exceed 31 but its retention at the end of the treatment c is lower than 2 which could suggest some scaling effects at high ph values onorato et al 2017 both types of cation exchange membranes table 3 used in the pilot are permeable to multivalent ions and should not restrict the transport of free cations metal oxides formed in surface water would separate in ed stage 1 or 2 according to their valence as observed in the case of previously discussed for vanadium tungsten and molybdenum therefore the low removal of most transition metals semi metals non metals and lanthanide suggests they formed organometallic complexes which remained stable in brine in addition the irving williams series implies the stability of organometallic complexes increases as they involve trace metals across the first row of the periodic table from titanium to zinc with the exception of vanadium mantoura et al 1978b results show the removal rates of compounds decrease accordingly lanthanide which was not found transferring to the concentrate side however was reduced in the brine the case of uranium and selenium deposition on the membrane due to the presence of calcium and carbonate is discussed in onorato et al 2017 4 discussion in addition to the assessment of the transport of trace pollutants through aix and ed processes sampling introduced the risk of contamination of the created secondary products the nacl solution collected in concentrate 1 5 can be reintroduced in the aix through the next regeneration cycle the excess of chloride in the brine after aix is estimated to be around 30 of the total demand if fully recovered through ed it would be mixed with 70 of new solution the main risk associated with this practice involves accumulation of anions other than chloride in time the data provided in this article indicate that the initial salt purity of 99 from provider mixed with a recovered salt purity of 82 from sampling would decrease to 94 over one cycle contamination would mainly be caused by bicarbonate 2 5 and different cations calcium magnesium potassium only the presence of anions potentially reduces the regeneration efficiency of the resin and a buffering effect of bicarbonate is expected to stabilize the contamination effect in time which should be determined experimentally a projected overview of anions contaminating chloride in the brine after ed and in the calculated composition of the regeneration solution as a mix of recovered and fresh nacl is presented in fig 6 in this scenario the combined contamination normalized per mg of chloride would reduce from 0 79 mg of anions and trace pollutants per mg of chloride to 0 22 mg mg cl after ed and to 0 07 mg mg cl once blended with fresh salt the purification of nom after the two ed steps before use as humic and fulvic supplement in agricultural applications is assessed in fig 7 the contamination with inorganic and trace pollutants is normalized per mg doc and displayed in the brine 4 after ed 1 6 and in the recovered nom solution 7 after ed 2 it shows demineralization takes place with a concentration of combined inorganic ions falling from 36 2 mg mg doc to 5 3 mg mg doc during treatment however residual na hco3 and so4 will hamper the range of applications of nom where there is no limitation on salts animal feed supplement could be such example for direct application either on soil or for animal consumption residual levels of trace pollutants in the nom are relevant regulations are specific to application and location so only general toxicity risks related to trace pollutants are considered among the micro pollutants of concern dinitro ortho cresol dnoc a pesticide now banned from use is fully eliminated during treatment information subjected to the high inaccuracy of the analytical methods for this particular compound sulfamethoxazole a potentially hazardous antibiotic in the nom solution amounts 0 04 μg l with no existing standard for this compound this level is considered acceptable diclofenac an anti inflammatory recently put on a watch list for priority substance by the european union remains in the nom solution at a concentration of 0 01 μg l this is below the standards currently set on 0 1 μg l in the european water framework for surface waters stowa 2013 23 human pharmaceuticals in the water cycle n d therefore not considered threatening to the environment among the heavy transition metals copper nickel arsenic cobalt and chromium are regulated in large numbers of application i e in the use as fertilizer kane et al 2003 or in the standards for surface water wfd 2000 residual concentrations in the recovered nom exceed the standards mentioned in both documents in fact this assessment implies that the removal of heavy metals was incomplete because of complex formation which forms a serious risk for different applications one possible easy solution could be for example acid treatment to de complex the hs and the heavy metals if unsuccessful alternative treatment methods should be investigated for the purification of humic substances as a replacement to the second step of electrodialysis 5 conclusions the sampling campaign confirmed the retention of organic and inorganic trace pollutants from raw water during aix treatment and indicated a probable dominance of electrostatic interaction during organic micro pollutants transport and formation of oxyanions and complexes with the organics during metals transport during the treatment of the aix brine in a two stage ed monovalent selective followed by standard stacks trace pollutants were seemingly separated according to the following size separation of organic micro pollutants with a clear cut off value related to van der waals volume was observed for the monovalent selective anion exchange membranes this behavior did not appear with standard ion exchange membranes due to its looser polymeric structure passage of metals was related to the periodic table group properties alkali and alkali earth metals largely passed the membranes on both ed stacks likely in their cationic form other metals especially transition metals were mostly retained presumably due to complex formation with nom as a result nacl was found to be of sufficient quality for reuse in the process with however a specific attention to long term accumulation of bicarbonate nom contained heavy metals which forms a risk for potential reuse applications further research should focus on improving the nom quality using for example nonionic resin extraction as an alternative to the second ed stack to remove greater quantities of heavy metals and improve desalination of nom

18962,the results of this sampling campaign on pilot scale processes aim to evaluate the occurrence and behavior of trace organic micro pollutants and metal elements during anion exchange treatment of surface water and the subsequent treatment of generated spent brine with two types of electrodialysis membrane pairs this knowledge is relevant to assess the quality and reusability of secondary products created during brine treatment specifically the excess of sodium chloride to be recycled onsite and the natural organic matter mostly consisting of humic substances which find multiple applications in the agricultural industry this study highlights that 1 the attachment mechanism of organic micro pollutants to anion exchange resin occurs through electrostatic interaction and the subsequent transfer through ion exchange membranes is restricted by size exclusion and 2 the complexation of trace metals compounds with the natural organic matter partly explains their removal by anion exchange complexes remain stable during treatment of the brine with electrodialysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords metal traces organic micro pollutants anion exchange electrodialysis humic substances 1 introduction in the drinking water industry the removal of natural organic matter nom through anion exchange aix is establishing itself as a relevant alternative to conventional processes the benefit is the removal of the specific fractions with low molecular weight and negative charges which are typically difficult to coagulate humbert et al 2005 mergen et al 2008 global climate change makes this technology particularly applicable in places where acidification of water sources due to acid rains etc lead to a modification of organic matter towards smaller species eikebrokk et al 2004 eimers et al 2008 evans et al n d lepistö et al 2008 monteith et al 2007 ritson et al 2014 by removing this specific fraction of organics the technology permits not only a reduction of taste and odor it also minimizes the formation of disinfection by products and increases the treatability of the water for downstream processes kingsbury and singer 2013 metcalfe et al 2015 the generation of a spent brine inherent to the process probably constitutes its main drawback these brines streams are characterized by a high conductivity and color due the excess of sodium chloride from the regenerant solution and the desorbed nom and inorganic anions from the raw water their disposal can be considered difficult and expensive which favored the development of technologies for brine treatment ariono et al 2016 more often the problem is turned around by creating useful secondary products from brine components sodium chloride is the first possible secondary product that can be reused directly onsite reducing in consequence the production transportation and spill of chemicals amini et al 2015 choe et al 2015 the nom fraction in the spent brine that essentially consists of smaller and charged fractions due to resin selectivity is often classified as humic or fulvic acids when that is the case they constitute a potentially valuable secondary product in circular economies in fact humic substances hs the general term to describe both species have raised interest in many industries lately e g in livestock breeding hs can reduce the amount of necessary antibiotic animals ingest islam et al 2005 kucukersan et al 2005 in open field agriculture hs can diminish the use of mineral addition for crops lyons and genc 2016 these prospects in a time of ever tighter regulation are worth the research and development effort for separation technologies capable of recovering these fractions the authors realize that the actual purity of recovered hs will dictate the benefits of the recovered fractions in this work the separation of spent brine components and recovery of secondary products is proposed with the use of a two stages process of electrodialysis ed a first stage for recycling a sodium chloride solution and a second stage for recovering the humic substances ed has previously been referred to as a suitable technology to separate inorganics from organic compounds kabsch korbutowicz et al 2011 zhang y pinoy l meesschaert b van der bruggen 2011 zhang et al 2009 for the recovery of nacl the anion exchange membranes can be made monovalent selective either by employing a thin perm selective surface layer with the same charge as the transferred ion or by increasing the degree of crosslinking within the polymer matrix vaselbehagh et al 2015 the proposed approach was tested at pwn a water utility in north holland in this setting illustrated in fig 1 aix treats surface water from the ijssel lake 1 for nom removal prior to further treatment with ceramic microfiltration and advanced oxidation processes 2 after a certain contact time the resin is separated and regenerated with a sodium chloride solution 3 to be reused in the next cycle the spent sodium chloride solution 4 or spent brine contains the desorbed nom but also untargeted anions from the ijssel lake that had an affinity for the resin typically nitrate sulphate and bicarbonate and possibly trace pollutants to separate and recycle the different chemical components the brine 4 undergoes a first ed step with monovalent selective anion exchange and standard cation exchange membranes referred to as the monovalent selective step until full transfer of chloride ions occurs to the concentrate 5 in the next step the diluate 6 enters a second ed stack equipped with standard anion and cation exchange membranes to separate the remaining multivalent salts in concentrate 8 from the organic matter in solution 7 three different streams are created from this treatment of the brine the monovalent salt solution in concentrate 1 5 consists of sodium chloride and bicarbonate to be reused as a fresh salt solution 3 the multivalent salts solution 8 usually dominated by sodium sulphate the nom in solution 7 among which the humic and fulvic acids this article covers the effort to assess the fate and removal of naturally occurring trace pollutants within the drinking water pre treatment using aix and subsequent brine treatment using ed leading to the recovery of sodium chloride and nom previous work on trace pollutant removal with aix or ed include single assessments of either processes mostly in a laboratory controlled setting and targeting only specific compounds of interest the removal of organic micro pollutants with aix resin was in fact previously investigated with regards to kinetics bä uerlein et al 2012 landry et al 2015a liu et al 2011 selectivity of the resin landry et al 2015b the competitive effect of the water matrix bä uerlein et al 2012 neale et al 2010 and the chemistry involved in the removal mechanism landry et al 2015a liu et al 2011 neale et al 2010 most studies highlight the co existence of several sorption mechanisms the electrostatic interaction and physical interactions driven by hydrophobicity or hydrogen bounding one study however has carried the investigation over several adsorption regeneration cycles to find the diminishing impact of the non electrostatic interactions cycle after cycle wang et al 2016 trace metal removal with anion exchange resin in drinking water production has been subject to fewer studies in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment the combination of strong base anion exchange and complexing agents such as edta nta or newly developed biodegradable aspartic acid derivatives is used for the removal of heavy metals with restricted discharge regulation kołodyǹ ska 2011 kołodyńska et al 2009 ed has been studied for removal of metals in waste stream decontamination results established a relation between the charges and hydrated radius of ions and their removals banasiak and schäfer 2009 one study used real brackish water to investigate the influence of the water matrix on trace metal transportation which highlights membrane deposition and neutral complex formation phenomena previously disregarded in artificial waters onorato et al 2017 finally the passage of organic micro pollutants through ion exchange membranes was isolated in vanoppen et al 2015 in which diffusion is designated as the main transportation mechanism to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first attempt to apply and compare the theories and observations from laboratory scale on the fate of trace pollutants in aix and ed to industrial or pilot scale using natural and un spiked water furthermore this study differentiates from other studies by offering a complete assessment of trace pollutants in the combination of relevant technologies recreated on pilot scale anion exchange resin and ion exchange membranes may in fact experience synergetic or complementary effects in compounds interactions the sampling results also relates to the operational process conditions and to the molecular properties to highlight trends in the transport of trace pollutants including an attempt to evaluate the consequences on contamination of secondary products 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling 2 1 1 sample points samples points of the aix include inlet and outlet of the contactor referred to in fig 1 as streams 1 and 2 as well as in the brine solution 4 obtained from the periodic regeneration cycle of aix resin occurring immediately after a sufficient contact time more details on the use of nacl solution leading to brine production is available in galjaard and koreman 2015 in the ed pilots operated in batch mode sample points include influent brine 4 effluent brines numbered 6 and 7 for ed1 and ed 2 respectively and effluent concentrates 5 and 8 2 1 2 trace pollutants for consistency trace pollutants were sampled within a day the study uses three aix units available at andijk with slight differences in kinetics due to their different scales two generations of pilots and one full scale the operational parameters for each aix units are given below in detail the brine from pilot 2 table 2 was manually collected to be further treated with ed in two consecutive batches 2 1 3 process performance routine samples were taken weekly in pilot 2 and the obtained analytical results from these samples were used to express the continuous aix performances over a period of six months for ed running in either in batch mode or feed and bleed mode the sampling time affected the results therefore a representative batch was chosen to determine the performance ed routinely runs using brine from full scale 2 2 ion exchange pilots all three pilot and full scale ion exchange units in this study are six processes developed by pwnt koreman and galjaard 2016 operating continuously on the parameters in table 1 during six operation the resin is dosed in the raw water kept in suspension during a fixed residence time separated from effluent water through lamellas and fully regenerated before being used in the next cycle 2 3 electrodialysis pilot the ed pilot includes two stacks operated in subsequent batch mode at a constant voltage of 45 v for 5 h in both batches the concentrate initially consists of 60 l of water produced by reverse osmosis in which the transferred salts will accumulate overtime the diluate of ed 1 consists of 150 l of brine produced on aix pilot 2 which will transfer to ed 2 to be further treated table 2 summarizes the operational parameters applied 2 4 membrane characterization membranes were characterized to determine differences in structural properties at the time of the study parameters evaluated include membrane thickness perm selectivity electrical resistance water content and contact angle determined with the captive bubble method results are presented in table 3 and more information on the method is available from supporting information i the difference between the two types of anion exchange membranes is an additional layer on the surface of the monovalent selective membranes this can be observed from a difference in the determined membranes thicknesses between the two types of ed membranes table 3 ge et al 2014 saracco and zanetti 1994 suggest that this additional layer is a tighter cross linked polymer which is deposited onto the pvc internal structure to physically block the passage of larger molecules characterization data show that the monovalent selective and standard membranes have a similar water content despite differences in membrane thickness in addition a higher contact angle for the monovalent selective membrane indicates a lower hydrophilicity both characteristics could in fact result from a lower density of active groups caused by an additional layer of polymers kumar et al 2009 in any case an improved mono selectivity of the neosepta membrane was confirmed by the difference in electrical resistance in a nacl solution 10 ω cm2 or in a mgso4 solution 87 ω cm2 the standard pc cell membranes display a constant electrical resistance around 2 ω cm2 in both solutions 2 5 analytical method trace elements 2 5 1 pre treatment of samples all samples were filtered using 0 20 μm filtration to remove larger particles as dilution factor of 10 determined by validation tests was applied to brine samples to reduce matrix effects during chemical analysis 2 5 2 organic micro

the lc qtof was performed with a recovery test spiked with 0 5 μg l of 56 frequently occurring micro pollutants and showed a good recovery for surface water ranging from 74 8 to 124 1 and satisfying recoveries for diluted brine ranging from 44 5 to 129 validation of lc ms ms resulted in better recoveries and quantification in both surface water ranging from 89 1 to 108 8 and diluted brine ranging from 76 3 to 140 8 in the results section a star marks the values obtained with lc ms ms 2 5 3 inorganic micro pollutants for trace metal compounds analysis an icp ms screening method using a xseries 2 icp ms thermo fisher scientific was employed for the detection of 65 trace metal compounds in a single run the trace metal compounds were quantified using an external calibration line consisting of four points because of its high salinity dilution of the brine with a factor of ten and hundred were compared during a recovery test with 1 μg l spiked compound and were found to be similar range 43 6 148 1 2 6 mass balance formulas two parameters derived from simple mass balance equations were used to express the trace pollutants transport in the ion exchanger first the removal in through adsorption of a compound calculated by equation 1 as the difference in concentrations entering and exiting the aix contactor relatively to the concentration entering secondly the percentage of compounds in the brine presumably transported from raw water through adsorption desorption is calculated as a ratio between the two in equation 2 under the assumption that the fresh nacl solution for regeneration is not contaminated with trace pollutants 1 removal from the raw water c 1 f 1 c 2 f 2 c 1 f 1 100 2 transport to the brine c 4 f 4 c 1 f 1 100 in both equations c refers to the concentration and f to flows of either ion exchange influent referred to as stream 1 in fig 1 the effluent stream 2 or the brine stream 4 theoretically the difference between equations 1 and 2 represents the percentage of compounds permanently adsorbed on the resin beads similar mass balance equations were adapted for the trace pollutants transport in the ed processes for each of the two ed steps equations 3 and 4 express the removal in by ion exchange transfer as a difference between the concentrations in the brine at the beginning and the end of treatment relatively to the initial concentrations in the brine the percentage recovered in the concentrate stream at the end of either the first stage or the second stage ed are expressed with equations 5 and 6 respectively the initial

diluate containing the nom in solution 3 results 3 1 ion exchange performance in drinking water treatment the selected resin lewatit s5128 is designed for the adsorption and desorption of negatively charged dissolved organic matter lewatit lenntech 2015 however the charged quaternary ammonium functional groups results in the adsorption onto the resin material of both nom and anions present in the raw water removal eq 1 and transport eq 2 percentages calculated over pilot 2 are displayed in table 4 the data show a preferential order of removal of anions from the ijssel lake as so4 2 doc no3 hpo42 hco3 doc dissolved organic carbon represents the nom half of the doc is removed during the treatment which can be explained by the selectivity of the resin towards charged compounds with a low molecular weight referred to as the humic fraction of nom this selectivity is indicated by lc ocd used for nom fractionation metcalfe et al 2015 for this study the focus is the fate of trace contaminants nom fractionation was not used the percentages of compounds removed from the raw water eq 1 almost match the percentage transported in the brine eq 2 as an indication of a near complete regeneration the production of brine constitutes in volume about 0 5 of the water treated 3 2 organic micro pollutants transport in anion exchange pilot twenty three organic micro pollutants were detected with lc ms ms and the 81 screened with qtof in the ijssel lake only 27 species were quantified in the aix influent effluent and or brine and the removal eq 1 and transport eq 2 were calculated the species detected under quantifiable limits are listed in supporting information iii transport determined in pilot 2 are presented in fig 2 with similar trends for pilot 1 and full scale in supporting information iv all species caring negative charges except for gabapentine were transported substantially 5 5 30 to the brine stream whereas only a limited amount 0 7 5 of the neutral species and none of the positively charged metroprolol and tetrapropylammonium were transported other parameters related to the organic micro pollutants in the ijssel lake in the ranges summed up below could not be correlated with their removal molecular weight with values between 119 and 390 g mol initial concentration in ijssel lake between 0 1 μ g l and 0 61 μ g l the octanol water coefficient log p between 1 7 most hydrophilic and 4 26 most hydrophobic van der waals radius between 99 and 368 å pka between 1 16 and 15 96 as a measure of the acidity this observation tends to indicate that in practice the transport of organic micro pollutants in aix is dominantly driven by electrostatic interactions with the quaternary ammonium group of the regenerated aix resin material to a lesser degree physical interactions occur as well as was indicated by the transport of neutral compound metazachlor esa 3 3 trace metals compounds removal in anion exchange pilot metal cations in solution are not expected to adsorb on the resin because of charge repulsion effects unless a ligand is present or negatively charged metal oxides are formed in ijssel lake water the hs which contain a high density of carboxylic and other binding groups in their structure can be considered as ligands they are even often referred to as chelating agents which involves the ability to form multiple bonds with a single metallic element increasing the strength of the complex many studies davis 1984 mantoura et al 1978a 1978b olivier pourret mélanie davranche gérard gruau 2007 ram and raman 1984 have theorized the complexation of trace metals compounds with humic substances and the effect of surrounding conditions ph temperature concentrations and competition mechanisms to verify the attachment of trace metal compounds on lewatit s5128 in the presence of hs removal eq 1 and transport eq 2 were calculated transport across pilot 2 are presented in fig 3 results with pilot 1 and full scale showed similar trends and are displayed in supporting information v the results are organized by groups of elements according to the periodic table to highlight possible group behaviors the analysis revealed over 36 elements among them sodium magnesium potassium and calcium entering the process ranging from 5 to 94 mg l while others range from 0 1 to 340 μg l sodium is here deliberately excluded from the calculations since it is added in large amounts during regeneration the transition metals as a group and arsenic selenium and uranium display the highest transport to the brine to confirm they originate from ijssel lake rather than from the salt solution their removal eq 1 and transport eq 2 are compared in supporting information v only tungsten and zirconium could not be traced back because there were not quantifiable in raw water despite higher initial concentrations the transport of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals is low all transported ions have in common a favorable electronic configuration towards complex or oxyanions formation aqueous forms of the transition metals are too numerous to be considered all vanadium molybdenum tungsten copper and cobalt displaying the highest transport are discussed below as examples the first three elements share similar properties 1 as a result of redox reaction they are mostly found in surface waters as in oxyanions h2vo4 moo4 2 wo4 2 which adsorption on the resin is possible 2 there is also evidence of humic material partially reducing mo v and w to form weak organometallic complexes crans and tracey 1998 lazaridis et al 2003 smedley and kinniburgh 2017 world health organisation 2000 but for copper and cobalt which occur in surface water in their free cu2 and co2 forms transport to the brine can only take place through complexation with organic molecules 3 4 performances of the two stage electrodialysis the performance of ed during routine operation on full scale brine is displayed in table 5 desalination data is provided in supporting information vi a high removal of chloride and nitrate a moderate removal of bicarbonate and a low removal sulphate and doc was observed during the first stage ed separation the second stage of ed reduced the total inorganic content of the brine even further with a relatively limited loss of organics 3 5 micro pollutants removal in electrodialysis all micro pollutants detected in the brine in pilot 2 were retrieved in the ed mass balance fig 4 displays their distribution between the different effluents the recovery equations 5 and 6 illustrate the fractions transported to the concentrates after the monovalent a and standard b stacks respectively equation 4 is used to assess the compounds remaining in the brine at the end of the two stage treatment c on the x axis the micro pollutants are ordered by increasing van der waals volume a clear cut off in removal is observed after the passage of 2 4 dinitrophenol at 141 85 å over the monovalent ed stack compounds with a bigger radius were not found to be significantly transported such a cut off was not observed with the standard ed stack and previously strictly retained micro pollutants on the monovalent ed stack such as cyclamate 154 å mcpa 172 å benzaton 202 å or sulamethoxazole 211 å could be transferred to the concentrate of the standard ed stack the difference in removal over the two stacks could be attributed to the additional polymer layer on the surface of monovalent selective anion exchange membranes table 3 of which separation was based on size exclusion at the end of the two stage ed treatment only the largest compounds remain in the brine the zwitterion gabapentine is also noticeably retained throughout the two stages ed whilst being relatively small this could be explained by the double positive and negative charges which may lead to ineffective transport under the electrical current as illustrated in supporting documents vii other molecular properties of the organic micro pollutants e g molecular weight concentration in brine octanol water coefficient log p pka and charge did not affect the removal considerably 3 6 trace metals removal in electrodialysis the hypothesis of metal cations transport through aix process involved organometallic complexes and oxyanions that would have formed in surface water once in the brine changes in salinity and ph can affect the stability of the complexes lores and pennock 1998 rehemanjiang wufuera et al 2014 and possible modification of the bonding mechanisms could be observed during ed treatment the 36 elements screened in the brine were retrieved in the ed pilot the results in fig 5 display the distribution of metal elements between the three effluents i e the removal over the monovalent selective ed stack a the standard ed stack b and the retention in the brine after the two stacks c equations 4 6 are respectively used for the calculations fig 5 shows that alkali metals and alkaline earth metals transfer relatively easily under the electrical current in the first stage ed a and the second stage b with the noticeable exception of calcium whereas the transition metals and other elements at the right side of the periodic element table are mostly retained by both ed stacks with the noticeable exceptions of 1 rhenium palladium and ruthenium in ed stage 1 and 2 basic and semi metals groups and transition metals tungsten molybdenum and vanadium in ed stage 2 the ease of transport of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals confirms their presence in an ionic form in the brine the combined removal of calcium over the two stages did not exceed 31 but its retention at the end of the treatment c is lower than 2 which could suggest some scaling effects at high ph values onorato et al 2017 both types of cation exchange membranes table 3 used in the pilot are permeable to multivalent ions and should not restrict the transport of free cations metal oxides formed in surface water would separate in ed stage 1 or 2 according to their valence as observed in the case of previously discussed for vanadium tungsten and molybdenum therefore the low removal of most transition metals semi metals non metals and lanthanide suggests they formed organometallic complexes which remained stable in brine in addition the irving williams series implies the stability of organometallic complexes increases as they involve trace metals across the first row of the periodic table from titanium to zinc with the exception of vanadium mantoura et al 1978b results show the removal rates of compounds decrease accordingly lanthanide which was not found transferring to the concentrate side however was reduced in the brine the case of uranium and selenium deposition on the membrane due to the presence of calcium and carbonate is discussed in onorato et al 2017 4 discussion in addition to the assessment of the transport of trace pollutants through aix and ed processes sampling introduced the risk of contamination of the created secondary products the nacl solution collected in concentrate 1 5 can be reintroduced in the aix through the next regeneration cycle the excess of chloride in the brine after aix is estimated to be around 30 of the total demand if fully recovered through ed it would be mixed with 70 of new solution the main risk associated with this practice involves accumulation of anions other than chloride in time the data provided in this article indicate that the initial salt purity of 99 from provider mixed with a recovered salt purity of 82 from sampling would decrease to 94 over one cycle contamination would mainly be caused by bicarbonate 2 5 and different cations calcium magnesium potassium only the presence of anions potentially reduces the regeneration efficiency of the resin and a buffering effect of bicarbonate is expected to stabilize the contamination effect in time which should be determined experimentally a projected overview of anions contaminating chloride in the brine after ed and in the calculated composition of the regeneration solution as a mix of recovered and fresh nacl is presented in fig 6 in this scenario the combined contamination normalized per mg of chloride would reduce from 0 79 mg of anions and trace pollutants per mg of chloride to 0 22 mg mg cl after ed and to 0 07 mg mg cl once blended with fresh salt the purification of nom after the two ed steps before use as humic and fulvic supplement in agricultural applications is assessed in fig 7 the contamination with inorganic and trace pollutants is normalized per mg doc and displayed in the brine 4 after ed 1 6 and in the recovered nom solution 7 after ed 2 it shows demineralization takes place with a concentration of combined inorganic ions falling from 36 2 mg mg doc to 5 3 mg mg doc during treatment however residual na hco3 and so4 will hamper the range of applications of nom where there is no limitation on salts animal feed supplement could be such example for direct application either on soil or for animal consumption residual levels of trace pollutants in the nom are relevant regulations are specific to application and location so only general toxicity risks related to trace pollutants are considered among the micro pollutants of concern dinitro ortho cresol dnoc a pesticide now banned from use is fully eliminated during treatment information subjected to the high inaccuracy of the analytical methods for this particular compound sulfamethoxazole a potentially hazardous antibiotic in the nom solution amounts 0 04 μg l with no existing standard for this compound this level is considered acceptable diclofenac an anti inflammatory recently put on a watch list for priority substance by the european union remains in the nom solution at a concentration of 0 01 μg l this is below the standards currently set on 0 1 μg l in the european water framework for surface waters stowa 2013 23 human pharmaceuticals in the water cycle n d therefore not considered threatening to the environment among the heavy transition metals copper nickel arsenic cobalt and chromium are regulated in large numbers of application i e in the use as fertilizer kane et al 2003 or in the standards for surface water wfd 2000 residual concentrations in the recovered nom exceed the standards mentioned in both documents in fact this assessment implies that the removal of heavy metals was incomplete because of complex formation which forms a serious risk for different applications one possible easy solution could be for example acid treatment to de complex the hs and the heavy metals if unsuccessful alternative treatment methods should be investigated for the purification of humic substances as a replacement to the second step of electrodialysis 5 conclusions the sampling campaign confirmed the retention of organic and inorganic trace pollutants from raw water during aix treatment and indicated a probable dominance of electrostatic interaction during organic micro pollutants transport and formation of oxyanions and complexes with the organics during metals transport during the treatment of the aix brine in a two stage ed monovalent selective followed by standard stacks trace pollutants were seemingly separated according to the following size separation of organic micro pollutants with a clear cut off value related to van der waals volume was observed for the monovalent selective anion exchange membranes this behavior did not appear with standard ion exchange membranes due to its looser polymeric structure passage of metals was related to the periodic table group properties alkali and alkali earth metals largely passed the membranes on both ed stacks likely in their cationic form other metals especially transition metals were mostly retained presumably due to complex formation with nom as a result nacl was found to be of sufficient quality for reuse in the process with however a specific attention to long term accumulation of bicarbonate nom contained heavy metals which forms a risk for potential reuse applications further research should focus on improving the nom quality using for example nonionic resin extraction as an alternative to the second ed stack to remove greater quantities of heavy metals and improve desalination of nom

18963,recreational waters are a source of many diseases caused by human viral pathogens including norovirus genogroup ii nov gii and enterovirus ev water samples from the arenales river in salta argentina were concentrated by ultrafiltration and analyzed for the concentrations of nov gii and ev by quantitative pcr out of 65 samples 61 and 59 were non detects below the sample limit of detection limit slod for ev and nov gii respectively we hypothesized that a finite number of environmental samples would lead to different conclusions regarding human health risks based on how data were treated and fitted to existing distribution functions a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra was performed and the risk of infection was calculated using a two methodological approaches to find the distributions that best fit the data sets methods h and r b four different exposure scenarios primary contact for children and adults and secondary contact by spray inhalation ingestion and hand to mouth contact and c five alternatives for treating censored data the risk of infection for nov gii was much higher and exceeded in most cases the acceptable value established by the usepa than for ev in almost all the scenarios within the recommended limit mainly due to the low infectious dose of nov the type of methodology used to fit the monitoring data was critical for these datasets with numerous non detects leading to very different estimates of risk method r resulted in higher projected risks than method h regarding the alternatives for treating censored data replacing non detects by a unique value like the average or median slod to simplify the calculations led to the loss of information about the particular characteristics of each sample in addition the average slod was highly impacted by extreme values due to events such as precipitations or point source contamination instead using the slod or half slod captured the uniqueness of each sample since they account for the history of the sample including the concentration procedure and the detection method used finally substitution of non detects by zero is not realistic since a negative result would be associated with a slod that can change by developing more efficient and sensitive methodology hence this approach would lead to an underestimation of the health risk our findings suggest that in most cases the use of the half slod approach is appropriate for qmra modeling graphical abstract image 1 keywords quantitative microbial risk assessment enteric virus recreational water censored data

yoder et al 2004 sinclair et al 2009 although only a small number of outbreaks are reported and investigated dorevitch et al 2012 different viral groups that share the fecal oral route for transmission can be found in ambient waters including norovirus nov kitajima et al 2010 victoria et al 2010 and enterovirus ev hsu et al 2008 rajtar et al 2008 one of the challenges of monitoring viruses in recreational waters is low and highly variable concentrations often resulting in observations below the detection limit bdl for this reason to evaluate the risk of infection or illness due to enteric viruses and other pathogens from exposures to low levels in water a set of statistical tools known as quantitative microbiological risk assessment qmra has been developed haas et al 1993 qmra has been applied to water contaminated with bacteria king abia et al 2016 viruses prez et al 2015 vergara et al 2016 and parasites krkosek et al 2016 and the risk calculated has been used to make decisions regarding public health qmra involves four stages hazard identification exposure assessment dose response assessment and risk characterization haas et al 1999 this methodology unlike point estimates of risk uses probability distributions incorporating the variability and uncertainty of the input magnitudes involved in the estimates in the stage of exposure assessment decisions such as fitting the experimental data to a distribution are of crucial importance and particular considerations should be made when numerous observations bdl or non detects are part of the data set haas et al 1999 some authors use zeros to represent non detects borchardt et al 2012 and others replace all of them by a particular value like the method limit of detection mara and sleigh 2010 rijal et al 2011 in this work another approach was used the non detects were represented by the sample limit of detection slod rajal et al 2007 or related values the calculation of slod takes into account the efficiency of virus recovery during the concentration of water the volumes and the efficiencies of molecular steps in the process including nucleic acid extraction reverse transcription amplification and inhibition that may affect the quantification using real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr rajal et al 2007 the concept considers that the limitations of detection and quantification are not only due to the selected methods but also due to the composition of the water matrix that affects the efficiency of all the stages involved from the concentration step to the experimental result poma et al 2013 furthermore when negative results or non detects are to be reported an slod should be reported with them such information can indicate a possible false negative case in which there is contamination with the pathogen of interest although at a concentration that is lower than the specific detection limit in the context of incorporating the slod to represent the non detects the aims of this study were to evaluate significant steps in qmra analysis and their impact on the calculated risk 1 the method to find the distributions that best fit the data set 2 the treatment of non detect data and 3 different scenarios for the ingestion of water contaminated with pathogens the analyses were performed using two sample datasets for human enterovirus ev and norovirus nov gii with abundant non detect results obtained by monitoring a river that crosses the city of salta in the northwest of argentina 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples and virus analysis sustained observations were carried out along the arenales river argentina and a total of 65 samples were analyzed the water was characterized physico chemically and microbiologically determining bacterial indicators enteric viruses and parasites as described before poma et al 2012 human ev and nov gii were quantified using qpcr briefly 20 l of water samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration using a system that was previously described and validated rajal et al 2007 each sample was spiked prior to ultrafiltration with a known amount of the bacteriophage pp7 phage of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15692 b2 which was used as an internal control to assess qpcr inhibition and to calculate the recovery efficiency of the concentration process the concentration factor of the ultrafiltration process was close to 400 the nucleic acids were extracted from concentrated water samples using qiagen viral rna kit qiagen valencia ca and transcribed into cdna using superscript iii invitrogen quantification by qpcr was done using validated taqman oligonucleotide systems kageyama et al 2003 fuhrman et al 2005 rajal et al 2007 water samples were processed and viruses quantified in the laboratorio de aguas y suelos water and soil laboratory at iniqui conicet unsa in salta argentina slod gc ml for each non detect result was calculated as 1 s l o d a l o d d f r v f e x t v i e x e e

were used to perform quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra qmra is a methodology that allows estimating the risk of adverse health effects for people being exposed to contaminated water it involves four steps as follows 2 2 1 hazard identification the hazards identified in this study belong to two groups of viral organisms ev and nov noroviruses are the most common cause of gastroenteritis in adults maunula et al 2005 and also have a high incidence in children koo et al 2013 in argentina the epidemiological information related to norovirus is limited however a few studies conducted suggest the importance of this viral group in non bacterial gastroenteritis bereciartu et al 2002 gomes et al 2007 analyzed fecal samples from eight outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis from six argentine provinces finding nov in 36 of the samples the gastroenteritis caused by these viruses causes rapid dehydration which is mainly troubling among older adults and infants karst et al 2014 unlike the acute course of the disease in most people in immune compromised patients the disease is characterized by being chronic and asymptomatic causing a prolonged excretion of the virus over time promoting its spread bok and green 2012 these viruses have been identified in natural and engineered aquatic environments kitajima et al 2010 victoria et al 2010 blanco fernández et al 2012 enteroviruses have been indicated as the causative agent of about 10 30 million illnesses per year in the united states caro et al 2001 several authors reported the presence of enteroviruses in recreational environmental waters hsu et al 2008 corsi et al 2014 lodder et al 2015 ev replicates in the oropharyngeal and intestinal mucosa although diarrhea and vomiting are unusual after crossing the intestinal epithelium the viruses reach the blood and can spread to various organs muir 2014 it is interesting to note that viruses that have high homology in their amino acid sequences exhibit very diverse clinical manifestations tapparel et al 2013 2 2 2 exposure assessment the dose or pathogen number involved in the exposure was calculated as 2 d c vwi 3 vwi ir te where d gc is the dose ingested c gc ml is the concentration or density of pathogens v wi ml is the volume of water ingested ir ml h is the ingestion rate and t e h is the duration of the exposure two methodological approaches which use maximum likelihood estimators mle were compared to find the distributions that best fit the data sets in the first approach a procedure described by haas et al 1999 was used which contemplates that numerous observations of the data set represented values below the detection limit bdl it will henceforth be called method h in the second approach the akaike information criterion aic was used which is included in the software risk version 7 0 0 palisade corporation it will henceforth be called method r for method h three density distributions lognormal gamma inverse gaussian were evaluated to find the more appropriate distribution of each set of virus data in the arenales river considering that our data set included a majority of censored data non detects which means results below the detection limit the following likelihood equation was used 4 2 ln l 2 i 1 n δ i ln f c i β 1 δ i ln f c i β where c i is the observed densities of organisms and f c i is the probability density function if the samples are above a detection limit if the samples are below the detection limit x i is replaced by any of the forms to represent the non detects and the term f c i should be replaced with the cumulative distribution f c i thereby the variable δ i takes a value of 1 if the sample is above the detection limit and a value of 0 in the opposite case in order to represent the non detects five alternatives were tested slod slod 2 the average slod of the dataset sloda the median of the slod in the data set slodm and zero the β represents the parameters that characterize the different distributions they were calculated for each distribution using a numerical optimization package included in microsoft office excel 2013 and those values which minimized 2 ln l were chosen the density distribution that produced the lowest value of 2 ln l was selected because it provided the better fit to the data set to confirm the adequate fit of the selected distribution to the data a special purpose goodness of fit test used for data sets with many non detects was implemented following haas et al 1999 according to hollander and proschan 1979 for the method r using the software risk the fitting process was performed by applying the maximum likelihood estimators mle resulting in a group of parameters that best fit the distribution to the data set unlike the h method where the distribution that generates the lowest value of 2 ln l eq 4 was selected in the r method the different fitted distributions were classified according to the akaike information criterion aic allowing for the selection of the distribution that best represented the data set risk 2015 version 7 0 0 palisade corporation the goodness of fit was evaluated by the p values obtained after the parametric bootstrapping procedure the same alternatives as mentioned above were used to represent the non detects for the water ingested v wi four scenarios were evaluated while the t e h was characterized by a pert distribution 0 1 0 5 2 for all of them coupe et al 2006 different scenarios were used to calculate the ingestion rate ir two of them involved primary contact bathing for adults and children respectively and the other two involved secondary contact due to hand mouth contact and to spray inhalation ingestion during canoeing boating and fishing to estimate the ir in adults and children during bathing pert distributions were used table 1 for the spray inhalation ingestion scenario a point value was used to characterize the rate of ingestion table 1 the ir due to wet hand to mouth contact q hm in ml h in children under 13 years old was calculated after de man et al 2014 5 q h m h a f h m where h cm represents the film thickness of water on hands a cm2 the skin surface area of the hand that touched the mouth and f hm number h the frequency of hand to mouth contact the proposed distributions for each term of equation 5 are presented in table 1 dose harmonization was taken into account so that the laboratory methods used to calculate the dose were in accordance with the methods used to establish dose response curves for enterovirus approximately 1000 rna genomic copies gc is equal to 1 plaque forming units pfu jonsson et al 2009 in contrast no dose harmonization was required for noroviruses because their dose response curves are based on molecular methods teunis et al 2008 2 2 3 dose response assessment relatively few dose response relationships have been developed from clinical trials and used extensively in qmra a beta poisson and a gauss hypergeometric function were selected as dose response models for enterovirus and norovirus respectively with the equations used to characterize the likelihood of developing a health adverse effect p i the probability of infection from exposure to a given dose d table 2 theoretical dose response estimates can drive norovirus based health risk estimates as has been discussed previously mcbride et al 2013 schmidt 2015 here we chose the published teunis formulation of the probability of illness teunis et al 2008 2 2 4 risk characterization the risk was calculated as individual s infection risk iir for each virus and it was characterized as the total probability of infection p i after one exposure to recreational water through accidental ingestion or secondary contact a monte carlo simulation of 10 000 exposure events was conducted for a characterization of uncertainty in the estimation of risk risk version 7 0 0 palisade corporation a sensitivity analysis was performed by calculating spearman rank correlation coefficients 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of two fitting methods using different alternatives for censored data of the 65 samples analyzed in the arenales river 6 2 were positive for ev and 9 2 for nov gii hence most of them were classified as non detects or samples below the sample limit of detection slod table 3 the range of pp7 recovery for the environmental samples analyzed used to calculate the slod was highly variable between 1 5 and 29 7 others have detected these viruses in ambient waters enteroviruses were found in 13 of 34 38 recreation areas from taiwan with a percentage of positive samples that was between 20 and 83 3 hsu et al 2008 also in a surveillance study conducted throughout europe which included the analysis of 1410 samples of recreational freshwater and marine water 6 2 of samples were positive for nov wyn jones et al 2011 in addition in a study conducted in the milwaukee river watershed 8 an 1 6 of samples were positive for ev and nov gii respectively corsi et al 2014 in a surveillance study of ev conducted in the city of córdoba argentina it was found that 59 of sewage samples and 21 of river samples were positive for ev detection in this study a large diversity of ev was found with echovirus 14 e14 being the most frequently detected serotype farías et al 2017 this serotype has been related to cases of acute flaccid paralysis afp pallansh and roos 2007 in a recent study conducted at the san roque dam one of the most important aquatic tourist destinations in central argentina nov was detected in 43 of the water samples evaluated the study involved 114 samples over a period of three years and genogroup ii predominated in 83 of the positive samples masachessi et al 2018 different probability distributions were found to best fit the experimental data based on how non detects were treated table 4 for the method r the pearson5 distribution worked best following the akaike information criterion aic for both viruses when slod slod 2 and slodm were used to represent the non detects however the exponential distribution had the best fit when zeros were used instead the pearson5 distribution is usually employed to fit microbiological data sets including pathogenic viruses hervé claude et al 2008 and bacteria oscar 2009 mckellar et al 2012 instead when using method h the gamma distribution showed the best fit for all the alternatives with the exception of the case when the sloda was used for ev table 4 the high frequency with which the gamma distribution emerged as the best fit for the data sets validates its use in qmraspot a software package for quantitative microbial risk assessment in surface and potable waters schijven et al 2011 that always adopts a gamma distribution to describe the experimental pathogen concentrations all the distributions found with the methods h and r provided a good fit to observed data in accordance with the hollander and proschan test and parametric bootstrapping procedure respectively 3 2 effect of fitting method on risk estimates the estimation using method r showed higher risk in almost all the evaluated exposure scenarios compared to those obtained from method h assuming five different ways of representing censored data table 5 the skewness sk was negative when method r was used for nov in all the scenarios involving primary contact for adults and children indicating a higher probability that the risk exceeded the average value av in these cases the median risks me were higher than the av conversely the sk was positive and me was lower than av in most cases when method h was used in agreement with lower risk estimates table 5 the higher values of kurtosis ku found for the probability distributions for ev compared to nov indicated a greater concentration of the estimated values close to the average the same effect leptokurtic was observed although more accentuated in the particular case of ev in scenarios involving secondary contact compared to primary contact for ev all the average risk values were within the limit established by usepa 2004 with the exception of those obtained for a primary contact using sloda fig 1 a conversely replacing the censored data with sloda and using the method h produced the minimum values of risk for all scenarios considered this behaviour is a consequence of the fact that a lognormal distribution found as the best fit for this approach was used for the calculation for norovirus fig 1b the risk due to primary contact for children was slightly higher than for adults the representations are superimposed in fig 1b due to the log scale used and exceeded the epa limit in all cases except when zeros were used for the non detects and the method h was selected zero h fig 1b the risk values due to secondary contact by inhalation followed a similar pattern although they were lower finally for secondary contact by hand mouth contact the risk was acceptable in all cases when the method h was used except for the situation of sloda replacing the non detects sloda h fig 1b conversely when the method r was used the risk exceeded the acceptable limit in all the cases except when zeros were used for censored data zero r fig 1b the analysis of this last scenario which was the most frequent one in the arenales river showed how critical the selection of the fitting method is essentially acting as a crossroads for decision making 3 3 effect of the alternatives for treating censored data on risk estimates as mentioned before authors generally use zeros or other specific values like the method limit of detection to represent results bdl borchardt et al 2012 mara and sleigh 2010 rijal et al 2011 in this work we approached the treatment evaluating five different alternatives the average risk increased when non detects were replaced in the following order zero slod 2 slod slodm and sloda to consider a non detect sample as zero is inaccurate because the experimental measurement is subject to the limitation of the detection method used which could be eventually reduced by the development of more sensitive techniques in addition using zeros gives the lowest risk values some of which may be within the limits accepted by regulations if decisions related to the protection of public health are based on those estimates this can lead to an underestimation of health risk in this sense it is appropriate to include that limitation in the methodology which affects the risk estimates by evaluating different alternatives for non detects the risk was at a maximum when sloda was employed due to the effect of a few high experimental values that significantly impacted the probability distribution and the parameters that characterize it used to represent the set of experimental data in this study high values of slod were a consequence of low pp7 recoveries eq 1 mainly related to samples with high turbidity affecting the performance of the ultrafiltration system during the water concentration this situation may even be more pronounced if other less efficient viral recovery procedures such as those reported in previous studies poma et al 2013 are applied the use of sloda for the calculation of risk led to the highest values and any decision based on these estimates would lead to an extremely protective public health policy among the different alternatives evaluated the use of the corresponding slod or slod 2 for each non detect seems more reasonable than replacing all of them by a unique value like the sloda highly affected by extreme values or the slodm or even the method limit of detection alod rajal et al 2007 in general for slod or slod 2 the uniqueness of each sample

not the case for sloda and slodm 3 4 comparison of risks associated with different exposure scenarios in all cases the risk was highest for children exposed to primary contact followed by exposed adults secondary contact by inhalation and finally hand mouth contact this order was driven by the ingested amount of the pathogen in each scenario for this work a single distribution was used in all scenarios to characterize the duration of the exposure however more research is needed to characterize a distribution in detail for the different scenarios a sensitivity analysis was performed by calculating spearman rank correlation coefficients between the selected output variables individual s infection risk and different input distributions viral concentration ingestion rate duration of exposure in all the scenarios the viral concentration was the variable with the highest correlation coefficients between 0 57 and 0 97 when the slod slod 2 and zero were used and hence represented the most significant factor in determining the risk of infection the average risk of infection was higher for norovirus than for enterovirus exceeding in most cases the limit established by usepa 2004 for gastroenteritis due to contact with recreational freshwaters the higher risk for noroviruses than for enteroviruses was mainly due to the lower infective dose in the dose response model when the assessment was performed for enterovirus the risk was within the acceptable limits except for primary contact when the risk approach was used and non detects were represented by the sloda when the assessment was performed for norovirus using the method h and the non detects were replaced with zeros the risk was below the limit established by epa in all the scenarios studied a public health related decision made based on this approach could lead to the underestimation of the real risk leaving the population vulnerable in the particular case of the hand mouth contact using method h all the alternatives for non detects led to a risk that was within the acceptable level except when sloda was used in contrast when the method r was utilized for hand mouth contact the risk was only acceptable when non detects were replaced with zeros 4 conclusions the type of methodology used for finding the best fit for pathogen data is critical especially in datasets with numerous non detects because different approaches can result in very different estimations of risk method r led to higher projected risks than method h for norovirus the estimated risk for the four scenarios considered was higher than the acceptable risk established by epa in most cases in contrast for enterovirus the estimated risk in almost all the scenarios was below the recommended limit five different alternatives to represent censored data sloda slodm slod slod 2 and zero were evaluated although it may be tempting to replace non detects by a unique value like the sloda or slodm to simplify the calculations this approach is equivalent to removing information about the particular characteristics of a sample in addition the sloda is highly impacted by extreme values in environmental data sets such as high concentrations due to precipitation leading to runoff or point source contamination on the other hand procedures to process samples for concentration and detection of target organisms are fully considered when either slod or slod 2 is used finally the common practice of replacing the non detects by zero is not realistic since it is known that any negative result is associated with a limit of detection which can change with more efficient and sensitive methodology and employing zero would lead to an underestimation of the risk the decision how to treat censored data especially when they are abundant in the dataset is crucial a decision maker will need to elect a methodology and alternative for censored data that results in neither under using zeros for the non detects nor

18963,recreational waters are a source of many diseases caused by human viral pathogens including norovirus genogroup ii nov gii and enterovirus ev water samples from the arenales river in salta argentina were concentrated by ultrafiltration and analyzed for the concentrations of nov gii and ev by quantitative pcr out of 65 samples 61 and 59 were non detects below the sample limit of detection limit slod for ev and nov gii respectively we hypothesized that a finite number of environmental samples would lead to different conclusions regarding human health risks based on how data were treated and fitted to existing distribution functions a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra was performed and the risk of infection was calculated using a two methodological approaches to find the distributions that best fit the data sets methods h and r b four different exposure scenarios primary contact for children and adults and secondary contact by spray inhalation ingestion and hand to mouth contact and c five alternatives for treating censored data the risk of infection for nov gii was much higher and exceeded in most cases the acceptable value established by the usepa than for ev in almost all the scenarios within the recommended limit mainly due to the low infectious dose of nov the type of methodology used to fit the monitoring data was critical for these datasets with numerous non detects leading to very different estimates of risk method r resulted in higher projected risks than method h regarding the alternatives for treating censored data replacing non detects by a unique value like the average or median slod to simplify the calculations led to the loss of information about the particular characteristics of each sample in addition the average slod was highly impacted by extreme values due to events such as precipitations or point source contamination instead using the slod or half slod captured the uniqueness of each sample since they account for the history of the sample including the concentration procedure and the detection method used finally substitution of non detects by zero is not realistic since a negative result would be associated with a slod that can change by developing more efficient and sensitive methodology hence this approach would lead to an underestimation of the health risk our findings suggest that in most cases the use of the half slod approach is appropriate for qmra modeling graphical abstract image 1 keywords quantitative microbial risk assessment enteric virus recreational water censored data

transmission can be found in ambient waters including norovirus nov kitajima et al 2010 victoria et al 2010 and enterovirus ev hsu et al 2008 rajtar et al 2008 one of the challenges of monitoring viruses in recreational waters is low and highly variable concentrations often resulting in observations below the detection limit bdl for this reason to evaluate the risk of infection or illness due to enteric viruses and other pathogens from exposures to low levels in water a set of statistical tools known as quantitative microbiological risk assessment qmra has been developed haas et al 1993 qmra has been applied to water contaminated with bacteria king abia et al 2016 viruses prez et al 2015 vergara et al 2016 and parasites krkosek et al 2016 and the risk calculated has been used to make decisions regarding public health qmra involves four stages hazard identification exposure assessment dose response assessment and risk characterization haas et al 1999 this methodology unlike point estimates of risk uses probability distributions incorporating the variability and uncertainty of the input magnitudes involved in the estimates in the stage of exposure assessment decisions such as fitting the experimental data to a distribution are of crucial importance and particular considerations should be made when numerous observations bdl or non detects are part of the data set haas et al 1999 some authors use zeros to represent non detects borchardt et al 2012 and others replace all of them by a particular value like the method limit of detection mara and sleigh 2010 rijal et al 2011 in this work another approach was used the non detects were represented by the sample limit of detection slod rajal et al 2007 or related values the calculation of slod takes into account the efficiency of virus recovery during the concentration of water the volumes and the efficiencies of molecular steps in the process including nucleic acid extraction reverse transcription amplification and inhibition that may affect the quantification using real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr rajal et al 2007 the concept considers that the limitations of detection and quantification are not only due to the selected methods but also due to the composition of the water matrix that affects the efficiency of all the stages involved from the concentration step to the experimental result poma et al 2013 furthermore when negative results or non detects are to be reported an slod should be reported with them such information can indicate a possible false negative case in which there is contamination with the pathogen of interest although at a concentration that is lower than the specific detection limit in the context of incorporating the slod to represent the non detects the aims of this study were to evaluate significant steps in qmra analysis and their impact on the calculated risk 1 the method to find the distributions that best fit the data set 2 the treatment of non detect data and 3 different scenarios for the ingestion of water contaminated with pathogens the analyses were performed using two sample datasets for human enterovirus ev and norovirus nov gii with abundant non detect results obtained by monitoring a river that crosses the city of salta in the northwest of argentina 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples and virus analysis sustained observations were carried out along the arenales river argentina and a total of 65 samples were analyzed the water was characterized physico chemically and microbiologically determining bacterial indicators enteric viruses and parasites as described before poma et al 2012 human ev and nov gii were quantified using qpcr briefly 20 l of water samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration using a system that was previously described and validated rajal et al 2007 each sample was spiked prior to ultrafiltration with a known amount of the bacteriophage pp7 phage of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15692 b2 which was used as an internal control to assess qpcr inhibition and to calculate the recovery efficiency of the concentration process the concentration factor of the ultrafiltration process was close to 400 the nucleic acids were extracted from concentrated water samples using qiagen viral rna kit qiagen valencia ca and transcribed into cdna using superscript iii invitrogen quantification by qpcr was done using validated taqman oligonucleotide systems kageyama et al 2003 fuhrman et al 2005 rajal et al 2007 water samples were processed and viruses quantified in the

were used to perform quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra qmra is a methodology that allows estimating the risk of adverse health effects for people being exposed to contaminated water it involves four steps as follows 2 2 1 hazard identification the hazards identified in this study belong to two groups of viral organisms ev and nov noroviruses are the most common cause of gastroenteritis in adults maunula et al 2005 and also have a high incidence in children koo et al 2013 in argentina the epidemiological information related to norovirus is limited however a few studies conducted suggest the importance of this viral group in non bacterial gastroenteritis bereciartu et al 2002 gomes et al 2007 analyzed fecal samples from eight outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis from six argentine provinces finding nov in 36 of the samples the gastroenteritis caused by these viruses causes rapid dehydration which is mainly troubling among older adults and infants karst et al 2014 unlike the acute course of the disease in most people in immune compromised patients the disease is characterized by being chronic and asymptomatic causing a prolonged excretion of the virus over time promoting its spread bok and green 2012 these viruses have been identified in natural and engineered aquatic environments kitajima et al 2010 victoria et al 2010 blanco fernández et al 2012 enteroviruses have been indicated as the causative agent of about 10 30 million illnesses per year in the united states caro et al 2001 several authors reported the presence of enteroviruses in recreational environmental waters hsu et al 2008 corsi et al 2014 lodder et al 2015 ev replicates in the oropharyngeal and intestinal mucosa although diarrhea and vomiting are unusual after crossing the intestinal epithelium the viruses reach the blood and can spread to various organs muir 2014 it is interesting to note that viruses that have high homology in their amino acid sequences exhibit very diverse clinical manifestations tapparel et al 2013 2 2 2 exposure assessment the dose or pathogen number involved in the exposure was calculated as 2 d c vwi 3 vwi ir te where d gc is the dose ingested c gc ml is the concentration or density of pathogens v wi ml is the volume of water ingested ir ml h is the ingestion rate and t e h is the duration of the exposure two methodological approaches which use maximum likelihood estimators mle were compared to find the distributions that best fit the data sets in the first approach a procedure described by haas et al 1999 was used which contemplates that numerous observations of the data set represented values below the detection limit bdl it will henceforth be called method h in the second approach the akaike information criterion aic was used which is included in the software risk version 7 0 0 palisade corporation it will henceforth be called method r for method h three density distributions lognormal gamma inverse gaussian were evaluated to find the more appropriate distribution of each set of virus data in the arenales river considering that our data set included a majority of censored data non detects which means results below the detection limit the following likelihood equation was used 4 2 ln l 2 i 1 n δ i ln f c i β 1 δ i ln f c i β where c i is the observed densities of organisms and f c i is the probability density function if the samples are above a detection limit if the samples are below the detection limit x i is replaced by any of the forms to represent the non detects and the term f c i should be replaced with the cumulative distribution f c i thereby the variable δ i takes a value of 1 if the sample is above the detection limit and a value of 0 in the opposite case in order to represent the non detects five alternatives were tested slod slod 2 the average slod of the dataset sloda the median of the slod in the data set slodm and zero the β represents the parameters that characterize the different distributions they were calculated for each distribution using a numerical optimization package included in microsoft office excel 2013 and those values which minimized 2 ln l were chosen the density distribution that produced the lowest value of 2 ln l was selected because it provided the better fit to the data set to confirm the adequate fit of the selected distribution to the data a special purpose goodness of fit test used for data sets with many non detects was implemented following haas et al 1999 according to hollander and proschan 1979 for the method r using the software risk the fitting process was performed by applying the maximum likelihood estimators mle resulting in a group of parameters that best fit the distribution to the data set unlike the h method where the distribution that generates the lowest value of 2 ln l eq 4 was selected in the r method the different fitted distributions were classified according to the akaike information criterion aic allowing for the selection of the distribution that best represented the data set risk 2015 version 7 0 0 palisade corporation the goodness of fit was evaluated by the p values obtained after the parametric bootstrapping procedure the same alternatives as mentioned above were used to represent the non detects for the water ingested v wi four scenarios were evaluated while the t e h was characterized by a pert distribution 0 1 0 5 2 for all of them coupe et al 2006 different scenarios were used to calculate the ingestion rate ir two of them involved primary contact bathing for adults and children respectively and the other two involved secondary contact due to hand mouth contact and to spray inhalation ingestion during canoeing boating and fishing to estimate the ir in adults and children during bathing pert distributions were used table 1 for the spray inhalation ingestion scenario a point value was used to characterize the rate of ingestion table 1 the ir due to wet hand to mouth contact q hm in ml h in children under 13 years old was calculated after de man et al 2014 5 q h m h a f h m where h cm represents the film thickness of water on hands a cm2 the skin surface area of the hand that touched the mouth and f hm number h the frequency of hand to mouth contact the proposed distributions for each term of equation 5 are presented in table 1 dose harmonization was taken into account so that the laboratory methods used to calculate the dose were in accordance with the methods used to establish dose response curves for enterovirus approximately 1000 rna genomic copies gc is equal to 1 plaque forming units pfu jonsson et al 2009 in contrast no dose harmonization was required for noroviruses because their dose response curves are based on molecular methods teunis et al 2008 2 2 3 dose response assessment relatively few dose response relationships have been developed from clinical trials and used extensively in qmra a beta poisson and a gauss hypergeometric function were selected as dose response models for enterovirus and norovirus respectively with the equations used to characterize the likelihood of developing a health adverse effect p i the probability of infection from exposure to a given dose d table 2 theoretical dose response estimates can drive norovirus based health risk estimates as has been discussed previously mcbride et al 2013 schmidt 2015 here we chose the published teunis formulation of the probability of illness teunis et al 2008 2 2 4 risk characterization the risk was calculated as individual s infection risk iir for each virus and it was characterized as the total probability of infection p i after one exposure to recreational water through accidental ingestion or secondary contact a monte carlo simulation of 10 000 exposure events was conducted for a characterization of uncertainty in the estimation of risk risk version 7 0 0 palisade corporation a sensitivity analysis was performed by calculating spearman rank correlation coefficients 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of two fitting methods using different alternatives for censored data of the 65 samples analyzed in the arenales river 6 2 were positive for ev and 9 2 for nov gii hence most of them were classified as non detects or samples below the sample limit of detection slod table 3 the range of pp7 recovery for the environmental samples analyzed used to calculate the slod was highly variable between 1 5 and 29 7 others have detected these viruses in ambient waters enteroviruses were found in 13 of 34 38 recreation areas from taiwan with a percentage of positive samples that was between 20 and 83 3 hsu et al 2008 also in a surveillance study conducted throughout europe which included the analysis of 1410 samples of recreational freshwater and marine water 6 2 of samples were positive for nov wyn jones et al 2011 in addition in a study conducted in the milwaukee river watershed 8 an 1 6 of samples were positive for ev and nov gii respectively corsi et al 2014 in a surveillance study of ev conducted in the city of córdoba argentina it was found that 59 of sewage samples and 21 of river samples were positive for ev detection in this study a large diversity of ev was found with echovirus 14 e14 being the most frequently detected serotype farías et al 2017 this serotype has been related to cases of acute flaccid paralysis afp pallansh and roos 2007 in a recent study conducted at the san roque dam one of the most important aquatic tourist destinations in central argentina nov was detected in 43 of the water samples evaluated the study involved 114 samples over a period of three years and genogroup ii predominated in 83 of the positive samples masachessi et al 2018 different probability distributions were found to best fit the experimental data based on how non detects were treated table 4 for the method r the pearson5 distribution worked best following the akaike information criterion aic for both viruses when slod slod 2 and slodm were used to represent the non detects however the exponential distribution had the best fit when zeros were used instead the pearson5 distribution is usually employed to fit microbiological data sets including pathogenic viruses hervé claude et al 2008 and bacteria oscar 2009 mckellar et al 2012 instead when using method h the gamma distribution showed the best fit for all the alternatives with the exception of the case when the sloda was used for ev table 4 the high frequency with which the gamma distribution emerged as the best fit for the data sets validates its use in qmraspot a software package for quantitative microbial risk assessment in surface and potable waters schijven et al 2011 that always adopts a gamma distribution to describe the experimental pathogen concentrations all the distributions found with the methods h and r provided a good fit to observed data in accordance with the hollander and proschan test and parametric bootstrapping procedure respectively 3 2 effect of fitting method on risk estimates the estimation using method r showed higher risk in almost all the evaluated exposure scenarios compared to those obtained from method h assuming five different ways of representing censored data table 5 the skewness sk was negative when method r was used for nov in all the scenarios involving primary contact for adults and children indicating a higher probability that the risk exceeded the average value av in these cases the median risks me were higher than the av conversely the sk was positive and me was lower than av in most cases when method h was used in agreement with lower risk estimates table 5 the higher values of kurtosis ku found for the probability distributions for ev compared to nov indicated a greater concentration of the estimated values close to the average the same effect leptokurtic was observed although more accentuated in the particular case of ev in scenarios involving secondary contact compared to primary contact for ev all the average risk values were within the limit established by usepa 2004 with the exception of those obtained for a primary contact using sloda fig 1 a conversely replacing the censored data with sloda and using the method h produced the minimum values of risk for all scenarios considered this behaviour is a consequence of the fact that a lognormal distribution found as the best fit for this approach was used for the calculation for norovirus fig 1b the risk due to primary contact for children was slightly higher than for adults the representations are superimposed in fig 1b due to the log scale used and exceeded the epa limit in all cases except when zeros were used for the non detects and the method h was selected zero h fig 1b the risk values due to secondary contact by inhalation followed a similar pattern although they were lower finally for secondary contact by hand mouth contact the risk was acceptable in all cases when the method h was used except for the situation of sloda replacing the non detects sloda h fig 1b conversely when the method r was used the risk exceeded the acceptable limit in all the cases except when zeros were used for censored data zero r fig 1b the analysis of this last scenario which was the most frequent one in the arenales river showed how critical the selection of the fitting method is essentially acting as a crossroads for decision making 3 3 effect of the alternatives for treating censored data on risk estimates as

18964,we have incorporated na functionalized carbon quantum dots na cqds into the polyamide layer via interfacial polymerization reaction and developed novel thin film nanocomposite tfn hollow fiber membranes for brackish water desalination comparing with the conventional thin film composite tfc membranes the tfn membranes comprising na cqds have a larger effective surface area thinner polyamide layer and more hydrophilic oxygen containing groups in the polyamide layer besides the interstitial space among the polyamide chains becomes larger due to the presence of na cqds as a result the incorporation of 1 wt na cqds into the polyamide layer could improve the pure water permeability pwp of the membranes from 1 74 lmh bar to 2 56 lmh bar by 47 1 without compromising their nacl rejection of 97 7 interestingly stabilization of the tfn hollow fiber membranes containing 1 wt na cqds at 23 bar could further promote the pwp to 4 27 lmh bar and the salt rejection to 98 6 under the same testing conditions due to the deformation of the membranes under a high hydraulic pressure when using a 2000 ppm nacl aqueous solution as the feed the optimal water flux and rejection of the

pressure are of great interest thin film composite tfc membranes which are prepared by deposition of a thin selective layer on top of a porous support have been widely employed as commercial ro membranes yang et al 2018 in addition to their superior permeation properties to the traditional phase inversion membranes they have a unique advantage of optimizing the porous support and thin polyamide selective layer separately to meet the requirements of specific applications gai et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 intensive efforts have been focused on the modification of the polyamide layer to improve their separation performance for ro ghosh et al 2008 ma et al 2018 sarkar et al 2010 zheng et al 2018 during the past decades the water flux and solute rejection of tfc membranes have been significantly improved however to further advance their ro performance one must get around the trade off relationship between the water permeability and solute selectivity geise et al 2011 recently the burgeoning nanotechnology has brought some exciting and promising breakthroughs on membrane technology for water treatment teow and mohammad 2019 jeong et al firstly developed thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes by embedding naa zeolite nanoparticles into the polyamide layer during the interfacial polymerization process and the resultant membranes had a pure water permeability pwp almost double the control ones jeong et al 2007 since then various tfn membranes with enhanced separation performance have been developed by employing different kinds of nanomaterials such as silica inorganic salts graphene oxide go carbon nanotubes cnts metal organic frameworks mofs and etc chae et al 2015 duan et al 2015a 2015b jadav and singh 2009 kim and deng 2011 kim et al 2012 lee et al 2008 it has been found that the physicochemical properties of the membranes could be effectively tailored by the additional nanomaterials to meet the requirements for specific water treatment applications leading to a substantially improved membrane performance song et al 2016 therefore tfn membranes have been regarded as a promising strategy to overcome the bottlenecks of the current ro membranes certain tfn membranes have been reported to overcome the trade off between water permeability and solute selectivity and demonstrate outstanding antifouling ability and antibacterial effects lau et al 2015 yin and deng 2015 however most of the aforementioned nanomaterials have relatively large sizes i e several hundred nanometers compared with the thickness of polyamide layers therefore it is difficult to fabricate defect free polyamide layers consisting of uniformly dispersed nanomaterials especially for the tfn membranes with a hollow fiber configuration the tfn membranes incorporated with large size nanoparticles tend to have non selective voids formed between these nanomaterials and the polymer matrices lind et al 2009 therefore the carbon based quantum dots which have a size of only several nanometers have drawn extensive attention to develop tfn membranes with defect free polyamide selective layers for water treatment in recent years fathizadeh et al 2019 song et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhao and chung 2018 in addition to their unique nanometer sizes carbon based quantum dots have excellent properties such as high specific surface area hydrophilicity antifouling properties and etc zeng et al 2016 zhao and chung 2018 zhao et al 2017 besides they are negatively charged with oxygen containing groups such as carboxyl groups which could potentially impart the tfn membranes with improved rejections against charged solutes and antifouling performance zhang et al fabricated tfn membranes with a tannic acid ta film comprising graphene oxide quantum dots goqds for low pressure nanofiltration nf zhang et al 2017 song et al and fathizadeh et al developed flat sheet tfn membranes with polyamide layers comprising goqds and nitrogen doped graphene oxide quantum dots n goqd for ro application respectively fathizadeh et al 2019 song et al 2016 in this work we would study the use of na functionalized carbon quantum dots na cqds as the nanofillers to develop tfn hollow fiber membranes for brackish water desalination the hollow fiber configuration is chosen because it has the following advantages over the flat sheet one 1 a much larger membrane area per unit module volume 2 self mechanical support 3 no need of spacers and 4 ease of handling during module fabrication baker 2004 peng et al 2012 the physicochemical properties and separation performance of the newly developed tfn membranes would be evaluated and compared with those of the conventional tfc membranes and the tfn membranes incorporated with carbon quantum dots cqds in addition we would investigate the effects of high pressure stabilization on the separation performance of the tfc and tfn hollow fiber membranes this study may provide new insights and open up novel strategies to design next generation ro membranes for brackish water desalination 2 experimental section 2 1 materials the porous hollow fiber substrates were prepared using veradel 3100p polyethersulfone pes solvay specialty polymers polyethylene glycol 400 peg mw 400 g mol acros organics n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 99 5 merck and glycerol industrial grade aik moh pains chemicals pte ltd the polyamide layers were deposited on top of the inner surface of the porous substrates by interfacial polymerization using 1 3 5 benzenetricarbonyl trichloride tmc 98 sigma aldrich in hexane 99

then functionalized with sodium hydroxide 98 sigma aldrich to produce na cqds sodium chloride nacl 99 5 merck was acquired for membrane performance tests all chemicals were used as received without further purification deionized di water produced by a milli q ultrapure water system millipore usa was used throughout the experiments 2 2 syntheses and characterizations of cqds and na cqds fig 1 illustrates the synthesis schemes of cqds and na cqds and the details have been elaborated in the literature guo et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 briefly citric acid was grinded into fine powders and then heated in air at 180 c for 3 h in a glass container with a loose cover the semi finished product was cooled down to room temperature and dissolved in di water then dialyzed using slide a lyzer g2 dialysis cassettes 2k mwco against di water the residues after dialysis were freeze dried to produce cqds na cqds were prepared by neutralizing the residues after dialysis with a naoh aqueous solution 5 0 m to a ph value of 8 and then freeze dried the particle size and morphology of cqds and na cqds were characterized using high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem jeol jem 2100f to prepare the samples for tem the cqds and na cqds were firstly dispersed in di water at 0 5 wt then a single drop of the nanoparticle aqueous solution was added onto the carbon coated copper grid 200 mesh then the tem samples were dried at room temperature before characterization fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir vertex 70 bruker usa with a wavenumber range of 4000 500 cm 1 and an x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps kratos axis ultradld spectrometer kratos analytical ltd with a mono al kα x ray source were employed to determinate the functional groups and chemical compositions of cqds and na cqds 2 3 fabrication of porous hollow fiber substrates a dry jet wet spinning process and a dual layer spinneret were employed to fabricate the porous hollow fiber substrates the polymer solution was prepared by dissolving the commercial pes polymer in a mixture of nmp and peg 1 1 followed by adding a small amount of di water into the homogenous polymer solution subsequently the di water polymer solution and nmp were fed into the inner middle and outer channels of the dual layer spinneret respectively to produce the inner selective hollow fiber substrates the details of polymer solution preparation and hollow fiber spinning could be found elsewhere zhang et al 2014 after being immersed in tap water for 2 days and a 50 wt glycerol aqueous solution for another 2 days followed by air drying in room temperature for 2 days the prepared hollow fiber substrates were made into small lab scale modules each module comprised three pieces of hollow fiber substrates with a length of about 14 cm 2 4 fabrication of tfc and tfn hollow fiber membranes a thin selective polyamide layer was deposited on top of the inner surface of each hollow fiber substrate via interfacial polymerization for the conventional tfc membranes a 2 wt mpd aqueous solution comprising 0 1 wt sds was firstly introduced into the lumen of the substrates for 3 min at a flow rate of 4 25 ml min then followed by air purging through the lumen for 5 min in order to strip away the excessive mpd solution subsequently a tmc hexane solution of 0 15 wt was introduced into the lumen of the substrates for 5 min at a flow rate of 2 50 ml min to react with the mpd monomer then followed by air purging through the lumen of the substrates for 1 min to strip away the excessive tmc solution for the tfn membranes comprising cqds or na cqds in the polyamide layers the nanomaterials were added into the mpd aqueous solutions at 1 wt following the same procedures as those for the conventional tfc membranes the resultant tfn membranes were denoted as tfn cqds 1 and tfn na cqds 1 respectively where 1 means 1 wt cqds or na cqds in the mpd aqueous solutions after interfacial polymerization the prepared lab scale modules comprising tfc and tfn membranes were left in air overnight and then immersed in di water for at least one day before the tests 2 5 characterizations of tfc and tfn hollow fiber membranes to study the differences between the conventional tfc membranes and the tfn membranes incorporated with cqds and na cqds various characterization techniques were utilized prior to the characterizations the membranes were taken out from the lab scale modules and immersed in di water for at least one day to remove the potential contaminants before being freeze dried field emission scanning electronic microscopy fesem jeol jsm 6700 was used to observe their morphology the membrane samples for fesem observation were fractured in liquid nitrogen and coated with platinum using a joel jfc 1100e ion sputtering device atomic force microscopy afm nanoscope iiia digital instrument usa was utilized to determine their mean roughness ra root mean square roughness rq and effective surface area with a scan size of 5 μm 5 μm under a tapping mode in air x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps kratos axis ultradld spectrometer kratos analytical ltd with a mono al kα x ray source was employed to study the chemical compositions of their polyamide layers 2 6 performance tests of tfc and tfn hollow fiber membranes the performance of the tfc and tfn membranes was evaluated in terms of pure water permeability pwp or a l m 2 h 1 bar lmh bar salt permeability b l m 2 h 1 lmh water flux j w l m 2 h 1 lmh and solute rejection r using lab scale modules comprising three pieces of hollow fiber membranes with an effective area of about 8 cm2 the experimental setup used in this work was modified from the setup reported elsewhere zhang et al 2014 one of the two pre determined stabilization pressures i e 15 bar or 23 bar had been applied for 1 h before the membrane performance was evaluated at 15 bar membrane performance under the same stabilization condition i e 15 bar was compared to study the effects of the incorporation of cqds and na cqds membrane performance under different stabilization conditions i e 15 bar vs 23 bar was compared to study the effects of high pressure stabilization on the separation performance of hollow fiber membranes the pressure of 23 bar was chosen because the burst pressure of these membranes was 25 bar which was determined by elevating the hydraulic pressure in their lumen until the hollow fiber membranes collapsed to measure pwp di water was pumped into the lumen of the lab scale modules at a flow rate of 200 ml min the water permeate at the shell side of hollow fiber membranes was collected at 15 bar after the membranes had been stabilized at 15 bar or 23 bar for 1 h pwp could be calculated using the equation below 1 a δ v a m δ t δ p where δ v l is the volumetric variation of water permeation during a time interval δ t h under a trans membrane pressure of δ p b a r and a m m 2 is the effective membrane area of the lab scale modules to measure the salt permeability water flux and solute rejection a 2000 ppm nacl feed solution was pumped into the lumen of the lab scale modules at a flow rate of 200 ml min and the permeate was collected at 15 bar after the tfc and tfn membranes had been stabilized at 15 bar or 23 bar for 1 h the water flux across the membranes was evaluated using the equation below 2 j w δ v a m δ t the conductivity of the feed and permeate was measured to determine the salt rejection and salt permeability using the equations below 3 r 1 c d p c d f 100 4 b 1 r r δ p δ π a where c d p μ s c m and c d f μ s c m are the conductivity of the permeate and feed solution respectively δ π is the osmotic pressure difference across the membranes 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of cqds and na cqds fig 2 displays the tem images of both cqds and na cqds they are well dispersed without agglomeration and have a nearly spherical shape with a similar size range between 2 and 6 nm fig 3 shows the surface chemistry of cqds and na cqds investigated by ft ir the wide absorption around 3300 cm 1 and the absorption at 1690 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of the hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups existing in cqds respectively interestingly the absorption of the carboxyl groups of na cqds shifts to 1551 cm 1 which is in consistent with the literature pan et al 2017 the existence of these hydrophilic oxygen containing groups in cqds and na cqds make them highly hydrophilic table 1 summarizes the chemical compositions of cqds and na cqds analyzed by xps both cqds and na cqds have high oxygen content indicating the existence of large amounts of hydrophilic oxygen containing groups which is in consistent with the ft ir analyses the na content in na cqds is 12 9 while there is no na existing in cqds not only the existence of oxygen containing groups but also the existence of sodium imparts the na cqds with excellent hydrophilicity which makes them highly dispersible in aqueous solutions 3 2 physicochemical changes due to cqds and na cqds incorporation fesem was empolyed to study the effects of cqds and na cqds incorporation on the morphology of polyamide layers fig 4 compares the cross section and surface morphology of the polyamide layers of the tfc and tfn membranes as shown in fig 4 a1 and b1 the conventional tfc membrane has a polyamide layer apparently as an independent layer on top of the porous substrate with a thickness of around 426 nm and a typical ridge and valley surface morphology han et al 2013 sun and chung 2013 wan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in contrast the polyamide layer of the tfn membrane incorporated with cqds i e tfn cqds 1 not only could be hardly distinguished as an extra layer from the substrate due to the significantly decreased thickness fig 4 a2 but also has a much smoother nodular like surface morphology fig 4 b2 the cause for the decreased thickness and smoother surface may result from the acidic properties of cqds in other words the ph value of the as synthesized cqds aqueous solution before being freeze dried is about 2 the addition of cqds into the mpd aqueous solution causes a drop in ph value from about 8 9 to 5 under this circumstance the acid groups of cqds may react with the mpd monomer which results in a decrease in the available amount of amine groups for interfacial polymerization in addition the h generated from the ionization of carboxyl groups tends to inhibit the reaction between mpd and tmc monomers whose byproduct is hcl fathizadeh et al 2019 shen et al 2016 2017 as a result the acidic mpd solution comprising cqds tends to have a lower degree of reaction with the tmc solution forming a nodular like polyamide selective layer with a smaller thickness and roughness interestingly the typical ridge and valley morphology re appears on the polyamide layer of the tfn membrane incorporated with na cqds i e tfn na cqds 1 and the polyamide layer could be again distinguished as an independent layer on top of the substrate with a thickness of about 343 nm as illustrated in fig 4 a3 and b3 a comparison of its surface morphology with that of the conventional tfc membrane the former has more and broader leaves than the latter as a result the tfn na cqds 1 has a polyamide layer with the highest roughness among the three kinds of membranes this morphological change is mainly due to the effects of na cqds incorporation during the interfacial polymerization process usually mpd molecules in the aqueous phase tend to diffuse across the interface to react with tmc molecules the diffusion of mpd would slow down gradually due to the formation of a nascent polyamide network when the polyamide network becomes dense and thick enough it would stop the mpd diffusion and terminate the interfacial polymerization the addition of na cqds into the mpd aqueous solution induces additional interstitial space among the nascent polyamide network and results in more mpd diffusing towards the organic phase and reacting with tmc as a result the polyamide layer of tfn na cqds 1 has more and broader leaves formed on its surface accompanying with a decreased thickness table 2 summarizes the roughness and effective surface area of the polyamide layers measured by afm consistent with the observations from fesem images the polyamide layer of tfn cqds 1 has a lower roughness than the conventional tfc membrane due to the lower degree of reaction between the acidic mpd solution and the tmc solution while the polyamide layer of tfn na cqds 1 has a higher roughness than the conventional tfc membrane due to the diffusion of more mpd to react with tmc in terms of effective surface area the polyamide layer of tfn cqds 1 has the smallest one because it possesses a nodular like morphology instead of the typical ridge and valley morphology observed for the conventional tfc membrane and tfn na cqds 1 since tfn na cqds 1 has a polyamide layer with more and broader leaves on its surface than the conventional tfc membrane the former has an effective surface area 21 0 larger than the latter i e 46 1 μm2 vs 38 1 μm2 it is widely believed that the higher roughness would benefit the water transport across the membranes due to the larger effective surface area leading to a higher water permeability and flux ghosh and hoek 2009 hirose et al 1996 ren et al 2017 sun et al 2014 yao et al 2007 table 3 shows the xps results reflecting the effects of cqds and na cqds incorporation on the chemical compositions of polyamide layers both tfn cqds 1 and tfn na cqds 1 have slightly higher o content and o c ratio in their polyamide layers than the conventional tfc membrane due to the incorporation of highly oxygen containing cqds and na cqds the higher o content and o c ratio imply that the polyamide layers of tfn membranes have more hydrophilic oxygen containing groups in their surface which may potentially benefit the water transport across the membranes besides the incorporation of cqds and na cqds would also affect the n content of the polyamide layers since both cqds and na cqds have no n content the addition of them into the polyamide layers tend to decrease the n content of both tfn cqds 1 and tfn na cqds 1 due to the dilution effect however a comparison of n content among these three membranes shows tfn na cqds 1 conventional tfc tfn cqds 1 the higher n content of tfn na cqds 1 could be regarded as an indicator for the enhanced degree of reaction between mpd and tmc monomers interestingly this sequence is exactly the same as the orders of roughness and effective surface area these results are in consistent with our hypotheses about how the addition of cqds and na cqds influences the interfacial polymerization reaction between mpd and tmc monomers due to the relatively low amount of na content in na cqds the na content in the polyamide layer could be hardly detected by xps 3 3 performance changes due to cqds and na cqds incorporation in this section the water permeate across membranes was collected at 15 bar after the hollow fiber membranes had been stabilized at 15 bar for 1 h to determine the effects of cqds and na cqds incorporation on membrane performance fig 5 summarizes the pwp a and salt permeability b of the conventional tfc membrane and cqds and na cqds incorporated tfn membranes the a and b values of the conventional tfc membrane are 1 74 lmh bar and 0 58 lmh respectively after the incorporation of cqds into the polyamide layer the a value of tfn cqds 1 decreases to 1 21 lmh bar due to the dramatic decrease in both membrane roughness and effective surface area while its b value maintains as the same as that of the conventional tfc membrane in contrast the a value of tfn na cqds 1 increases to 2 56 lmn bar accompanying with a slight increase in the b value to 0 86 lmh compared to the conventional tfc membrane the 47 1 increase in the a value may arise from the physicochemical changes happened to the polyamide layer as a result of na cqds incorporation such as a decreased membrane thickness an increased effective surface area more hydrophilic oxygen containing groups and an increased interstitial space among the polyamide chains table 4 compares the water fluxes and solute rejections of the conventional tfc membrane and cqds and na cqds incorporated tfn membranes for brackish water desalination using a 2000 ppm nacl aqueous solution as the feed the conventional tfc membrane has a water flux and solute rejection of 24 25 lmh and 97 7 respectively similar to the effects of cqds and na cqds incorporation on the a values the water flux of tfn cqds 1 drops to 16 95 lmh while that of tfn na cqds 1 dramatically jumps to 34 86 lmh which is a 43 8 increment compared with the conventional tfc membrane meanwhile the nacl rejection of tfn cqds 1 decreases to 96 7 due to the combined effects of the enlarged interstitial space among polyamide chains and the decreased degree of reaction between mpd and tmc monomers in contrast although the incorporation of na cqds into the polyamide layer would also enlarge the interstitial space among polyamide chains its negative effects on nacl rejection could be compensated by the positive effects induced by the increased degree of reaction between mpd and tmc as a result tfn na cqds 1 has the same nacl rejection as the conventional tfc membrane which means that the incorporation of 1 wt na cqds into the polyamide layer does not induce any significant defects 3 4 advantages of the hollow fiber configuration for brackish water desalination in this section the water permeate across membranes was still collected at 15 bar while a higher stabilization pressure had been applied to hollow fiber membranes so that the effects of high pressure stabilization on separation performance can be illustrated fig 6 shows the a and b values tested at 15 bar after the hollow fiber membranes had been stabilized at 23 bar for 1 h a higher stabilization pressure would not change the effects of cqds and na cqds incorporation on membrane performance so the general trends of a and b values in fig 6 are almost as the same as those in fig 5 tfn na cqds 1 has the highest a value of 4 27 lmh bar a comparison between figs 5 and 6 indicates that the stabilization at 23 bar instead of 15 bar makes the a values jump 68 4 63 6 and 66 8 for the conventional tfc tfn cqds 1 and tfn na cqds 1 membranes respectively the dramatic enhancement may be explainable by the deformation of hollow fiber membranes under a high hydraulic pressure due to the polymeric nature and self support configuration a hollow fiber membrane would experience a certain degree of circumferential expansion if there is a high hydraulic pressure applied in its lumen this expansion would not only stretch the polyamide layer circumferentially but also decrease the membrane thickness and tortuosity gai et al 2016 as a result the area of the membrane inner surface is increased and the length and resistance for water transport are reduced both factors would benefit water transport across the membranes leading to a higher pure water permeability i e a value interestingly the membranes stabilized at 23 bar have almost comparable salt permeability i e b values with the membranes stabilized at 15 bar which means that the stabilization of hollow fiber membranes at a high hydraulic pressure does not induce any significant defects on the polyamide layer table 4 also summaries the water fluxes and solute rejections tested at 15 bar after the hollow fiber membranes had been stabilized at 23 bar for 1 h similar to the changes in a values the water fluxes of all membranes increase about 60 after being stabilized at a higher hydraulic pressure among them tfn na cqds 1 still has the highest water flux of 57 65 lmh with a nacl rejection of 98 6 for brackish water desalination what s more the solute rejections of all three membranes improve slightly from 97 7 to 98 7 96 7 to 97 8 and 97 7 to 98 6 for the conventional tfc tfn cqds 1 and tfn na cqds 1 respectively this may result from the radial compaction of the polyamide layers under a higher stabilization pressure in conclusion high pressure stabilization could significantly enhance the water flux and slightly improve the solute rejection of hollow fiber membranes since the deformation under a high hydraulic pressure could improve the separation performance of hollow fiber membranes significantly while deteriorate the separation performance of flat sheet membranes li et al 2013 the hollow fiber configuration may be more attractive than flat sheet membranes to achieve the optimal performance of tfc and tfn membranes for the low pressure ro process 4 conclusions a novel tfn hollow fiber membrane has been developed by incorporating na cqds into the polyamide layer via interfacial polymerization for brackish water desalination the newly developed tfn membrane shows a significantly higher water flux than the conventional tfc membrane with a comparable nacl rejection the performance enhancement arises from the morphological and composition changes of the polyamide layer as a result of na cqds incorporation such as a thinner polyamide layer a larger effective surface area more hydrophilic oxygen containing groups and an enlarged interstitial space among the polyamide chains these physiochemical changes may also influence the antifouling property of the membranes and we will examine it in our future work in addition after the high pressure stabilization the tfn hollow fiber membrane would have a stretched polyamide layer with an expanded inner surface area and a decreased water transport length and resistance by taking advantages of these unique features of hollow fiber configuration the optimal tfn na cqds 1 hollow fiber membrane has a water flux of 57 65 lmh with a nacl rejection of 98 6 using a 2000 ppm nacl aqueous solution as the feed declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

18964,we have incorporated na functionalized carbon quantum dots na cqds into the polyamide layer via interfacial polymerization reaction and developed novel thin film nanocomposite tfn hollow fiber membranes for brackish water desalination comparing with the conventional thin film composite tfc membranes the tfn membranes comprising na cqds have a larger effective surface area thinner polyamide layer and more hydrophilic oxygen containing groups in the polyamide layer besides the interstitial space among the polyamide chains becomes larger due to the presence of na cqds as a result the incorporation of 1 wt na cqds into the polyamide layer could improve the pure water permeability pwp of the membranes from 1 74 lmh bar to 2 56 lmh bar by 47 1 without compromising their nacl rejection of 97 7 interestingly stabilization of the tfn hollow fiber membranes containing 1 wt na cqds at 23 bar could further promote the pwp to 4 27 lmh bar and the salt rejection to 98 6 under the same testing conditions due to the deformation of the membranes under a high hydraulic pressure when using a 2000 ppm nacl aqueous solution as the feed the optimal water flux and rejection of the newly developed tfn membranes at 15 bar are 57 65 3 26 lmh and 98 6 0 35 respectively the na cqds incorporated tfn hollow fiber membranes show promising applications in the field of brackish water desalination graphical abstract image 1 keywords na functionalized carbon quantum dots na cqds thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes reverse osmosis ro hollow fiber configuration stabilization 1

lau et al 2015 yin and deng 2015 however most of the aforementioned nanomaterials have relatively large sizes i e several hundred nanometers compared with the thickness of polyamide layers therefore it is difficult to fabricate defect free polyamide layers consisting of uniformly dispersed nanomaterials especially for the tfn membranes with a hollow fiber configuration the tfn membranes incorporated with large size nanoparticles tend to have non selective voids formed between these nanomaterials and the polymer matrices lind et al 2009 therefore the carbon based quantum dots which

further purification deionized di water produced by a milli q ultrapure water system millipore usa was used throughout the experiments 2 2 syntheses and characterizations of cqds and na cqds fig 1 illustrates the synthesis schemes of cqds and na cqds and the details have been elaborated in the literature guo et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 briefly citric acid was grinded into fine powders and then heated in air at 180 c for 3 h in a glass container with a loose cover the semi finished product was cooled down to room temperature and dissolved in di water then dialyzed using slide a lyzer g2 dialysis cassettes 2k mwco against di water the residues after dialysis were freeze dried to produce cqds na cqds were prepared by neutralizing the residues after dialysis with a naoh aqueous solution 5 0 m to a ph value of 8 and then freeze dried the particle size and morphology of cqds and na cqds were characterized using high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem jeol jem 2100f to prepare the samples for tem the cqds and na cqds were firstly dispersed in di water at 0 5 wt then a single drop of the nanoparticle aqueous solution was added onto the carbon coated copper grid 200 mesh then the tem samples were dried at room temperature before characterization fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir vertex 70 bruker usa with a wavenumber range of 4000 500 cm 1 and an x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps kratos axis ultradld spectrometer kratos analytical ltd with a mono al kα x ray source were employed to determinate the functional groups and chemical compositions of cqds and na cqds 2 3 fabrication of porous hollow fiber substrates a dry jet wet spinning process and a dual layer spinneret were employed to fabricate the porous hollow fiber substrates the polymer solution was prepared by dissolving the commercial pes polymer in a mixture of nmp and peg 1 1 followed by adding a small amount of di water into the homogenous polymer solution subsequently the di water polymer solution and nmp were fed into the inner middle and outer channels of the dual layer spinneret respectively to produce the inner selective hollow fiber substrates the details of polymer solution preparation and hollow fiber spinning could be found elsewhere zhang et al 2014 after being immersed in tap water for 2 days and a 50 wt glycerol aqueous solution for another 2 days followed by air drying in room temperature for 2 days the prepared hollow fiber substrates were made into small lab scale modules each module comprised three pieces of hollow fiber substrates with a length of about 14 cm 2 4 fabrication of tfc and tfn hollow fiber membranes a thin selective polyamide layer was deposited on top of the inner surface of each hollow fiber substrate via interfacial polymerization for the conventional tfc membranes a 2 wt mpd aqueous solution comprising 0 1 wt sds was firstly introduced into the lumen of the substrates for 3 min at a flow rate of 4 25 ml min then followed by air purging through the lumen for 5 min in order to strip away the excessive mpd solution subsequently a tmc hexane solution of 0 15 wt was introduced into the lumen of the substrates for 5 min at a flow rate of 2 50 ml min to react with the mpd monomer then followed by air purging through the lumen of the substrates for 1 min to strip away the excessive tmc solution for the tfn membranes comprising cqds or na cqds in the polyamide layers the nanomaterials were added into the mpd aqueous solutions at 1 wt following the same procedures as those for the conventional tfc membranes the resultant tfn membranes were denoted as tfn cqds 1 and tfn na cqds 1 respectively where 1 means 1 wt cqds or na cqds in the mpd aqueous solutions after interfacial polymerization the prepared lab scale modules comprising tfc and tfn membranes were left in air overnight and then immersed in di water for at least one day before the tests 2 5 characterizations of tfc and tfn hollow fiber membranes to study the differences between the conventional tfc membranes and the tfn membranes incorporated with cqds and na cqds various characterization techniques were utilized prior to the characterizations the membranes were taken out from the lab scale modules and immersed in di water for at least one day to remove the potential contaminants before being freeze dried field emission scanning electronic microscopy fesem jeol jsm 6700 was used to observe their morphology the membrane samples for fesem observation were fractured in liquid nitrogen and coated with platinum using a joel jfc 1100e ion sputtering device atomic force microscopy afm nanoscope iiia digital instrument usa was utilized to determine their mean roughness ra root mean square roughness rq and effective surface area with a scan size of 5 μm 5 μm under a tapping mode in air x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps kratos axis ultradld spectrometer kratos analytical ltd with a mono al kα x ray source was employed to study the chemical compositions of their polyamide layers 2 6 performance tests of tfc and tfn hollow fiber membranes the performance of the tfc and tfn membranes was evaluated in terms of pure water permeability pwp or a l m 2 h 1 bar lmh bar salt permeability b l m 2 h 1 lmh water flux j w l m 2 h 1 lmh and solute rejection r using lab scale modules comprising three pieces of hollow fiber membranes with an effective area of about 8 cm2 the experimental setup used in this work was modified from the setup reported elsewhere zhang et al 2014 one of the two pre determined stabilization pressures i e 15 bar or 23 bar had been applied for 1 h before the membrane performance was evaluated at 15 bar membrane performance under the same stabilization condition i e 15 bar was compared to study the effects of the incorporation of cqds and na cqds membrane performance under different stabilization conditions i e 15 bar vs 23 bar was compared to study the effects of high pressure stabilization on the separation performance of hollow fiber membranes the pressure of 23 bar was chosen because the burst pressure of these membranes was 25 bar which was determined by elevating the hydraulic pressure in their lumen until the hollow fiber membranes collapsed to measure pwp di water was pumped into the lumen of the lab scale modules at a flow rate of 200 ml min the water permeate at the shell side of hollow fiber membranes was collected at 15 bar after the membranes had been stabilized at 15 bar or 23 bar for 1 h pwp could be calculated using the equation below 1 a δ v a m δ t δ p where δ v l is the volumetric variation of water permeation during a time interval δ t h under a trans membrane pressure of δ p b a r and a m m 2 is the effective membrane area of the lab scale modules to measure the salt permeability water flux and solute rejection a 2000 ppm nacl feed solution was pumped into the lumen of the lab scale modules at a flow rate of 200 ml min and the permeate was collected at 15 bar after the tfc and tfn membranes had been stabilized at 15 bar or 23 bar for 1 h the water flux across the membranes was evaluated using the equation below 2 j w δ v a m δ t the conductivity of the feed and permeate was measured to determine the salt rejection and salt permeability using the equations below 3 r 1 c d p c d f 100 4 b 1 r r δ p δ π a where c d p μ s c m and c d f μ s c m are the conductivity of the permeate and feed solution respectively δ π is the osmotic pressure difference across the membranes 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of cqds and na cqds fig 2 displays the tem images of both cqds and na cqds they are well dispersed without agglomeration and have a nearly spherical shape with a similar size range between 2 and 6 nm fig 3 shows the surface chemistry of cqds and na cqds investigated by ft ir the wide absorption around 3300 cm 1 and the absorption at 1690 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of the hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups existing in cqds respectively interestingly the absorption of the carboxyl groups of na cqds shifts to 1551 cm 1 which is in consistent with the literature pan et al 2017 the existence of these hydrophilic oxygen containing groups in cqds and na cqds make them highly hydrophilic table 1 summarizes the chemical compositions of cqds and na cqds analyzed by xps both cqds and na cqds have high oxygen content indicating the existence of large amounts of hydrophilic oxygen containing groups which is in consistent with the ft ir analyses the na content in na cqds is 12 9 while there is no na existing in cqds not only the existence of oxygen containing groups but also the existence of sodium imparts the na cqds with excellent hydrophilicity which makes them highly dispersible in aqueous solutions 3 2 physicochemical changes due to cqds and na cqds incorporation fesem was empolyed to study the effects of cqds and na cqds incorporation on the morphology of polyamide layers fig 4 compares the cross section and surface morphology of the polyamide layers of the tfc and tfn membranes as shown in fig 4 a1 and b1 the conventional tfc membrane has a polyamide layer apparently as an independent layer on top of the porous substrate with a thickness of around 426 nm and a typical ridge and valley surface morphology han et al 2013 sun and chung 2013 wan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in contrast the polyamide layer of the tfn membrane incorporated with cqds i e tfn cqds 1 not only could be hardly distinguished as an extra layer from the substrate due to the significantly decreased thickness fig 4 a2 but also has a much smoother nodular like surface morphology fig 4 b2 the cause for the decreased thickness and smoother surface may result from the acidic properties of cqds in other words the ph value of the as synthesized cqds aqueous solution before being freeze dried is about 2 the addition of cqds into the mpd aqueous solution causes a drop in ph value from about 8 9 to 5 under this circumstance the acid groups of cqds may react with the mpd monomer which results in a decrease in the available amount of amine groups for interfacial polymerization in addition the h generated from the ionization of carboxyl groups tends to inhibit the reaction between mpd and tmc monomers whose byproduct is hcl fathizadeh et al 2019 shen et al 2016 2017 as a result the acidic mpd solution comprising cqds tends to have a lower degree of reaction with the tmc solution forming a nodular like polyamide selective layer with a smaller thickness and roughness interestingly the typical ridge and valley morphology re appears on the polyamide layer of the tfn membrane incorporated with na cqds i e tfn na cqds 1 and the polyamide layer could be again distinguished as an independent layer on top of the substrate with a thickness of about 343 nm as illustrated in fig 4 a3 and b3 a comparison of its surface morphology with that of the conventional tfc membrane the former has more and broader leaves than the latter as a result the tfn na cqds 1 has a polyamide layer with the highest roughness among the three kinds of membranes this morphological change is mainly due to the effects of na cqds incorporation during the interfacial polymerization process usually mpd molecules in the aqueous phase tend to diffuse across the interface to react with tmc molecules the diffusion of mpd would slow down gradually due to the formation of a nascent polyamide network when the polyamide network becomes dense and thick enough it would stop the mpd diffusion and terminate the interfacial polymerization the addition of na cqds into the mpd aqueous solution induces additional interstitial space among the nascent polyamide network and results in more mpd diffusing towards the organic phase and reacting with tmc as a result the polyamide layer of tfn na cqds 1 has more and broader leaves formed on its surface accompanying with a decreased thickness table 2 summarizes the roughness and effective surface area of the polyamide layers measured by afm consistent with the observations from fesem images the polyamide layer of tfn cqds 1 has a lower roughness than the conventional tfc membrane due to the lower degree of reaction between the acidic mpd solution and the tmc solution while the polyamide layer of tfn na cqds 1 has a higher roughness than the conventional tfc membrane due to the diffusion of more mpd to react with tmc in terms of effective surface area the polyamide layer of tfn cqds 1 has the smallest one because it possesses a nodular like morphology instead of the typical ridge and valley morphology observed for the conventional tfc membrane and tfn na cqds 1 since tfn na cqds 1 has a polyamide layer with more and broader leaves on its surface than the conventional tfc membrane the former has an effective surface area 21 0 larger than the latter i e 46 1 μm2 vs 38 1 μm2 it is widely believed that the higher roughness would benefit the water transport across the membranes due to the larger effective surface area leading to a higher water permeability and flux ghosh and hoek 2009 hirose et al 1996 ren et al 2017 sun et al 2014 yao et al 2007 table 3 shows the xps results reflecting the effects of cqds and na cqds incorporation on the chemical compositions of polyamide layers both tfn cqds 1 and tfn na cqds 1 have slightly higher o content and o c ratio in their polyamide layers than the conventional tfc membrane due to the incorporation of highly oxygen containing cqds and na cqds the higher o content and o c ratio imply that the polyamide layers of tfn membranes have more hydrophilic oxygen containing groups in their surface which may potentially benefit the water transport across the membranes besides the incorporation of cqds and na cqds would also affect the n content of the polyamide layers since both cqds and na cqds have no n content the addition of them into the polyamide layers tend to decrease the n content of both tfn cqds 1 and tfn na cqds 1 due to the dilution effect however a comparison of n content among these three membranes shows tfn na cqds 1 conventional tfc tfn cqds 1 the higher n content of tfn na cqds 1 could be regarded as an indicator for the enhanced degree of reaction between mpd and tmc monomers interestingly this sequence is exactly the same as the orders of roughness and effective surface area these results are in consistent with our hypotheses about how the addition of cqds and na cqds influences the interfacial polymerization reaction between mpd and tmc monomers due to the relatively low amount of na content in na cqds the na content in the polyamide layer could be hardly detected by xps 3 3 performance changes due to cqds and na cqds incorporation in this section the water permeate across membranes was collected at 15 bar after the hollow fiber membranes had been stabilized at 15 bar for 1 h to determine the effects of cqds and na cqds incorporation on membrane performance fig 5 summarizes the pwp a and salt permeability b of the conventional tfc membrane and cqds and na cqds incorporated tfn membranes the a and b values of the conventional tfc membrane are 1 74 lmh bar and 0 58 lmh respectively after the incorporation of cqds into the polyamide layer the a value of tfn cqds 1 decreases to 1 21 lmh bar due to the dramatic decrease in both membrane roughness and effective surface area while its b value maintains as the same as that of the conventional tfc membrane in contrast the a value of tfn na cqds 1 increases to 2 56 lmn bar accompanying with a slight increase in the b value to 0 86 lmh compared to the conventional tfc membrane the 47 1 increase in the a value may arise from the physicochemical changes happened to the polyamide layer as a result of na cqds incorporation such as a decreased membrane thickness an increased effective surface area more hydrophilic oxygen containing groups and an increased interstitial space among the polyamide chains table 4 compares the water fluxes and solute rejections of the conventional tfc membrane and cqds and na cqds incorporated tfn membranes for brackish water desalination using a 2000 ppm nacl aqueous solution as the feed the conventional tfc membrane has a water flux and solute rejection of 24 25 lmh and 97 7 respectively similar to the effects of cqds and na cqds incorporation on the a values the water flux of tfn cqds 1 drops to 16 95 lmh while that of tfn na cqds 1 dramatically jumps to 34 86 lmh which is a 43 8 increment compared with the conventional tfc membrane meanwhile the nacl rejection of tfn cqds 1 decreases to 96 7 due to the combined effects of the enlarged interstitial space among polyamide chains and the decreased degree of reaction between mpd and tmc monomers in contrast although the incorporation of na cqds into the polyamide layer would also enlarge the interstitial space among polyamide chains its negative effects on nacl rejection could be compensated by the positive effects induced by the increased degree of reaction between mpd and tmc as a result tfn na cqds 1 has the same nacl rejection as the conventional tfc membrane which means that the incorporation of 1 wt na cqds into the polyamide layer does not induce any significant defects 3 4 advantages of the hollow fiber configuration for brackish water desalination in this section the water permeate across membranes was still collected at 15 bar while a higher stabilization pressure had been applied to hollow fiber membranes so that the effects of high pressure stabilization on separation performance can be illustrated fig 6 shows the a and b values tested at 15 bar after the hollow fiber membranes had been stabilized at 23 bar for 1 h a higher stabilization pressure would not change the effects of cqds and na cqds incorporation on membrane performance so the general trends of a and b values in fig 6 are almost as the same as those in fig 5 tfn na cqds 1 has the highest a value of 4 27 lmh bar a comparison between figs 5 and 6 indicates that the stabilization at 23 bar instead of 15 bar makes the a values jump 68 4 63 6 and 66 8 for the conventional tfc tfn cqds 1 and tfn na cqds 1 membranes respectively the dramatic enhancement may be explainable by the deformation of hollow fiber membranes under a high hydraulic pressure due to the polymeric nature and self support configuration a hollow fiber membrane would experience a certain degree of circumferential expansion if there is a high hydraulic pressure applied in its lumen this expansion would not only stretch the polyamide layer circumferentially but also decrease the membrane thickness and tortuosity gai et al 2016 as a result the area of the membrane inner surface is increased and the length and resistance for water transport are reduced both factors would benefit water transport across the membranes leading to a higher pure water permeability i e a value interestingly the membranes stabilized at 23 bar have almost comparable salt permeability i e b values with the membranes stabilized at 15 bar which means that the stabilization of hollow fiber membranes at a high hydraulic pressure does not induce any significant defects on the polyamide layer table 4 also summaries the water fluxes and solute rejections tested at 15 bar after the hollow fiber membranes had been stabilized at 23 bar for 1 h similar to the changes in a values the water fluxes of all membranes increase about 60 after being stabilized at a higher hydraulic pressure among them tfn na cqds 1 still has the highest water flux of 57 65 lmh with a nacl rejection of 98 6 for brackish water desalination what s more the solute rejections of all three membranes improve slightly from 97 7 to 98 7 96 7 to 97 8 and 97 7 to 98 6 for the conventional tfc tfn cqds 1 and tfn na cqds 1 respectively this may result from the radial compaction of the polyamide layers under a higher stabilization pressure in conclusion high pressure stabilization could significantly enhance the water flux and slightly improve the solute rejection of hollow fiber membranes since the deformation under a high hydraulic pressure could improve the separation performance of hollow fiber membranes significantly while deteriorate the separation performance of flat sheet membranes li et al 2013 the hollow fiber configuration may be more attractive than flat sheet membranes to achieve the optimal performance of tfc and tfn membranes for the low pressure ro process 4 conclusions a novel tfn hollow fiber membrane has been developed by incorporating na cqds into the polyamide layer via interfacial polymerization for brackish water desalination the newly developed tfn membrane shows a significantly higher water flux than the conventional tfc membrane with a comparable nacl rejection the performance enhancement arises from the morphological and composition changes of the polyamide layer as a result of na cqds incorporation such as a thinner polyamide layer a larger effective surface area more hydrophilic oxygen containing groups and an enlarged interstitial space among the polyamide chains these physiochemical changes may also influence the antifouling property of the membranes and we will examine it in our future work in addition after the high pressure stabilization the tfn hollow fiber membrane would have a stretched polyamide layer with an expanded inner surface area and a decreased water transport length and resistance by taking advantages of these unique features of hollow fiber configuration the optimal tfn na cqds 1 hollow fiber membrane has a water flux of 57 65 lmh with a nacl rejection of 98 6 using a 2000 ppm nacl aqueous solution as the feed declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to
