18950,dunaliella salina is a green microalgae species industrially exploited for its capacity to produce important amounts of carotenoid pigments however in low nitrogen conditions in which they produce these pigments their concentration is low which results in harvesting difficulties and high costs in this work we propose a new solution to efficiently harvest d salina at the pre industrial scale using flocculation flotation harvesting induced by naoh addition in the medium we first show using numerical simulations and nanoscale atomic force spectroscopy experiments that sweeping mechanism in formed magnesium hydroxide precipitate is only responsible for d salina flocculation in hypersaline culture medium upon naoh addition based on this understanding of the flocculation mechanism we then evaluate the influence of several parameters related to naoh mixing and magnesium hydroxide precipitation and show that naoh concentration mixing and salinity of the medium can be optimized to achieve high flocculation flotation harvesting efficiencies in laboratory scale experiments we finally successfully scale up the data obtained at lab scale to a continuous pre industrial flotation pilot and achieve up to 80 of cell recovery this interdisciplinary study thus provides original results from the nano to the pre industrial scale which allow the successful development of an efficient large scale d salina harvesting process we thus anticipate our results to be the starting point for further optimization and industrial use of this flocculation flotation harvesting technique graphical abstract image 1 keywords dunaliella salina harvesting flocculation flotation atomic force microscopy 1 introduction microalgae are receiving increasing attention worldwide as an alternative and renewable source of energy because of their eminent oil producing capacity pragya et al 2013 but the potential of microalgae is in fact even greater and they also represent an important source of biomass and of molecules of interest for the fields of food feed or health indeed microalgae are unique microorganisms which convert light energy water and inorganic nutrients into biomass resource rich in value added products such as lipids carbohydrates proteins and pigments minhas et al 2016 pragya et al 2013 among the wide diversity of microalgae metting 1996 dunaliella salina a halotolerant green microalgae is among the species currently industrially exploited as it is one of the most important producer of natural β carotene pigments pirwitz et al 2015 ambati et al 2018 because of this specificity d salina has been the subject of many studies dedicated to the optimization of its culture conditions prieto et al 2011 kim et al 2012 khadim et al 2018 béchet et al 2018 and of its harvesting besson and guiraud 2013 pirwitz et al 2015 xiong et al 2015 moreover other studies have showed the utility of this microalgae species in genetic and metabolic engineering feng et al 2014 anila et al 2016 and also recently in concrete biomedical applications for example to reduce tumor growth in mice srinivasan et al 2017 however under β carotene production culture conditions nitrogen deficiency conditions d salina reaches low cell concentrations which thus has consequences on the energy input and overall cost of their separation from water in industrial processes in a general manner several methods can be used for microalgae harvesting including centrifugation filtration flocculation and flotation garg et al 2012 however most of these methods are synonymous with high costs and energy consumption often for low efficiency rates for example centrifugation the most commonly used method consumes a large amount of energy and can cause damages to the cells because of high shear forces pragya et al 2013 filtration involves using membranes which in the case of microalgae separation can get clogged because of the small size of the cells and or of the exopolysaccharides they secrete resulting in high operating costs uduman et al 2010 as for flocculation it seems to be a promising low cost approach for large scale harvesting however contamination is a major issue in this technique as the chemical flocculants classically used to induce flocculation end up in the harvested biomass and can interfere with the final application of the biomass food or feed vandamme et al 2013 in this context flotation is believed to be a promising harvesting technique that takes advantage of microalgae s natural low density and self floating tendency garg et al 2012 assisted flotation consists in air or gas transformed into bubbles rising through a microalgae suspension as a result microalgae cells get attached to bubbles and are carried out and accumulated on the surface thus flotation allows for low cost cell harvesting without necessarily using flocculants that could damage the cells in addition it is a relatively rapid operation which needs low space and has moderate operational costs however as both the surface of microalgae and bubbles present a negative charge in aqueous medium yang et al 2001 garg et al 2015 and given the low hydrophobicity of microalgae cells the interactions between cells and bubbles are repulsive which prevents adhesion and thus capture and flotation resulting in the poor efficiency of this harvesting technique among the possible strategies to enhance flotation efficiency natural auto flocculation is an interesting alternative there are several known auto flocculation mechanisms among which one is based on the precipitation of magnesium ions into magnesium hydroxide at high ph sukenik and shelef 1984 such increased ph in the culture medium can result either from the photosynthesis activity of the cells or from the direct addition of oh then the flocculation of the cells can occur through charge neutralization i e through the interaction between the positively charged formed magnesium hydroxide precipitates and cells through sweeping where cells are entrapped in the massive precipitation of the magnesium hydroxide in the medium or both vandamme et al 2013 auto flocculation of cells at high ph using naoh addition has already been described for different microalgae species such as chlorella vulgaris wu et al 2012 or phaeodactylum tricornutum wu et al 2012 vandamme et al 2015 formosa dague et al 2018 and has been showed to occur by both sweeping flocculation and charge neutralization in the case of d salina a previous study that we conducted in 2013 showed that addition of naoh was necessary to increase the ph in the medium and that further flocculation was caused by sweeping of the cells by forming magnesium hydroxide precipitate besson and guiraud 2013 in the experimental conditions used in this study the more naoh was added the more magnesium hydroxide was precipitated and the more efficient the flocculation was a cell recovery up to 100 could be achieved using further flotation the results obtained also showed that the naoh flow rate had no influence on the flocculation and further flotation recovery however they suggested that the type of injection of naoh and thus its mixing in the medium and the speed of magnesium hydroxide precipitation could have an influence in the final harvesting efficiency in the work presented here we will first evidence the only contribution of sweeping mechanism in the flocculation of cells induced by the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide at high ph and exclude the role of charge neutralization for that we will first simulate the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide in the medium as a function of the naoh concentration to understand the behavior of the culture medium during flocculation then we will use recent developments made in the team that consist in using atomic force microscopy afm binnig et al 1986 to probe the interactions between microalgae cells and particles formosa dague et al 2018 for that afm tips functionalized with magnesium hydroxides particles will be used in force spectroscopy experiments to measure directly at the piconewton scale the interactions between these particles and the cells then knowing precisely the flocculation mechanism at play we will be able to optimize parameters to harvest in the most effective possible way d salina cells at laboratory scale but also at pre industrial scales suspension flow rate 0 6 m3 h for that we will complete our previous study and determine the role of naoh mixing in the medium by testing different injection types agitation and medium salinity and by evaluating their effects on the flocculation flotation recovery of the cells at laboratory scale based on these results and their interpretation we will adapt and optimize an injection system to efficiently flocculate and harvest cells by flotation in a pre industrial continuous cultivation system this way we will provide a cost effective solution to efficiently harvest low concentrated d salina cells at industrial scales thus contributing to the industrial valorization of this β carotene rich biomass 2 material and methods 2 1 strain and culture conditions dunaliella salina strain ccap19 25 culture collection of algae and protozoa was cultivated in dechlorinated tap water containing the following nacl 107 g l mgso4 7h2o 4 8 g l mgcl2 6h2o 4 0 g l cacl2 1 1 g l kcl 0 1 g l a complete nutritive conway medium without silicates walne 1970 was also added the salinity of this synthetic water is of 10 the ionic strength of 2 3 this medium was used for all the experiments performed in laboratory it mimics the medium resulting from the evaporation of see water in which d salina can grow with a limited competition from other microorganisms used in pre industrial scale cultures a d salina strain isolated from saline ponds in gruissan occitanie france was also used to evaluate the influence of the strain on the harvesting efficiencies laboratory scale cultures for afm experiments cells were cultivated at 20 c under agitation 120 rpm in 75 ml non coated culture flasks 15 ml of culture and 500 ml non coated culture flasks 150 ml of culture the incubator was equipped with white neon light tubes providing illumination of approximately 40 μmol photons m 2 s 1 with a photoperiod of 12 h light 12 h dark for flotation experiments d salina culture was achieved in 10 l glass photobioreactors the culture was continuously agitated by the gentle bubbling of 0 2 μm filtered atmospheric air 2 l min illumination was provided by daylight fluorescent tubes osram fq 965 biolux with a photoperiod of 16 h light 8 h dark the temperature of the culture was regulated by air conditioning at 21 3 c pre industrial scale cultures the pre industrial experimental site of the salinalgue research project 2010 2014 was located in a salt marsh on the mediterranean sea coast at gruissan occitanie france latitude 43 094 n longitude 3 084 e as fully described in béchet et al 2018 briefly cultures were achieved in 4 outdoor raceways of 250 m2 containing between 30 and 100 m3 see water concentrated by sun evaporation salinity of 12 and disinfected with bleach fed the raceways before being inoculated the raceways were mixed by paddle wheels and by suspension pumping which was also used to limit the ph to 7 4 by a monitored addition of dissolved co2 in the recirculated suspension 2 2 precipitation model for hydroxide magnesium in the culture medium used the concentration of magnesium hydroxide calcium carbonate and dolomite were modeled as a function of the added naoh concentration in the culture medium to do so we simulated the naoh addition effects and developed a numerical model using the software phreeqc based on the pitzer equations to simulate the precipitate formation in our culture medium indeed in order to assess the equilibrium state of hypersaline solutions in which d salina is grown and understand the precipitation phenomena involved during naoh addition it is necessary to evaluate the activity of species in solution this requires the evaluation of coefficients of activity which take into account the various ionic interactions in these complex environments the models for calculating these activity coefficients are generally based on the coupling of the debye hückel debye and hückel 1923 theory translating electrostatic ionic interactions and of the theory of the ionic association that takes into account ionic interactions at short distances these models are well suited for solutions with ionic strength that does not exceed the one of regular seawater ionic strength of 0 7 but since the culture of d salina is carried out in a hypersaline environment the ionic forces encountered in its culture medium exceed the areas of validity of the different ion association models for a 10 salinity culture medium the ionic strength is of 2 3 therefore the models obtained with these theoretical descriptions of saltwater thermodynamics are not satisfactory for concentrated saline water in the case of d salina it was thus necessary to implement other types of models known as specific ion interaction models such as the one proposed by pitzer the pitzer model is based on a different thermodynamic approach and is well suited to evaluate the thermodynamic properties of hypersaline solutions the model used is based on the pitzer equations and allows to simulate the ionic equilibria during the injection of naoh in our culture medium the models developed by pitzer pitzer 1973 1975 pitzer and mayorga 1973 1974 pitzer and kim 1974 describes the specific ionic interactions of diverse species in complex media at high ionic strength for pure components this model uses the parameters given by pitzer and mayorga 1973 1974 the asymmetric mixing parameters come from pitzer and kim pitzer and kim 1974 pitzer 1975 the whole set of parameters were validated and listed by harvie et al 1984 the relevant database being pitzer dat this database accounts for the significant elements for mediterranean see water nakmgcahcls o cfemnbasrblibr with a large spectrum of possible precipitates before its application for the simulations presented here the model has been successfully besson 2013 compared to the experimental results of sea water evaporation proposed by baseggio 1974 the composition of the culture medium used for the simulations table 1 was entered using a temperature of 25 c and a total dissolved carbon concentration of 0 00021 mol kg water 2 3 flotation experiments due to the small size of the microalgae dissolved air flotation daf was used to harvest d salina after naoh induced flocculation fig 1 presents the daf devices used in this study laboratory scale a detailed presentation of the laboratory scale flotation experiments can be found in besson guiraud besson and guiraud 2013 daf experiments were performed in a multiplace orchidis fth3 flottatest three flotation test beakers were run simultaneously in which 600 ml samples were collected from the algal culture and added to each beaker then naoh was added in the case of direct naoh injection x ml of naoh at a concentration of 1m was added to the microalgae suspension as well as 100 x ml of distilled water in the case of the diluted naoh injection a unique solution containing x ml of naoh at a concentration of 1m and 100 x ml of distilled water was added to the microalgae suspension the volume of naoh x added was calculated depending on the final concentration wanted this procedure is presented in fig 4a the depressurization at atmospheric pressure of 200 ml of culture medium free of algae and saturated by air at 6 bars for 15 min induced the formation of microbubbles the recycle ratio pressurized culture medium volume initial sample volume was of 33 for flocculation the concentration of the added naoh solution was calculated taking into account the volume of the culture and the volume of the added white waters so that the ph does not change upon addition of the white waters pre industrial scale the pre industrial daf system was adapted from the cy1 flotation unit proposed by serinol bram occitanie france and is presented in fig 1 built in 316 l stainless steel to avoid corrosion by suspensions at high salinity this continuous cylindrical 0 6 m of diameter daf separation equipment with a conical bottom works as an airlift a cylindrical clifford delimits the ascending contact zone where the suspension to be treated and the white waters containing bubbles mix at the periphery the descending annular separation zone is equipped with a vertical lamellar packing to keep the flow as quiet as possible the nominal descending flow velocity is of 4 0 m h the flotation tank volume is of 600 l and its maximum flow capacity is of 1 m3 h the floated microalgae are mechanically removed from the tank surface by a tunable rotating scrapper salted waters identical to the culture medium or recycled from the harvesting are continuously pressurized at 6 bars by a centrifugal pump and saturated with air within a pressurization tank white waters are produced by passing this pressurized solution through a needle valve the microbubble size distribution was measured by laser diffraction sizer malvern spraytec most of the bubbles produced in these saline waters have a diameter smaller than 60 μm besson and guiraud 2012 naoh solutions at different concentrations in distilled water were added at different injection places on the supply line at a controlled flow injection using a peristaltic pump given that the microalgae suspension flow rate is of 300 l h and the final naoh concentration is of 0 02 mol l if a naoh solution of 0 1 mol l is injected the flowrate is of 66 l h and if a naoh solution of 0 2 mol l is injected the flowrate is of 0 33 l h flowrates were measured thanks to khrone optif lux 4100 electromagnetic flowmeters for the operating conditions microalgae suspensions were extracted from the external raceways using a peristaltic pump into the flotation unit simultaneously the pressurization system was launched and the naoh solutions were injected on the supply line the scrapping of the microalgae started as soon as the pressurization system was launched after 1 h at constant operating parameters three times the time of the continuous state setting samples required to quantify the separation efficiency treated suspension were harvested the harvesting efficiency was then quantified as described below 2 4 harvesting efficiency quantification harvesting efficiency quantification is based on optical density measurements the harvesting efficiency represents the quantity of algae floated compared to the quantity in the initial suspension it was evaluated using the following equation e 1 od a v a od i v i 100 where odi and vi are the initial optical density at 800 nm and the volume of algal suspension before naoh addition and flotation oda and va are the optical density at 800 nm of the aqueous phase and the volume of the aqueous phase after injection of pressurized water 2 5 zeta potential measurements the global electrical properties of d salina cell surface were assessed by measuring the electrophoretic mobility which corresponds to the velocity of suspended cells exposed to an electric field to this end microalgae were harvested by centrifugation 1500 rpm 3 min washed two times in sorbitol buffer 375 mm at ph 10 and resuspended in the same buffer at a final concentration of 1 5 106 cell ml using this procedure electrolytes present in the culture medium do not interfere and only the surface charge of the cells is measured the electrophoretic mobility was then measured using an automated laser zetameter zetasizer nanozs malvern instruments cell suspensions coming from 2 independent cultures were analyzed 2 6 afm tip functionalization with hydroxides to prepare functionalized afm with mg oh 2 mlct auwh bruker tips were first dipped into a thin layer of uv curable glue noa63 norland edmund optics then into a thin layer of mg oh 2 particles sigma aldrich deposited on a glass slide functionalized tips were then put under uv light for 10 min to allow the glue to cure 2 7 afm imaging and force spectroscopy experiments before afm experiments cells were harvested by centrifugation 1500 rpm 10 min and washed two times in sorbitol buffer 375 mm at ph 10 this salt free buffer is used for force spectroscopy experiments as it allows to accurately measure interactions between the cells and magnesium hydroxide particles functionalized on the afm tips without introducing a bias from electrolytes present in d salina culture medium moreover the sorbitol present in this buffer keeps the cells from exploding because of the osmotic pressure finally the ph of 10 allows to reproduce the conditions in which the cells are during flocculation induced by addition of naoh cells were then immobilized on polyethylenimine pei sigma p3143 coated glass slide prepared as previously described francius et al 2008 briefly freshly oxygen activated glass slides were covered by a 0 2 pei solution in deionized water and left for incubation overnight then the glass slides were rinsed with deionized water and dried under nitrogen a total of 1 ml of cell suspension was then deposited on the pei slides allowed to stand for 30 min at room temperature and rinsed with sorbitol buffer 375 mm at ph 10 for force spectroscopy experiments mlct auwh bruker cantilevers with a nominal spring constant of 0 01 n m functionalized with hydroxides or not were used at a constant applied force of 0 25 nn the cantilevers spring constants were determined using the thermal noise method hutter and bechhoefer 1993 before each experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation modeling and afm force spectroscopy confirm that d salina is flocculated by sweeping in magnesium hydroxide precipitate at high ph in our previous study in 2013 besson and guiraud 2013 our work evidenced the positive effect of naoh addition on the flocculation of d salina our main results showed indeed an increase in the harvesting efficiency with the addition of naoh into the medium up to 80 of cell recovery while the hypothesis that the flocculation occurred through sweeping in magnesium hydroxide precipitate could be formulated notably thanks to ions chromatography experiments performed on the suspension before and after flocculation flotation no proof of this mechanism were brought the first part of this study thus focus on providing a full understanding of the naoh induced flocculation mechanism for that we first assessed the equilibrium state of the hypersaline solutions in which d salina is grown to understand the precipitation phenomena involved when flocculating this microalgae using naoh addition for that we used the model described in section 2 2 elaborated from the pitzer model to successfully simulate the influence of the addition of naoh on the ionic equilibria in our culture medium described in table 1 results are presented in fig 2 on this graph the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 is plotted as a function of the added naoh concentration the resulting ph as well as two other precipitate candidate concentrations are also presented even if the measure of ph in hypersaline solutions with a high ionic strength presents some problems the simulated ph profile is similar to experimental measurements as the one showed in our previous study besson and guiraud 2013 the ph sharply increases until the beginning of the precipitation of the magnesium hydroxide then it continues to slightly increase until the end of the mg oh 2 precipitation that is to say when all the mg present in the solution is used thus this shows that upon addition of naoh magnesium hydroxide precipitation increases until reaching a maximum for a naoh concentration between 0 08 and 0 1 mol kg of water while calcium carbonate precipitation remains non significant thus we can conclude from this simulation that the hypothesis made in our previous study stating that flocculation of d salina at increased ph under hypersaline conditions at least results from the precipitation of only magnesium hydroxide at high ph among a great number of other possible salts is correct while this precipitation creates a gel that entraps the cells and flocculate them through sweeping the question is now to know if charge neutralization is also involved in this flocculation mechanism thus to have a full understanding of it to answer this question we used afm and performed force spectroscopy experiments using functionalized tips with magnesium hydroxides particles in this type of experiments the afm tip is moved towards the surface until touching it and then retracted if an interaction takes place between the tip and the sample upon retraction the tip will bend until the force applied is higher than the force of the interaction and the interaction breaks the tip then goes back to its initial position which is materialized on afm retract force curves as a peak referred to as retract adhesion the results of these experiments are presented in fig 3 they show in the case of bare afm tips no adhesion between the tip and the cells as seen on the retract force curves which present no retract adhesions fig 3a and b n 2400 curves recorded on 6 cells from 2 independent cultures in the case of tips functionalized by magnesium hydroxides fig 3c and d force curves also show no retract adhesions thus demonstrating that hydroxide particles do not interact with cells n 3200 curves recorded on 8 cells coming from 2 independent cultures with 7 different mg oh 2 tips note that in order to avoid any interaction between electrolytes in the medium and the afm tips experiments were performed in a salt free buffer at ph 10 to make sure only the interactions between the cells and the tips are probed as no interactions were probed in this buffer it is then evident that in the hypersaline waters in which d salina grows these interactions do not occur neither given the high quantity of charged ions that can screen both cells and mg oh 2 particles charges to give an explanation to this absence of interactions between the cells and mg oh 2 particles we then performed zeta potential measurements of d salina cells in the same salt free buffer at high ph ph 10 and measured a surface charge of 15 4 0 9 mv n 8 measurements on cell suspensions coming from 2 independent cultures thus the cells do not present a sufficient negative surface charge in our conditions and do not interact with the positive surface of magnesium hydroxide lin and wang 2009 therefore thanks to these simulations and afm experiments we are able to confirm the hypothesis we made in our previous study and show that addition of naoh in the culture medium precipitates only magnesium hydroxide this precipitation results in the formation of a gel that is only responsible for entrapping the cells and flocculating them as afm experiments proved that charge neutralization is not involved in the case of d salina moreover in further experiments that we performed mg oh 2 already formed was directly added to d salina cultures which resulted in no flocculation of the cells thus reinforcing our nanoscale conclusions this is an interesting point as for all the microalgae species for which ph induced flocculation has been described charge neutralization mechanism is always involved sukenik and shelef 1984 wu et al 2012 vandamme et al 2012 2015 nguyen et al 2014 formosa dague et al 2018 branyikova et al 2018 indeed microalgae often have a cell wall composed of lipids proteins and polysaccharides these last ones have a pka of 11 12 when the ph increases in the medium the hydroxyl functions of these polysaccharides are deprotonated which can give the surface a more important negative charge as microalgae are usually grown in waters containing calcium or magnesium ions which precipitate into positively charged particles at high ph then flocculation occur also thanks to the interaction between these particles and the cells however in our case d salina cells do not interact with positively charged magnesium hydroxide indeed dunaliella genus is unique in the absence of a rigid polysaccharidic cell wall cells only present a thin plasma membrane oren 2005 chen and jiang 2009 this thus explains why its surface charge is not more negative at high ph and thus why charge neutralization is not involved in its flocculation mechanisms in presence of magnesium hydroxide thus our results give a full understanding of the mechanism of d salina flocculation at high ph based on these information we can now evaluate the influence of different parameters such as naoh concentration agitation and salinity in order to determine the best possible separation conditions of the cells from the water and provide a solution for high scale harvesting 3 2 magnesium hydroxide precipitation phase is determinant for flocculating the cells because the flocculation of the cells occur only through sweeping the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide is then determinant for the successful flocculation flotation of the cells indeed the precipitation phase must be carried out as homogeneously as possible so that as much of the sample volume as possible is affected by the trapping of microalgae in the precipitate in formation therefore the conditions for adding naoh to the suspension should be adapted to optimize its fast mixing to address this point we performed flocculation flotation experiments using two different injection ways fig 4a reaching the same final naoh concentration in the first way direct injection naoh 1 mol l and water are directly injected in a flotation unit containing the microalgae suspension in the second way called here diluted injection water and naoh 1 mol l are first mixed into one solution which is further added to the microalgae suspension then in the first case concentrated naoh is delivered locally into the medium and in the second case the local instant concentration of the naoh solution is reduced using these two injection scenarios flocculation flotation harvesting was performed the results presented in fig 4b show a clear increase of the harvesting efficiency in the case of diluted injection for the same final naoh concentration in the microalgae suspension black filled symbols for example at 0 02 mol l of final naoh concentration the harvesting efficiency using direct injection is of almost 30 whereas using the diluted injection system it reaches up to 90 indeed in the case of direct injection a high quantity of concentrated naoh is locally delivered in the solution thus the speed of precipitation is increased but only concerns a local area of the suspension therefore in this case only the cells present in this area can be entrapped during the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide in the case of the diluted injection the low local concentration allows for a slower precipitation which then has time to occur in the entire or at least a larger volume of the microalgae suspension leading to the entrapment of more cells this phenomena is further illustrated in fig 4c for a final naoh concentration in the microalgae suspension of 0 02 mol l the more diluted the added naoh solution is the more efficient the harvesting is indeed for an added naoh solution of 0 1 mol l the flocculation flotation cell recovery reaches 80 while for naoh solutions higher than 0 5 mol l the harvesting efficiency is reduced to 20 the results of these experiments then prove that the local concentration of naoh and the phase of the magnesium hydroxide precipitation is determinant for the harvesting efficiency while diluted injection allows lowering this local naoh concentration to optimize the conditions to reach the best cell separation possible other parameters such as the agitation and the salinity quantity of magnesium ions available of the medium should be taken into account as they will thus also influence the harvesting efficiency 3 3 agitation and salinity are parameters that influence harvesting efficiency while diluted injection allows the magnesium hydroxide precipitate to form slowly in the medium agitation of the medium allows for the precipitation phase to sweep the entire microalgae suspension in fig 5 a the effects of different agitation speed on the flocculation flotation harvesting efficiency were measured it is clear on this figure that an increase from 20 to 40 rpm allows increasing by approximately a two fold the cell separation whatever the final naoh concentration in the microalgae suspension however increasing again the agitation speed from 40 to 80 rpm do not show the same effect as the harvesting efficiency in the case of 80 rpm agitation is slightly lower than in the case of 40 rpm this can be explained by the fact that a too fast agitation can change the structure of the flocs formed and thus have consequences on their capture by the bubbles during flotation as for the salinity of the medium to assess its effects on the harvesting efficiency we performed experiments with d salina cells grown in natural seawaters presenting salinities of 7 5 12 and 15 2 using a dilute injection system and an agitation of 40 rpm the results obtained presented in fig 5b show that the more saline the medium is the less efficient the harvesting is whatever the naoh final concentration indeed while high magnesium concentrations found in highly saline media can be thought in the case of sweeping flocculation to enhance harvesting efficiency it is the opposite effect in high saline media the naoh added directly meets high concentrations of magnesium ions which induces a fast precipitation of magnesium hydroxide oh has thus no time to reach the entire volume of the suspension then a high salinity has similar effects than injection of concentrated naoh where only the cells present in the area where fast precipitation of mg oh 2 occurs can be entrapped in the precipitate leading to lower separation rates therefore thanks to these experiments the parameters to reach the best separation rate possible can be optimized while a dilute injection is needed the agitation of the medium must be optimized to allow an efficient mixing of naoh with cells and a mg oh 2 precipitation that reaches the entire volume without having negative effects on the flocs formed as for the salinity of the culture medium it needs to be low enough to avoid supersaturation of magnesium hydroxide precipitation the adequate naoh concentration depending on the salinity in order to make sure that only parameters related to the magnesium hydroxide precipitation have an influence on the harvesting efficiency we also evaluated the influence of the calcium concentration the d salina strain used and the nutritive conditions in which the cells are grown regarding the influence of the calcium concentration in the medium sukenik et al in 1984 have established that the precipitation of calcium and phosphate ions at high ph could induce the flocculation of microalgae cells sukenik and shelef 1984 the conway medium used here to cultivate the cells containing phosphate we thus used waters of different calcium concentrations to evaluate the potential effect of calcium phosphate precipitate on the flocculation of d salina our results supplementary data 1 showed no difference in the harvesting efficiencies thus reinforcing our conclusions on the role of only magnesium hydroxide precipitate in sweeping the cells the influence of the d salina strain and of its nutritive conditions have then also been evaluated and showed that for the two strains we tested the ccap 19 25 and one other d salina strains isolated from saline ponds in france the same flocculation flotation conditions resulted in the same harvesting efficiencies supplementary data 2 regarding the nutritive conditions in which cells are grown we chose to focus on nitrogen deficiency conditions indeed the overproduction of β carotene after nitrogen starvation i e in conditions of unbalanced growth in response to lack of nitrogen is a well documented biological process in d salina lamers et al 2012 bonnefond et al 2017 we thus chose to address this question as the harvesting method we propose here is intended to be used for industrial use our results with cells grown in nitrogen deficient conditions showed no difference in the harvesting efficiencies obtained thus these two last points show that the flocculation flotation method that we focus on in this study when used with the good injection system agitation and salinity of the medium is efficient for different d salina strains in different relevant culture conditions this demonstrates the robustness of this harvesting method and thus the parameters identified naoh injection agitation and salinity can now further be used to develop and adapt a naoh injection system to efficiently flocculate and harvest cells by flotation in a pre industrial continuous cultivation harvesting system 3 4 development of a pre industrial harvesting process of d salina by flocculation flotation in this part of the work the knowledge previously acquired at the laboratory scale is used to harvest d salina cells at high scales for that raceways of 250 m2 were built in gruissan occitanie france and used to cultivate d salina an industrial continuous flotation unit 600 l was adapted and installed on the raceway site to harvest cells using naoh induced flocculation flotation a network of pumps with controlled flow rates were used to collect the cells from the raceway and bring pressurized water into the flotation unit for adapting the flotation unit to the specific conditions of d salina we first faced a technical challenge regarding the size of the bubbles produced in the pilot indeed using a method based on laser light diffraction we evaluated the size of the bubbles produced by daf in d salina culture medium supplementary data 3a these experiments show that in this medium nacl concentration of 107 g l bubbles have a size of approximately 40 μm compared to 60 100 μm in freshwater edzwald 1995 thus the salinity reduces the size of the bubbles which results in the reduction of their ascending velocity while this is not a problem at small scale because the flotation units consist of one small cylinder 1 l of maximum volume with only one entry for the pressurized water at the bottom fig 1a at high scale in a high dimensioned flotation unit presenting descending flow zones it is a problem for instance this flotation unit presents holes at the base of the clifford in order to accentuate the airlift effect and obtain in nominal functioning conditions descending speeds of 4 m h fig 1b we thus roughly calculated the speed of our bubbles considering them as rigid particles obeying the stokes law corrected by oseen oseen 1910 clift et al 1978 and found in our conditions an average bubble ascending velocity comprised between 3 6 and 5 4 m h depending on the contamination degree of their surface 1 and 1 5 mm s supplementary data 3b thus some of the bubbles may not reach the surface and can be aspirated in the flow descending zones of the flotation unit thus adaptations directly on the flotation unit were realized and consisted in decreasing the surface of the holes present at the base of the clifford to decrease the airlift effect and decrease the velocity in these descending flow zones this way the rising velocity of the microbubbles is higher than the velocity in the descending flow zones and thus a functioning similar to what is obtained at the laboratory scale can be provided these adaptations made we then scaled up the naoh induced flocculation flotation process optimized in batch mode at the laboratory scale to a continuous pre industrial scale mode for that given the specific flocculation mechanism of d salina by sweeping it is needed to adapt an injection system that will ensure a good mixing between the cells and the added naoh as it is determinant to efficiently flocculate the cells given the previous results concerning the salinity of the medium these experiments were performed in natural seawater at a salinity of 12 that ensured the growth of the cells in the raceway without presenting precipitation supersaturation problems for the experiments microalgae cultures were injected into the industrial flotation unit as well as pressurized waters through supply lines following the injection system represented in fig 6 a note that in this system the waters used for pressurization are recycled from the flotation unit after microalgae recovery and may contain also some microalgae naoh mixing with microalgae and microbubbles in this system takes place directly in the injection system and is different depending on its location on this injection system for instance in positions 3 and 6 fig 6a mixing will be more efficient than in position 1 and 4 because there the flow rate is the most important and the fluid is already a tri phase fluid culture medium cells and bubbles thus to find the best mixing conditions we chose to inject naoh at of 0 2 mol l final concentration of 0 02 mol l in the microalgae suspension at the different places in the injection system represented in red on the schematic representation in fig 6a after flocculation flotation the harvesting efficiencies were measured results are presented in fig 6b they show that the best cell separation rates of approximately 60 are reached when naoh is injected in the locations 3 and 6 where mixing is the most efficient if naoh is injected into the microalgae supply line the harvesting performance is slightly higher if this injection is made at the outlet of the elbow position 1 where recirculation phenomena occur because of the 90 bend located just upstream of position 1 however these performances do not reach those achieved for a naoh injection in the positions 3 and 6 on the pressurized water supply line the further away the injection is from the confluence with the suspension feed the lower the harvesting efficiency is for instance the harvesting efficiency is significantly reduced when naoh is injected in the position 4 this can be explained by the low presence of microalgae in this pipe the magnesium precipitate needs to be formed in the presence of the cells to best entrap them thus explaining the lower separation efficiencies reached in the pressurized water supply line however in these experiments the maximum harvesting efficiency obtained is of 60 they were realized with a naoh solution at a concentration of 0 2 mol l as showed before best separation rates are obtained for diluted naoh solutions the best efficiencies being achieved in the case of naoh solutions of 0 1 mol l figs 4c and 80 of cell separated from water thus in order to optimize the naoh concentration using a naoh injection in the position 3 in the injection system the experiments were repeated with injected naoh solutions of different concentrations final naoh concentration of 0 02 mol l the results are showed in fig 7 where both the harvesting efficiencies obtained in batch mode at laboratory scale and in continuous mode at pre industrial scale are represented it is clear on this graph that indeed for a solution of naoh of 0 1 mol l the separation rate reaches 80 and decreases as the naoh concentration increases the interesting point is that for both harvesting modes batch or continuous the harvesting efficiencies are the same thus showing the successful scale up of our naoh induced flocculation flotation process therefore we could adapt an efficient injection system allowing to separate in a single pass up to 80 of the cells from their culture medium at high scale and concentrate them by a factor of 230 compared to approximately 20 in laboratory scale experiments this difference in the concentration factor is explained by the fact that in the continuous daf system the rotation velocity of the scrapper which removes floated microalgae and its vertical position in the tank can be tuned in order to adapt the residence time of the foam containing the microalgae at the tank surface during this residence the microalgae concentration increases in the foam due to the liquid drainage by gravity resulting in higher concentration factors compared to lab scale experiments 4 conclusions we provide here an interdisciplinary multi scale study to propose an efficient harvesting method for d salina cells using flocculation flotation which can be used at industrial scales experiments at the nanoscale as well as simulations allowed first to precisely understand the complete mechanism of flocculation by addition of naoh in the complex hypersaline medium in which d salina grows we thus brought strong scientific arguments proving that addition of naoh in the medium creates a magnesium hydroxide precipitate that entraps the cell and flocculate them through sweeping because no other mechanism is involved the formation of this precipitate at low speed in the entire microalgae suspension is determinant for the harvesting efficiency understanding this then led us to evaluate the influence of pertinent parameters to achieve high efficiency harvesting all related to the precipitation of mg oh 2 that are the naoh concentration in the medium the agitation and the salinity of the medium our results in laboratory scale flocculation flotation experiments allowed us to show that the added naoh solution had to be diluted the agitation had to be optimal to bring the naoh in the entire volume without breaking the forming flocs and that too high salinities were resulting in magnesium hydroxide supersaturation phenomena it is based on this understanding of the separation mechanisms and on the identification of the influence of different parameters on the harvesting performances that the transition of the process to the pre industrial scale could be addressed in an efficient way for that we focused on the mixing efficiency at the injection site and the naoh concentration injected to provide optimal parameters and achieve efficient microalgae harvesting at high scale now further studies needs to be done to evaluate with precision the cost and energy consumption of this process at high scale and optimize better flocculation conditions to achieve effective harvesting at lower costs experiments have already been performed in this way using slaked lime as a base to induce the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide our results so far show promising harvesting efficiencies achieved at lower cost as

18950,dunaliella salina is a green microalgae species industrially exploited for its capacity to produce important amounts of carotenoid pigments however in low nitrogen conditions in which they produce these pigments their concentration is low which results in harvesting difficulties and high costs in this work we propose a new solution to efficiently harvest d salina at the pre industrial scale using flocculation flotation harvesting induced by naoh addition in the medium we first show using numerical simulations and nanoscale atomic force spectroscopy experiments that sweeping mechanism in formed magnesium hydroxide precipitate is only responsible for d salina flocculation in hypersaline culture medium upon naoh addition based on this understanding of the flocculation mechanism we then evaluate the influence of several parameters related to naoh mixing and magnesium hydroxide precipitation and show that naoh concentration mixing and salinity of the medium can be optimized to achieve high flocculation flotation harvesting efficiencies in laboratory scale experiments we finally successfully scale up the data obtained at lab scale to a continuous pre industrial flotation pilot and achieve up to 80 of cell recovery this interdisciplinary study thus provides original results from the nano to the pre industrial scale which allow the successful development of an efficient large scale d salina harvesting process we thus anticipate our results to be the starting point for further optimization and industrial use of this flocculation flotation harvesting technique graphical abstract image 1 keywords dunaliella salina harvesting flocculation flotation atomic force microscopy 1 introduction microalgae are receiving increasing attention worldwide as an alternative and renewable source of energy because of their eminent oil producing capacity pragya et al 2013 but the potential of microalgae is in fact even greater and they also represent an important source of biomass and of molecules of interest for the fields of food feed or health indeed microalgae are unique microorganisms which convert light energy water and inorganic nutrients into biomass resource rich in value added products such as lipids carbohydrates proteins and pigments minhas et al 2016 pragya et al 2013 among the wide diversity of microalgae metting 1996 dunaliella salina a halotolerant green microalgae is among the species currently industrially exploited as it is one of the most important producer of natural β carotene pigments pirwitz et al 2015 ambati et al 2018 because of this specificity d salina has been the subject of many studies dedicated to the optimization of its culture conditions prieto et al 2011 kim et al 2012 khadim et al 2018 béchet et al 2018 and of its harvesting besson and guiraud 2013 pirwitz et al 2015 xiong et al 2015 moreover other studies have showed the utility of this microalgae species in genetic and metabolic engineering feng et al 2014 anila et al 2016 and also recently in concrete biomedical applications for example to reduce tumor growth in mice srinivasan et al 2017 however under β carotene production culture conditions nitrogen deficiency conditions d salina reaches low cell concentrations which thus has consequences on the energy input and overall cost of their separation from water in industrial processes in a general manner several methods can be used for microalgae harvesting including centrifugation filtration flocculation and flotation garg et al 2012 however most of these methods are synonymous with high costs and energy consumption often for low efficiency rates for example centrifugation the most commonly used method consumes a large amount of energy and can cause damages to the cells because of high shear forces pragya et al 2013 filtration involves using membranes which in the case of microalgae separation can get clogged because of the small size of the cells and or of the exopolysaccharides they secrete resulting in high operating costs uduman et al 2010 as for flocculation it seems to be a promising low cost approach for large scale harvesting however contamination is a major issue in this technique as the chemical flocculants classically used to induce flocculation end up in the harvested biomass and can interfere with the final application of the biomass food or feed vandamme et al 2013 in this context flotation is believed to be a promising harvesting technique that takes advantage of microalgae s natural low density and self floating tendency garg et al 2012 assisted flotation consists in air or gas transformed into bubbles rising through a microalgae suspension as a result microalgae cells get attached to bubbles and are carried out and accumulated on the surface thus flotation allows for low cost cell harvesting without necessarily using flocculants that could damage the cells in addition it is a relatively rapid operation which needs low space and has moderate operational costs however as both the surface of microalgae and bubbles present a negative charge in aqueous medium yang et al 2001 garg et al 2015 and given the low hydrophobicity of microalgae cells the interactions between cells and bubbles are repulsive which prevents adhesion and thus capture and flotation resulting in the poor efficiency of this harvesting technique among the possible strategies to enhance flotation efficiency natural auto flocculation is an interesting alternative there are several known auto flocculation mechanisms among which one is based on the precipitation of magnesium ions into magnesium hydroxide at high ph sukenik and shelef 1984 such increased ph in the culture medium can result either from the photosynthesis activity of the cells or from the direct addition of oh then the flocculation of the cells can occur through charge neutralization i e through the interaction between the positively charged formed magnesium hydroxide precipitates and cells through sweeping where cells are entrapped in the massive precipitation of the magnesium hydroxide in the medium or both vandamme et al 2013 auto flocculation of cells at high ph using naoh addition has already been described for different microalgae species such as chlorella vulgaris wu et al 2012 or phaeodactylum tricornutum wu et al 2012 vandamme et al 2015 formosa dague et al 2018 and has been showed to occur by both sweeping flocculation and charge neutralization in the case of d salina a previous study that we conducted in 2013 showed that addition of naoh was necessary to increase the ph in the medium and that further flocculation was caused by sweeping of the cells by forming magnesium hydroxide precipitate besson and guiraud 2013 in the experimental conditions used in this study the more naoh was added the more magnesium hydroxide was precipitated and the more efficient the flocculation was a cell recovery up to 100 could be achieved using further flotation the results obtained also showed that the naoh flow rate had no influence on the flocculation and further flotation recovery however they suggested that the type of injection of naoh and thus its mixing in the medium and the speed of magnesium hydroxide precipitation could have an influence in the final harvesting efficiency in the work presented here we will first evidence the only contribution of sweeping mechanism in the flocculation of cells induced by the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide at high ph and exclude the role of charge neutralization for that we will first simulate the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide in the medium as a function of the naoh concentration to understand the behavior of the culture medium during flocculation then we will use recent developments made in the team that consist in using atomic force microscopy afm binnig et al 1986 to probe the interactions between microalgae cells and particles formosa dague et al 2018 for that afm tips functionalized with magnesium hydroxides particles will be used in force spectroscopy experiments to measure directly at the piconewton scale the interactions between these particles and the cells then knowing precisely the flocculation mechanism at play we will be able to optimize parameters to harvest in the most effective possible way d salina cells at laboratory scale but also at pre industrial scales suspension flow rate 0 6 m3 h for that we will complete our previous study and determine the role of naoh mixing in the medium by testing different injection types agitation and medium salinity and by evaluating their effects on the flocculation flotation recovery of the cells at laboratory scale based on these results and their interpretation we will adapt and optimize an injection system to efficiently flocculate and harvest cells by flotation in a pre industrial continuous cultivation system this way we will provide a cost effective solution to efficiently harvest low concentrated d salina cells at industrial scales thus contributing to the industrial valorization of this β carotene rich biomass 2 material and methods 2 1 strain and culture conditions dunaliella salina strain ccap19 25 culture collection of algae and protozoa was cultivated in dechlorinated tap water containing the following nacl 107 g l mgso4 7h2o 4 8 g l mgcl2 6h2o 4 0 g l cacl2 1 1 g l kcl 0 1 g l a complete nutritive conway medium without silicates walne 1970 was also added the salinity of this synthetic water is of 10 the ionic strength of 2 3 this medium was used for all the experiments performed in laboratory it mimics the medium resulting from the evaporation of see water in which d salina can grow with a limited competition from other microorganisms used in pre industrial scale cultures a d salina strain isolated from saline ponds in gruissan occitanie france was also used to evaluate the influence of the strain on the harvesting efficiencies laboratory scale cultures for afm experiments cells were cultivated at 20 c under agitation 120 rpm in 75 ml non coated culture flasks 15 ml of culture and 500 ml non coated culture flasks 150 ml of culture the incubator was equipped with white neon light tubes providing illumination of approximately 40 μmol photons m 2 s 1 with a photoperiod of 12 h light 12 h dark for flotation experiments d salina culture was achieved in 10 l glass photobioreactors the culture was continuously agitated by the gentle bubbling of 0 2 μm filtered atmospheric air 2 l min illumination was provided by daylight fluorescent tubes osram fq 965 biolux with a photoperiod of 16 h light 8 h dark the temperature of the culture was regulated by air conditioning at 21 3 c pre industrial scale cultures the pre industrial experimental site of the salinalgue research project 2010 2014 was located in a salt marsh on the mediterranean sea coast at gruissan occitanie france latitude 43 094 n longitude 3 084 e as fully described in béchet et al 2018 briefly cultures were achieved in 4 outdoor raceways of 250 m2 containing between 30 and 100 m3 see water concentrated by sun evaporation salinity of 12 and disinfected with bleach fed the raceways before being inoculated the raceways were mixed by paddle wheels and by suspension pumping which was also used to limit the ph to 7 4 by a monitored addition of dissolved co2 in the recirculated suspension 2 2 precipitation model for hydroxide magnesium in the culture medium used the concentration of magnesium hydroxide calcium carbonate and dolomite were modeled as a function of the added naoh concentration in the culture medium to do so we simulated the naoh addition effects and developed a numerical model using the software phreeqc based on the pitzer equations to simulate the precipitate formation in our culture medium indeed in order to assess the equilibrium state of hypersaline solutions in which d salina is grown and understand the precipitation phenomena involved during naoh addition it is necessary to evaluate the activity of species in solution this requires the evaluation of coefficients of activity which take into account the various ionic interactions in these complex environments the models for calculating these activity coefficients are generally based on the coupling of the debye hückel debye and hückel 1923 theory translating electrostatic ionic interactions and of the theory of the ionic association that takes into account ionic interactions at short distances these models are well suited for solutions with ionic strength that does not exceed the one of regular seawater ionic strength of 0 7 but since the culture of d salina is carried out in a hypersaline environment the ionic forces encountered in its culture medium exceed the areas of validity of the different ion association models for a 10 salinity culture medium the ionic strength is of 2 3 therefore the models obtained with these theoretical descriptions of saltwater thermodynamics are not satisfactory for concentrated saline water in the case of d salina it was thus necessary to implement other types of models known as specific ion interaction models such as the one proposed by pitzer the pitzer model is based on a different thermodynamic approach and is well suited to evaluate the thermodynamic properties of hypersaline solutions the model used is based on the pitzer equations and allows to simulate the ionic equilibria during the injection of naoh in our culture medium the models developed by pitzer pitzer 1973 1975 pitzer and mayorga 1973 1974 pitzer and kim 1974 describes the specific ionic interactions of diverse species in complex media at high ionic strength for pure components this model uses the parameters given by pitzer and mayorga 1973 1974 the asymmetric mixing parameters come from pitzer and kim pitzer and kim 1974 pitzer 1975 the whole set of parameters were validated and listed by harvie et al 1984 the relevant database being pitzer dat this database accounts for the significant elements for mediterranean see water nakmgcahcls o cfemnbasrblibr with a large spectrum of possible precipitates before its application for the simulations presented here the model has been successfully besson 2013 compared to the experimental results of sea water evaporation proposed by baseggio 1974 the composition of the culture medium used for the simulations table 1 was entered using a temperature of 25 c and a total dissolved carbon concentration of 0 00021 mol kg water 2 3 flotation experiments due to the small size of the microalgae dissolved air flotation daf was used to harvest d salina after naoh induced flocculation fig 1 presents the daf devices used in this study laboratory scale a detailed presentation of the laboratory scale flotation experiments can be found in besson guiraud besson and guiraud 2013 daf experiments were performed in a multiplace orchidis fth3 flottatest three flotation test beakers were run simultaneously in which 600 ml samples were collected from the algal culture and added to each beaker then naoh was added in the case of direct naoh injection x ml of naoh at a concentration of 1m was added to the microalgae suspension as well as 100 x ml of distilled water in the case of the diluted naoh injection a unique solution containing x ml of naoh at a concentration of 1m and 100 x ml of distilled water was added to the microalgae suspension the volume of naoh x added was calculated depending on the final concentration wanted this procedure is presented in fig 4a the depressurization at atmospheric pressure of 200 ml of culture medium free of algae and saturated by air at 6 bars for 15 min induced the formation of microbubbles the recycle ratio pressurized culture medium volume initial sample volume was of 33 for flocculation the concentration of the added naoh solution was calculated taking into account the volume of the culture and the volume of the added white waters so that the ph does not change upon addition of the white waters pre industrial scale the pre industrial daf system was adapted from the cy1 flotation unit proposed by serinol bram occitanie france and is presented in fig 1 built in 316 l stainless steel to avoid corrosion by suspensions at high salinity this continuous cylindrical 0 6 m of diameter daf separation equipment with a conical bottom works as an airlift a cylindrical clifford delimits the ascending contact zone where the suspension to be treated and the white waters containing bubbles mix at the periphery the descending annular separation zone is equipped with a vertical lamellar packing to keep the flow as quiet as possible the nominal descending flow velocity is of 4 0 m h the flotation tank volume is of 600 l and its maximum flow capacity is of 1 m3 h the floated microalgae are mechanically removed from the tank surface by a tunable rotating scrapper salted waters identical to the culture medium or recycled from the harvesting are continuously pressurized at 6 bars by a centrifugal pump and saturated with air within a pressurization tank white waters are produced by passing this pressurized solution through a needle valve the microbubble size distribution was measured by laser diffraction sizer malvern spraytec most of the bubbles produced in these saline waters have a diameter smaller than 60 μm besson and guiraud 2012 naoh solutions at different concentrations in distilled water were added at different injection places on the supply line at a controlled flow injection using a peristaltic pump given that the microalgae suspension flow rate is of 300 l h and the final naoh concentration is of 0 02 mol l if a naoh solution of 0 1 mol l is injected the flowrate is of 66 l h and if a naoh solution of 0 2 mol l is injected the flowrate is of 0 33 l h flowrates were measured thanks to khrone optif lux 4100 electromagnetic flowmeters for the operating conditions microalgae suspensions were extracted from the external raceways using a peristaltic pump into the flotation unit simultaneously the pressurization system was launched and the naoh solutions were injected on the supply line the scrapping of the microalgae started as soon as the pressurization system was launched after 1 h at constant operating parameters three times the time of the continuous state setting samples required to quantify the separation efficiency treated suspension were harvested the harvesting efficiency was then quantified as described below 2 4 harvesting efficiency quantification harvesting efficiency quantification is based on optical density measurements the harvesting efficiency represents the quantity of algae floated compared to the quantity in the initial suspension it was evaluated using the following equation e 1 od a v a od i v i 100 where odi and vi are the initial optical density at 800 nm and the volume of algal suspension before naoh addition and flotation oda and va are the optical density at 800 nm of the aqueous phase and the volume of the aqueous phase after injection of pressurized water 2 5 zeta potential measurements the global electrical properties of d salina cell surface were assessed by measuring the electrophoretic mobility which corresponds to the velocity of suspended cells exposed to an electric field to this end microalgae were harvested by centrifugation 1500 rpm 3 min washed two times in sorbitol buffer 375 mm at ph 10 and resuspended in the same buffer at a final concentration of 1 5 106 cell ml using this procedure electrolytes present in the culture medium do not interfere and only the surface charge of the cells is measured the electrophoretic mobility was then measured using an automated laser zetameter zetasizer nanozs malvern instruments cell suspensions coming from 2 independent cultures were analyzed 2 6 afm tip functionalization with hydroxides to prepare functionalized afm with mg oh 2 mlct auwh bruker tips were first dipped into a thin layer of uv curable glue noa63 norland edmund optics then into a thin layer of mg oh 2 particles sigma aldrich deposited on a glass slide functionalized tips were then put under uv light for 10 min to allow the glue to cure 2 7 afm imaging and force spectroscopy experiments before afm experiments cells were harvested by centrifugation 1500 rpm 10 min and washed two times in sorbitol buffer 375 mm at ph 10 this salt free buffer is used for force spectroscopy experiments as it allows to accurately measure interactions between the cells and magnesium hydroxide particles functionalized on the afm tips without introducing a bias from electrolytes present in d salina culture medium moreover the sorbitol present in this buffer keeps the cells from exploding because of the osmotic pressure finally the ph of 10 allows to reproduce the conditions in which the cells are during flocculation induced by addition of naoh cells were then immobilized on polyethylenimine pei sigma p3143 coated glass slide prepared as previously described francius et al 2008 briefly freshly oxygen activated glass slides were covered by a 0 2 pei solution in deionized water and left for incubation overnight then the glass slides were rinsed with deionized water and dried under nitrogen a total of 1 ml of cell suspension was then deposited on the pei slides allowed to stand for 30 min at room temperature and rinsed with sorbitol buffer 375 mm at ph 10 for force spectroscopy experiments mlct auwh bruker cantilevers with a nominal spring constant of 0 01 n m functionalized with hydroxides or not were used at a constant applied force of 0 25 nn the cantilevers spring constants were determined using the thermal noise method hutter and bechhoefer 1993 before each experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation modeling and afm force spectroscopy confirm that d salina is flocculated by sweeping in magnesium hydroxide precipitate at high ph in our previous study in 2013 besson and guiraud 2013 our work evidenced the positive effect of naoh addition on the flocculation of d salina our main results showed indeed an increase in the harvesting efficiency with the addition of naoh into the medium up to 80 of cell recovery while the hypothesis that the flocculation occurred through sweeping in magnesium hydroxide precipitate could be formulated notably thanks to ions chromatography experiments performed on the suspension before and after flocculation flotation no proof of this mechanism were brought the first part of this study thus focus on providing a full understanding of the naoh induced flocculation mechanism for that we first assessed the equilibrium state of the hypersaline solutions in which d salina is grown to understand the precipitation phenomena involved when flocculating this microalgae using naoh addition for that we used the model described in section 2 2 elaborated from the pitzer model to successfully simulate the influence of the addition of naoh on the ionic equilibria in our culture medium described in table 1 results are presented in fig 2 on this graph the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 is plotted as a function of the added naoh concentration the resulting ph as well as two other precipitate candidate concentrations are also presented even if the measure of ph in hypersaline solutions with a high ionic strength presents some problems the simulated ph profile is similar to experimental measurements as the one showed in our previous study besson and guiraud 2013 the ph sharply increases until the beginning of the precipitation of the magnesium hydroxide then it continues to slightly increase until the end of the mg oh 2 precipitation that is to say when all the mg present in the solution is used thus this shows that upon addition of naoh magnesium hydroxide precipitation increases until reaching a maximum for a naoh concentration between 0 08 and 0 1 mol kg of water while calcium carbonate precipitation remains non significant thus we can conclude from this simulation that the hypothesis made in our previous study stating that flocculation of d salina at increased ph under hypersaline conditions at least results from the precipitation of only magnesium hydroxide at high ph among a great number of other possible salts is correct while this precipitation creates a gel that entraps the cells and flocculate them through sweeping the question is now to know if charge neutralization is also involved in this flocculation mechanism thus to have a full understanding of it to answer this question we used afm and performed force spectroscopy experiments using functionalized tips with magnesium hydroxides particles in this type of experiments the afm tip is moved towards the surface until touching it and then retracted if an interaction takes place between the tip and the sample upon retraction the tip will bend until the force applied is higher than the force of the interaction and the interaction breaks the tip then goes back to its initial position which is materialized on afm retract force curves as a peak referred to as retract adhesion the results of these experiments are presented in fig 3 they show in the case of bare afm tips no adhesion between the tip and the cells as seen on the retract force curves which present no retract adhesions fig 3a and b n 2400 curves recorded on 6 cells from 2 independent cultures in the case of tips functionalized by magnesium hydroxides fig 3c and d force curves also show no retract adhesions thus demonstrating that hydroxide particles do not interact with cells n 3200 curves recorded on 8 cells coming from 2 independent cultures with 7 different mg oh 2 tips note that in order to avoid any interaction between electrolytes in the medium and the afm tips experiments were performed in a salt free buffer at ph 10 to make sure only the interactions between the cells and the tips are probed as no interactions were probed in this buffer it is then evident that in the hypersaline waters in which d salina grows these interactions do not occur neither given the high quantity of charged ions that can screen both cells and mg oh 2 particles charges to give an explanation to this absence of interactions between the cells and mg oh 2 particles we then performed zeta potential measurements of d salina cells in the same salt free buffer at high ph ph 10 and measured a surface charge of 15 4 0 9 mv n 8 measurements on cell suspensions coming from 2 independent cultures thus the cells do not present a sufficient negative surface charge in our conditions and do not interact with the positive surface of magnesium hydroxide lin and wang 2009 therefore thanks to these simulations and afm experiments we are able to confirm the hypothesis we made in our previous study and show that addition of naoh in the culture medium precipitates only magnesium hydroxide this precipitation results in the formation of a gel that is only responsible for entrapping the cells and flocculating them as afm experiments proved that charge neutralization is not involved in the case of d salina moreover in further experiments that we performed mg oh 2 already formed was directly added to d salina cultures which resulted in no flocculation of the cells thus reinforcing our nanoscale conclusions this is an interesting point as for all the microalgae species for which ph induced flocculation has been described charge neutralization mechanism is always involved sukenik and shelef 1984 wu et al 2012 vandamme et al 2012 2015 nguyen et al 2014 formosa dague et al 2018 branyikova et al 2018 indeed microalgae often have a cell wall composed of lipids proteins and polysaccharides these last ones have a pka of 11 12 when the ph increases in the medium the hydroxyl functions of these polysaccharides are deprotonated which can give the surface a more important negative charge as microalgae are usually grown in waters containing calcium or magnesium ions which precipitate into positively charged particles at high ph then flocculation occur also thanks to the interaction between these particles and the cells however in our case d salina cells do not interact with positively charged magnesium hydroxide indeed dunaliella genus is unique in the absence of a rigid polysaccharidic cell wall cells only present a thin plasma membrane oren 2005 chen and jiang 2009 this thus explains why its surface charge is not more negative at high ph and thus why charge neutralization is not involved in its flocculation mechanisms in presence of magnesium hydroxide thus our results give a full understanding of the mechanism of d salina flocculation at high ph based on these information we can now evaluate the influence of different parameters such as naoh concentration agitation and salinity in order to determine the best possible separation conditions of the cells from the water and provide a solution for high scale harvesting 3 2 magnesium hydroxide precipitation phase is determinant for flocculating the cells because the flocculation of the cells occur only through sweeping the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide is then determinant for the successful flocculation flotation of the cells indeed the precipitation phase must be carried out as homogeneously as possible so that as much of the sample volume as possible is affected by the trapping of microalgae in the precipitate in formation therefore the conditions for adding naoh to the suspension should be adapted to optimize its fast mixing to address this point we performed flocculation flotation experiments using two different injection ways fig 4a reaching the same final naoh concentration in the first way direct injection naoh 1 mol l and water are directly injected in a flotation unit containing the microalgae suspension in the second way called here diluted injection water and naoh 1 mol l are first mixed into one solution which is further added to the microalgae suspension then in the first case concentrated naoh is delivered locally into the medium and in the second case the local instant concentration of the naoh solution is reduced using these two injection scenarios flocculation flotation harvesting was performed the results presented in fig 4b show a clear increase of the harvesting efficiency in the case of diluted injection for the same final naoh concentration in the microalgae suspension black filled symbols for example at 0 02 mol l of final naoh concentration the harvesting efficiency using direct injection is of almost 30 whereas using the diluted injection system it reaches up to 90 indeed in the case of direct injection a high quantity of concentrated naoh is locally delivered in the solution thus the speed of precipitation is increased but only concerns a local area of the suspension therefore in this case only the cells present in this area can be entrapped during the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide in the case of the diluted injection the low local concentration allows for a slower precipitation which then has time to occur in the entire or at least a larger volume of the microalgae suspension leading to the entrapment of more cells this phenomena is further illustrated in fig 4c for a final naoh concentration in the microalgae suspension of 0 02 mol l the more diluted the added naoh solution is the more efficient the harvesting is indeed for an added naoh solution of 0 1 mol l the flocculation flotation cell recovery reaches 80 while for naoh solutions higher than 0 5 mol l the harvesting efficiency is reduced to 20 the results of these experiments then prove that the local concentration of naoh and the phase of the magnesium hydroxide precipitation is determinant for the harvesting efficiency while diluted injection allows lowering this local naoh concentration to optimize the conditions to reach the best cell separation possible other parameters such as the agitation and the salinity quantity of magnesium ions available of the medium should be taken into account as they will thus also influence the harvesting efficiency 3 3 agitation and salinity are parameters that influence harvesting efficiency while diluted injection allows the magnesium hydroxide precipitate to form slowly in the medium agitation of the medium allows for the precipitation phase to sweep the entire microalgae suspension in fig 5 a the effects of different agitation speed on the flocculation flotation harvesting efficiency were measured it is clear on this figure that an increase from 20 to 40 rpm allows increasing by approximately a two fold the cell separation whatever the final naoh concentration in the microalgae suspension however increasing again the agitation speed from 40 to 80 rpm do not show the same effect as the harvesting efficiency in the case of 80 rpm agitation is slightly lower than in the case of 40 rpm this can be explained by the fact that a too fast agitation can change the structure of the flocs formed and thus have consequences on their capture by the bubbles during flotation as for the salinity of the medium to assess its effects on the harvesting efficiency we performed experiments with d salina cells grown in natural seawaters presenting salinities of 7 5 12 and 15 2 using a dilute injection system and an agitation of 40 rpm the results obtained presented in fig 5b show that the more saline the medium is the less efficient the harvesting is whatever the naoh final concentration indeed while high magnesium concentrations found in highly saline media can be thought in the case of sweeping flocculation to enhance harvesting efficiency it is the opposite effect in high saline media the naoh added directly meets high concentrations of magnesium ions which induces a fast precipitation of magnesium hydroxide oh has thus no time to reach the entire volume of the suspension then a high salinity has similar effects than injection of concentrated naoh where only the cells present in the area where fast precipitation of mg oh 2 occurs can be entrapped in the precipitate leading to lower separation rates therefore thanks to these experiments the parameters to reach the best separation rate possible can be optimized while a dilute injection is needed the agitation of the medium must be optimized to allow an efficient mixing of naoh with cells and a mg oh 2 precipitation that reaches the entire volume without having negative effects on the flocs formed as for the salinity of the culture medium it needs to be low enough to avoid supersaturation of magnesium hydroxide precipitation the adequate naoh concentration depending on the salinity in order to make sure that only parameters related to the magnesium hydroxide precipitation have an influence on the harvesting efficiency we also evaluated the influence of the calcium concentration the d salina strain used and the nutritive conditions in which the cells are grown regarding the influence of the calcium concentration in the medium sukenik et al in 1984 have established that the precipitation of calcium and phosphate ions at high ph could induce the flocculation of microalgae cells sukenik and shelef 1984 the conway medium used here to cultivate the cells containing phosphate we thus used waters of different calcium concentrations to evaluate the potential effect of calcium phosphate precipitate on the flocculation of d salina our results supplementary data 1 showed no difference in the harvesting efficiencies thus reinforcing our conclusions on the role of only magnesium hydroxide precipitate in sweeping the cells the influence of the d salina strain and of its nutritive conditions have then also been evaluated and showed that for the two strains we tested the ccap 19 25 and one other d salina strains isolated from saline ponds in france the same flocculation flotation conditions resulted in the same harvesting efficiencies supplementary data 2 regarding the nutritive conditions in which cells are grown we chose to focus on nitrogen deficiency conditions indeed the overproduction of β carotene after nitrogen starvation i e in conditions of unbalanced growth in response to lack of nitrogen is a well documented biological process in d salina lamers et al 2012 bonnefond et al 2017 we thus chose to address this question as the harvesting method we propose here is intended to be used for industrial use our results with cells grown in nitrogen deficient conditions showed no difference in the harvesting efficiencies obtained thus these two last points show that the flocculation flotation method that we focus on in this study when used with the good injection system agitation and salinity of the medium is efficient for different d salina strains in different relevant culture conditions this demonstrates the robustness of this harvesting method and thus the parameters identified naoh injection agitation and salinity can now further be used to develop and adapt a naoh injection system to efficiently flocculate and harvest cells by flotation in a pre industrial continuous cultivation harvesting system 3 4 development of a pre industrial harvesting process of d salina by flocculation flotation in this part of the work the knowledge previously acquired at the laboratory scale is used to harvest d salina cells at high scales for that raceways of 250 m2 were built in gruissan occitanie france and used to cultivate d salina an industrial continuous flotation unit 600 l was adapted and installed on the raceway site to harvest cells using naoh induced flocculation flotation a network of pumps with controlled flow rates were used to collect the cells from the raceway and bring pressurized water into the flotation unit for adapting the flotation unit to the specific conditions of d salina we first faced a technical challenge regarding the size of the bubbles produced in the pilot indeed using a method based on laser light diffraction we evaluated the size of the bubbles produced by daf in d salina culture medium supplementary data 3a these experiments show that in this medium nacl concentration of 107 g l bubbles have a size of approximately 40 μm compared to 60 100 μm in freshwater edzwald 1995 thus the salinity reduces the size of the bubbles which results in the reduction of their ascending velocity while this is not a problem at small scale because the flotation units consist of one small cylinder 1 l of maximum volume with only one entry for the pressurized water at the bottom fig 1a at high scale in a high dimensioned flotation unit presenting descending flow zones it is a problem for instance this flotation unit presents holes at the base of the clifford in order to accentuate the airlift effect and obtain in nominal functioning conditions descending speeds of 4 m h fig 1b we thus roughly calculated the speed of our bubbles considering them as rigid particles obeying the stokes law corrected by oseen oseen 1910 clift et al 1978 and found in our conditions an average bubble ascending velocity comprised between 3 6 and 5 4 m h depending on the contamination degree of their surface 1 and 1 5 mm s supplementary data 3b thus some of the bubbles may not reach the surface and can be aspirated in the flow descending zones of the flotation unit thus adaptations directly on the flotation unit were realized and consisted in decreasing the surface of the holes present at the base of the clifford to decrease the airlift effect and decrease the velocity in these descending flow zones this way the rising velocity of the microbubbles is higher than the velocity in the descending flow zones and thus a functioning similar to what is obtained at the laboratory scale can be provided these adaptations made we then scaled up the naoh induced flocculation flotation process optimized in batch mode at the laboratory scale to a continuous pre industrial scale mode for that given the specific flocculation mechanism of d salina by sweeping it is needed to adapt an injection system that will ensure a good mixing between the cells and the added naoh as it is determinant to efficiently flocculate the cells given the previous results concerning the salinity of the medium these experiments were performed in natural seawater at a salinity of 12 that ensured the growth of the cells in the raceway without presenting precipitation supersaturation problems for the experiments microalgae cultures were injected into the industrial flotation unit as well as pressurized waters through supply lines following the injection system represented in fig 6 a note that in this system the waters used for pressurization are recycled from the flotation unit after microalgae recovery and may contain also some microalgae naoh mixing with microalgae and microbubbles in this system takes place directly in the injection system and is different depending on its location on this injection system for instance in positions 3 and 6 fig 6a mixing will be more efficient than in position 1 and 4 because there the flow rate is the most important and the fluid is already a tri phase fluid culture medium cells and bubbles thus to find the best mixing conditions we chose to inject naoh at of 0 2 mol l final concentration of 0 02 mol l in the microalgae suspension at the different places in the injection system represented in red on the schematic representation in fig 6a after flocculation flotation the harvesting efficiencies were measured results are presented in fig 6b they show that the best cell separation rates of approximately 60 are reached when naoh is injected in the locations 3 and 6 where mixing is the most efficient if naoh is injected into the microalgae supply line the harvesting performance is slightly higher if this injection is made at the outlet of the elbow position 1 where recirculation phenomena occur because of the 90 bend located just upstream of position 1 however these performances do not reach those achieved for a naoh injection in the positions 3 and 6 on the pressurized water supply line the further away the injection is from the confluence with the suspension feed the lower the harvesting efficiency is for instance the harvesting efficiency is significantly reduced when naoh is injected in the position 4 this can be explained by the low presence of microalgae in this pipe the magnesium precipitate needs to be formed in the presence of the cells to best entrap them thus explaining the lower separation efficiencies reached in the pressurized water supply line however in these experiments the maximum harvesting efficiency obtained is of 60 they were realized with a naoh solution at a concentration of 0 2 mol l as showed before best separation rates are obtained for diluted naoh solutions the best efficiencies being achieved in the case of naoh solutions of 0 1 mol l figs 4c and 80 of cell separated from water thus in order to optimize the naoh concentration using a naoh injection in the position 3 in the injection system the experiments were repeated with injected naoh solutions of different concentrations final naoh concentration of 0 02 mol l the results are showed in fig 7 where both the harvesting efficiencies obtained in batch mode at laboratory scale and in continuous mode at pre industrial scale are represented it is clear on this graph that indeed for a solution of naoh of 0 1 mol l the separation rate reaches 80 and decreases as the naoh concentration increases the interesting point is that for both harvesting modes batch or continuous the harvesting efficiencies are the same thus showing the successful scale up of our naoh induced flocculation flotation process therefore we could adapt an efficient injection system allowing to separate in a single pass up to 80 of the cells from their culture medium at high scale and concentrate them by a factor of 230 compared to approximately 20 in laboratory scale experiments this difference in the concentration factor is explained by the fact that in the continuous daf system the rotation velocity of the scrapper which removes floated microalgae and its vertical position in the tank can be tuned in order to adapt the residence time of the foam containing the microalgae at the tank surface during this residence the microalgae concentration increases in the foam due to the liquid drainage by gravity resulting in higher concentration factors compared to lab scale experiments 4 conclusions we provide here an interdisciplinary multi scale study to propose an efficient harvesting method for d salina cells using flocculation flotation which can be used at industrial scales experiments at the nanoscale as well as simulations allowed first to precisely understand the complete mechanism of flocculation by addition of naoh in the complex hypersaline medium in which d salina grows we thus brought strong scientific arguments proving that addition of naoh in the medium creates a magnesium hydroxide precipitate that entraps the cell and flocculate them through sweeping because no other mechanism is involved the formation of this precipitate at low speed in the entire microalgae suspension is determinant for the harvesting efficiency understanding this then led us to evaluate the influence of pertinent parameters to achieve high efficiency harvesting all related to the precipitation of mg oh 2 that are the naoh concentration in the medium the agitation and the salinity of the medium our results in laboratory scale flocculation flotation experiments allowed us to show that the added naoh solution had to be diluted the agitation had to be optimal to bring the naoh in the entire volume without breaking the forming flocs and that too high salinities were resulting in magnesium hydroxide supersaturation phenomena it is based on this understanding of the separation mechanisms and on the identification of the influence of different parameters on the harvesting performances that the transition of the process to the pre industrial scale could be addressed in an efficient way for that we focused on the mixing efficiency at the injection site and the naoh concentration injected to provide optimal parameters and achieve efficient microalgae harvesting at high scale now further studies needs to be done to evaluate with precision the cost and energy consumption of this process at high scale and optimize better flocculation conditions to achieve effective harvesting at lower costs experiments have already been performed in this way using slaked lime as a base to induce the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide our results so far show promising harvesting efficiencies achieved at lower cost as

18951,tetrafluoroborate anion bf4 is found in the streams of flue gas desulfurization and borosilicate glasses etching which deteriorates water quality through slow hydrolysis into boric acid and fluoride decomposition and electrocoagulation ec of bf4 were studied using metallic aluminum as the sacrificial electrode the dissolved al iii from the anode could efficiently decompose bf4 in forms of fluoroaluminate complexes and the derived boric acid and fluoride ion were removed by sweep flocculation major variables were investigated to optimize ec including the reaction ph initial concentration of bf4 current density and electrolyte type the mechanism of ec process was elucidated with the kinetics of consecutive reactions experimental results suggested that the removal of bf4

electroplating wang et al 2014 aqueous boron is in forms of boric acid b oh 3 and borate ion b oh 4 depending on the ph of the solution when fluoride is present in a solution fluoride ion behaves as a strong ligand that coordinates with boron as extremely stable tetrafluoroborate bf4 anion itakura et al 2006 bf4 generally originates from streams of flue gas desulfurization process in coal fired power plants because of boron and fluoride compounds in coals katagiri et al 2010 pangeni et al 2012 and wastewaters of the wet etching of the borosilicate glasses using hydrofluoric acid iliescu et al 2008 once discharged in nature water the decomposition of bf4 would slowly release boric acid and fluoride ion which deteriorates the water quality gernon 1999 the environmental protection administration of taiwan regulated the effluent standards of boron and fluoride at 5 0 mg l and 15 mg l respectively tetrafluoroborate is one of the four species of fluoroborates bf oh 3 bf2 oh 2 bf3oh and bf4 as depicted in fig 1 the speciation of fluoroborates is dependent on the solution ph according to the involved reactions listed in table 1 bf4 predominates at a ph below 5 while b oh 3 and b oh 4 become major species under neutral and alkaline conditions since hydroxyl ion as a lewis base substitutes the fluoride ligands on boron however this process is not kinetically favorable due to the strong bf bonding even at ph 10 the decomposition of bf4 was only 2 6 6 6 and 25 8 after 1 5 and 20 days respectively katagiri et al 2006 the calcium and aluminum salts are currently applied to decompose bf4 followed by conventional precipitation of fluoride and boron cao and ca oh 2 enabled the decomposition of bf4 by forming caf complex at 80 c korenowski et al 1997 lin et al 1990 the boron and fluoride were then recovered as ca2b2o5 and caf2 by a hydrothermal reaction at 150 c itakura et al 2006 in contrast aluminum ions conducted the decomposition of bf4 at ambient temperature due to its great affinity to fluoride ligand table 1 singh 1976 the fraction of boron and aluminum fluoride species upon ph is shown in fig 2 with a molar ratio of total concentrations bt alt ft of 1

dominant at a ph greater than 8 therefore bf4 was first decomposed by aluminum salt in acidic condition and then the derived fluoride was removed by metal ions by adjusting ph to around 7 katagiri et al 2010 electrocoagulation ec in situ produces colloidal metal hydroxides by applying electric potential on sacrificial anodes ec could achieve higher removal efficiency compared to conventional

tetrafluoroborate removal because it can achieve two purposes the decomposition of tetrafluoroborate with aluminum ions that evolved from anode and the coagulation of the derived fluoride and boric acid the aim of this study is to demonstrate the treatability of ec toward tetrafluoroborate the reaction mechanism is elucidated by examining the variation of soluble species during ec the effects of

was made by the nonlinear curve fit of origin 2018 originlab co with levenberg marquardt iteration algorithm 3 results and discussion 3 1 mechanism of bf4 decomposition and removal of fluoride and boron in ec the variation in concentrations of bf4 free fluoride hf f h2f2 and hf2 and borate b oh 3 and b oh 4 during ec were examined at ph 8 as shown in fig 3 which is the optimal ph of ec in the removal of boron reported previously kartikaningsih et al 2016 the level of bf4 substantially decreases in ec in 3 h indicating that the dissolved aluminum ions compete vigorously with bf4 for fluoride ligand eq 9 9 b f 4 n a l 3 3 h 2 o n a l f 4 n 3 4 n b o h 3 3 h the soluble al iii was less than 1 ppm because of the low solubility of al oh 3 estimated to be 4 10 6 m at ph 8 fig s1 therefore neither free aluminum ions nor fluorinated aluminum complexes should exist in the solution the negligible quantity of free fluoride fig 3a suggests that the fluoride compounds were incorporated in aluminum hydroxide precipitates eq 10 ntuk et al 2015 un et al 2013 on the other hand the concentration of boron that was decomposed from bf4 increases and attains a steady value in 2 h as reported in early research sari and chellam 2015 xu and peak 2007 ec using al electrode is capable of efficiently removing boric acid once bf4 decomposition occurs the boron uptake on precipitates reaches an adsorption desorption equilibrium yielding a relatively high level of boron than fluoride eq 11 10 a l f p 3 p q a l 3 3 q p 3 o h a l q 1 f p o h 3 q p 3 s 11 a l o h b o h 3 a l o b o h 2 h 2 o as plotted in fig 3b the efficiency of ec on bf4 is evaluated based on the bf4 degradation and the removals of total fluoride and boron up to 90 of bf4 was decomposed within 3 h and the removal of total fluoride coincides with that of bf4 the removal efficiency of total boron however attains 80 in the end of ec the experimental result suggests that the derived fluoride ions are totally coagulated while the coagulation of boron is less effective the precipitates produced in ec are of nanoscale and have high specific surface area which may benefit the adsorptive removal of bf4 the aluminum hydroxides collected from ec with only nacl were evaluated in the adsorption of bf4 the precipitates were mainly composed of bayerite al oh 3 and boehmite alooh according to xrd shown later from the zeta potential ζ analysis as shown in fig s2a the point of zero charge phpzc of ec precipitates is 9 05 the surface groups are protonated as soh2 at ph 9 and deprotonated as so at ph 9 in other words the surfaces of the precipitates were positively charged and supposed to be beneficial for electrostatic attraction toward bf4 at ph 8 however as shown in fig s2b the adsorption of bf4 by aluminum oxy hydroxide is rather insignificant implying that bf4 would not be directly coagulated in ec system 3 2 effect of reaction ph on removals and precipitates the decomposition of bf4 and the coagulation of the derived fluoride ions and boron are the essential mechanisms for the electrocoagulation of bf4 the speciation of alf complexes is predominated at a ph lower than 10 according to fig 2 nevertheless fig 4 a shows that the ultimate removal of bf4 reaches 90 in a ph range of 4 12 in 3 h and at low ph the removal rate is more efficient restated the influence of reaction ph on bf4 removal is little even at a ph unfavorable to form alf complexes this phenomenon may be subject to the fluctuation of local ph in the vicinity of anode lei et al 2017 the oxygen evolution normally accompanies al iii dissolution at high overpotential that would concentrate the proton over the anode surfaces therefore the decomposition of bf4 was not impaired by alkaline conditions because the lowered local ph nearby anodes still enabled the formation of alf complexes at ph 4 the solubility of aluminum oxy hydroxide is relatively high fig s1 and thus more soluble al iii would present and accelerate the decomposition of bf4 fig 4b shows the final removals of bf4 total fluoride and boron at different ph the total fluoride removal and the decomposition ratio of bf4 are around 90 at ph 4 12 in contrast the total boron removal varies from 33 to 80 and maximizes at ph 8 which is consistent to the previous study kartikaningsih et al 2016 the immobilization of boron on metal hydro oxide is through an inner sphere monodentate complexation between neutral surface group soh and boric acid b oh 3 chorghe et al 2017 demetriou et al 2013 qiu et al 2015 in that case the adsorption capacity is maximized at the ph where the degree of dissociation α of soh and b oh 3 are great as the surface group of soh predominates at ph 8 10 fig s2a and b oh 3 is the major species at ph 9 2 pka 10 9 2 the removal of boron is therefore optimized at ph 8 9 the crystalline phases of electro coagulates vary with ph according to xrd patterns in fig 5 the precipitates present in forms of boehmite alooh jcpdf 21 1307 and bayerite al oh 3 jcpdf 20 0011 coexist in a wide range of ph 6 10 even though the boehmite is relatively stable lagno and demopoulos 2006 the broadening diffraction peaks of the boehmite phase suggest a small primary particle size due to intense homogeneous nucleation moreover heterogeneous nucleation and growth of bayerite with good crystallinity on the poorly crystallized boehmite surfaces has been reported van straten et al 1984 the eds analysis reveals that the precipitate mainly comprises al and o with molar percentages of 24 3 and 75 7 respectively while the content of boron and fluorine was negligible the morphology of the sweeping flocs over the electrode surface was displayed in fig 5b d under ph 4 the precipitate of boehmite phase was of nanoscale consistent to its low crystallinity the precipitate grew in size as ph increased and its crystallinity was enhanced simultaneously the amorphous aluminum oxyhydroxide would recrystallize to aluminum hydroxide under high ph because the high concentration of hydroxyl anion accelerated the crystallization of bayerite which in turn increased the grain size zhang et al 2009 3 3 effects of initial bf4 loading electrolytes and current density on ec performance the initial concentration of bf4 between 0 9 and 9 3 mm equivalent to 10 to 100 ppm b was treated by ec at ph 8 under current density of 5 0 ma cm2 to evaluate its capability as presented in fig 6 the influence of bf4 loading on the ec efficiency is insignificant residual bf4 were all below 0 2 mm however the removal of total boron declines from 80 to 74 when raising bf4 0 from 0 9 mm to 9 3 mm fig 6b under a fixed current density the quantity of precipitates generated and the number of active sites should be identical based on faraday s law in the view of adsorption isotherm the adsorption capacity mmol g increases with a higher equilibrium concentration of adsorbate mmol l at a fixed ph and ionic strength tran et al 2017 and approaches a maximal adsorption capacity as the active sites over surfaces are saturated in other word with a higher initial loading a greater adsorption capacity would be obtained in equilibrium with more aqueous adsorbate the final adsorption capacities of ec for boron were 0 3 1 4 and 2 6 mmol g al and residual boron levels were 0 1 1 1 and 2 3 mm in ecs when initial bf4 loadings were 0 9 4 6 and 9 3 mm respectively the types of supporting electrolytes may modify the conductivity of ec system and passivation of electrodes fig 7 a and b demonstrate the effects of 10 mm nacl naclo4 nano3 and na2so4 as supporting electrolytes on the treatment of bf4 nacl naclo4 and nano3 leads to similar rate of bf4 removal 97 whereas only 37 of bf4 is removed within na2so4 it is known that anodizing aluminum metal would form a thin layer of oxides on the surface that inhibits metal dissolution schwirn et al 2008 the formation of specific metal anion complexes would break up the passivated layer and accelerate the dissolution of metal picard et al 2000 eq 12 suggests that the dissolution of aluminum anode depends upon the overpotential e e 0 which is the difference between the electrode potential e and the formal potential of dissolution e 0 eq 1 12 e e 0 0 0591 3 log 1 a l 3 in the presence of chloride salt eq 13 the formal potential e 0 is therefore modified by the formation constant k f of aluminum chloride complex eq 14 in other words e 0 shifts because of the complexation of alcln 3 n and thus al dissolves at a lower anodic potential abdel gaber et al 2006 13 al3 ncl

has been known to follow the order of cl br i f clo4 oh so4 2 ghernaout and ghernaout 2011 na2so4 is less reactive with the passivated layer than the other electrolytes thus diminishing the aluminum dissolution and the efficiency of bf4 decomposition on the other hand the removal of total boron is low in the presence of nano3 compared to nacl and naclo4 as presented in fig 7c and d increasing the concentration of nacl from 5 mm to 50 mm deteriorates the decomposition rate of bf4 from 98 8 to 86 3 the high concentration of nacl lowers the overpotential of chlorine formation and affects the current efficiency on aluminum dissolution to some extent eqs 16 and 17 furthermore the chloride ion may compete with the fluoride ion over the lewis acid sites of aluminum ion gao et al 2010 16 cl2

6 25 ma cm2 the boron removal as shown in fig 8b increases from 43 to 74 when rising cd from 2 5 ma cm2 to 5 0 ma cm2 and further increases in cd to 6 25 ma cm2 does not improve boron removal significantly based on faraday s law cd applies to the electron transfer of aluminum dissolution chlorine and oxygen evolution in parallel on the anode accompanying the water reduction on the cathode

are around 115 regardless of the cd applied the values of η exceeding 100 indicate that the aluminum dissolution are subjected to not only dc current but also oxidative species in the solution most likely dissolved oxygen and water ma 2012 furthermore the presence of chloride could break down the aluminum oxide film minimizing the passivation of anode known as pitting corrosion cañizares et al 2005 mouedhen et al 2008 sari and chellam 2015 the operation costs of ec using various cd are evaluated based on the consumption of energy cenergy and electrode materials celectrode and the treatment fee of sludge csludge eq 19 isa et al 2014 olmez hanci et al 2012 the unit price of electricity a is 0 073 per kwh taiwan power company the unit price of aluminum electrode b is 1 8 per kilogram the

ec increases from 3 3 m3 to 8 9 m3 as shown in fig 8d when cd is raised from 2 5 ma cm2 to 6 25 ma cm2 the use of electrodes accounts for 62 0 3 0 of total cost while 19 7 3 9 and 18 4 0 9 of the costs are from electricity and sludge disposal respectively with an increase in cd high energy is needed to conduct the dissolution of anodes that creates a large quantity of precipitates and elevates the cost of waste disposal the cd is optimized at 5 ma cm2 based on the cost effectiveness of the treatment 3 4 kinetics of bf4 decomposition in ec the kinetics of tetrafluoroborate decomposition was studied to verify the reaction mechanism and influence of operation parameters on the rate constants the aluminum ion is derived from electro dissolution of anode eq 20 aluminum oxy hydroxide has a low solubility at neutral ph and precipitates rapidly eq 21 while bf4 is decomposed by the aluminum ion as b oh 3 and fluoroaluminate complex a l f 4 n 3 4 n as shown in eq 22 while n may vary with ph

the concentration of bf4 in the bulk solution depends on the ligand exchange reactions between bf4 and fluoroaluminate complex eq 24 since the proton concentration is low the backward reaction of eq

varying experimental parameters are summarized in table 2 the model can describe the bf4 removal in ec properly since the values of r2 are mostly greater than 0 99 the rate constant of aluminum dissolution k 1 is greatly affected by cd and electrolytes increasing cd from 2 5 ma cm2 to 6 25 ma cm2 enhances k 1 from 0 06 to 0 15 aluminum anodes suffered from various degrees of pitting corrosion within different electrolytes nacl and naclo4 corroded the electrodes with a similar rate k 1 of 0 10 min 1 which was faster than nano3 did 0 085 min 1 the k 1 value declines when elevating the concentration of nacl due to the competition between the current efficiencies for al iii dissolution and chloride oxidation the anodic dissolution is independent of ph and bf4 0 when the ec was conducted at 5 ma cm2 within 5 mm nacl leading to a k 1 value of 0 085 0 009 min 1 on the other hand the ratio of rates of aluminum hydroxide precipitation and bf4 decomposition k k 2 k 3 depends on concentrations of bf4 0 and nacl the k value drops from 5 1 to 1 9 as bf4 0 increased from 0 9 mm to 9 3 mm the results reveal that precipitation might become rate limiting at high bf4 loadings a slight decrease in k with increasing nacl suggests that the precipitation was retarded by the parasitic oxidation of chloride ions the ecs at ph 4 and within na2so4 were fitted using a pseudo first order reaction model as described in text s2 in the supporting information since the proton concentration and the tolerable al iii level are high at ph 4 the backward reaction of eq 22 is not negligible and thus an equilibrium concentration of bf4 is attained within na2so4 the decomposition of bf4 was inhibited when the aluminum anodes were totally passivated 3 5 comparison of electrocoagulation and chemical coagulation of bf4 chemical coagulation cc using alum is the primary method for treating wastewater that contains bf4 the efficacy of ec and cc is compared using an initial 9 26 mm bf4 ec was operated at conditions nacl 10 mm ph 8 0 0 3 cd 5 0 ma cm2 in which the weight loss of aluminum anode was 2 4 g in 3 h the addition of al iii salt may decrease ph drastically because of its lewis acidity and the precipitation of al oh 3 harif et al 2012 thus cc was conducted under similar conditions to ec i e controlled ph 8 0 0 3 10 mm of nacl and 88 7 mmol of aluminum chloride as a coagulant equivalent to 2 4 g of al anode consumed in ec the experimental result in fig 9 shows that efficiencies of bf4 degradation and boron removal by ec are superior to cc since cc introduced all aluminum salt initially and instantly 70 of bf4 could be rapidly removed in 15 min however the removal of bf4 in cc never increased after 15 min meanwhile only 27 of total boron was removed in contrast the anodic dissolution of al in ec continuously introduced sweep flocs and achieved the removal of bf4 and total boron at 98 and 74 respectively which is more efficient than direct use of aluminum salt 4 conclusion electrocoagulation of tetrafluoroborate bf4 and the derived boron and fluoride ions using metallic aluminum as electrodes was investigated the aluminum ion dissolved from sacrificial anodes facilitates the decomposition of bf4 through the complexation of fluoroaluminate fluoride ions and boric acid can be in situ removed by sweep flocs reaction ph was a major variable in influencing the removal of boron nacl was the most effective electrolyte to promote the anodic dissolution by destroying the passivated oxide layers over al electrodes however the oxidation of chloride and the competition between fluoride and chloride over aluminum ion would eliminate the current efficiency of treating bf4 when the concentration of nacl was up to 20 mm under conditions bf4 0 9 3 mm nacl 10 mm ph 8 0 current density 5 ma cm2 the bf4 decomposition ratio and total boron removal were 98 2 and 72 8 respectively and became 72 8 and 27 respectively by

18951,tetrafluoroborate anion bf4 is found in the streams of flue gas desulfurization and borosilicate glasses etching which deteriorates water quality through slow hydrolysis into boric acid and fluoride decomposition and electrocoagulation ec of bf4 were studied using metallic aluminum as the sacrificial electrode the dissolved al iii from the anode could efficiently decompose bf4 in forms of fluoroaluminate complexes and the derived boric acid and fluoride ion were removed by sweep flocculation major variables were investigated to optimize ec including the reaction ph initial concentration of bf4 current density and electrolyte type the mechanism of ec process was elucidated with the kinetics of consecutive reactions experimental results suggested that the removal of bf4 and total fluoride were less influenced by ph and that of total boron reached a maximum at ph 8 which favored the surface complexation between borate species and ec precipitates under the conditions bf4 0 9 3 mm nacl 10 mm ph 8 0 current density 5 ma cm2 98 3 of bf4 was decomposed and the removal of total fluoride and boron attained 98 2 and 74 1 respectively within 3 h ec using the al electrode outperformed the conventional chemical coagulation and reduced the levels of bf4 b oh 3 and f in aqueous solution synergically graphical abstract image 1 keywords defluorination boric acid adsorption co precipitation ligand exchange 1 introduction boron compounds are extensively used in industries including manufacturing of glass cosmetics fertilizers semiconductors and additives for electroplating wang et al 2014 aqueous boron is in forms of boric acid b oh 3 and borate ion b oh 4 depending on the ph of the solution when fluoride is present in a solution fluoride ion behaves as a strong ligand that coordinates with boron as extremely stable tetrafluoroborate bf4 anion itakura et al 2006 bf4 generally originates from streams of flue gas desulfurization process in coal fired power plants because of boron and fluoride compounds in coals katagiri et al 2010 pangeni et al 2012 and wastewaters of the wet etching of the borosilicate glasses using hydrofluoric acid iliescu et al 2008 once discharged in nature water the decomposition of bf4 would slowly release boric acid and fluoride ion which deteriorates the water quality gernon 1999 the environmental protection administration of taiwan regulated the effluent standards of boron and fluoride at 5 0 mg l and 15 mg l respectively tetrafluoroborate is one of the four species of fluoroborates bf oh 3 bf2 oh 2 bf3oh and bf4 as depicted in fig 1 the speciation of fluoroborates is dependent on the solution ph according to the involved reactions listed in table 1 bf4 predominates at a ph below 5 while b oh 3 and b oh 4 become major species under neutral and alkaline conditions since hydroxyl ion as a lewis base substitutes the fluoride ligands on boron however this process is not kinetically favorable due to the strong bf bonding even at ph 10 the decomposition of bf4 was only 2 6 6 6 and 25 8 after 1 5 and 20 days respectively katagiri et al 2006 the calcium and aluminum salts are currently applied to decompose bf4 followed by conventional precipitation of fluoride and boron cao and ca oh 2 enabled the decomposition of bf4 by forming caf complex at 80 c korenowski et al 1997 lin et al 1990 the boron and fluoride were then recovered as ca2b2o5 and caf2 by a hydrothermal reaction at 150 c itakura et al 2006 in contrast aluminum ions conducted the decomposition of bf4 at ambient temperature due to its great affinity to fluoride ligand table 1 singh 1976 the fraction of boron and aluminum fluoride species upon ph is shown in fig 2 with a molar ratio of total concentrations bt alt ft of 1 2 4 alf2 alf2 and alf3 suppress the fluoroborates in acidic condition which majorly dissociate into b oh 3 and b oh 4 the fluoroaluminates alfm oh n 3 m n prevail up to ph 8 and f and al oh 4 become dominant at a ph greater than 8 therefore bf4 was first decomposed by aluminum salt in acidic condition and then the derived fluoride was removed by metal ions by adjusting ph to around 7 katagiri et al 2010 electrocoagulation ec in situ produces colloidal metal hydroxides by applying electric potential on sacrificial anodes ec could achieve higher removal efficiency compared to conventional chemical coagulation harif et al 2012 yilmaz et al 2007 although several metals can serve as anodes kartikaningsih et al 2017 widhiastuti et al 2018 aluminum and iron are preferred due to their cost

pollutants or suspended particles can be removed by charge neutralization with the hydrolyzed metallic species at low ph or by adsorption onto the precipitates called sweep flocculation at neutral to alkaline ph ghernaout and ghernaout 2012 vasudevan and oturan 2014 al electrode has been reported to efficiently remove 95 of fluoride ion and 90 of boric acid from initial fluorine of 5 and 25 ppm f behbahani et al 2011 un et al 2013 and boron of 10 100 ppm b isa et al 2014 kartikaningsih et al 2016 yılmaz et al 2008 respectively ec with aluminum anodes was regarded as a promising method for tetrafluoroborate removal because it can achieve two purposes the decomposition of tetrafluoroborate with aluminum ions that evolved from anode and the coagulation of the derived fluoride and boric acid the aim of this study is to demonstrate the treatability of ec toward tetrafluoroborate the reaction mechanism is elucidated by examining the variation of soluble species during ec the effects of experimental variables including reaction ph current density initial concentration and electrolytes on efficiency and kinetics of bf4 boron and fluorine removals are investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all reagents were laboratory grade and used without further purification the milli q ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was used to prepare all solutions sodium

freshly prepared 4 m sodium hydroxide naoh merck and hydrochloric acid hcl basf 2 2 experimental procedures the ec reactor was made of polymethyl methacrylate pmma with dimensions of 12 cm in length 10 cm in width and 9 cm in height widhiastuti et al 2018 a given concentration of nabf4 dissolved in 850 ml was transferred to the reactor and mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm after adjusting the ph of the solution to a desired value four al as anodes paired with four al as cathodes were placed in the reactor in which the interval between electrodes was 1 cm a direct current dc power supply unit maxgood asy 3 sm generated certain current densities throughout ec process at specific time 4 ml of solution was collected and filtered using a 0 45 μm pvdf syringe filter chromafil meanwhile the ph temperature voltage and current were recorded the concentrations of bf4 and f were analyzed by an ion chromatography 850 professional ic anion mcs metrohm an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes ultima 2000 horida was used to analyze the concentration of boron in the filtrate an x ray diffractometer xrd rigaku rx iii was used to verify the crystalline phases of the precipitates evolved from the electrodes after being dried at 60 c for 12 h the x ray source was cukα and the measurements were carried out at 40 kv and 40 ma with a scanning rate of 4 min the micromorphology and the elemental analysis of the precipitate were characterized using a scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem joel jxa 840 hitachi s4100 as a comparison to ec the chemical precipitation cc was conducted with jar test devices at 150 rpm after adjusting the ph of 850 ml of solution that contained 9 26 mm of nabf4 and 10 mm of nacl to 8 around 90 mm of alcl3 was added to the solution which was equivalent to the amount of aluminum dissolved in ec at cd of 5 ma cm2 the ph was maintained at 8 0 0 3 throughout the reaction the removal efficiencies of bf4 total fluoride and boron were evaluated through eqs 6 8 as shown below total fluoride concentration ft refers to the sum of bf4 and free fluoride hf f h2f2 and hf2 total boron concentration is the sum of soluble boron species including bf4 b oh 3 and b oh 4 6 b f 4 r e m o v a l b f 4 0 b f 4 b f 4 0 100 7 t o t a l f l u o r i d e r e m o v a l f t 0 f t f

bt ft and alt calculation details are presented in text s1 in the supporting information numerical solutions were simulated by matlab 2017a mathworks the fitting of the kinetic of bf4 decomposition was made by the nonlinear curve fit of origin 2018 originlab co with levenberg marquardt iteration algorithm 3 results and discussion 3 1 mechanism of bf4 decomposition and removal of fluoride and boron in ec the variation in concentrations of bf4 free fluoride hf f h2f2 and hf2 and borate b oh 3 and b oh 4 during ec were examined at ph 8 as shown in fig 3 which is the optimal ph of ec in the removal of boron reported previously kartikaningsih et al 2016 the level of bf4 substantially decreases in ec in 3 h indicating that the dissolved aluminum ions compete vigorously with bf4 for fluoride ligand eq 9 9 b f 4 n a l 3 3 h 2 o n a l f 4 n 3 4 n b o h 3 3 h the soluble al iii was less than 1 ppm because of the low solubility of al oh 3 estimated to be 4 10 6 m at ph 8 fig s1 therefore neither free aluminum ions nor fluorinated aluminum complexes should exist in the solution the negligible quantity of free fluoride fig 3a suggests that the fluoride compounds were incorporated in aluminum hydroxide precipitates eq 10 ntuk et al 2015 un et al 2013 on the other hand the concentration of boron that was decomposed from bf4 increases and attains a steady value in 2 h as reported in early research sari and chellam 2015 xu and peak 2007 ec using al electrode is capable of efficiently removing boric acid once bf4 decomposition occurs the boron uptake on precipitates reaches an adsorption desorption equilibrium yielding a relatively high level of boron than fluoride eq 11 10 a l f p 3 p q a l 3 3 q p 3 o h a l q 1 f p o h 3 q p 3 s 11 a l o h b o h 3 a l o b o h 2 h 2 o as plotted in fig 3b the efficiency of ec on bf4 is evaluated based on the bf4 degradation and the removals of total fluoride and boron up to 90 of bf4 was decomposed within 3 h and the removal of total fluoride coincides with that of bf4 the removal efficiency of total boron however attains 80 in the end of ec the experimental result suggests that the derived fluoride ions are totally coagulated while the coagulation of boron is less effective the precipitates produced in ec are of nanoscale and have high specific surface area which may benefit the adsorptive removal of bf4 the aluminum hydroxides collected from ec with only nacl were evaluated in the adsorption of bf4 the precipitates were mainly composed of bayerite al oh 3 and boehmite alooh according to xrd shown later from the zeta potential ζ analysis as shown in fig s2a the point of zero charge phpzc of ec precipitates is 9 05 the surface groups are protonated as soh2 at ph 9 and deprotonated as so at ph 9 in other words the surfaces of the precipitates were positively charged and supposed to be beneficial for electrostatic attraction toward bf4 at ph 8 however as shown in fig s2b the adsorption of bf4 by aluminum oxy hydroxide is rather insignificant implying that bf4 would not be directly coagulated in ec system 3 2 effect of reaction ph on removals and precipitates the decomposition of bf4 and the coagulation of the derived fluoride ions and boron are the essential mechanisms for the electrocoagulation of bf4 the speciation of alf complexes is predominated at a ph lower than 10 according to fig 2 nevertheless fig 4 a shows that the ultimate removal of bf4 reaches 90 in a ph range of 4 12 in 3 h and at low ph the removal rate is more efficient restated the influence of reaction ph on bf4 removal is little even at a ph unfavorable to form alf complexes this phenomenon may be subject to the fluctuation of local ph in the vicinity of anode lei et al 2017 the oxygen evolution normally accompanies al iii dissolution at high overpotential that would concentrate the proton over the anode surfaces therefore the decomposition of bf4 was not impaired by alkaline conditions because the lowered local ph nearby anodes still enabled the formation of alf complexes at ph 4 the solubility of aluminum oxy hydroxide is relatively high fig s1 and thus more soluble al iii would present and accelerate the decomposition of bf4 fig 4b shows the final removals of bf4 total fluoride and boron at different ph the total fluoride removal and the decomposition ratio of bf4 are around 90 at ph 4 12 in contrast the total boron removal varies from 33 to 80 and maximizes at ph 8 which is consistent to the previous study kartikaningsih et al 2016 the immobilization of boron on metal hydro oxide is through an inner sphere monodentate complexation between neutral surface group soh and boric acid b oh 3 chorghe et al 2017 demetriou et al 2013 qiu et al 2015 in that case the adsorption capacity is maximized at the ph where the degree of dissociation α of soh and b oh 3 are great as the surface group of soh predominates at ph 8 10 fig s2a and b oh 3 is the major species at ph 9 2 pka 10 9 2 the removal of boron is therefore optimized at ph 8 9 the crystalline phases of electro coagulates vary with ph according to xrd patterns in fig 5 the precipitates present in forms of boehmite alooh jcpdf 21 1307 and bayerite al oh 3 jcpdf 20 0011 coexist in a wide range of ph 6 10 even though the boehmite is relatively stable lagno and demopoulos 2006 the broadening diffraction peaks of the boehmite phase suggest a small primary particle size due to intense homogeneous nucleation moreover heterogeneous nucleation and growth of bayerite with good crystallinity on the poorly crystallized boehmite surfaces has been reported van straten et al 1984 the eds analysis reveals that the precipitate mainly comprises al and o with molar percentages of 24 3 and 75 7 respectively while the content of boron and fluorine was negligible the morphology of the sweeping flocs over the electrode surface was displayed in fig 5b d under ph 4 the precipitate of boehmite phase was of nanoscale consistent to its low crystallinity the precipitate grew in size as ph increased and its crystallinity was enhanced simultaneously the amorphous aluminum oxyhydroxide would recrystallize to aluminum hydroxide under high ph because the high concentration of hydroxyl anion accelerated the crystallization of bayerite which in turn increased the grain size zhang et al 2009 3 3 effects of initial bf4 loading electrolytes and current density on ec performance the initial concentration of bf4 between 0 9 and 9 3 mm equivalent to 10 to 100 ppm b was treated by ec at ph 8 under current density of 5 0 ma cm2 to evaluate its capability as presented in fig 6 the influence of bf4 loading on the ec efficiency is insignificant residual bf4 were all below 0 2 mm however the removal of total boron declines from 80 to 74 when raising bf4 0 from 0 9 mm to 9 3 mm fig 6b under a fixed current density the quantity of precipitates generated and the number of active sites should be identical based on faraday s law in the view of adsorption isotherm the adsorption capacity mmol g increases with a higher equilibrium concentration of adsorbate mmol l at a fixed ph and ionic strength tran et al 2017 and approaches a maximal adsorption capacity as the active sites over surfaces are saturated in other word with a higher initial loading a greater adsorption capacity would be obtained in equilibrium with more aqueous adsorbate the final adsorption capacities of ec for boron were 0 3 1 4 and 2 6 mmol g al and residual boron levels were 0 1 1 1 and 2 3 mm in ecs when initial bf4 loadings were 0 9 4 6 and 9 3 mm respectively the types of supporting electrolytes may modify the conductivity of ec system and passivation of electrodes fig 7 a and b demonstrate the effects of 10 mm nacl naclo4 nano3 and na2so4 as supporting electrolytes on the treatment of bf4 nacl naclo4 and nano3 leads to similar rate of bf4 removal 97 whereas only 37 of bf4 is removed within na2so4 it is known that anodizing aluminum metal would form a thin layer of oxides on the surface that inhibits metal dissolution schwirn et al 2008 the formation of specific metal anion complexes would break up the passivated layer and accelerate the dissolution of metal picard et al 2000 eq 12 suggests that the dissolution of aluminum anode depends upon the overpotential e e 0 which is the difference between the electrode potential e and the formal potential of dissolution e 0 eq 1 12 e e 0 0 0591 3 log 1 a l 3 in the presence of chloride salt eq 13 the formal potential e 0 is therefore modified by the formation constant k f of aluminum chloride complex eq 14 in other words e 0 shifts because of the complexation of alcln 3 n and thus al dissolves at a lower anodic potential abdel gaber et al 2006 13 al3 ncl alcln 3 n k f 14 al3 ncl alcln 3 n 3e e 0 15a e e 0 0 0591 3 log c l n a l c l n 3 n e 0 0 0591 3 log 1 k f a l 3 15b w h e r e e 0 e 0 0 0591 3 log k f the anions in inhibiting aluminum passivation has been known to follow the order of cl br i f clo4 oh so4 2 ghernaout and ghernaout 2011 na2so4 is less reactive with the passivated layer than the other electrolytes thus diminishing the aluminum dissolution and the efficiency of bf4 decomposition on the other hand the removal of total boron is low in the presence of nano3 compared to nacl and naclo4 as presented in fig 7c and d increasing the concentration of nacl from 5 mm to 50 mm deteriorates the decomposition rate of bf4 from 98 8 to 86 3 the high concentration of nacl lowers the overpotential of chlorine formation and affects the current efficiency on aluminum dissolution to some extent eqs 16 and 17 furthermore the chloride ion may compete with the fluoride ion over the lewis acid sites of aluminum ion gao et al 2010 16 cl2 2e 2cl e0 1 36 v v s she 17 hocl h 2e cl h2o e0 1 48 v v s she fig 8 a shows that the decomposition ratio of bf4 increases from 74 to 99 in 3 h when elevating the current density cd from 2 5 ma cm2 to 6 25 ma cm2 the boron removal as shown in fig 8b increases from 43 to 74 when rising cd from 2 5 ma cm2 to 5 0 ma cm2 and further increases in cd to 6 25 ma cm2 does not improve boron removal significantly based on faraday s law cd applies to the electron transfer of aluminum dissolution chlorine and oxygen evolution in parallel on the anode accompanying the water reduction on the cathode

are around 115 regardless of the cd applied the values of η exceeding 100 indicate that the aluminum dissolution are subjected to not only dc current but also oxidative species in the solution most likely dissolved oxygen and water ma 2012 furthermore the presence of chloride could break down the aluminum oxide film minimizing the passivation of anode known as pitting corrosion cañizares et al 2005 mouedhen et al 2008 sari and chellam 2015 the operation costs of ec using various cd are evaluated based on the consumption of energy cenergy and electrode materials celectrode and the treatment fee of sludge csludge eq 19 isa et al 2014 olmez hanci et al 2012 the unit price of electricity a is 0 073 per kwh taiwan power company the unit price of aluminum electrode b is 1 8 per kilogram the unit price of sludge disposal c is 0 16 per kilogram with the assumption that the water content of sludge is 70 wt 19 cost a c e n e r g y b c e l e c t r o d e c c s l u d g e the operation cost of ec increases from 3 3 m3 to 8 9 m3 as shown in fig 8d when cd is raised from 2 5 ma cm2 to 6 25 ma cm2 the use of electrodes accounts for 62 0 3 0 of total cost while 19 7 3 9 and 18 4 0 9 of the costs are from electricity and sludge disposal respectively with an increase in cd high energy is needed to conduct the dissolution of anodes that creates a large quantity of precipitates and elevates the cost of waste disposal the cd is optimized at 5 ma cm2 based on the cost effectiveness of the treatment 3 4 kinetics of bf4 decomposition in ec the kinetics of tetrafluoroborate decomposition was studied to verify the reaction mechanism and influence of operation parameters on the rate constants the aluminum ion is derived from electro dissolution of anode eq 20 aluminum oxy hydroxide has a low solubility at neutral ph and precipitates rapidly eq 21 while bf4 is decomposed by the aluminum ion as b oh 3 and fluoroaluminate complex a l f 4 n 3 4 n as shown in eq 22 while n may vary with ph

the concentration of bf4 in the bulk solution depends on the ligand exchange reactions between bf4 and fluoroaluminate complex eq 24 since the proton concentration is low the backward reaction of eq

varying experimental parameters are summarized in table 2 the model can describe the bf4 removal in ec properly since the values of r2 are mostly greater than 0 99 the rate constant of aluminum dissolution k 1 is greatly affected by cd and electrolytes increasing cd from 2 5 ma cm2 to 6 25 ma cm2 enhances k 1 from 0 06 to 0 15 aluminum anodes suffered from various degrees of pitting corrosion within different electrolytes nacl and naclo4 corroded the electrodes with a similar rate k 1 of 0 10 min 1 which was faster than nano3 did 0 085 min 1 the k 1 value declines when elevating the concentration of nacl due to the competition between the current efficiencies for al iii dissolution and chloride oxidation the anodic dissolution is independent of ph and bf4 0 when the ec was conducted at 5 ma cm2 within 5 mm nacl leading to a k 1 value of 0 085 0 009 min 1 on the other hand the ratio of rates of aluminum hydroxide precipitation and bf4 decomposition k k 2 k 3 depends on concentrations of bf4 0 and nacl the k value drops from 5 1 to 1 9 as bf4 0 increased from 0 9 mm to 9 3 mm the results reveal that precipitation might become rate limiting at high bf4 loadings a slight decrease in k with increasing nacl suggests that the precipitation was retarded by the parasitic oxidation of chloride ions the ecs at ph 4 and within na2so4 were fitted using a pseudo first order reaction model as described in text s2 in the supporting information since the proton concentration and the tolerable al iii level are high at ph 4 the backward reaction of eq 22 is not negligible and thus an equilibrium concentration of bf4 is attained within na2so4 the decomposition of bf4 was inhibited when the aluminum anodes were totally passivated 3 5 comparison of electrocoagulation and chemical coagulation of bf4 chemical coagulation cc using alum is the primary method for treating wastewater that contains bf4 the efficacy of ec and cc is compared using an initial 9 26 mm bf4 ec was operated at conditions nacl 10 mm ph 8 0 0 3 cd 5 0 ma cm2 in which the weight loss of aluminum anode was 2 4 g in 3 h the addition of al iii salt may decrease ph drastically because of its lewis acidity and the precipitation of al oh 3 harif et al 2012 thus cc was conducted under similar conditions to ec i e controlled ph 8 0 0 3 10 mm of nacl and 88 7 mmol of aluminum chloride as a coagulant equivalent to 2 4 g of al anode consumed in ec the experimental result in fig 9 shows that efficiencies of bf4 degradation and boron removal by ec are superior to cc since cc introduced all aluminum salt initially and instantly 70 of bf4 could be rapidly removed in 15 min however the removal of bf4 in cc never increased after 15 min meanwhile only 27 of total boron was removed in contrast the anodic dissolution of al in ec continuously introduced sweep flocs and achieved the removal of bf4 and total boron at 98 and 74 respectively which is more efficient than direct use of aluminum salt 4 conclusion electrocoagulation of tetrafluoroborate bf4 and the derived boron and fluoride ions using metallic aluminum as electrodes was investigated the aluminum ion dissolved from sacrificial anodes facilitates the decomposition of bf4 through the complexation of fluoroaluminate fluoride ions and boric acid can be in situ removed by sweep flocs reaction ph was a major variable in influencing the removal of boron nacl was the most effective electrolyte to promote the anodic dissolution by destroying the passivated oxide layers over al electrodes however the oxidation of chloride and the competition between fluoride and chloride over aluminum ion would eliminate the current efficiency of treating bf4 when the concentration of nacl was up to 20 mm under conditions bf4 0 9 3 mm nacl 10 mm ph 8 0 current density 5 ma cm2 the bf4 decomposition ratio and total boron removal were 98 2 and 72 8 respectively and became 72 8 and 27 respectively by

18952,a pilot microbial electrochemical system mes system with a total volume of 1 5 m3 was developed and operated outdoor in a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp microbial separator based on the dynamic biofilm on low cost porous matrix was applied to replace ion exchange membranes iems while the separate plug in module architecture allowed the totally 336 pairs of mes units and 14 separator modules to be integrated into one wastewater tank the separator layer equally divided the wastewater tank into 7 cathodic and 8 anodic compartments fed with primary sedimentation tank effluent of wwtp the pilot mes achieved stable removal efficiency for chemical oxygen demand 91 3 total nitrogen 64 2 and ammonium nitrogen 91 3 which were complied with the first grade a standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant dspmwtp in china the stable power output of pilot mes was 406 30 mw m 3 based on effective liquid volume or energy conversion performance of 2 03 10 3 kwh m 3 one cubic meter of influent wastewater the pilot mes achieved much lower effluent cod of 25 7 mg l 1 with hrt of 5 h while that of activated sludge process in wwtp was 43 6 mg l 1 under hrt of 12 h even though the aeration of biocathode demanded a net electricity consumption of 3 44 10 3 kwh m 3 the low operation energy requirement for pilot mes was only 12 of that in a typical activated sludge process 0 3 kwh m 3 by avoiding the utilization of iems and redundant structural materials the pilot mes achieved a low system cost of 1702 1 or 1135 m 3 as well and promoted the further real world application of mes graphical abstract image 1 keywords pilot microbial electrochemical system mes field tests of wastewater treatment microbial separator separate plug in module architecture energy and economic analysis 1 introduction water scarcity and pollution have become major obstacles for the rapid development of human society requiring efficient technology for sustainable treatment and reclamation of wastewater li et al 2014 sun et al 2016 microbial electrochemical systems mess considered as a promising wastewater treatment technology have been intensively studied in past decade schröder et al 2015 significant progress has been made in function expansions wang and ren 2013 system architectures he et al 2016c operation strategies he et al 2016a and fundamental mechanisms shi et al 2016 walker et al 2017 however the practical application of mess is still far from success due to the lacking of affordable scaled up construction and operation verification under actual application circumstance logan 2010 logan et al 2015 most mess have been conducted in the laboratory condition with reactors volume limited in tens to hundreds of milliliters oliveira et al 2013 wang and han 2009 only a minority of reactors tested with the scale of one to several liters dong et al 2015b he et al 2016c hiegemann et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 and very few studies reported the pilot scale mess larger than 100 l feng et al 2014 ge and he 2016 liang et al 2018 considering the operation circumstance mes studies were mostly conducted using pure substrates dong et al 2018 or fed with pre stored collected wastewater he et al 2016c wu et al 2017 and operated under manual intervened indoor environment zhang et al 2013 however the outdoor field test operation has differences in the real time fluctuation of influent cod he et al 2016a accidental wastewater composition changes and outside temperature variation etc campo et al 2013 thus it is urgent and of great meaning to design and operate an application orientated pilot scale mes in outdoor field test at wwtp to evaluate its actual wastewater treatment performances cathode system is considered as a major obstacle in mes electrolyte sangeun oh et al 2004 ter heijne et al 2010 however the frequently used air cathodes with abiotic chemical catalyst suffer from rapid and irreversible performance degradation attributed to catalyst poisoning and structure collapse ben liew et al 2014 the fabrication of large dimension air cathodes for full size mess also had undergone extreme difficulties cheng and wu 2013 dong et al 2012 and in stable long term pressure bearing operation he et al 2014 2016b li et al 2016 however self reproducible biocathodes have great advantages in building pilot mes for its low construction and operation costs scaling up applicability and long term sustainability huang et al 2011 jafary et al 2015 better effluent quality could be achieved with biocathode mes for the synchronous removal of both nutrient and organic pollutants du et al 2014b and detoxification of toxicants liang et al 2016 the biocathode presents a potential approach for the real application of mess however to build a cost efficiency pilot biocathode mes still requires further breakthroughs in material development and construction design unlike air cathode systems the biocathode mes are highly depended on separator structure apart from cathode and anode modules as the physical separation between anode and biocathode compartments separator is required to have low ion transfer resistance and able to effectively maintain the substrate and dissolved oxygen do differences between the biocathode and anode oliot et al 2016 the most commonly applied separators were ion exchange membranes iems however the expensive iems accounted for a significant proportion of the total construction cost of mess ge and he 2016 and the unsatisfied life time of iems in raw wastewater increased the risk of operation maintenance recently the developments of affordable carbon based electrodes logan et al 2007 and low cost modification technology feng et al 2010 2016 have significantly reduced the electrode cost the expensive iems by contrast became a key limiting factor for the application of biocathode mes many healthy attempts have been made to develop potential substitutes of iems as separator such as microfiltration mf sun et al 2009 and ultrafiltration uf tang et al 2010 membranes earthenware winfield et al 2013 and terracotta yousefi et al 2017 however the problems of separator structure in cost maintenance and related reactor design weren t fully solved dynamic membrane dm normally used in membrane treatment process was the cake layer formed on porous support matrix during filtration with accumulated solid particles such as microbial cells extracellular organic and inorganic precipitates ersahin et al 2012 the cake dm layer on the support material providing effective retention capability can easily be removed and reestablished again in a short time ersahin et al 2014 thus mainly acting as microbial carrier but not filtration material lots of cheap materials with large pore size could be used as support materials enabling dynamic membrane filtration applications at much lower capital exploitation costs zhang et al 2010 by far the dynamic membrane has commonly used as membrane bioreactor although having not been integrated with biocathode mes it is reasonable to speculate dynamic membrane can function well as microbial based separator for mes instead of iems for its advantages including high membrane flux low resistance cost efficiency and self sustainability as a kind of filtration membrane the microbial separator based on dm will allow not only the migration of ions but also wastewater and molecules to pass across which avoided the external wastewater distribution devices to recycle anolyte back into cathode compartment jadhav et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 and reduced the ph difference across membrane rozendal et al 2006 in mess with iems therefore the highly simplified separate plug in module architecture used for air cathode mess may have the possibility to be applied for pilot biocathode mess design which could leave out the redundant structures of modules save initial investment and improve the electrode maintainability he et al 2016c the construction of individual reaction chambers for mes modules costs a great faction in total financial investment feng et al 2014 but was often ignored in the economic analysis of mes the separate plug in module architecture allowed mes modules to be stacked in one water tank highly reducing the initial construction cost in this study a pilot biocathode mes with total volume of 1 5 m3 was installed for field tests in a municipal wastewater treatment plant fed with primary sedimentation tank effluent for 4 months from summer to winter the mes was designed with separate accessible anode cathode and separator modules plugged in one pvc wastewater tank the dynamic membrane with low cost polyurethane sponge support matrix and self reproducible dynamic biofilm layer was applied as the microbial separator between biocathode and anode modules the system was operated outdoor in non intervened circumstance with real time fluctuation of wastewater condition and temperature variations integrated with latest technologies and construction designs the application oriented pilot mes was investigated in terms of wastewater treatment and power generation under field test conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction and installation the pilot mes was operated as a moveable wastewater treatment facility equipped with electricity pump and light systems fig s1 the side walls and partitions of the mes reactor were fabricated by high density polyvinylchloride pvc plates with a thickness of 10 mm this whole treatment device mainly consisted of three parts with a total volume of 1 5 m3 including primary clarifier tank 0 2 m 1 m 1 m l w h 0 2 m3 internal dimensions same as below bioelectrochemical treatment tank 1 2 m 1 m 1 m l w h 1 2 m3 secondary clarifier tank 0 1 m 1 m 1 m

plates at an angle of 60 to the horizontal the following bioelectrochemical tank achieved an effective liquid volume up to 1 m3 after fully assembled with electrodes and separators the secondary clarifier tank was designed to further precipitate the suspended solids ss from the effluent of biocathode compartments the water head loss from primary to secondary clarifier was about 4 cm according to the reactor bottom of pilot mes to estimate the overall water head drop of the pilot mes the slight inclination of operation ground where the movable water treatment device located during field test was also considered the altitude intercept based on the horizontal level between the bottom of the head end of primary clarifier and the bottom of the terminal end of secondary clarifier was about 2 cm therefore the overall water head drop of pilot mes process was about 6 cm the anodes and biocathodes were graphite fiber brushes φ 3 cm h 110 cm made with carbon fiber toray 3k held between two twisted titanium ti wires the porous polyurethane sponge 1 m 1 m l w thickness of 2 cm layers functioned as porous support material of biofilm dynamic membrane that acted as the microbial separator after fully developed to divide biocathode and anode compartments a polyurethane sponge layer was sandwiched between two perforated high density polyethylene hdpe plates 1 m 1 m l w thickness of 0 5 cm pore size φ 1 cm open area 33 which were fixed together by cap screws and lock washers pressing the polyurethane pu sponge to 1 cm therefore the whole separator module was installed with a total thickness of 2 cm totally 14 separator modules were plugged along the side slots into the bioelectrochemical treatment tank and equally divided it into 15 compartments 100 6 100 cm w l d fifteen electrode modules including 7 cathode modules and 8 anode modules were then installed in the reactor totally 48 brushes forming one electrode module were arranged into two parallel rows and inserted into one compartment fig 2 a the top of which was fixed in a perforated top cover plate 100 cm 6 cm w l thickness of 1 cm pvc each anode brush could be matched with the adjacent cathode brush to form one electrode pair one mes unit fig 2a the distance between ti wire cores of anode brush and adjacent cathode brush was 5 cm the rows of anode brushes at the head and the terminal end of the bioelectrochemical treatment tank didn t have their matching cathode brushes therefore each of them was connected to the nearest anodes brush in the same compartment totally 720 brushes were installed into the treatment tank forming 336 mes units fig 2a the mes unit was numbered based on the position of biocathode brushes and investigated individually for example m r 4 1 c13 represented the mes unit contained the biocathode located in the fourth cathode module the 13th row count from primary to secondary clarifier and first column count from right to left fig 2a firstly the brushes were heat treated at 450 c in a large high temperature oven heating space 110 cm 70 cm 105 cm w h d model dy 881 1g dongyuan electric heating equipment co ltd wujiang china an industrial grade peristaltic pump pw250z shimge was used for influent wastewater was first pumped through primary clarifier tank and then overflowed out through the vertical outlet pipe installed on both sides of the primary clarifier for distribution two serials of influent distribution pipe were installed on both sides of bioelectrochemical treatment tank and parallelly distribute the influent wastewater into the lower part of each anode compartment 5 cm up from the reactor bottom by gravity flow fig s2 the wastewater flowed into the anode compartments and then percolated through the separator layers on either side into the adjacent cathode compartments the microbial separator on the support matrix pu sponge originating from the suspended solids and bacteria in influent wastewater was synchronously developed with the domestication of the anode and biocathode electrochemical active biofilm the wastewater then overflowed out of cathode compartment into collecting pipes two serials of effluent collecting pipe were installed through the top of cathode compartment on both sides of the reactor and then led the biocathode effluent into the secondary clarifier tank fig s2 the center of collecting pipes was 98 cm up from the reactor bottom sludge discharging pipes were set at the bottom of the primary clarifier tank and both sides of the secondary clarifier tank for periodical monthly sludge disposal the accumulated sludge in the anode compartment could be discharged into the primary clarifier tank through the influent distribution pipelines during the back flush of the reactor the effluent of mes temporarily gathered in the emergency adjusting tank was used for the back flush a microporous aerator pipe φ 1 5 cm l 95 cm bubble diameter 0 2 0 5 mm boyu corporation china was fixed at the bottom of each cathode compartment between the two rows of biocathodes for aeration the aeration pump had a nominal flow rate of 450 l min 1 and an actual flow rate of 400 l min

100 ω during the whole experiment period except in the electrochemical tests the external resistor of 100 ω was chosen as an estimated maximum power output point for one mes unit the copper wires exposed to the environment were sealed with insulated heat shrink tube and antirust paint to avoid metal corrosion in long term operation during startup period stage 1 days 1 50 the operation cycle of the aeration pump was set at intermittent aeration mode including an aeration phase of 0 5 min and a rest phase of 5 min with an air liquid ratio a l of 10 9 please refer to supplement section s1 for

of pilot mes was shown based on the average data of these sampled units in the different locations stage 1 and 2 days 0 74 polarization and power tests were performed at the end of stage 2 by varying the external resistors 510 100 51 30 20 10 5 1 2 and 1 ω stabilization time 45 min during power tests the mes units in rows of r 1 2 r 2 1 r 3 1 r 4 1 r 5 1 r 6 1 and r 7 1 were connected in parallel as a whole while the adjacent brushes were taken out to prevent short circuiting between the tested units and around electrode pairs fig 2 b the power density of pilot mes was calculated based on the average data of seven sampled rows and normalized based on the separator area and the effective liquid volume of mes the microbial communities of anode separator and biocathode were analyzed by pyrosequencing at the end of stable operation period total dna was extracted from the samples using a minibest bacterial genomic dna extraction kit takara biotechnology japan according to the manufacturer s instructions and assessed by electrophoresis in 1 agarose gels pyrosequencing of the amplicons was performed by sangon biotech co ltd using miseq instrument the outdoor temperature was monitored by a temperature recorder model rc 4 elitech china the ambient temperature in the movable water treatment facility varied from 35 to 3 c in the whole operation period from summer to winter totally 88 effective operation days the pilot mes was acclimated and operated without temperature intervention in stage 1 and 2 0 74 days energy balance was built between the energy production and energy consumption the electrical energy consumption of pumping and aeration was calculated as previously reported dong et al 2015a please refer to the supplement section s2 for the detail calculation process 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater treatment performance of pilot mes the condition of wastewater was highly variable during startup the cod varied from 200 to 350 mg l 1 in stage 1 and 2 table 1 in this period the average cod removal was 63 13 with an average effluent cod of 98 40 mg l 1 while those of scod were 60 15 and 85 38 mg l 1 fig 3 a in the final of stage 1 the cod removal gradually increased to 92 with an effluent cod of 22 mg l 1 and cod removal rate of 0 93 kg m 3 day 1 at day 50 while the final scod removal obtained was 91 with an effluent scod of 20 mg l 1and cod removal rate of 0 84 kg m 3 day 1at day 50 fig 3a and fig s4 table s1 at stable operation period days 51 74 stage 2 table 1 the average effluent concentration of cod were 25 7 mg l 1 with a cod removal of 91 3 while those of scod were 20 6 mg l 1 and 91 3 fig 3b and fig s4 the cod removal performance was stable even under an outdoor temperature below 0 c in days 71 74 with a cod removal of 92 2 and scod removal of 92 2 the stable effluent cod concentration was 23 6 mg l 1 which met the first grade a standard of discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant dspmwtp in china discharge cod 50 mg l 1 gb 18918 2002 the pilot mes also exhibited good nitrogen removal performance fig 3b and fig s4 the nh4 n removal was increased from 1 to 89 in the first 60 days while the tn removal rose from 3 to 70 from day 61 74 the average nh4 n removal obtained was 91 3 with an effluent concentration of 3 1 mg l 1 while those of tn were 64 2 and 13 2 mg l 1 this quality of mes effluent after 60 days operation in nitrogen removal met the first grade a standard of dspmwtp in china nh4 n 5 mg l 1 tn 15 mg l 1 gb 18918 2002 the nitrogen removal owned to the great amount of biomass on both electrodes and separators and the synchronous accumulation of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in the system the nitrifiers accumulated on biocathode in aerobic condition demonstrated a total abundance of 2 9 with several typical nitrifying bacteria including the genus of nitrosomonas nitrospira nitrosospira and nitrobacter fig 4 a du et al 2014a correspondingly on separators and anodes in an anaerobic condition the abundances of nitrifiers were relatively low at 0 31 separator and 0 67 anode typical reported denitrifying species including genus of pseudoxanthomonas meng et al 2015 comamonas wu et al 2015 thiobacillus claus and kutzner 1985 ottowia claus and kutzner 1985 sulfuritalea mcilroy et al 2016 thauera kondaveeti et al 2014 acidovorax nalcaci et al 2011 pseudomonas almeida et al 1995 and denitratisoma fahrbach et al 2006 were also found in all the sampling points the anodes were observed to have the highest total abundance of denitrifiers of 5 22 while those of biocathode 2 99 and separator 1 68 were relatively lower fig 4b the significant role of anode in denitrification was mainly attributed to the permeability of microbial separator based on dynamic membrane unlike iems separators in some extent the permeability the porous matrix and dynamic biofilm layer allowed the reverse circumfluence of catholyte into anode compartment under the turbulence of aeration and brought small molecules and ions including dissolved oxygen and nitrate to anode biofilm the dissolved oxygen leaked through dynamic biofilm separator layer allowed the nitrification process in anode biofilm bellucci et al 2011 even though it didn t influent the anaerobic condition do 0 2 0 5 mg l 1 the relatively high cod influent cod 204 314 mg l 1 and anaerobic condition in anode compartment provided denitrifiers a suitable inhabitant while the biocathode compartment with higher do and lower cod was more favorable for nitrifiers position in the boundary of aerobic and anaerobic circumstance the bacteria community in dynamic biofilm layer with both nitrifiers and denitrifiers also attribute to the nitrogen removal of the pilot mes therefore due to the application of microbial separator based on dynamic biofilm developed on porous matrix the pilot mes achieved good synchronous nitrogen and cod removal performance attribute to the permeable dynamic biofilm separator the influent wastewater could directly go through the separator layers into biocathode compartments therefore unlike those wastewater external redistribution depended biocathode systems with separators of low or no water permeability the suspended solids ss in wastewater could be effectively removed by the pilot mes during the start up period stage 1 the average ss removal was 81 8 with an average effluent ss concentration of 27 15 mg l 1 fig 3a after fully accumulating of biofilm on the brushes and microbial separator the ss removal further increased to 92 3 with an effluent ss concentration of 10 3 mg l 1 fig 3b which were comparable to that obtained in a 2 l tubular mes 14 18 mg l 1 fed with raw municipal wastewater zhang et al 2013 3 2 electricity generation of pilot mes with dynamic membrane separator separator in biocathode mes maintains the different circumstance of anolyte and catholyte therefore different functional electrochemical active biofilm can be domesticated on anodes and cathodes providing sustainable potential difference and electron flow between electrodes in addition the separator also requires ion transfer capability to form a closed electronic circuit the stable and sustainable electricity generation in mes units indicated the successful integration of dynamic membrane into mes as microbial separator which could effectively restrict the diffusion of substrate and do between electrode compartments and demonstrated sufficient ionic conductivity the mes units sampled in various locations exhibited similar voltage output performance under an external resistor of 100 ω at the end of start up period stage 1 the exoelectrogens usually belonging to the phylum of proteobacteria were gradually enriched on the electrodes fig s5 while the voltage output fluctuated around 280 21 mv in stable operation period stage 2 the voltage output stabilized at 300 55 mv with the volumetric current density of 71 12 ma m 2 1 0 0 17 a m 3 which was higher than that of a 90 l air cathode mes treating brewery wastewater 0 39 a m 3 dong et al 2015b and similar with a 200 l pilot multi module tubular mes in series connection 0 5 0 8 a m 3 ge and he 2016 the power tests were performed at the end of stage 2 the pilot mes obtained an average power density of 29 2 mw m 2 based on area of separator layer or 406 30 mw m 3 based on effective volume 1 m3 fig 5 a which was similar with that of the pilot air cathode mes with pt c catalyst 460 mw m 3 and the same cross section area 1 m2 feng et al 2014 based on the fitting of linear zone of polarization curves of the electrodes hutchinson et al 2011 the apparent internal resistance of anode was 1 8 ω while that of cathode was 1 1ω fig s6 therefore the anode rather than biocathode limited the power generation performance of pilot mes which may due to the low substrate strength in municipal wastewater however the power density of pilot mes was mainly limited by the scale effects during scaling up feng et al 2014 there were three special periods observed during which the voltage of mes units decreased due to inevitable shocks during operation fig 6 during day 10 13 the voltage output decreased to 0 v attributed to the lack of oxygen for aeration pump failure the unaerated shock fig 6 s1 quickly caused the disable of mes units and resulted in an anaerobic condition in cathode compartments however the biocathode could immediately recovery after aeration restarted on day 14 during day 60 63 a confluence of industrial sewage into the wwtp increased the influent ph to 8 3 9 2 and a great amount of white agglutinant suspended mass was observed fig 6 s2 during this industrial sewage shock the voltage output of mes units was only 110 93 mv the electricity generation performance recovered to 297 mv in 36 h with the influent wastewater became normal ph 7 0 7 3 the quick recovery of mes function after industrial sewage shock indicted the good resistant capacity of electrode functional biofilm the third operation shock was the low temperature shock fig 6 s3 after the first 0 c record at day 68 from day 69 74 the average temperature was only 5 c however the voltage output of pilot mes was relatively stable around 300 55 mv indicating the stable operation capability of mes under low temperature fig 6 3 3 energy balance and cost analysis energy balance was built based on the energy consumption and electricity generation in stage 2 days 51 74 table 2 the energy consumption has mainly resulted from the feeding of mes reactor pumping and aeration of biocathode the electrical energy requirement for pumping wastewater into mes was 2 51 10 4 kwh m 3 which could be negligible when compared with that needed for aeration 3 63 10 2 kwh m 3 based on the volume of influent wastewater the electricity generation of the mes was 2 03 10 3 kwh m 3 therefore a negative energy balance of 3 44 10 3 kwh m 3 was obtained the mess consisted of milliliter or liter scale modules dong et al 2015b ren et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 could demonstrate higher power density output and then obtained a net energy output however due to the existing of unideal resistance in internal resistance and the increasing of area specific resistance asr during dimension extension of mes the power density of future full size scale mes might be highly restricted by this scale effects feng et al 2014 even though the future mes wastewater treatment process would demand a small amount of net energy input its energy consumption was only 12 of that in a typical activated sludge process asp 0 3 kwh m 3 mccarty et al 2011 which gave the mes process a great advantage in operation cost than the conventional wastewater treatment processes like asp for the wastewater treatment performance the pilot mes also demonstrated superiority compared with asp during the same operation period of stage 2 the effluent cod of the wwtp with asp was 43 6 mg l 1 which was 1 9 0 7 times as much as that of mes process fig 7 a considering the hrt of mes treatment was 5 h totally 6 5 h with sedimentation and that of asp was 12 h the cod removal rate based on unit liquid volume of mes process was about 2 times as that of asp which was attribute to great cod degradation acceleration of mes synchronously with the electron flow he et al 2016c therefore rather than the capability of power generation the main advantage of mes process was the extracellular electron transfer assisted pollution degradation the mes demonstrated better nitrogen removal performance as well fig 7b and c and meet the first grade a standard about effluent nitrogen in china while effluent nitrogen of asp nh4 6 1 mg l 1 tn 16 1 mg l 1 could only meet the first grade b standard of dspmwtp in china the present investment of engineering mes was estimated based on the material and manufacture cost table 3 the raw material cost of carbon fiber brushes accounted for the main parts 52 5 including carbon fiber 515 08 and ti wire 378 8 the ptfe used for electrode treatment cost 10 of the total spend 170 25 the perforated plate supporting separator layer accounted for 12 1 of the total cost 205 8 the polyurethane sponge as the porous matrix of dynamic membrane 41 16 2 4 eliminated the use of expensive ion exchange membrane iem and significantly reduced the system cost in spite of the low cost the microbial separator based on dynamic biofilm also met the requirement of separator for the efficiency of ion transfer and capability to form do and cod gradient and ensured the stable operation of pilot biocathode mes another cost component was the fabrication of mes reactor using pvc plates 298 5 which was 17 5 of the total cost other accessories including the resistors wire ppr tubes and valves etc only cost a small fraction 92 5 5 4 the total cost of this 1 5 m3 mes centered wastewater treatment equipment was estimated to be 1702 1 or 1135 m 3 the pilot mes reactor was very economic friendly compared with the 200 l tubular mfc system with 96 modules totally 2226 or 11k usd m 3 include only cost for mes modules ge and he 2016 and the 1000 l mfc system consisted of cubic type 10 reactors with 5 modules in each 36k usd m 3 liang et al 2018 the low cost of the pilot mes reactor was mainly contributed to the separate plug in module architecture and the microbial separator based on the dynamic membrane table s2 the material of mes reactor costs up to 27 in total financial investment feng et al 2014 however the separate plug in module architecture can leave out the redundant structures for each module and allows mes to be conveniently stacked in one wastewater tank therefore for future full size mes the reactor cost would be even lower 10 in this study the dynamic membrane formed on the porous support matrix avoid the utilization of expensive iems as separator which cost 60 in the previous study ge and he 2016 the microbial separator also allowed the direct passing through of anolyte into the biocathode compartments and prevented the redundant accessories to pump anode effluent back into cathode chambers the microbial separator and microbial electrodes achieved self replenishing for all necessary structures of biocathode mes and possessed longer service life therefore the pilot mes in this study was superior as well in terms of low operation cost and easy maintenance the pilot mes was designed relatively close to the practical application for simplified architecture and low cost structural materials which demonstrated good expandability to be built as a full size reactor the construction cost per cubic meter construction cost with scale extension and construction optimization the material cost for electrodes and separator layer would also decrease with a bulk purchase or industrial manufacture the financial investment could be expectantly reduced to 300 500 m 3 in future at this level of construction cost the real world application of mess could be expected 4 conclusions a 1 5 m3 pilot biocathode mes was developed for outdoor field test operation in wwtp for primary effluent treatment effective wastewater treatment was achieved with hrt of 5 h the main effluent quality indexes including cod 25 7 mg l 1 tn 13 2 mg l 1 nh4 n 3 1 mg l 1 and ss 10 3 mg l 1 complied with the first grade a standard of dspmwtp in china the application of microbial separator achieved stable power generation of 406 30 mw m 3 based on an effective liquid volume of 1 m3 or 2 03 10 3 kwh m 3 based on wastewater volume aeration of biocathode resulted in most of the energy cost and a net electricity consumption of 3 44 10 3 kwh m 3 however the low operation energy requirement for pilot mes was only 12 of that for a typical activated sludge process 0 3 kwh m 3 the pilot mes demonstrated about 2 times cod removal efficiency as that of asp in wwtp hrt 12 h due to the extracellular electron transfer assisted cod degradation with microbial separator and separate plug in module architecture the pilot mes avoided the application of iems and redundant structure material and achieved a low system cost of 1702 1 or

18952,a pilot microbial electrochemical system mes system with a total volume of 1 5 m3 was developed and operated outdoor in a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp microbial separator based on the dynamic biofilm on low cost porous matrix was applied to replace ion exchange membranes iems while the separate plug in module architecture allowed the totally 336 pairs of mes units and 14 separator modules to be integrated into one wastewater tank the separator layer equally divided the wastewater tank into 7 cathodic and 8 anodic compartments fed with primary sedimentation tank effluent of wwtp the pilot mes achieved stable removal efficiency for chemical oxygen demand 91 3 total nitrogen 64 2 and ammonium nitrogen 91 3 which were complied with the first grade a standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant dspmwtp in china the stable power output of pilot mes was 406 30 mw m 3 based on effective liquid volume or energy conversion performance of 2 03 10 3 kwh m 3 one cubic meter of influent wastewater the pilot mes achieved much lower effluent cod of 25 7 mg l 1 with hrt of 5 h while that of activated sludge process in wwtp was 43 6 mg l 1 under hrt of 12 h even though the aeration of biocathode demanded a net electricity consumption of 3 44 10 3 kwh m 3 the low operation energy requirement for pilot mes was only 12 of that in a typical activated sludge process 0 3 kwh m 3 by avoiding the utilization of iems and redundant structural materials the pilot mes achieved a low system cost of 1702 1 or 1135 m 3 as well and promoted the further real world application of mes graphical abstract image 1 keywords pilot microbial electrochemical system mes field tests of wastewater treatment microbial separator separate plug in module architecture energy and economic analysis 1 introduction water scarcity and pollution have become major obstacles for the rapid development of human society requiring efficient technology for sustainable treatment and reclamation of wastewater li et al 2014 sun et al 2016 microbial electrochemical systems mess considered as a promising wastewater treatment technology have been intensively studied in past decade schröder et al 2015 significant progress has been made in function expansions wang and ren 2013 system architectures he et al 2016c operation strategies he et al 2016a and fundamental mechanisms shi et al 2016 walker et al 2017 however the practical application of mess is still far from success due to the lacking of affordable scaled up construction and operation verification under actual application circumstance logan 2010 logan et al 2015 most mess have been conducted in the laboratory condition with reactors volume limited in tens to hundreds of milliliters oliveira et al 2013 wang and han 2009 only a minority of reactors tested with the scale of one to several liters dong et al 2015b he et al 2016c hiegemann et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 and very few studies reported the pilot scale mess larger than 100 l feng et al 2014 ge and he 2016 liang et al 2018 considering the operation circumstance mes studies were mostly conducted using pure substrates dong et al 2018 or fed with pre stored collected wastewater he et al 2016c wu et al 2017 and operated under manual intervened indoor environment zhang et al 2013 however the outdoor field test operation has differences in the real time fluctuation of influent cod he et al 2016a accidental wastewater composition changes and outside temperature variation etc campo et al 2013 thus it is urgent and of great meaning to design and operate an application orientated pilot scale mes in outdoor field test at wwtp to evaluate its actual wastewater treatment performances cathode system is considered as a major obstacle in mes electrolyte sangeun oh et al 2004 ter heijne et al 2010 however the frequently used air cathodes with abiotic chemical catalyst suffer from rapid and irreversible performance degradation attributed to catalyst poisoning and structure collapse ben liew et al 2014 the fabrication of large dimension air cathodes for full size mess also had undergone extreme difficulties cheng and wu 2013 dong et al 2012 and in stable long term pressure bearing operation he et al 2014 2016b li et al 2016 however self reproducible biocathodes have great advantages in building pilot mes for its low construction and operation costs scaling up applicability and long term sustainability huang et al 2011 jafary et al 2015 better effluent quality could be achieved with biocathode mes for the synchronous removal of both nutrient and organic pollutants du et al 2014b and detoxification of toxicants liang et al 2016 the biocathode presents a potential approach for the real application of mess however to build a cost efficiency pilot biocathode mes still requires further breakthroughs in material development and construction design unlike air cathode systems the biocathode mes are highly depended on separator structure apart from cathode and anode modules as the physical separation between anode and biocathode compartments separator is required to have low ion transfer resistance and able to effectively maintain the substrate and dissolved oxygen do differences between the biocathode and anode oliot et al 2016 the most commonly applied separators were ion exchange membranes iems however the expensive iems accounted for a significant proportion of the total construction cost of mess ge and he 2016 and the unsatisfied life time of iems in raw wastewater increased the risk of operation maintenance recently the developments of affordable carbon based electrodes logan et al 2007 and low cost modification technology feng et al 2010 2016 have significantly reduced the electrode cost the expensive iems by contrast became a key limiting factor for the application of biocathode mes many healthy attempts have been made to develop potential substitutes of iems as separator such as microfiltration mf sun et al 2009 and ultrafiltration uf tang et al 2010 membranes earthenware winfield et al 2013 and terracotta yousefi et al 2017 however the problems of separator structure in cost maintenance and related reactor design weren t fully solved dynamic membrane dm normally used in membrane treatment process was the cake layer formed on porous support matrix during filtration with accumulated solid particles such as microbial cells extracellular organic and inorganic precipitates ersahin et al 2012 the cake dm layer on the support material providing effective retention capability can easily be removed and reestablished again in a short time ersahin et al 2014 thus mainly acting as microbial carrier but not filtration material lots of cheap materials with large pore size could be used as support materials enabling dynamic membrane filtration applications at much lower capital exploitation costs zhang et al 2010 by far the dynamic membrane has commonly used as membrane bioreactor although having not been integrated with biocathode mes it is reasonable to speculate dynamic membrane can function well as microbial based separator for mes instead of iems for its advantages including high membrane flux low resistance cost efficiency and self sustainability as a kind of filtration membrane the microbial separator based on dm will allow not only the migration of ions but also wastewater and molecules to pass across which avoided the external wastewater distribution devices to recycle anolyte back into cathode compartment jadhav et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 and reduced the ph difference across membrane rozendal et al 2006 in mess with iems therefore the highly simplified separate plug in module architecture used for air cathode mess may have the possibility to be applied for pilot biocathode mess design which could leave out the redundant structures of modules save initial investment and improve the electrode maintainability he et al 2016c the construction of individual reaction chambers for mes modules costs a great faction in total financial investment feng et al 2014 but was often ignored in the economic analysis of mes the separate plug in module architecture allowed mes modules to be stacked in one water tank highly reducing the initial construction cost in this study a pilot biocathode mes with total volume of 1 5 m3 was installed for field tests in a municipal wastewater treatment plant fed with primary sedimentation tank effluent for 4 months from summer to winter the mes was designed with separate accessible anode cathode and separator modules plugged in one pvc wastewater tank the dynamic membrane with low cost polyurethane sponge support matrix and self reproducible dynamic biofilm layer was applied as the microbial separator between biocathode and anode modules the system was operated outdoor in non intervened circumstance with real time fluctuation of wastewater condition and temperature variations integrated with latest technologies and construction designs the application oriented pilot mes was investigated in terms of wastewater treatment and power generation under field test conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction and installation the pilot mes was operated as a moveable wastewater treatment facility equipped with electricity pump and light systems fig s1 the side walls and partitions of the mes reactor were fabricated by high density polyvinylchloride pvc plates with a thickness of 10 mm this whole treatment device mainly consisted of three parts with a total volume of 1 5 m3 including primary clarifier tank 0 2 m 1 m 1 m l w h 0 2 m3 internal dimensions same as below bioelectrochemical treatment tank 1 2 m 1 m 1 m l w h 1 2 m3 secondary clarifier tank 0 1 m 1 m 1 m

plates at an angle of 60 to the horizontal the following bioelectrochemical tank achieved an effective liquid volume up to 1 m3 after fully assembled with electrodes and separators the secondary clarifier tank was designed to further precipitate the suspended solids ss from the effluent of biocathode compartments the water head loss from primary to secondary clarifier was about 4 cm according to the reactor bottom of pilot mes to estimate the overall water head drop of the pilot mes the slight inclination of operation ground where the movable water treatment device located during field test was also considered the altitude intercept based on the horizontal level between the bottom of the head end of primary clarifier and the bottom of the terminal end of secondary clarifier was about 2 cm therefore the overall water head drop of pilot mes process was about 6 cm the anodes and biocathodes were graphite fiber brushes φ 3 cm h 110 cm made with carbon fiber toray 3k held between two twisted titanium ti wires the porous polyurethane sponge 1 m 1 m l w thickness of 2 cm layers functioned as porous support material of biofilm dynamic membrane that acted as the microbial separator after fully developed to divide biocathode and anode compartments a polyurethane sponge layer was sandwiched between two perforated high density polyethylene hdpe plates 1 m 1 m l w thickness of 0 5 cm pore size φ 1 cm open area 33 which were fixed together by cap screws and lock washers pressing the polyurethane pu sponge to 1 cm therefore the whole separator module was installed with a total thickness of 2 cm totally 14 separator modules were plugged along the side slots into the bioelectrochemical treatment tank and equally divided it into 15 compartments 100 6 100 cm w l d fifteen electrode modules including 7 cathode modules and 8 anode modules were then installed in the reactor totally 48 brushes forming one electrode module were arranged into two parallel rows and inserted into one compartment fig 2 a the top of which was fixed in a perforated top cover plate 100 cm 6 cm w l thickness of 1 cm pvc each anode brush could be matched with the adjacent cathode brush to form one electrode pair one mes unit fig 2a the distance between ti wire cores of anode brush and adjacent cathode brush was 5 cm the rows of anode brushes at the head and the terminal end of the bioelectrochemical treatment tank didn t have their matching cathode brushes therefore each of them was connected to the nearest anodes brush in the same compartment totally 720 brushes were installed into the treatment tank forming 336 mes units fig 2a the mes unit was numbered based on the position of biocathode brushes and investigated individually for example m r 4 1 c13 represented the mes unit contained the biocathode located in the fourth cathode module the 13th row count from primary to secondary clarifier and first column count from right to left fig 2a firstly the brushes were heat treated at 450 c in a large high temperature oven heating space 110 cm 70 cm 105 cm w h d model dy 881 1g dongyuan electric heating equipment co ltd wujiang china an industrial grade peristaltic pump pw250z shimge was used for influent wastewater was first pumped through primary clarifier tank and then overflowed out through the vertical outlet pipe installed on both sides of the primary clarifier for distribution two serials of influent distribution pipe were installed on both sides of bioelectrochemical treatment tank and parallelly distribute the influent wastewater into the lower part of each anode compartment 5 cm up from the reactor bottom by gravity flow fig s2 the wastewater flowed into the anode compartments and then percolated through the separator layers on either side into the adjacent cathode compartments the microbial separator on the support matrix pu sponge originating from the suspended solids and bacteria in influent wastewater was synchronously developed with the domestication of the anode and biocathode electrochemical active biofilm the wastewater then overflowed out of cathode compartment into collecting pipes two serials of effluent collecting pipe were installed through the top of cathode compartment on both sides of the reactor and then led the biocathode effluent into the secondary clarifier tank fig s2 the center of collecting pipes was 98 cm up from the reactor bottom sludge discharging pipes were set at the bottom of the primary clarifier tank and both sides of the secondary clarifier tank for periodical monthly sludge disposal the accumulated sludge in the anode compartment could be discharged into the primary clarifier tank through the influent distribution pipelines during the back flush of the reactor the effluent of mes temporarily gathered in the emergency adjusting tank was used for the back flush a microporous aerator pipe φ 1 5 cm l 95 cm bubble diameter 0 2 0 5 mm boyu corporation china was fixed at the bottom of each cathode compartment between the two rows of biocathodes for aeration the aeration pump had a nominal flow rate of 450 l min 1 and an actual flow rate of 400 l min

located outdoor between primary sedimentation tank and aeration tank of the wwtp figs s1 and s3 the mes was inoculated and fed with the primary sedimentation tank effluent of wwtp without adding additional salt substrate minerals or nutrition during whole operation periods the hydraulic retention times hrts of the wastewater in the primary clarifier bioelectrochemical treatment tank and

100 ω during the whole experiment period except in the electrochemical tests the external resistor of 100 ω was chosen as an estimated maximum power output point for one mes unit the copper wires exposed to the environment were sealed with insulated heat shrink tube and antirust paint to avoid metal corrosion in long term operation during startup period stage 1 days 1 50 the operation cycle of the aeration pump was set at intermittent aeration mode including an aeration phase of 0 5 min and a rest phase of 5 min with an air liquid ratio a l of 10 9 please refer to supplement section s1 for

of pilot mes was shown based on the average data of these sampled units in the different locations stage 1 and 2 days 0 74 polarization and power tests were performed at the end of stage 2 by varying the external resistors 510 100 51 30 20 10 5 1 2 and 1 ω stabilization time 45 min during power tests the mes units in rows of r 1 2 r 2 1 r 3 1 r 4 1 r 5 1 r 6 1 and r 7 1 were connected in parallel as a whole while the adjacent brushes were taken out to prevent short circuiting between the tested units and around electrode pairs fig 2 b the power density of pilot mes was calculated based on the average data of seven sampled rows and normalized based on the separator area and the effective liquid volume of mes the microbial communities of anode separator and biocathode were analyzed by pyrosequencing at the end of stable operation period total dna was extracted from the samples using a minibest bacterial genomic dna extraction kit takara biotechnology japan according to the manufacturer s instructions and assessed by electrophoresis in 1 agarose gels pyrosequencing of the amplicons was performed by sangon biotech co ltd using miseq instrument the outdoor temperature was monitored by a temperature recorder model rc 4 elitech china the ambient temperature in the movable water treatment facility varied from 35 to 3 c in the whole operation period from summer to winter totally 88 effective operation days the pilot mes was acclimated and operated without temperature intervention in stage 1 and 2 0 74 days energy balance was built between the energy production and energy consumption the electrical energy consumption of pumping and aeration was calculated as previously reported dong et al 2015a please refer to the supplement section s2 for the detail calculation process 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater treatment performance of pilot mes the condition of wastewater was highly variable during startup the cod varied from 200 to 350 mg l 1 in stage 1 and 2 table 1 in this period the average cod removal was 63 13 with an average effluent cod of 98 40 mg l 1 while those of scod were 60 15 and 85 38 mg l 1 fig 3 a in the final of stage 1 the cod removal gradually increased to 92 with an effluent cod of 22 mg l 1 and cod removal rate of 0 93 kg m 3 day 1 at day 50 while the final scod removal obtained was 91 with an effluent scod of 20 mg l 1and cod removal rate of 0 84 kg m 3 day 1at day 50 fig 3a and fig s4 table s1 at stable operation period days 51 74 stage 2 table 1 the average effluent concentration of cod were 25 7 mg l 1 with a cod removal of 91 3 while those of scod were 20 6 mg l 1 and 91 3 fig 3b and fig s4 the cod removal performance was stable even under an outdoor temperature below 0 c in days 71 74 with a cod removal of 92 2 and scod removal of 92 2 the stable effluent cod concentration was 23 6 mg l 1 which met the first grade a standard of discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant dspmwtp in china discharge cod 50 mg l 1 gb 18918 2002 the pilot mes also exhibited good nitrogen removal performance fig 3b and fig s4 the nh4 n removal was increased from 1 to 89 in the first 60 days while the tn removal rose from 3 to 70 from day 61 74 the average nh4 n removal obtained was 91 3 with an effluent concentration of 3 1 mg l 1 while those of tn were 64 2 and 13 2 mg l 1 this quality of mes effluent after 60 days operation in nitrogen removal met the first grade a standard of dspmwtp in china nh4 n 5 mg l 1 tn 15 mg l 1 gb 18918 2002 the nitrogen removal owned to the great amount of biomass on both electrodes and separators and the synchronous accumulation of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in the system the nitrifiers accumulated on biocathode in aerobic condition demonstrated a total abundance of 2 9 with several typical nitrifying bacteria including the genus of nitrosomonas nitrospira nitrosospira and nitrobacter fig 4 a du et al 2014a correspondingly on separators and anodes in an anaerobic condition the abundances of nitrifiers were relatively low at 0 31 separator and 0 67 anode typical reported denitrifying species including genus of pseudoxanthomonas meng et al 2015 comamonas wu et al 2015 thiobacillus claus and kutzner 1985 ottowia claus and kutzner 1985 sulfuritalea mcilroy et al 2016 thauera kondaveeti et al 2014 acidovorax nalcaci et al 2011 pseudomonas almeida et al 1995 and denitratisoma fahrbach et al 2006 were also found in all the sampling points the anodes were observed to have the highest total abundance of denitrifiers of 5 22 while those of biocathode 2 99 and separator 1 68 were relatively lower fig 4b the significant role of anode in denitrification was mainly attributed to the permeability of microbial separator based on dynamic membrane unlike iems separators in some extent the permeability the porous matrix and dynamic biofilm layer allowed the reverse circumfluence of catholyte into anode compartment under the turbulence of aeration and brought small molecules and ions including dissolved oxygen and nitrate to anode biofilm the dissolved oxygen leaked through dynamic biofilm separator layer allowed the nitrification process in anode biofilm bellucci et al 2011 even though it didn t influent the anaerobic condition do 0 2 0 5 mg l 1 the relatively high cod influent cod 204 314 mg l 1 and anaerobic condition in anode compartment provided denitrifiers a suitable inhabitant while the biocathode compartment with higher do and lower cod was more favorable for nitrifiers position in the boundary of aerobic and anaerobic circumstance the bacteria community in dynamic biofilm layer with both nitrifiers and denitrifiers also attribute to the nitrogen removal of the pilot mes therefore due to the application of microbial separator based on dynamic biofilm developed on porous matrix the pilot mes achieved good synchronous nitrogen and cod removal performance attribute to the permeable dynamic biofilm separator the influent wastewater could directly go through the separator layers into biocathode compartments therefore unlike those wastewater external redistribution depended biocathode systems with separators of low or no water permeability the suspended solids ss in wastewater could be effectively removed by the pilot mes during the start up period stage 1 the average ss removal was 81 8 with an average effluent ss concentration of 27 15 mg l 1 fig 3a after fully accumulating of biofilm on the brushes and microbial separator the ss removal further increased to 92 3 with an effluent ss concentration of 10 3 mg l 1 fig 3b which were comparable to that obtained in a 2 l tubular mes 14 18 mg l 1 fed with raw municipal wastewater zhang et al 2013 3 2 electricity generation of pilot mes with dynamic membrane separator separator in biocathode mes maintains the different circumstance of anolyte and catholyte therefore different functional electrochemical active biofilm can be domesticated on anodes and cathodes providing sustainable potential difference and electron flow between electrodes in addition the separator also requires ion transfer capability to form a closed electronic circuit the stable and sustainable electricity generation in mes units indicated the successful integration of dynamic membrane into mes as microbial separator which could effectively restrict the diffusion of substrate and do between electrode compartments and demonstrated sufficient ionic conductivity the mes units sampled in various locations exhibited similar voltage output performance under an external resistor of 100 ω at the end of start up period stage 1 the exoelectrogens usually belonging to the phylum of proteobacteria were gradually enriched on the electrodes fig s5 while the voltage output fluctuated around 280 21 mv in stable operation period stage 2 the voltage output stabilized at 300 55 mv with the volumetric current density of 71 12 ma m 2 1 0 0 17 a m 3 which was higher than that of a 90 l air cathode mes treating brewery wastewater 0 39 a m 3 dong et al 2015b and similar with a 200 l pilot multi module tubular mes in series connection 0 5 0 8 a m 3 ge and he 2016 the power tests were performed at the end of stage 2 the pilot mes obtained an average power density of 29 2 mw m 2 based on area of separator layer or 406 30 mw m 3 based on effective volume 1 m3 fig 5 a which was similar with that of the pilot air cathode mes with pt c catalyst 460 mw m 3 and the same cross section area 1 m2 feng et al 2014 based on the fitting of linear zone of polarization curves of the electrodes hutchinson et al 2011 the apparent internal resistance of anode was 1 8 ω while that of cathode was 1 1ω fig s6 therefore the anode rather than biocathode limited the power generation performance of pilot mes which may due to the low substrate strength in municipal wastewater however the power density of pilot mes was mainly limited by the scale effects during scaling up feng et al 2014 there were three special periods observed during which the voltage of mes units decreased due to inevitable shocks during operation fig 6 during day 10 13 the voltage output decreased to 0 v attributed to the lack of oxygen for aeration pump failure the unaerated shock fig 6 s1 quickly caused the disable of mes units and resulted in an anaerobic condition in cathode compartments however the biocathode could immediately recovery after aeration restarted on day 14 during day 60 63 a confluence of industrial sewage into the wwtp increased the influent ph to 8 3 9 2 and a great amount of white agglutinant suspended mass was observed fig 6 s2 during this industrial sewage shock the voltage output of mes units was only 110 93 mv the electricity generation performance recovered to 297 mv in 36 h with the influent wastewater became normal ph 7 0 7 3 the quick recovery of mes function after industrial sewage shock indicted the good resistant capacity of electrode functional biofilm the third operation shock was the low temperature shock fig 6 s3 after the first 0 c record at day 68 from day 69 74 the average temperature was only 5 c however the voltage output of pilot mes was relatively stable around 300 55 mv indicating the stable operation capability of mes under low temperature fig 6 3 3 energy balance and cost analysis energy balance was built based on the energy consumption and electricity generation in stage 2 days 51 74 table 2 the energy consumption has mainly resulted from the feeding of mes reactor pumping and aeration of biocathode the electrical energy requirement for pumping wastewater into mes was 2 51 10 4 kwh m 3 which could be negligible when compared with that needed for aeration 3 63 10 2 kwh m 3 based on the volume of influent wastewater the electricity generation of the mes was 2 03 10 3 kwh m 3 therefore a negative energy balance of 3 44 10 3 kwh m 3 was obtained the mess consisted of milliliter or liter scale modules dong et al 2015b ren et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 could demonstrate higher power density output and then obtained a net energy output however due to the existing of unideal resistance in internal resistance and the increasing of area specific resistance asr during dimension extension of mes the power density of future full size scale mes might be highly restricted by this scale effects feng et al 2014 even though the future mes wastewater treatment process would demand a small amount of net energy input its energy consumption was only 12 of that in a typical activated sludge process asp 0 3 kwh m 3 mccarty et al 2011 which gave the mes process a great advantage in operation cost than the conventional wastewater treatment processes like asp for the wastewater treatment performance the pilot mes also demonstrated superiority compared with asp during the same operation period of stage 2 the effluent cod of the wwtp with asp was 43 6 mg l 1 which was 1 9 0 7 times as much as that of mes process fig 7 a considering the hrt of mes treatment was 5 h totally 6 5 h with sedimentation and that of asp was 12 h the cod removal rate based on unit liquid volume of mes process was about 2 times as that of asp which was attribute to great cod degradation acceleration of mes synchronously with the electron flow he et al 2016c therefore rather than the capability of power generation the main advantage of mes process was the extracellular electron transfer assisted pollution degradation the mes demonstrated better nitrogen removal performance as well fig 7b and c and meet the first grade a standard about effluent nitrogen in china while effluent nitrogen of asp nh4 6 1 mg l 1 tn 16 1 mg l 1 could only meet the first grade b standard of dspmwtp in china the present investment of engineering mes was estimated based on the material and manufacture cost table 3 the raw material cost of carbon fiber brushes accounted for the main parts 52 5 including carbon fiber 515 08 and ti wire 378 8 the ptfe used for electrode treatment cost 10 of the total spend 170 25 the perforated plate supporting separator layer accounted for 12 1 of the total cost 205 8 the polyurethane sponge as the porous matrix of dynamic membrane 41 16 2 4 eliminated the use of expensive ion exchange membrane iem and significantly reduced the system cost in spite of the low cost the microbial separator based on dynamic biofilm also met the requirement of separator for the efficiency of ion transfer and capability to form do and cod gradient and ensured the stable operation of pilot biocathode mes another cost component was the fabrication of mes reactor using pvc plates 298 5 which was 17 5 of the total cost other accessories including the resistors wire ppr tubes and valves etc only cost a small fraction 92 5 5 4 the total cost of this 1 5 m3 mes centered wastewater treatment equipment was estimated to be 1702 1 or 1135 m 3 the pilot mes reactor was very economic friendly compared with the 200 l tubular mfc system with 96 modules totally 2226 or 11k usd m 3 include only cost for mes modules ge and he 2016 and the 1000 l mfc system consisted of cubic type 10 reactors with 5 modules in each 36k usd m 3 liang et al 2018 the low cost of the pilot mes reactor was mainly contributed to the separate plug in module architecture and the microbial separator based on the dynamic membrane table s2 the material of mes reactor costs up to 27 in total financial investment feng et al 2014 however the separate plug in module architecture can leave out the redundant structures for each module and allows mes to be conveniently stacked in one wastewater tank therefore for future full size mes the reactor cost would be even lower 10 in this study the dynamic membrane formed on the porous support matrix avoid the utilization of expensive iems as separator which cost 60 in the previous study ge and he 2016 the microbial separator also allowed the direct passing through of anolyte into the biocathode compartments and prevented the redundant accessories to pump anode effluent back into cathode chambers the microbial separator and microbial electrodes achieved self replenishing for all necessary structures of biocathode mes and possessed longer service life therefore the pilot mes in this study was superior as well in terms of low operation cost and easy maintenance the pilot mes was designed relatively close to the practical application for simplified architecture and low cost structural materials which demonstrated good expandability to be built as a full size reactor the construction cost per cubic meter construction cost with scale extension and construction optimization the material cost for electrodes and separator layer would also decrease with a bulk purchase or industrial manufacture the financial investment could be expectantly reduced to 300 500 m 3 in future at this level of construction cost the real world application of mess could be expected 4 conclusions a 1 5 m3 pilot biocathode mes was developed for outdoor field test operation in wwtp for primary effluent treatment effective wastewater treatment was achieved with hrt of 5 h the main effluent quality indexes including cod 25 7 mg l 1 tn 13 2 mg l 1 nh4 n 3 1 mg l 1 and ss 10 3 mg l 1 complied with the first grade a standard of dspmwtp in china the application of microbial separator achieved stable power generation of 406 30 mw m 3 based on an effective liquid volume of 1 m3 or 2 03 10 3 kwh m 3 based on wastewater volume aeration of biocathode resulted in most of the energy cost and a net electricity consumption of 3 44 10 3 kwh m 3 however the low operation energy requirement for pilot mes was only 12 of that for a typical activated sludge process 0 3 kwh m 3 the pilot mes demonstrated about 2 times cod removal efficiency as that of asp in wwtp hrt 12 h due to the extracellular electron transfer assisted cod degradation with microbial separator and separate plug in module architecture the pilot mes avoided the application of iems and redundant structure material and achieved a low system cost of 1702 1 or 1135 m 3 and promoted the real world application of mes conflicts of interest we declare that we have no financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that can in

liquid chromatography organic carbon detection indicated the presence of proteins above 20 kda and humic like substances extracted proteins 93 5 8 1 μg g media correlated well r 0 90 with uv 280 measurements indicating that spectrophotometry may serve as a valuable tool to quantify proteins in extracted biofilms while substances in biofilms can serve as ndma and dcan precursors the full scale

formation selbes et al 2014 haloacetonitriles hans are a class of unregulated n dbps with a higher genotoxicity than haloacetic acids muellner et al 2007 similar to ndma han precursors have been associated with treated wastewater le roux et al 2011 proteins and free amino acids such as tryptophan also serve as important han precursors bond et al 2012 biological filtration has been identified as an efficient treatment technology to remove natural organic matter nom as well as dbp precursors farré et al 2011 nom removal can occur by a combination of adsorption on biologically active carbon bac media and biodegradation by the microbiome these two processes can occur independently or synergistically leading to bioregeneration of adsorption sites aktas and cecen 2007 thus a clear distinction does not exist between nom that has adsorbed to filter media and that which has been metabolized in the biofilm biofilm formation is encouraged by the presence of available nutrients boon et al 2011 and is composed of bacteria as well as extracellular polymeric substances eps which serve as an attachment framework and a source of nutrients for the microbial community flemming et al 2016 eps have been extensively studied in activated sludge comte et al 2007 liu and fang 2002 more recently extraction methods have been adapted for use with drinking water biofilter media elhadidy et al 2017 keithley and kirisits 2018 eps is ionically bonded to filter media and bacteria typically involving divalent cations such as calcium körstgens et al 2001 extraction of eps involves the disruption of these bonds using chemical or physical methods which release eps from the biofilm into solution excess levels of biofilm on filter media have been reported to lead to clogging and may require supplementary backwash procedures to properly manage headloss lauderdale et al 2012 poor removals of nitrosamines with biofiltration have previously been attributed to the sloughing of eps and other biofilm related compounds into the effluent liu et al 2017 where if present may also form n dbps following chloramination perez and susa 2017 wang et al 2012 biofilm components need to be characterized such that their contribution to n dbps may be better understood this study examined the n dbp formation potential fp under uniform formation conditions ufc of biofilm extracted from a full scale drinking water treatment biological filter as well as the impact of filter start up on n dbp precursor concentration in filter effluent biofilm was extracted from a bac filter using cation exchange resin its composition was assessed using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond as well as fluorescence excitation and emission matrices feem to further understand the character of the extracted n dbp precursors sourced from both eps and bulk organic matter retained on filter media a separate time wise analysis of biofilter influent and

continuously for 1 h following a minimum period of stagnation of 6 h since depth wise analyses of biofilter media have shown higher atp concentrations to exist near the top 20 cm of the biofilter unit boon et al 2011 liao et al 2013 velten et al 2011 filter media samples were collected from top the 5 10 cm of the media surface biofilter media samples were collected in whirl pak sample bags uline

from filter media to assess its potential to serve as an n dbp precursor the extracted biofilm had a high organic content doc of 31 7 2 7 mg l table 1 likely reflecting the presence of both carbohydrates and proteins associated with the eps as well as organics desorbed from the gac since the biofilter has been in operation for 15 years it can be inferred that its adsorptive capacity was exhausted mckie et al 2016 however active sites may potentially be regenerated by microbial utilization of adsorbed compounds el gamal et al 2018 absorbance measured at 254 nm and 280 nm suggests the presence of aromatic weishaar et al 2003 and protein like teare et al 1997 content a complete absorbance spectra is included as fig s1 in supplementary materials the ratio of aromatic uv254 to protein uv280 absorbance was similar when comparing biofilter influent and extracted biofilm uv254 280 ratios were 1 511 0 061 and 1 353 0 013 for biofilter influent and extracted biofilm respectively even though the uv254 and uv280 values were 15 7 17 7 times higher in the extracted biofilm table 1 the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva value of extracted biofilm was twice as high as that of the biofilter influent an accumulation of organic material is expected to occur on biofilter media lautenschlager et al 2014 and as such a higher suva in extracted biofilm may imply a preferential accumulation of aromatic substances on bac media or reflect the protein content within the biofilm layer biologically related characteristics of the biofilm were assessed using atp and protein measurements atp analysis is commonly used as a surrogate to represent biomass concentration and activity hammes et al 2010 even though atp does not always correlate well with organics removal pharand et al 2014 atp values in this study ranged from 233 to 360 ng g media fig 1 showing low variability in biomass concentration and suggesting steady state conditions an analysis of the top 15 cm of several acclimated biofilters by pharand et al 2014 showed that typical atp values ranging from 102 or 103 ng atp cm3 media were not influenced by source water type temperature or ebct for their study atp values were reported on a per volume basis to normalize for media type and density however atp is commonly reported on a per mass basis mckie et al 2016 velten et al 2011 as reported in this study data presented in fig 1 is in contrast to those of elhadidy et al 2017 who reported a significantly positive correlation r 0 91 between extract proteins and atp from extraction of drinking water biofilms however no similar relationship between biomass concentration and extracted proteins has been reported by others wang et al 2013 regardless media remained biologically active during cold water conditions 3 6 0 5 c throughout our study eps are excreted by microbial communities present in biofilters which serve to attach bacteria and protect them from adverse environments and may also serve as a source of nutrients during periods of starvation laspidou and rittmann 2002 eps include soluble proteins which contain a carbon nitrogen backbone that may provide a source of n dbp precursors meints 2015 this study attributes extracted proteins 93 5 8 1 μg g media to both eps and nom desorbed from bac media low variation in extract proteins between trials indicated an optimized extraction efficiency for this media previously reported biofilm extractions are difficult to numerically compare due to variation in extraction procedures and media types nonetheless previous protein data by others are summarized in table 2 which suggest that comparable results were obtained in the present study 3 2 ndma and dcan formation potentials of extracted biofilm under uniform formation conditions formation potential tests were conducted on biofilm extracts under uniform formation conditions to assess whether biofilm related materials could be considered as n dbp precursors while the ndma formation from biofilm derived compounds such as tryptophan as well as the han formation from cultures of p aeruginosa and p putida have been reported meints 2015 wang et al 2012 the n dbp ufc fp of biofilm extract has not previously been assessed the ndma ufc fp of this extracted biofilm was 0 80 0 27 ng ndma per g media fig 2 of the four han species measured bcan dban and tcan ufc fps were below the method detection limit 0 8 μg l the dcan ufc fp was 18 7 3 3 ng per g media although fps associated with finished drinking water or prepared solutions of known precursors are typically reported on a per volume basis shen and andrews 2011 uzun et al 2017 ndma and dcan ufc fps in this study were normalized to the mass of biofilter media to facilitate the correlations discussed later li et al 2017 reported the use of cation exchange resin to be effective for the removal of nitrosamine precursors since these are often protonated at neutral ph but impeded by divalent cations keithley and kirisits 2018 employed a staining and imaging technique to assess extraction efficacy of eps from three media types sand anthracite gac and concluded that a significant portion of biomass was retained on filter media following extraction based on these findings it is hypothesized that not all n dbp precursors were extracted from the biofilm and that the reported ufc fps underestimate the quantity of n dbp precursors present on drinking water bac filter media 3 3 characterization of nom in extracted biofilm in addition to organic content characterization the extracted organics were also characterized in terms of their size distribution and fluorescence properties liquid chromatography organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond is a useful tool to elucidate the composition of nom in source and drinking waters as it classifies nom into size fractions typically associated with biopolymers 20 kda humic substances 1 20 kda building blocks 300 500 da low molecular weight organic acids and neutrals 350 da as per huber et al 2011 although eps associated polysaccharides and proteins are typically included in the biopolymer fraction huber et al 2011 analysis of extracted biofilm with lc ocd ond should not be directly interpreted using these categories results are therefore shown as relative size fractions fig 3 analysis of extracted biofilms using lc ocd ond showed a majority of organic carbon to be between 1 and 20 kda fig 3 a category that is typically associated with humic like substances in natural source waters while organic size fractions 20 kda are typically associated with biopolymers a protein profile of extracted biofilm has shown that their molecular sizes can reach above 100 kda andersson et al 2009 organic nitrogen fractions corresponded to 13 20 kda and 6 between 1 and 20 kda others have reported that the majority of eps can be composed of carbohydrates flemming et al 2007 these were not quantified in this study as carbohydrates are not typically considered to be n dbp precursors due to the lack of nitrogen in their chemical structure fluorescence excitation emission matrices feem can also be used to characterize nom peleato et al 2016 the analysis of biofilm extract showed two main peak intensities table 3 an example feem contour plot for extracted biofilm is included as fig s2 in the supplementary materials both peaks a and b ex em 260 450 nm and 330 450 nm suggest the presence of humic like substances wang et al 2009 and corroborate the larger contribution of organic carbon ranging from 1 to 20 kda which reflects the removal of bulk organic matter adsorbed to the gac media as well as biofilm components previous feem analyses of extracted biofilm have shown a higher presence of protein like content along with humic like substances perez and susa 2017 wang et al 2009 a predominant protein peak was not observed in the present study even though protein content had been verified using the pierce micro bca protein method further research into the use of feem for characterizing protein content of these sample matrices is suggested 3 4 surrogate measurements for biofilm characterization correlations were established between all measured parameters in extracted biofilm table s1 in supplementary materials while doc and ndma ufc fp were strongly and negatively correlated r 0 88 r2 0 78 doc and dcan ufc fp were not significantly correlated r 0 32 r2 0 10 of note extract proteins showed a moderate positive correlation with organic nitrogen constituents 20 kda r 0 76 r2 0 58 further corroborating that this fraction of lc ocd ond results includes biopolymers as well uv 254 measurements correlated highly with organic carbon ranging from 1 to 20 kda r 0 90 r2 0 81 offering support that a major portion of this lc ocd ond fraction may be composed of humic substances which are highly aromatic extract proteins were highly positively correlated with uv 280 r 0 90 and r2 0 82 indicating that uv measurements can serve as a resource efficient alternative to protein quantification tests potentially in an on line scenario while a moderately positive correlation was observed between dcan ufc fp and uv 280 r 0 74 r2 0 55 a strongly negative correlation was found between ndma ufc fp and uv 280 r 0 89 r2 0 79 indicating that uv measurements may not be suitable for monitoring all n dbp precursors with respect to time 3 5 ndma precursor removal during regular cyclical operation including filter start up biofilter influent and effluent were monitored over time to evaluate the presence of n dbp precursors during filter ripening immediately following start up of a full scale cyclically operated drinking water biofilter the diversity and abundance of microbial communities are dependent on operational factors such as the presence of oxidants available nutrients and type of filter media gerrity et al 2018 oh et al 2018 periods of intermittent stagnation can lead to microbial stress associated with nutrient limitation proctor and hammes 2015 the presence of biofilm related compounds in aqueous samples was estimated by measuring total atp tatp which increased during the first 20 min following filter start up fig 4 a the change in dissolved oxygen across the filter bed δdo increased over the same time period fig 4b atp has previously been correlated to the rate of oxygen utilization by biofilm simpson 2008 and as an increase in δdo occurred in tandem with a spike in tatp both parameters appear to indicate a temporary increase of metabolic activity in the biofilm these changes may be indicators of conditions present in the filter bed during stagnation since microbial activity is not completely suppressed during stagnation bacteria may continue to aerobically metabolize nutrients by consuming do and may also release tatp as filter start up occurs the water that is initially flushed out may be depleted in oxygen and enriched in tatp alternatively because microbial starvation typically takes place during stagnation due to a lack of nutrients this temporary change in tatp and δdo may be attributed to sloughing of biofilm related compounds through the filter although tatp was released from the filters and peaked at values up to 71 5 ng l between 5 and 15 min after start up the tatp reached steady state levels of 17 2 7 8 ng l in the effluent following 30 min of operation similarly δdo reached a maximum of 5 1 mg l within the same period and 1 8 1 0 mg l after 30 min because both tatp and δdo stabilized within 30 min of filter operation this can be considered as the time to reach steady state confirming that the filters were already in steady state during the reported media collection time of 1 h of operation following stagnation ufc fp tests were conducted on biofilter influent and effluent to determine whether temporary disruptions in operation translated to changes in n dbp precursor concentration stability with respect to ndma precursors was observed to be independent of operation time with 6 9 4 3 ng l of ndma ufc fp being consistently removed 30 min after start up a consistent concentration of 8 5 2 6 ng l of ndma ufc fp was observed in biofilter effluent over the entire 6 h sampling period fig 5 han4 ufc fp were measured however all biofilter effluent samples remained below detection limits 0 8 μg l although the present study shows a direct association between biofilm and n dbp precursors it appears that no ndma precursors are released during cyclical operation start up or normal operation ndma precursors can be removed by both biodegradation as well as adsorption liao et al 2015 a combination of these two processes may be occurring eps were not released along with intracellular atp during filter start up since ndma ufc fp remained stable while tatp spiked this confirms the robustness of the eps layer and suggests that n dbp precursors are more associated with extracellular material rather than intracellular material 4 conclusions eps can serve an important role in maintaining biofilm life supporting microbiome and removal of organic material in biofilters but it may also contribute n dbp precursors this study investigated n dbp ufc fp following chloramination of biofilm extract collected from drinking water bac media extract

as an efficient treatment technology to remove natural organic matter nom as well as dbp precursors farré et al 2011 nom removal can occur by a combination of adsorption on biologically active carbon bac media and biodegradation by the microbiome these two processes can occur independently or synergistically leading to bioregeneration of adsorption sites aktas and cecen 2007 thus a clear distinction does not exist between nom that has adsorbed to filter media and that which has been metabolized in the biofilm biofilm formation is encouraged by the presence of available nutrients boon et al 2011 and is composed of bacteria as well as extracellular polymeric substances eps which serve as an attachment framework and a source of nutrients for the microbial community flemming et al 2016 eps have been extensively studied in activated sludge comte et al 2007 liu and fang 2002 more recently extraction methods have been adapted for use with drinking water biofilter media elhadidy et al 2017 keithley and kirisits 2018 eps is ionically bonded to filter media and bacteria typically involving divalent cations such as calcium körstgens et al 2001 extraction of eps involves the disruption of these bonds using chemical or physical methods which release eps from the biofilm into solution excess levels of biofilm on filter media have been reported to lead to clogging and may require supplementary backwash procedures to properly manage headloss lauderdale et al 2012 poor removals of nitrosamines with biofiltration have previously been attributed to the sloughing of eps and other biofilm related compounds into the effluent liu et al 2017 where if present may also form n dbps following chloramination perez and susa 2017 wang et al 2012 biofilm components need to be characterized such that their contribution to n dbps may be better understood this study examined the n dbp formation potential fp under uniform formation conditions ufc of biofilm extracted from a

exchange resin its composition was assessed using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond as well as fluorescence excitation and emission matrices feem to further understand the character of the extracted n dbp precursors sourced from both eps and bulk organic matter retained on filter media a separate time wise analysis of biofilter influent and

continuously for 1 h following a minimum period of stagnation of 6 h since depth wise analyses of biofilter media have shown higher atp concentrations to exist near the top 20 cm of the biofilter unit boon et al 2011 liao et al 2013 velten et al 2011 filter media samples were collected from top the 5 10 cm of the media surface biofilter media samples were collected in whirl pak sample bags uline

from filter media to assess its potential to serve as an n dbp precursor the extracted biofilm had a high organic content doc of 31 7 2 7 mg l table 1 likely reflecting the presence of both carbohydrates and proteins associated with the eps as well as organics desorbed from the gac since the biofilter has been in operation for 15 years it can be inferred that its adsorptive capacity was exhausted mckie et al 2016 however active sites may potentially be regenerated by microbial utilization of adsorbed compounds el gamal et al 2018 absorbance measured at 254 nm and 280 nm suggests the presence of aromatic weishaar et al 2003 and protein like teare et al 1997 content a complete absorbance spectra is included as fig s1 in supplementary materials the ratio of aromatic uv254 to protein uv280 absorbance was similar when comparing biofilter influent and extracted biofilm uv254 280 ratios were 1 511 0 061 and 1 353 0 013 for biofilter influent and extracted biofilm respectively even though the uv254 and uv280 values were 15 7 17 7 times higher in the extracted biofilm table 1 the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva value of extracted biofilm was twice as high as that of the biofilter influent an accumulation of organic material is expected to occur on biofilter media lautenschlager et al 2014 and as such a higher suva in extracted biofilm may imply a preferential accumulation of aromatic substances on bac media or reflect the protein content within the biofilm layer biologically related characteristics of the biofilm were assessed using atp and protein measurements atp analysis is commonly used as a surrogate to represent biomass concentration and activity hammes et al 2010 even though atp does not always correlate well with organics removal pharand et al 2014 atp values in this study ranged from 233 to 360 ng g media fig 1 showing low variability in biomass concentration and suggesting steady state conditions an analysis of the top 15 cm of several acclimated biofilters by pharand et al 2014 showed that typical atp values ranging from 102 or 103 ng atp cm3 media were not influenced by source water type temperature or ebct for their study atp values were reported on a per volume basis to normalize for media type and density however atp is commonly reported on a per mass basis mckie et al 2016 velten et al 2011 as reported in this study data presented in fig 1 is in contrast to those of elhadidy et al 2017 who reported a significantly positive correlation r 0 91 between extract proteins and atp from extraction of drinking water biofilms however no similar relationship between biomass concentration and extracted proteins has been reported by others wang et al 2013 regardless media remained biologically active during cold water conditions 3 6 0 5 c throughout our study eps are excreted by microbial communities present in biofilters which serve to attach bacteria and protect them from adverse environments and may also serve as a source of nutrients during periods of starvation laspidou and rittmann 2002 eps include soluble proteins which contain a carbon nitrogen backbone that may provide a source of n dbp precursors meints 2015 this study attributes extracted proteins 93 5 8 1 μg g media to both eps and nom desorbed from bac media low variation in extract proteins between trials indicated an optimized extraction efficiency for this media previously reported biofilm extractions are difficult to numerically compare due to variation in extraction procedures and media types nonetheless previous protein data by others are summarized in table 2 which suggest that comparable results were obtained in the present study 3 2 ndma and dcan formation potentials of extracted biofilm under uniform formation conditions formation potential tests were conducted on biofilm extracts under uniform formation conditions to assess whether biofilm related materials could be considered as n dbp precursors while the ndma formation from biofilm derived compounds such as tryptophan as well as the han formation from cultures of p aeruginosa and p putida have been reported meints 2015 wang et al 2012 the n dbp ufc fp of biofilm extract has not previously been assessed the ndma ufc fp of this extracted biofilm was 0 80 0 27 ng ndma per g media fig 2 of the four han species measured bcan dban and tcan ufc fps were below the method detection limit 0 8 μg l the dcan ufc fp was 18 7 3 3 ng per g media although fps associated with finished drinking water or prepared solutions of known precursors are typically reported on a per volume basis shen and andrews 2011 uzun et al 2017 ndma and dcan ufc fps in this study were normalized to the mass of biofilter media to facilitate the correlations discussed later li et al 2017 reported the use of cation exchange resin to be effective for the removal of nitrosamine precursors since these are often protonated at neutral ph but impeded by divalent cations keithley and kirisits 2018 employed a staining and imaging technique to assess extraction efficacy of eps from three media types sand anthracite gac and concluded that a significant portion of biomass was retained on filter media following extraction based on these findings it is hypothesized that not all n dbp precursors were extracted from the biofilm and that the reported ufc fps underestimate the quantity of n dbp precursors present on drinking water bac filter media 3 3 characterization of nom in extracted biofilm in addition to organic content characterization the extracted organics were also characterized in terms of their size distribution and fluorescence properties liquid chromatography organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond is a useful tool to elucidate the composition of nom in source and drinking waters as it classifies nom into size fractions typically associated with biopolymers 20 kda humic substances 1 20 kda building blocks 300 500 da low molecular weight organic acids and neutrals 350 da as per huber et al 2011 although eps associated polysaccharides and proteins are typically included in the biopolymer fraction huber et al 2011 analysis of extracted biofilm with lc ocd ond should not be directly interpreted using these categories results are therefore shown as relative size fractions fig 3 analysis of extracted biofilms using lc ocd ond showed a majority of organic carbon to be between 1 and 20 kda fig 3 a category that is typically associated with humic like substances in natural source waters while organic size fractions 20 kda are typically associated with biopolymers a protein profile of extracted biofilm has shown that their molecular sizes can reach above 100 kda andersson et al 2009 organic nitrogen fractions corresponded to 13 20 kda and 6 between 1 and 20 kda others have reported that the majority of eps can be composed of carbohydrates flemming et al 2007 these were not quantified in this study as carbohydrates are not typically considered to be n dbp precursors due to the lack of nitrogen in their chemical structure fluorescence excitation emission matrices feem can also be used to characterize nom peleato et al 2016 the analysis of biofilm extract showed two main peak intensities table 3 an example feem contour plot for extracted biofilm is included as fig s2 in the supplementary materials both peaks a and b ex em 260 450 nm and 330 450 nm suggest the presence of humic like substances wang et al 2009 and corroborate the larger contribution of organic carbon ranging from 1 to 20 kda which reflects the removal of bulk organic matter adsorbed to the gac media as well as biofilm components previous feem analyses of extracted biofilm have shown a higher presence of protein like content along with humic like substances perez and susa 2017 wang et al 2009 a predominant protein peak was not observed in the present study even though protein content had been verified using the pierce micro bca protein method further research into the use of feem for characterizing protein content of these sample matrices is suggested 3 4 surrogate measurements for biofilm characterization correlations were established between all measured parameters in extracted biofilm table s1 in supplementary materials while doc and ndma ufc fp were strongly and negatively correlated r 0 88 r2 0 78 doc and dcan ufc fp were not significantly correlated r 0 32 r2 0 10 of note extract proteins showed a moderate positive correlation with organic nitrogen constituents 20 kda r 0 76 r2 0 58 further corroborating that this fraction of lc ocd ond results includes biopolymers as well uv 254 measurements correlated highly with organic carbon ranging from 1 to 20 kda r 0 90 r2 0 81 offering support that a major portion of this lc ocd ond fraction may be composed of humic substances which are highly aromatic extract proteins were highly positively correlated with uv 280 r 0 90 and r2 0 82 indicating that uv measurements can serve as a resource efficient alternative to protein quantification tests potentially in an on line scenario while a moderately positive correlation was observed between dcan ufc fp and uv 280 r 0 74 r2 0 55 a strongly negative correlation was found between ndma ufc fp and uv 280 r 0 89 r2 0 79 indicating that uv measurements may not be suitable for monitoring all n dbp precursors with respect to time 3 5 ndma precursor removal during regular cyclical operation including filter start up biofilter influent and effluent were monitored over time to evaluate the presence of n dbp precursors during filter ripening immediately following start up of a full scale cyclically operated drinking water biofilter the diversity and abundance of microbial communities are dependent on operational factors such as the presence of oxidants available nutrients and type of filter media gerrity et al 2018 oh et al 2018 periods of intermittent stagnation can lead to microbial stress associated with nutrient limitation proctor and hammes 2015 the presence of biofilm related compounds in aqueous samples was estimated by measuring total atp tatp which increased during the first 20 min following filter start up fig 4 a the change in dissolved oxygen across the filter bed δdo increased over the same time period fig 4b atp has previously been correlated to the rate of oxygen utilization by biofilm simpson 2008 and as an increase in δdo occurred in tandem with a spike in tatp both parameters appear to indicate a temporary increase of metabolic activity in the biofilm these changes may be indicators of conditions present in the filter bed during stagnation since microbial activity is not completely suppressed during stagnation bacteria may continue to aerobically metabolize nutrients by consuming do and may also release tatp as filter start up occurs the water that is initially flushed out may be depleted in oxygen and enriched in tatp alternatively because microbial starvation typically takes place during stagnation due to a lack of nutrients this temporary change in tatp and δdo may be attributed to sloughing of biofilm related compounds through the filter although tatp was released from the filters and peaked at values up to 71 5 ng l between 5 and 15 min after start up the tatp reached steady state levels of 17 2 7 8 ng l in the effluent following 30 min of operation similarly δdo reached a maximum of 5 1 mg l within the same period and 1 8 1 0 mg l after 30 min because both tatp and δdo stabilized within 30 min of filter operation this can be considered as the time to reach steady state confirming that the filters were already in steady state during the reported media collection time of 1 h of operation following stagnation ufc fp tests were conducted on biofilter influent and effluent to determine whether temporary disruptions in operation translated to changes in n dbp precursor concentration stability with respect to ndma precursors was observed to be independent of operation time with 6 9 4 3 ng l of ndma ufc fp being consistently removed 30 min after start up a consistent concentration of 8 5 2 6 ng l of ndma ufc fp was observed in biofilter effluent over the entire 6 h sampling period fig 5 han4 ufc fp were measured however all biofilter effluent samples remained below detection limits 0 8 μg l although the present study shows a direct association between biofilm and n dbp precursors it appears that no ndma precursors are released during cyclical operation start up or normal operation ndma precursors can be removed by both biodegradation as well as adsorption liao et al 2015 a combination of these two processes may be occurring eps were not released along with intracellular atp during filter start up since ndma ufc fp remained stable while tatp spiked this confirms the robustness of the eps layer and suggests that n dbp precursors are more associated with extracellular material rather than intracellular material 4 conclusions eps can serve an important role in maintaining biofilm life supporting microbiome and removal of organic material in biofilters but it may also contribute n dbp precursors this study investigated n dbp ufc fp following chloramination of biofilm extract collected from drinking water bac media extract composition was evaluated using a combination of monitoring techniques including uv254 280 lc ocd ond and feem which demonstrated the presence of proteins as well as humic like substances likely originating from source water organics previously removed by the filter media the main conclusions are extracted biofilm represented a formation potential of 0 80 0 27 ng ndma g media and 18 7 3 3 ng dcan g media upon chloramination under uniform formation conditions ndma ufc fp of biofilter effluent remained at 8 5 2 6 ng l during cyclical operation and did not increase during filter start up following stagnation well operated cyclical biofilters should not release ndma precursors upon start up though biofilters that are regularly backwashed should be evaluated for release of precursors due to the vigorous nature of the backwash procedure and subsequent filter ripening biomass activity was stable at 298 55 ng atp g media during cold water 5 c conditions proteins were also stable in the biofilm layer and consistent with previously reported extract protein concentrations remaining at 93 5 8 1 μg extract proteins g media over three separate trials extracted biofilm contained a high

18954,the increased use of synthetic textiles in the last decades coupled with recent emphasis on the accumulation of micro plastic across multiple environmental compartments has garnered interest into how microplastic fibers are released into the environment in particular polyester textiles washed in the home have shown to release microplastic fibers but challenges with microplastic fiber analysis including time and difficulty of sample preparation and measurement has limited mechanistic studies on fiber fate and transport studies in this study we provide a method to synthesize fibers with an embedded inorganic in fingerprint which can be used as a tracer for ease of analysis and show the utility of this approach to assess the affinity for heteroaggregation between microplastic fibers and other particles in a heterogeneous suspension as well as approximate the fate of microplastic fibers in batch studies using activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp total in content in the fibers was measured to be 0 2 by weight which was low enough to not change fiber dynamics for fate and transport studies e g density etc but provided sensitive detection limits by icp ms fiber length was 510 μm 410 μm and 30 μm in diameter the incorporated metal remained stable inside the polymer when suspended in water and in activated sludge with 0 1 in leaching over two months in batch experiments the majority of fibers were associated with the sludge 99 9 with a mass balance of 95 recovery achieved on average across batches fiber removal linearly increased with contact times of up to 10 min suggesting interactions between plastics and organic matter is a metric that should be considered closely in this and other environmental contexts for fate and transport graphical abstract image 1 keywords plastic fiber wastewater sludge analysis 1 introduction synthetic fibers account for more than 60 of the world s fiber consumption with polyester polyamide acrylic and polyolefin being mostly used shui and plastina 2013 these fibers are utilized to produce synthetic textiles for various applications including apparel and upholstery textiles as well as textiles for agricultural medical or protection applications el mogahzy 2008 during their life cycle all textiles have the possibility to shed fibers and synthetic microplastic fibers are often considered environmental pollutants a significant fraction of microplastic debris throughout the environment marine system shorelines lakes soils etc is identified as microplastic fibers carr 2017 depending on the textile application there are different ways fibers can shed from the textiles and be released into the environment e g textiles may directly release fibers to the soil or shed fibers that contribute to atmospheric microplastic fiber pollution apparel textiles which shed fibers either while wearing or washing are considered a significant source of microplastic fibers to environment astrom 2016 cesa et al 2017 hartline et al 2016 hernandez et al 2017 napper and thompson 2016 pirc et al 2016 through these studies typical size of fibers released through laundering varied by study and is related to yarn textile manufacturing techniques and or final textile properties but most commonly ranged between 100 μm and 1 mm in length as many washing machines are not retrofitted with filters to capture microplastic fibers they are sent along with the washing machine wastewater stream to the domestic wastewater treatment plant wwtp several studies have attempted to determine the amount of microplastic which is withheld through wastewater treatment by sampling the number of microplastic pieces along the treatment chain of full scale wwtps in various locations across europe and the us browne et al 2011 carr et al 2016 leslie et al 2017 mason et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2017 while sampling strategies and analysis protocols varied by study lower particle size limits were typically the filter or sieve mesh size of between 11 and 300 μm the overall removal efficiency of microplastics in wwtp differed by study and or wwtp but it was generally large with between 60 and 95 of particulate plastic being retained in the sludge tertiary treatment was shown to remove an even greater percentage of plastic particles at least in the size fraction which was measured mintenig et al 2017 talvitie et al 2017 however not all of these studies measured fibers and or mention fiber retention in the plants explicitly and thus fiber specific retention may differ from other microplastic morphologies spheres beads fragments etc those which do take fibers into consideration often note that fibers are the most numerous morphology of microplastic measured to be released in the wwtp effluent browne et al 2011 talvitie et al 2015 indeed the concentration of microplastics downstream of wwtps was reported higher than in measurements upstream of the plants eriksen et al 2013 estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 hoellein et al 2014 mason et al 2016 this apparent disparity between high microplastic removal in wwtps and findings of microplastics particularly fibers downstream of wwtps may be due to high process water volume turnover rates alternatively fibers may simply be underrepresented when sampling wwtps sampling protocol for wwtp as well as other environmental compartments can still be greatly improved and standardized to achieve potentially more accurate results see e g talvitie et al 2017 and ort et al 2010 however extraction of microplastics and chemical analysis by an array of techniques micro ft ir micro raman etc have improved in the most recent of these studies and thus it is unlikely that general deficiencies in microplastic analysis in complex samples is the sole issue nevertheless a better mechanistic understanding of how the attachment and removal process of microplastic fibers is warranted in these systems to appreciate which factor s contribute to microplastic fiber retention through the wastewater treatment chain to gain an insight into microplastic fate and transport process studies in the laboratory can help to understand the behavior of microplastics in technical systems however these remain rare because of the huge time and effort typically needed to measure plastic in complex matrices to overcome some of the challenges of quantitative analysis of microplastic fibers in this study specially designed fibers with a conservative tracer were developed to be used in process studies to measure fibers at lower concentrations with higher fidelity than has been previously done before fibers were produced using a pilot scale fiber melting spinning plant for polymer extrusion which allowed for significant 1 kg quantities to be produced to use across all studies the fibers themselves have similar properties to fibers shed from apparel textiles but contain an indium in fingerprint which when spiked into a complex system with subsequent microwave digestion of the complete sample and metal analysis can be used to back calculate the concentration of fibers to ensure the quality and applicability of the fibers produced tests were carried out to demonstrate that the in inside the fiber was uniformly distributed and firmly bound inside the fiber with no leaching of metal over time these measurements allowed us to 1 ensure metal loading across the fiber was even to confirm a metal content to plastic fiber mass ratio 2 calculate the detection limit both in terms of total in and fiber concentrations and 3 ensure in was not leaching from the fibers over time in terms of applications it is anticipated that these materials will be suitable for a number of varied applications to study microplastic fate transport and interactions in diverse scenarios in laboratory pilot scale and mesocosm studies in this present work we have chosen one example to highlight their utility and the unique possibilities that exist by using trace metals analysis to circumvent the difficulties which presently exist for microplastic fiber analysis here batch studies were performed to simulate the activated sludge process of a municipal wwtp to assess the minimum potential retention efficiency of microplastic fibers here two aspects were investigated the time it took for fibers to become associated with organic matter and total plastic removal i e the fraction which was associated with the sludge opposed to the supernatant in a batch reactor ultimately this allowed for us to determine the minimum contact time which is needed for fiber sludge floc attachment and estimate what proportion of fibers we may expect to be released from a wwtp through the effluent 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot plant production of fibers 2 1 1 materials post condensated poly ethylene terephthalate pet in granular form was provided by serge ferrari tersuisse multifils sa switzerland the base material was pet 885 with a density of 1 4 g cm 3 and a viscosity index vi of 92 indium was added to the mixture as an indium salt indium iii acetylacetonate acquired by sigma aldrich 2 1 2 fiber melt spinning fiber melt spinning was carried out on a customized pilot melt spinning plant originally built by fourné polymertechnik alfter impekoven germany this pilot plant having features corresponding to an industrial plant enables the prototype production of multicomponent filaments with various cross sections and material combinations with a throughput of 0 1 5 kg h 1 further details about the pilot melt spinning plant can be found elsewhere hufenus et al 2012 in this work the pilot melt spinning line was assembled as depicted in figure s1 a single screw extruder with 14 mm diameter and a length to diameter ratio of 25 was used to melt and feed the polymer to a melt pump which in turn supplied the polymer melt at a fixed throughput to the spin pack a static mixer was installed between extruder and melt pump to improve the distributive mixing and temperature uniformity of the melt stream extruder pressures needed for an effective operation of the melt pump was 20 bar extruder and spin pack temperatures between 260 and 270 c and the nominal throughput of the gear pump was 4 5 cm3 min 1 the melt strength of the filament was too low for drawing in consequence the filament produced are as spun i e spun and solidified without drawing prior to extrusion 99 wt of pet and 1 wt of indium salt were physically mixed and vacuum dried for 12 h at 135 c the molten compound was spun through a circular monofilament die with an inner diameter of 0 5 mm and a capillary length to diameter ratio of l d 4 the fibers are produced from a standard pet commonly used for melt spinning and the fiber production plant is similar to an industrial production plant mainly differing in the smaller throughput of the pilot plant thus the resulting fibers and their performance are directly comparable to industrially produced pet fibers 2 2 fiber sample preparation and assessment of indium inclusion an analytical semi micro balance ax205 deltarange mettler was used to weigh all samples preparation of microplastic fibers were meant to mimic fibers shed during laundering textiles in terms of polyester properties diameter and length distribution hernandez et al 2017 the filament was cut using a santoku kitchen knife victorinox to produce fibers of micrometer length three sequential sieves mesh size 500 250 and 125 μm were used to achieve a narrower size distribution to assess the length distribution of the microplastic fibers more than 500 fibers were loaded onto a transparent petri dish and dispersed with the help of tweezers a light microscope szx2 ilit olympus was used with indirect illumination to ensure a high contrast of the fibers to the background the images obtained by the microscope were analyzed with the help of the ridge detection plugin of the software image j assessing the length of the fibers the lower cutoff for analysis was set to 0 05 μm to exclude any misidentification of contamination in the sample e g dust sem analysis of the cut fibers was carried out using a scanning electron microscope sem nanosem 230 feg fei at a voltage of 15 kv different weights of samples from different sections of the as spun filament were analyzed to 1 measure the concentration of indium inside the fiber and 2 the evenness of indium in the entire spool to ensure that the metal inside the fiber was stable the leaching potential was assessed six mesh bags containing approximately 100 mg of fiber each were put into the nitrification tank of a pilot scale wwtp on the eawag campus for eight weeks each week one bag was removed organic material washed from the surface of the fiber and three replicates of 25 mg fiber were digested and analyzed by icp ms the inclusion of indium after each week was compared to unaged fibers to assess metal leaching 2 3 sample digestion digestion was performed with a microwave digester ultraclave 4 mls gmbh in combination with a terminal 1640 interface mls gmbh and a chiller lab tech smart h150 1000 the microwave digester was operated at a pressure of 120 bar and a temperature of 250 c digestion tubes and caps were made of teflon sample volumes ranged between 1 and 5 ml and contained up to 50 mg microplastic fibers the digestion protocol figure s2 was derived from a digestion protocol for plastic digestion bergh of instruments 2004 and was modified to additionally break down the organic content of the matrix first 0 4 ml h2o2 was added to the sample in the digestion tube and allowed to stand for at least 10 min to decompose the organic matter second 4 ml hno3 and 0 2 ml h2so4 was added followed by acid microwave digestion 120 bar 250 c finally the sample was transferred to a polypropylene pp falcon tube the digestion tube was rinsed with h2o and the sample in the falcon tube was filled up to 50 ml digested samples were visually checked for solid residues to ensure a complete digestion 0 5 1 and 5 ppb of dissolved indium standard n 3 as well as 10 25 and 50 mg of fibers n 3 were digested in the presence of 2 ml of matrix di water wwtp effluent or mixed liquor from the wwtp nitrification tank diluted 1 500 and analyzed by icp ms to assess the digestion recovery 2 4 icp ms analysis elemental analysis was performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 8900 triple quad agilent technologies featuring an integrated sample introduction system isis micromist spray chamber and nickel cones to ensure a consistent quality of data all machine parameters were tuned automatically at the beginning of each day of analysis a calibration curve was prepared daily using a 1000 ppm indium standard with final dilutions of 0 0 5 1 2 5 and 5 ppb rhodium 0 1 mg l 1 was used as an internal standard for all measurements 2 5 wastewater samples and batch experiments effluent and mixed liquor samples were collected from the nitrification tank of a pilot scale wwtp at eawag this continuously running system is fed with real municipal wastewater from the city of dübendorf switzerland samples were used within 1 h after collection the background in concentration in the mixed liquor was measured by icp ms as less than 50 ng l 1 for measurement of the total suspended solid tss content of the mixed liquor a vacuum pump type me 2 müller krempel was used to separate the solids from the liquid phase the concentration of tss in mixed liquor samples ranged between 2 0 and 2 8 g l 1 2 5 1 sampling protocol and minimum sampling concentration to ensure representative sampling from mixed liquor spiked with microplastic fibers the minimum sampling size was investigated where an analysis was deemed successful by having over 95 recovery of fibers and less than 10 standard deviation across five replicate samples different weights of fibers 10 25 and 50 mg were spiked into 250 ml schott bottles containing 200 ml mixed liquor a magnetic stirring plate mix 8 xl 2 mag magnetic e motion was used to mix up to eight vessels simultaneously and was operated at 500 rpm samples of 1 5 and 10 ml n 5 were taken at 2 cm beneath the surface while mixing digested and analyzed by icp ms the minimum sampling concentration of microplastic fibers in mixed liquor was assessed by taking 10 ml samples n 5 from 20 25 33 50 125 and 250 mg fiber l 1 to determine the lowest concentration of fibers which still resulted in recovery of over 95 and a standard deviation of less than 10 the mass and the number of fibers at the minimum sampling concentration were calculated using their mean length and diameter 2 5 2 batch experiments schott bottles with 200 ml mixed liquor were spiked with 10 25 and 50 mg of microplastic fiber stirred continuously for 2 h at 500 rpm with subsequent settling for 30 min this process was meant to mimic the nitrification tank and secondary clarifier of a wwtp respectively three different compartments were formed after settling the air water interface the supernatant and the sludge figure s3 two different sampling methods were applied to assess the fate of the fibers in each compartment while ensuring a full mass balance fig 1 in the first approach i sequential 5 ml samples were taken gently from just below the air water interface until the total content of the batch was analyzed 40 samples to create a depth profile of the fibers in the batch reactor after sedimentation of the sludge the vessel was rinsed three times with 5 ml di h2o to re capture the remaining material sludge and fibers adhering to the wall the fibers recovered from the rinses were added to the concentration recovered in the sludge compartment additionally the depth profile of the tss in a similar batch reactor with no spiked fibers was assessed by analyzing the tss content in sequential 10 ml samples from the top layer repeatedly to enable a comparison between sludge and plastic depth profiles in the second approach ii 10 ml subsamples n 5 of each compartment were analyzed by measuring the volume of each compartment after sedimentation the weight of fibers in the subsamples were extrapolated to the entire compartment after sampling the air water interface and the supernatant both compartments were decanted and the sludge was re homogenized by mixing at 500 rpm for 20 min to ensure a representative and even distribution of fibers in the subsamples prior to sampling 2 5 3 affinity for fiber heteroaggreation with sludge flocs to assess the kinetics of heteroaggregation and or association of the fibers to the sludge flocs in the wastewater containers with either 200 ml mixed liquor or filtered mixed liquor and 25 mg microplastic fibers were mixed for 1 3 5 7 10 20 30 60 and 120 min all time points as separate reactors in triplicates and allowed to settle for 30 min a sample of 10 ml was taken from the supernatant 2 cm beneath the air water interface at each time point digested and analyzed by comparing the amount of buoyant fibers in different matrices conclusions could be drawn for the attachment of fibers to sludge flocs 3 results and discussion 3 1 fiber characteristics 3 1 1 indium concentration and stability of inclusion several samples of fiber 25 mg were taken randomly from the total mass of fiber produced and 0 19 0 005 in by weight was measured figure s4 when different weights of fiber were analyzed the concentration of in scaled linearly with fiber weight indicating that in is evenly distributed in the fibers at least in for the range of masses used in these experiments figure s5 the aged fiber samples showed no signs of leaching in since the average concentration measured after eight weeks suspended in the wwtp did not vary more than the standard deviation of the unaged fibers fig 2 3 1 2 fiber length distribution fiber morphology and the length distribution of more than 500 microplastic fibers were analyzed figure s6 with a length distribution from 0 05 to 1 5 mm fig 3 the mean length was 0 51 mm and over 80 of all fibers had a length between 0 1 and 0 8 mm with only 4 of fibers longer than 1 mm hernandez et al found a comparable length distribution when observing fibers released from polyester textiles after laundering hernandez et al 2017 thus the fiber length distribution created here represents a good estimation of microplastics released from textiles during the wash cycle 3 2 digestion and sampling protocol dissolved in icp ms standard and in containing fibers were separately spiked into di water effluent or mixed liquor digested and analyzed to test if the digestion process had any effect on subsequent in recovery both the in standard figure s7a and fibers figure s7b show an acceptable recovery across all matrices with an average of 99 8 1 5 dissolved in standard and 100 3 1 6 in doped fibers respectively while most studies on microplastic analysis stress the need for standardized sampling often little is done for quality assurance or quality control here we evaluated the effects of sampling volume and number of sample replicates on fiber collection and reproducibility of results for these studies an acceptable sampling protocol was assessed to be when concentrations equal to at least 95 of spiked fibers with a standard deviation of less than 10 across all replicates was achieved 10 25 or 50 mg of fibers were spiked into 200 ml mixed liquor with subsequent sample sizes of 1 5 and 10 ml in fiber recoveries of 68 37 86 17 and 98 8 were achieved for these sample volumes respectively fig 4 a therefore by increasing the sampling size while keeping the same number of replicates n 5 the precision and accuracy of the measurements were increased this is likely because the fibers essentially form hot spots of in inside the vessel and thus a larger sampling volume increased the chances of sampling a more representative number of fibers this also means that the differences of concentration of in between the replicates are reduced decreasing the standard deviation since five replicates of 10 ml sampling volume resulted in the most representative results it was chosen to be the sampling method to be applied in further experiments the minimum sampling concentration of microplastic fibers in mixed liquor was assessed by decreasing the fiber concentration until the recovery was less than 95 and or the standard deviation across all replicates was above 10 the concentration of 33 mg of microplastic fibers per liter of mixed liquor showed a satisfactory result in terms of recovery 97 but had a standard deviation of 10 fig 4b therefore 50 mg l 1 recovery 100 6 was determined to be the minimum sampling concentration of microplastic fibers in mixed liquor when applying the sampling protocol delineated above i e 5 replicates of 10 ml sample size this concentration is dependent on the chance of catching a representative mass of fibers in a sample and therefore limited by morphological properties of the cut fibers i e fiber length and number per a given plastic mass as well as the distribution of the fibers in the matrix naturally fiber size fiber concentration sample size and number of replicates are correlated and thus one must determine what is the appropriate sampling regime for each experimental system of interest for this system the fiber number detection limit can be determined for the sampling protocol outlined above considering the properties of the fiber including the average length 0 51 mm and diameter 0 05 mm as well as the density of polyethylene terephthalate pet ρ 1 4 g cm 3 approximately 360 fibers in a sample of 10 ml are the minimum sampling concentration of fibers in mixed liquor for more details see the supplemental information this corresponds to 0 1 mg l 1 in it is important to note that the detection limit of in when analyzing with an icp ms is much lower 0 05 μg l 1 and therefore the minimum sampling concentration in mixed liquor is based on the sampling protocol and how evenly the fibers are distributed in the sample rather than the concentration of fibers in the sample alone if slightly less recovery was expected and or a higher standard deviation were considered acceptable the detection limit of fibers could likewise be decreased while this fiber concentration is higher than other studies which monitor for and measure microplastic particles and fibers in the environment by showing that representative sampling is not achieved at lower concentrations this brings up a serious point as to assessing how representative the current field sampling techniques are naturally there are other considerations which make the difficulty of field sampling understandably challenging including larger volumes to analyze fluctuations of microplastic fibers over time and space as well as difficulty and time of typical microplastic analysis in survey studies the sample sizes and volumes will be much greater than those which were employed here and so results in that respect are not directly transferable nevertheless understanding the effects of sampling size and replicates should be brought more to the forefront of surveys of microplastics in natural systems 3 3 wwtp batch experiments and fiber association with sludge flocs to assess the allocation of the fibers in settled sludge two different sampling methods were applied to vessels of mixed liquor and fibers after sedimentation in the depth profile method i fig 1 91 4 of the spiked fibers could be recovered with 89 4 of the fibers found in the sludge and 2 1 found in the rinses fig 5 panels a and b this means that over 99 9 of the fibers recovered in the samples were associated with the sludge and less than 0 1 in the supernatant since the concentration of the fibers increased with the depth in tandem with the tss content this supports the hypothesis that the fibers were associated with and or entangled with the sludge flocs after decanting the supernatant re homogenization of the sludge phase and sub sampling method ii fig 1 the recovery of the fibers increased to 98 27 99 23 and 100 20 for 10 25 and 50 mg of spiked fibers respectively fig 5 panels c and d no fibers were found in the supernatant in that set of studies therefore homogenization of the settled sludge was necessary to enable representative subsamples for a complete mass balance in general this result shows that concentration gradients are an important and challenging aspect when collecting subsamples from a given set up and should be carefully considered when designing an experiment and sampling regime as it was shown that the fibers are generally associated with the sludge flocs the kinetics of this attachment process was assessed vessels containing mixed liquor or filtered mixed liquor were spiked with 25 mg fibers and mixed for different lengths of time between 1 min and 2 h prior to settling 30 min in filtered mixed liquor the concentration in the supernatant remained steady between 3 3 and 4 4 mg fiber l 1 6 2 8 3 μg in l 1 fig 6 in comparison the concentration of fibers in the supernatant of the mixed liquor batch was at a comparable concentration after 1 min of mixing with subsequent settling 3 7 1 8 mg fiber l 1 7 1 2 5 μg in l 1 but monotonically decreased to 0 2 0 2 mg fiber l 1 0 2 0 2 μg in l 1 after 10 min of fiber contact time with the sludge therefore we can demonstrate that fibers are more quickly removed from the system when sludge flocs are present and removal is not dependent on the settling of fibers alone moreover this attachment occurs relatively quickly on the order of minutes compared to the time scales involved in the sewer and wastewater treatment process on the order of hours given the residence time of sludge in a large wastewater treatment plant greatly exceeds the minimum mixing time to fulfill fiber attachment to sludge flocs this strongly suggests that microplastic fibers will predominantly be attached to sludge flocs or solids in the sewer system or treatment process additionally reason would suggest the possibility that fibers are already associated with organic matter before entering the sludge treatment system i e association occurs already in the sewer system 3 3 1 from households to the environment fate and transport of microplastic fibers in the lab scale experiment representing the activated sludge process of a wwtp the majority of fibers recovered in the samples 99 were found associated with the sludge due to agglomeration with organic matter and or the density dependent setting of the fibers themselves if the same driving factors are at play in a large scale wwtp as they are in the bench top batch studies fate and transport conclusions can be made for pet fibers entering a wastewater treatment system as fibers will be associated with the sludge further microplastic fiber fate will lean heavily towards sludge processing and use opposed to release with the effluent into receiving waters and riverine transport the main applications of sewage sludge in the eu are incineration and application and composting with different shares varying from country to country bianchini et al 2016 the interest in sludge application in agriculture is due to its soil conditioning properties and nutrition content to fertilize the land in the european union up to five million dry tons of sewage sludge are used as agricultural fertilizer or deposited on land each year willén et al 2017 although land application and composting are intended to decrease in the upcoming years high investment costs are still discouraging the transition to incineration in many countries bianchini et al 2016 it has been suggested that the widespread application of sludge municipal wwtp to farmland is a major input of plastics to agricultural soil and it has been shown that microplastic fibers with the same characteristics as those found in municipal wwtp were detected even after 15 years post sludge application nizzetto et al 2016 zubris and richards 2005 synthetic fibers therefore can even be an indicator of sewage sludge application to soils and their detection long after sludge application emphasizes how these materials can accumulate and persist once directly applied to the environment the explicit hazards of microplastic fibers in soil or any other environmental compartment have not been pinpointed yet and thus a risk assessment is not able to be performed for microplastic fiber containing sludge to soil when it is found that plastics have a certain hazard and the risk is better known new laws could introduce limits for plastic in sewage sludge for example in the last 20 years the occurrence of heavy metals in sludge and their fate and toxicity with regard to land application has led to regulations and to the trend of incineration verlicchi and zambello 2015 conversely other emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals have been reported in sewage sludge and can result in negative effects but to date there are still no set limits or regulations on concentration verlicchi and zambello 2015 while it is clear that the majority of microplastic fibers seemingly are retained in the wwtp sludge from this and other survey studies a measurable fraction is still released and detectable in receiving waters in this study it was shown that the attachment of the microplastic fiber to organics in the wwtp is an important mechanism which can dominate fate and transport even if all microplastic fibers attach to organics in the wwtp floating sludge flocs and bacteria would still inevitably lead to microplastic fibers in the effluent since the concentration of organics in the effluent of a wwtp is dependent on the type of treatment this could partially explain synthetic fibers found in the effluent and some of the variability between different plants additionally the presence of filamentous bacteria is a common problem in wwtps that can appear if variations in the effluent occur e g temperature flow rate nutrient rate or if the load of organics entering the system is low since filamentous microorganisms attain high growth rates despite low substrate and oxygen levels these problems often lead to bulking and foaming sludge and increase in tss release which may in turn increase the release of microplastics which are associated with this material 4 conclusions the three main goals of this work were to mechanistically understand microplastic fiber sludge interactions assess sampling and sample size implications on microplastic fiber analysis and provide a proof of concept study to show the utility of using metal doped microplastic fibers to more easily and quickly assess these interactions than is possible with many other techniques that are used within the microplastics community to date additionally the retention rate of microplastic fibers in wwtps was estimated by investigating lab scale batch systems representing the activated sludge and settling tank a complete mass balance of fibers was obtained 95 recovery and the vast majority of microplastic fibers approximately 99 were found to be associated with the sludge after sedimentation within this settled sludge a gradient of microplastic fibers along with increasing tss content over depth was observed association was relatively quick 15 min of contact time between microplastic fibers and sludge and therefore these lab scale tests suggest that the majority of microplastic fibers entering a wwtp will likely attach to sludge flocs and therefore be retained in the sludge through waste treatment however monitoring studies have shown microplastic fibers in the effluent and receiving waters of wwtps and so based on the attachment studies performed here we suggest this likely derives from floating sludge flocs and organics in the effluent nevertheless a clear majority of the fibers will enter the sludge treatment system and will be applied to land or incinerated depending on the sludge treatment system of the plant and the legislation in a given country beyond the case studies specifically highlighted here these metal doped microplastic fibers are suitable to study fate transport eco toxicity and

18954,the increased use of synthetic textiles in the last decades coupled with recent emphasis on the accumulation of micro plastic across multiple environmental compartments has garnered interest into how microplastic fibers are released into the environment in particular polyester textiles washed in the home have shown to release microplastic fibers but challenges with microplastic fiber analysis including time and difficulty of sample preparation and measurement has limited mechanistic studies on fiber fate and transport studies in this study we provide a method to synthesize fibers with an embedded inorganic in fingerprint which can be used as a tracer for ease of analysis and show the utility of this approach to assess the affinity for heteroaggregation between microplastic fibers and other particles in a heterogeneous suspension as well as approximate the fate of microplastic fibers in batch studies using activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp total in content in the fibers was measured to be 0 2 by weight which was low enough to not change fiber dynamics for fate and transport studies e g density etc but provided sensitive detection limits by icp ms fiber length was 510 μm 410 μm and 30 μm in diameter the incorporated metal remained stable inside the polymer when suspended in water and in activated sludge with 0 1 in leaching over two months in batch experiments the majority of fibers were associated with the sludge 99 9 with a mass balance of 95 recovery achieved on average across batches fiber removal linearly increased with contact times of up to 10 min suggesting interactions between plastics and organic matter is a metric that should be considered closely in this and other environmental contexts for fate and transport graphical abstract image 1 keywords plastic fiber wastewater sludge analysis 1 introduction synthetic fibers account for more than 60 of the world s fiber consumption with polyester polyamide acrylic and polyolefin being mostly used shui and plastina 2013 these fibers are utilized to produce synthetic textiles for various applications including apparel and upholstery textiles as well as textiles for agricultural medical or protection applications el mogahzy 2008 during their life cycle all textiles have the possibility to shed fibers and synthetic microplastic fibers are often considered environmental pollutants a significant fraction of microplastic debris throughout the environment marine system shorelines lakes soils etc is identified as microplastic fibers carr 2017 depending on the textile application there are different ways fibers can shed from the textiles and be released into the environment e g textiles may directly release fibers to the soil or shed fibers that contribute to atmospheric microplastic fiber pollution apparel textiles which shed fibers either while wearing or washing are considered a significant source of microplastic fibers to environment astrom 2016 cesa et al 2017 hartline et al 2016 hernandez et al 2017 napper and thompson 2016 pirc et al 2016 through these studies typical size of fibers released through laundering varied by study and is related to yarn textile manufacturing techniques and or final textile properties but most commonly ranged between 100 μm and 1 mm in length as many washing machines are not retrofitted with filters to capture microplastic fibers they are sent along with the washing machine wastewater stream to the domestic wastewater treatment plant wwtp several studies have attempted to determine the amount of microplastic which is withheld through wastewater treatment by sampling the number of microplastic pieces along the treatment chain of full scale wwtps in various locations across europe and the us browne et al 2011 carr et al 2016 leslie et al 2017 mason et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2017 while sampling strategies and analysis protocols varied by study lower particle size limits were typically the filter or sieve mesh size of between 11 and 300 μm the overall removal efficiency of microplastics in wwtp differed by study and or wwtp but it was generally large with between 60 and 95 of particulate plastic being retained in the sludge tertiary treatment was shown to remove an even greater percentage of plastic particles at least in the size fraction which was measured mintenig et al 2017 talvitie et al 2017 however not all of these studies measured fibers and or mention fiber retention in the plants explicitly and thus fiber specific retention may differ from other microplastic morphologies spheres beads fragments etc those which do take fibers into consideration often note that fibers are the most numerous morphology of microplastic measured to be released in the wwtp effluent browne et al 2011 talvitie et al 2015 indeed the concentration of microplastics downstream of wwtps was reported higher than in measurements upstream of the plants eriksen et al 2013 estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 hoellein et al 2014 mason et al 2016 this apparent disparity between high microplastic removal in wwtps and findings of microplastics particularly fibers downstream of wwtps may be due to high process water volume turnover rates alternatively fibers may simply be underrepresented when sampling wwtps sampling protocol for wwtp as well as other environmental compartments can still be greatly improved and standardized to achieve potentially more accurate results see e g talvitie et al 2017 and ort et al 2010 however extraction of microplastics and chemical analysis by an array of techniques micro ft ir micro raman etc have improved in the most recent of these studies and thus it is unlikely that general deficiencies in microplastic analysis in complex samples is the sole issue nevertheless a better mechanistic understanding of how the attachment and removal process of microplastic fibers is warranted in these systems to appreciate which factor s contribute to microplastic fiber retention through the wastewater treatment chain to gain an insight into microplastic fate and transport process studies in the laboratory can help to understand the behavior of microplastics in technical systems however these remain rare because of the huge time and effort typically needed to measure plastic in complex matrices to overcome some of the challenges of quantitative analysis of microplastic fibers in this study specially designed fibers with a conservative tracer were developed to be used in process studies to measure fibers at lower concentrations with higher fidelity than has been previously done before fibers were produced using a pilot scale fiber melting spinning plant for polymer extrusion which allowed for significant 1 kg quantities to be produced to use across all studies the fibers themselves have similar properties to fibers shed from apparel textiles but contain an indium in fingerprint which when spiked into a complex system with subsequent microwave digestion of the complete sample and metal analysis can be used to back calculate the concentration of fibers to ensure the quality and applicability of the fibers produced tests were carried out to demonstrate that the in inside the fiber was uniformly distributed and firmly bound inside the fiber with no leaching of metal over time these measurements allowed us to 1 ensure metal loading across the fiber was even to confirm a metal content to plastic fiber mass ratio 2 calculate the detection limit both in terms of total in and fiber concentrations and 3 ensure in was not leaching from the fibers over time in terms of applications it is anticipated that these materials will be suitable for a number of varied applications to study microplastic fate transport and interactions in diverse scenarios in laboratory pilot scale and mesocosm studies in this present work we have chosen one example to highlight their utility and the unique possibilities that exist by using trace metals analysis to circumvent the difficulties which presently exist for microplastic fiber analysis here batch studies were performed to simulate the activated sludge process of a municipal wwtp to assess the minimum potential retention efficiency of microplastic fibers here two aspects were investigated the time it took for fibers to become associated with organic matter and total plastic removal i e the fraction which was associated with the sludge opposed to the supernatant in a batch reactor ultimately this allowed for us to determine the minimum contact time which is needed for fiber sludge floc attachment and estimate what proportion of fibers we may expect to be released from a wwtp through the effluent 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot plant production of fibers 2 1 1 materials post condensated poly ethylene terephthalate pet in granular form was provided by serge ferrari tersuisse multifils sa switzerland the base material was pet 885 with a density of 1 4 g cm 3 and a viscosity index vi of 92 indium was added to the mixture as an indium salt indium iii acetylacetonate acquired by sigma aldrich 2 1 2 fiber melt spinning fiber melt spinning was carried out on a customized pilot melt spinning plant originally built by fourné polymertechnik alfter impekoven germany this pilot plant having features corresponding to an industrial plant enables the prototype production of multicomponent filaments with various cross sections and material combinations with a throughput of 0 1 5 kg h 1 further details about the pilot melt spinning plant can be found elsewhere hufenus et al 2012 in this work the pilot melt spinning line was assembled as depicted in figure s1 a single screw extruder with 14 mm diameter and a length to diameter ratio of 25 was used to melt and feed the polymer to a melt pump which in turn supplied the polymer melt at a fixed throughput to the spin pack a static mixer was installed between extruder and melt pump to improve the distributive mixing and temperature uniformity of the melt stream extruder pressures needed for an effective operation of the melt pump was 20 bar extruder and spin pack temperatures between 260 and 270 c and the nominal throughput of the gear pump was 4 5 cm3 min 1 the melt strength of the filament was too low for drawing in consequence the filament produced are as spun i e spun and solidified without drawing prior to extrusion 99 wt of pet and 1 wt of indium salt were physically mixed and vacuum dried for 12 h at 135 c the molten compound was spun through a circular monofilament die with an inner diameter of 0 5 mm and a capillary length to diameter ratio of l d 4 the fibers are produced from a standard pet commonly used for melt spinning and the fiber production plant is similar to an industrial production plant mainly differing in the smaller throughput of the pilot plant thus the resulting fibers and their performance are directly comparable to industrially produced pet fibers 2 2 fiber sample preparation and assessment of indium inclusion an analytical semi micro balance ax205 deltarange mettler was used to weigh all samples preparation of microplastic fibers were meant to mimic fibers shed during laundering textiles in terms of polyester properties diameter and length distribution hernandez et al 2017 the filament was cut using a santoku kitchen knife victorinox to produce fibers of micrometer length three sequential sieves mesh size 500 250 and 125 μm were used to achieve a narrower size distribution to assess the length distribution of the microplastic fibers more than 500 fibers were loaded onto a transparent petri dish and dispersed with the help of tweezers a light microscope szx2 ilit olympus was used with indirect illumination to ensure a high contrast of the fibers to the background the images obtained by the microscope were analyzed with the help of the ridge detection plugin of the software image j assessing the length of the fibers the lower cutoff for analysis was set to 0 05 μm to exclude any misidentification of contamination in the sample e g dust sem analysis of the cut fibers was carried out using a scanning electron microscope sem nanosem 230 feg fei at a voltage of 15 kv different weights of samples from different sections of the as spun filament were analyzed to 1 measure the concentration of indium inside the fiber and 2 the evenness of indium in the entire spool to ensure that the metal inside the fiber was stable the leaching potential was assessed six mesh bags containing approximately 100 mg of fiber each were put into the nitrification tank of a pilot scale wwtp on the eawag campus for eight weeks each week one bag was removed organic material washed from the surface of the fiber and three replicates of 25 mg fiber were digested and analyzed by icp ms the inclusion of indium after each week was compared to unaged fibers to assess metal leaching 2 3 sample digestion digestion was performed with a microwave digester ultraclave 4 mls gmbh in combination with a terminal 1640 interface mls gmbh and a chiller lab tech smart h150 1000 the microwave digester was operated at a pressure of 120 bar and a temperature of 250 c digestion tubes and caps were made of teflon sample volumes ranged between 1 and 5 ml and contained up to 50 mg microplastic fibers the digestion protocol figure s2 was derived from a digestion protocol for plastic digestion bergh of instruments 2004 and was modified to additionally break down the organic content of the matrix first 0 4 ml h2o2 was added to the sample in the digestion tube and allowed to stand for at least 10 min to decompose the organic matter second 4 ml hno3 and 0 2 ml h2so4 was added followed by acid microwave digestion 120 bar 250 c finally the sample was transferred to a polypropylene pp falcon tube the digestion tube was rinsed with h2o and the sample in the falcon tube was filled up to 50 ml digested samples were visually checked for solid residues to ensure a complete digestion 0 5 1 and 5 ppb of dissolved indium standard n 3 as well as 10 25 and 50 mg of fibers n 3 were digested in the presence of 2 ml of matrix di water wwtp effluent or mixed liquor from the wwtp nitrification tank diluted 1 500 and analyzed by icp ms to assess the digestion recovery 2 4 icp ms analysis elemental analysis was performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 8900 triple quad agilent technologies featuring an integrated sample introduction system isis micromist spray chamber and nickel cones to ensure a consistent quality of data all machine parameters were tuned automatically at the beginning of each day of analysis a calibration curve was prepared daily using a 1000 ppm indium standard with final dilutions of 0 0 5 1 2 5 and 5 ppb rhodium 0 1 mg l 1 was used as an internal standard for all measurements 2 5 wastewater samples and batch experiments effluent and mixed liquor samples were collected from the nitrification tank of a pilot scale wwtp at eawag this continuously running system is fed with real municipal wastewater from the city of dübendorf switzerland samples were used within 1 h after collection the background in concentration in the mixed liquor was measured by icp ms as less than 50 ng l 1 for measurement of the total suspended solid tss content of the mixed liquor a vacuum pump type me 2 müller krempel was used to separate the solids from the liquid phase the concentration of tss in mixed liquor samples ranged between 2 0 and 2 8 g l 1 2 5 1 sampling protocol and minimum sampling concentration to ensure representative sampling from mixed liquor spiked with microplastic fibers the minimum sampling size was investigated where an analysis was deemed successful by having over 95 recovery of fibers and less than 10 standard deviation across five replicate samples different weights of fibers 10 25 and 50 mg were spiked into 250 ml schott bottles containing 200 ml mixed liquor a magnetic stirring plate mix 8 xl 2 mag magnetic e motion was used to mix up to eight vessels simultaneously and was operated at 500 rpm samples of 1 5 and 10 ml n 5 were taken at 2 cm beneath the surface while mixing digested and analyzed by icp ms the minimum sampling concentration of microplastic fibers in mixed liquor was assessed by taking 10 ml samples n 5 from 20 25 33 50 125 and 250 mg fiber l 1 to determine the lowest concentration of fibers which still resulted in recovery of over 95 and a standard deviation of less than 10 the mass and the number of fibers at the minimum sampling concentration were calculated using their mean length and diameter 2 5 2 batch experiments schott bottles with 200 ml mixed liquor were spiked with 10 25 and 50 mg of microplastic fiber stirred continuously for 2 h at 500 rpm with subsequent settling for 30 min this process was meant to mimic the nitrification tank and secondary clarifier of a wwtp respectively three different compartments were formed after settling the air water interface the supernatant and the sludge figure s3 two different sampling methods were applied to assess the fate of the fibers in each compartment while ensuring a full mass balance fig 1 in the first approach i sequential 5 ml samples were taken gently from just below the air water interface until the total content of the batch was analyzed 40 samples to create a depth profile of the fibers in the batch reactor after sedimentation of the sludge the vessel was rinsed three times with 5 ml di h2o to re capture the remaining material sludge and fibers adhering to the wall the fibers recovered from the rinses were added to the concentration recovered in the sludge compartment additionally the depth profile of the tss in a similar batch reactor with no spiked fibers was assessed by analyzing the tss content in sequential 10 ml samples from the top layer repeatedly to enable a comparison between sludge and plastic depth profiles in the second approach ii 10 ml subsamples n 5 of each compartment were analyzed by measuring the volume of each compartment after sedimentation the weight of fibers in the subsamples were extrapolated to the entire compartment after sampling the air water interface and the supernatant both compartments were decanted and the sludge was re homogenized by mixing at 500 rpm for 20 min to ensure a representative and even distribution of fibers in the subsamples prior to sampling 2 5 3 affinity for fiber heteroaggreation with sludge flocs to assess the kinetics of heteroaggregation and or association of the fibers to the sludge flocs in the wastewater containers with either 200 ml mixed liquor or filtered mixed liquor and 25 mg microplastic fibers were mixed for 1 3 5 7 10 20 30 60 and 120 min all time points as separate reactors in triplicates and allowed to settle for 30 min a sample of 10 ml was taken from the supernatant 2 cm beneath the air water interface at each time point digested and analyzed by comparing the amount of buoyant fibers in different matrices conclusions could be drawn for the attachment of fibers to sludge flocs 3 results and discussion 3 1 fiber characteristics 3 1 1 indium concentration and stability of inclusion several samples of fiber 25 mg were taken randomly from the total mass of fiber produced and 0 19 0 005 in by weight was measured figure s4 when different weights of fiber were analyzed the concentration of in scaled linearly with fiber weight indicating that in is evenly distributed in the fibers at least in for the range of masses used in these experiments figure s5 the aged fiber samples showed no signs of leaching in since the average concentration measured after eight weeks suspended in the wwtp did not vary more than the standard deviation of the unaged fibers fig 2 3 1 2 fiber length distribution fiber morphology and the length distribution of more than 500 microplastic fibers were analyzed figure s6 with a length distribution from 0 05 to 1 5 mm fig 3 the mean length was 0 51 mm and over 80 of all fibers had a length between 0 1 and 0 8 mm with only 4 of fibers longer than 1 mm hernandez et al found a comparable length distribution when observing fibers released from polyester textiles after laundering hernandez et al 2017 thus the fiber length distribution created here represents a good estimation of microplastics released from textiles during the wash cycle 3 2 digestion and sampling protocol dissolved in icp ms standard and in containing fibers were separately spiked into di water effluent or mixed liquor digested and analyzed to test if the digestion process had any effect on subsequent in recovery both the in standard figure s7a and fibers figure s7b show an acceptable recovery across all matrices with an average of 99 8 1 5 dissolved in standard and 100 3 1 6 in doped fibers respectively while most studies on microplastic analysis stress the need for standardized sampling often little is done for quality assurance or quality control here we evaluated the effects of sampling volume and number of sample replicates on fiber collection and reproducibility of results for these studies an acceptable sampling protocol was assessed to be when concentrations equal to at least 95 of spiked fibers with a standard deviation of less than 10 across all replicates was achieved 10 25 or 50 mg of fibers were spiked into 200 ml mixed liquor with subsequent sample sizes of 1 5 and 10 ml in fiber recoveries of 68 37 86 17 and 98 8 were achieved for these sample volumes respectively fig 4 a therefore by increasing the sampling size while keeping the same number of replicates n 5 the precision and accuracy of the measurements were increased this is likely because the fibers essentially form hot spots of in inside the vessel and thus a larger sampling volume increased the chances of sampling a more representative number of fibers this also means that the differences of concentration of in between the replicates are reduced decreasing the standard deviation since five replicates of 10 ml sampling volume resulted in the most representative results it was chosen to be the sampling method to be applied in further experiments the minimum sampling concentration of microplastic fibers in mixed liquor was assessed by decreasing the fiber concentration until the recovery was less than 95 and or the standard deviation across all replicates was above 10 the concentration of 33 mg of microplastic fibers per liter of mixed liquor showed a satisfactory result in terms of recovery 97 but had a standard deviation of 10 fig 4b therefore 50 mg l 1 recovery 100 6 was determined to be the minimum sampling concentration of microplastic fibers in mixed liquor when applying the sampling protocol delineated above i e 5 replicates of 10 ml sample size this concentration is dependent on the chance of catching a representative mass of fibers in a sample and therefore limited by morphological properties of the cut fibers i e fiber length and number per a given plastic mass as well as the distribution of the fibers in the matrix naturally fiber size fiber concentration sample size and number of replicates are correlated and thus one must determine what is the appropriate sampling regime for each experimental system of interest for this system the fiber number detection limit can be determined for the sampling protocol outlined above considering the properties of the fiber including the average length 0 51 mm and diameter 0 05 mm as well as the density of polyethylene terephthalate pet ρ 1 4 g cm 3 approximately 360 fibers in a sample of 10 ml are the minimum sampling concentration of fibers in mixed liquor for more details see the supplemental information this corresponds to 0 1 mg l 1 in it is important to note that the detection limit of in when analyzing with an icp ms is much lower 0 05 μg l 1 and therefore the minimum sampling concentration in mixed liquor is based on the sampling protocol and how evenly the fibers are distributed in the sample rather than the concentration of fibers in the sample alone if slightly less recovery was expected and or a higher standard deviation were considered acceptable the detection limit of fibers could likewise be decreased while this fiber concentration is higher than other studies which monitor for and measure microplastic particles and fibers in the environment by showing that representative sampling is not achieved at lower concentrations this brings up a serious point as to assessing how representative the current field sampling techniques are naturally there are other considerations which make the difficulty of field sampling understandably challenging including larger volumes to analyze fluctuations of microplastic fibers over time and space as well as difficulty and time of typical microplastic analysis in survey studies the sample sizes and volumes will be much greater than those which were employed here and so results in that respect are not directly transferable nevertheless understanding the effects of sampling size and replicates should be brought more to the forefront of surveys of microplastics in natural systems 3 3 wwtp batch experiments and fiber association with sludge flocs to assess the allocation of the fibers in settled sludge two different sampling methods were applied to vessels of mixed liquor and fibers after sedimentation in the depth profile method i fig 1 91 4 of the spiked fibers could be recovered with 89 4 of the fibers found in the sludge and 2 1 found in the rinses fig 5 panels a and b this means that over 99 9 of the fibers recovered in the samples were associated with the sludge and less than 0 1 in the supernatant since the concentration of the fibers increased with the depth in tandem with the tss content this supports the hypothesis that the fibers were associated with and or entangled with the sludge flocs after decanting the supernatant re homogenization of the sludge phase and sub sampling method ii fig 1 the recovery of the fibers increased to 98 27 99 23 and 100 20 for 10 25 and 50 mg of spiked fibers respectively fig 5 panels c and d no fibers were found in the supernatant in that set of studies therefore homogenization of the settled sludge was necessary to enable representative subsamples for a complete mass balance in general this result shows that concentration gradients are an important and challenging aspect when collecting subsamples from a given set up and should be carefully considered when designing an experiment and sampling regime as it was shown that the fibers are generally associated with the sludge flocs the kinetics of this attachment process was assessed vessels containing mixed liquor or filtered mixed liquor were spiked with 25 mg fibers and mixed for different lengths of time between 1 min and 2 h prior to settling 30 min in filtered mixed liquor the concentration in the supernatant remained steady between 3 3 and 4 4 mg fiber l 1 6 2 8 3 μg in l 1 fig 6 in comparison the concentration of fibers in the supernatant of the mixed liquor batch was at a comparable concentration after 1 min of mixing with subsequent settling 3 7 1 8 mg fiber l 1 7 1 2 5 μg in l 1 but monotonically decreased to 0 2 0 2 mg fiber l 1 0 2 0 2 μg in l 1 after 10 min of fiber contact time with the sludge therefore we can demonstrate that fibers are more quickly removed from the system when sludge flocs are present and removal is not dependent on the settling of fibers alone moreover this attachment occurs relatively quickly on the order of minutes compared to the time scales involved in the sewer and wastewater treatment process on the order of hours given the residence time of sludge in a large wastewater treatment plant greatly exceeds the minimum mixing time to fulfill fiber attachment to sludge flocs this strongly suggests that microplastic fibers will predominantly be attached to sludge flocs or solids in the sewer system or treatment process additionally reason would suggest the possibility that fibers are already associated with organic matter before entering the sludge treatment system i e association occurs already in the sewer system 3 3 1 from households to the environment fate and transport of microplastic fibers in the lab scale experiment representing the activated sludge process of a wwtp the majority of fibers recovered in the samples 99 were found associated with the sludge due to agglomeration with organic matter and or the density dependent setting of the fibers themselves if the same driving factors are at play in a large scale wwtp as they are in the bench top batch studies fate and transport conclusions can be made for pet fibers entering a wastewater treatment system as fibers will be associated with the sludge further microplastic fiber fate will lean heavily towards sludge processing and use opposed to release with the effluent into receiving waters and riverine transport the main applications of sewage sludge in the eu are incineration and application and composting with different shares varying from country to country bianchini et al 2016 the interest in sludge application in agriculture is due to its soil conditioning properties and nutrition content to fertilize the land in the european union up to five million dry tons of sewage sludge are used as agricultural fertilizer or deposited on land each year willén et al 2017 although land application and composting are intended to decrease in the upcoming years high investment costs are still discouraging the transition to incineration in many countries bianchini et al 2016 it has been suggested that the widespread application of sludge municipal wwtp to farmland is a major input of plastics to agricultural soil and it has been shown that microplastic fibers with the same characteristics as those found in municipal wwtp were detected even after 15 years post sludge application nizzetto et al 2016 zubris and richards 2005 synthetic fibers therefore can even be an indicator of sewage sludge application to soils and their detection long after sludge application emphasizes how these materials can accumulate and persist once directly applied to the environment the explicit hazards of microplastic fibers in soil or any other environmental compartment have not been pinpointed yet and thus a risk assessment is not able to be performed for microplastic fiber containing sludge to soil when it is found that plastics have a certain hazard and the risk is better known new laws could introduce limits for plastic in sewage sludge for example in the last 20 years the occurrence of heavy metals in sludge and their fate and toxicity with regard to land application has led to regulations and to the trend of incineration verlicchi and zambello 2015 conversely other emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals have been reported in sewage sludge and can result in negative effects but to date there are still no set limits or regulations on concentration verlicchi and zambello 2015 while it is clear that the majority of microplastic fibers seemingly are retained in the wwtp sludge from this and other survey studies a measurable fraction is still released and detectable in receiving waters in this study it was shown that the attachment of the microplastic fiber to organics in the wwtp is an important mechanism which can dominate fate and transport even if all microplastic fibers attach to organics in the wwtp floating sludge flocs and bacteria would still inevitably lead to microplastic fibers in the effluent since the concentration of organics in the effluent of a wwtp is dependent on the type of treatment this could partially explain synthetic fibers found in the effluent and some of the variability between different plants additionally the presence of filamentous bacteria is a common problem in wwtps that can appear if variations in the effluent occur e g temperature flow rate nutrient rate or if the load of organics entering the system is low since filamentous microorganisms attain high growth rates despite low substrate and oxygen levels these problems often lead to bulking and foaming sludge and increase in tss release which may in turn increase the release of microplastics which are associated with this material 4 conclusions the three main goals of this work were to mechanistically understand microplastic fiber sludge interactions assess sampling and sample size implications on microplastic fiber analysis and provide a proof of concept study to show the utility of using metal doped microplastic fibers to more easily and quickly assess these interactions than is possible with many other techniques that are used within the microplastics community to date additionally the retention rate of microplastic fibers in wwtps was estimated by investigating lab scale batch systems representing the activated sludge and settling tank a complete mass balance of fibers was obtained 95 recovery and the vast majority of microplastic fibers approximately 99 were found to be associated with the sludge after sedimentation within this settled sludge a gradient of microplastic fibers along with increasing tss content over depth was observed association was relatively quick 15 min of contact time between microplastic fibers and sludge and therefore these lab scale tests suggest that the majority of microplastic fibers entering a wwtp will likely attach to sludge flocs and therefore be retained in the sludge through waste treatment however monitoring studies have shown microplastic fibers in the effluent and receiving waters of wwtps and so based on the attachment studies performed here we suggest this likely derives from floating sludge flocs and organics in the effluent nevertheless a clear majority of the fibers will enter the sludge treatment system and will be applied to land or incinerated depending on the sludge treatment system of the plant and the legislation in a given country beyond the case studies specifically highlighted here these metal doped microplastic fibers are suitable to study fate transport eco toxicity and
