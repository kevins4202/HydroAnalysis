19195,denitrifying sulfur conversion associated enhanced biological phosphorous removal ds ebpr system is not only a novel wastewater treatment process but also an ideal model for microbial ecology in a community context however it exists the knowledge gap on the roles and interactions of functional microorganisms in the ds ebpr system for carbon c nitrogen n phosphorus p and sulfur s bioconversions we use genome resolved metagenomics to build up an ecological model of microbial communities in a lab scale ds ebpr system with stable operation for more than 400 days our results yield 11 near complete draft genomes that represent a substantial portion of the microbial community 39 4 sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob promote complex metabolic processes and interactions for c n p and s conversions bins 1 4 and 10 are considered as new potential polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos in which bins 1 4 can be considered as s related paos s paos with no previously cultivated or reported members our findings give an insight into a new ecological system with c n p and s simultaneous bioconversions and improve the understanding of interactions among srb sob denitrifiers and paos within a community context graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological phosphorus removal sulfate reducing bacteria srb sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob metabolic mechanisms metagenomics 1 introduction biological nutrients removal has been widely applied in wastewater treatment to remove both nitrogen n and phosphorus p from wastewater to protect receiving waters from eutrophication in addition sulfur s associated contamination has caused concerns about corrosion and odor emission due to the application of seawater toilet flushing and sulfate coagulants during drinking water treatment recently the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated sani process has been developed and applied to simultaneously remove organic carbon c and n using sulfur biotransformation for electron transport to achieve sludge minimization and energy saving in saline sewage treatment wang et al 2009 lu et al 2012 very recently this sulfur associated biological process has been further upgraded to achieve sulfur driven denitrifying phosphorous removal in a ds ebpr process denitrifying sulfur conversion associated enhanced biological phosphorous removal process wu et al 2013 2014 the ds ebpr process is based on a synergy between sulfur transformation and poly phosphate poly p accumulating metabolism under anaerobic conditions p will be released associated with acetate uptake poly p and glycogen hydrolysis as well as polyhydroxyalkanoate pha and polysulfide and or elemental sulfur poly s intracellular formation under anoxic conditions p will be luxuriously uptaken associated with poly p and glycogen formation sulfur driven denitrification as well as pha and poly s degradation wu et al 2013 compared with the conventional enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr process the ds ebpr system enables successful biological sludge reduction and simultaneous removal of c n and p in a broad range of operational conditions such as ph and temperature with association of s biotransformation wu et al 2013 2014 yu et al 2016 the ds ebpr system is not only an attractive wastewater treatment process but also an ideal model for microbial ecology because it involves microbial interactions in four key bioconversions including c n p and s however a comprehensive study of the microbial interaction among c n p and s bioconversions is lacking previous studies of microbial communities in the ds ebpr system only focused on the identification of dominant microorganisms based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing for instance it was reported that neither conventional polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos e g candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis and tetrasphaera related bacteria nor major glycogen accumulating organisms gaos e g candidatus competibacter phosphatis and defluviicoccus vanus related bacteria were detected wu et al 2014 yu et al 2016 both sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob were enriched which synergistically contribute to maintain sulfur conversion intensity for achieving a stable ds ebpr performance guo et al 2016 although our recent study offered insights for possible interactions among functional bacteria denitrifying phosphorus removing thauera sulfate reducing desulfobacter and nitrate reducing and sulfide oxidizing thiobacillus zhang et al 2017 both the functional content of their genomes and their interactions among c n p and s bioconversions remain unknown in addition a study rubio rincón et al 2017 indicated that thiothrix caldifontis as a sulfide oxidizing microbe could play pao like roles with a mixotrophic metabolism for p removal using an intracellular sulfur pool as energy source however the understanding and identification of s based paos in ebpr have been largely overlooked the aims of this study are 1 to identify the key microorganisms involved in various biotransformations of c n p and s 2 to unravel the functional potential and metabolic pathways of the identified microorganisms at the genome scale resolution level and 3 to propose a conceptual ds ebpr ecosystem model showing insights into sulfur associated denitrifying p removal based on the representative genomes so the sludge samples from a long term operated ds ebpr system with a stable performance are collected for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and metagenomic sequencing a metagenome of the microbial community in this ds ebpr system is generated and 11 near complete draft genomes are binned to represent a substantial portion of the microbial communities the interactions among key microorganisms involved in c n p and s bioconversions are also elucidated in this study it is expected that our results will uncover important metabolic pathways of n p and s that have been previously overlooked and also shed light on the microbial interactions regarding four key elements c n p and s in a community context 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation conditions a lab scale ds ebpr sbr with a working volume of 20 l was operated under alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions fig 1 a for removing c n and p with s conversion in the stimulated saline wastewater synthetic wastewater the cyclic operation of sbr and the composition of synthetic wastewater were summarized in supplementary information si page s2 in si the sbr was operated with mechanical stirring at 400 rpm at 22 2 c for 400 days to cultivate functional microorganisms and achieve a stable sulfur driven denitrifying phosphorus removal the performance of sbr at steady state i e on day 315 was presented as the typical cycle measurements fig 1c and d 2 2 dna extraction metagenome and 16s rrna gene sequencing and data analyses three dna samples were extracted at the end of anoxic phase in the ds ebpr on day 315 details presented in si one of the dna sample was used for metagenome sequencing and the other two for 16s rrna gene sequencing for metagenomic sequencing two independent libraries with insert size of 500 bp and 750 bp were generated from the total dna dna sequences were pair end sequenced 2 250 bp on an illumina hiseq 2500 instrument producing approximately 17 8 gbp and 36 gbp of sequences respectively raw reads from different libraries were quality controlled using homemade perl scripts as described previously hua et al 2015 briefly the duplicated reads caused by the pcr amplification were removed firstly also we removed the sequences with a significant excess of n 10 of the base pairs for each paired end read the remaining reads with low quality phred value 20 were trimmed at both ends then the combined reads for the two libraries with different insert sizes were assembled using idba ud peng et al 2012 with following parameters mink 20 maxk 100 step 20 min contig 200 pre correction scaffolds with length 2500 bp were eliminated from further analysis due to the lower accuracy of short sequences for genome binning qualified metagenomic data were mapped onto the assembled scaffolds to compute the coverage information using bbmap version 38 85 http sourceforge net projects bbmap with the parameters as k 15 minid 0 9 build 1 then samtools li et al 2009 was used to sort the generated bam format file and coverage information was computed by the jgi summarize bam contig depths command in metabat kang et al 2015 metabat kang et al 2015 was used to generate the initial bins based on the tetranucleotide frequency and coverage information of generated scaffolds genome completeness was estimated using checkm version 1 0 5 parks et al 2015 genome bins with completeness 50 were kept and optimized manually to remove the contaminations the bins and bins that clustered together and shared similar coverage were combined and visualized by esom dick et al 2009 for the final bins gene prediction was determined using genemark zhu et al 2010 finally functional annotations for each bin were conducted based on comparisons to the kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes eggnog evolutionary genealogy of genes non surprised orthologous groups and ncbi nr national center for biotechnology information non redundant databases using the diamond program buchfink et al 2015 with e values 1e 5 to reconstruct the metabolic pathways for each bin kaas moriya et al 2007 was used to map all the predicted putative genes onto different modules in the kegg system especially those genes related to c n p and s pathways the methods of 16s rrna gene sequencing and analysis were detailed as described in our previous study zhang et al 2017 briefly raw reads with low quality phred value 20 at both ends were trimmed as described above flash reyon et al 2012 was used to assemble each pair end reads of the generated quality reads then adaptors and primers were removed for each assembled scaffold by mothur version 1 29 schloss et al 2009 and chimeric sequences were identified and removed using qiime caporaso et al 2010 subsequently after that the remaining sequences were clustered into otus at the 97 similarity level and taxonomic information was assigned using rdp classifier wang et al 2007 also 16s rrna gene sequences from metagenomic data were extracted and analyzed to recruit the 16s rrna gene sequences scaffolds were first used to search the rdp database matched regions were then extracted based on the start and end position of alignments only hits with length 400 bp were kept for later analysis taxonomic assignments were conducted by comparing extracted sequences to web based ncbi nr database as a sequence pool quality reads were mapped on them using bbmap version 38 85 http sourceforge net projects bbmap with the parameters as k 15 minid 0 97 build 1 relative abundance at the genus level were calculated as r i 1 i c i 1 j c j 100 where i represents recruited sequences that belonged to a specific genus and j means all the extracted sequences c stands for the read count of the corresponding sequence in addition programs used for data interpretation are described in si all data supporting the findings of this study are available in this paper and si sequencing data are deposited at the ncbi sequence read archive under the accession numbers srr6924042 and srr6906104 3 results 3 1 ds ebpr reactor performance a lab scale ds ebpr sequencing batch reactor sbr was operated for 400 days fig 1a the solids retention time srt was kept at 80 days the reactor was fed with influent concentrations of acetate and sulfate of 68 5 2 9 mg c l and 208 3 3 6 mg s l respectively in anaerobic phase while nitrate of 29 7 1 5 mg n l was fed to the reactor in anoxic phase after day 270 the concentrations of acetate nitrate and sulfate in the effluent were 0 0 mg c l 0 0 mg n l and 205 1 4 3 mg s l fig 1b indicating that the reactor entered a quasi steady state acetate added at the beginning of the anaerobic phase was completely consumed while glycogen degradation and pha formation occurred during the 7 5 hour period of anaerobic conditions simultaneously phosphate was released from poly p stored within bacterial cells in the subsequent anoxic conditions glycogen was generated while pha was consumed at the same time the phosphate was luxuriously taken up as poly p fig 1c and fig s1 in si the net p removal of the ds ebpr system was 7 5 0 3 mg p l and without chemical p removal these bioconversion trends were consistent with the phenotype of a typical ebpr system carvalho et al 2007 differently through sulfur s related microorganisms sulfate reduction sulfide formation and poly s production were observed during anaerobic conditions fig 1d this illustrates that electrons were transferred to sulfate through the s reduction from acetate in the subsequent anoxic conditions nitrate was immediately added at the end of the anaerobic phase as the only electron acceptor nitrate was completely consumed by using sulfide and poly s as electron donors within 2 h simultaneously sulfate production along with sulfide and poly s oxidation were observed fig 1d this illustrates that electrons were transferred from acetate to drive microbial sulfate reduction to sulfide collectively the unique operational mode of the ds ebpr system achieved efficient removals of total c n and p 3 2 community overview in order to reveal the microbial community structure we conducted both 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and metagenomic sequencing in total 22 834 sequences were generated based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing metagenomic sequencing of the whole community dna extracted from the ds ebpr system yielded a total of 778 914 675 bp total base pairs after quality filtering table s1 in si co assembly of the resulting reads using idba ud peng et al 2012 generated a total of 452 966 scaffolds length 500 bp with an n50 of 2599 bp in total 1 102 134 protein encoding genes average length of 624 bp and average guanine and cytosine gc content of 52 2 were predicted for each draft genome using genemark zhu et al 2010 the community composition was determined by both the amplicon based profiles and the 16s rrna gene sequences extracted from the metagenomes based on the 16s rrna gene from the metagenomes the most abundant populations belonged to the phyla proteobacteria delta and beta proteobacteria with 23 1 and 19 7 respectively chloroflexi 19 4 acidobacteria 17 5 bacteroidetes 3 3 chlorobi 2 8 acidobacteria 2 0 od1 1 4 tenericutes 1 1 and firmicutes 0 6 fig 2 sulfur sulfide oxidizing microorganism e g thiobacillus thiovirga and chromatiaceae accounted for 7 1 while the relative abundance of sulfate sulfite reducing microorganism e g geobacter desulfobulbaceae pelobacteraceae desulfobacteraceae was 22 8 in addition the triangular mark representing photosynthetic sob were detected including green sulfur bacteria gsb of 2 1 and purple sulfur bacteria psb of 1 3 fig s2 in si however several differences could be observed between the amplicon and metagenome based community profiles for example propionicimonas was detected with an abundance of up to 14 7 in the metagenome while this population was not found by16s rrna gene sequencing likely due to a primer mismatch for the forward primer 515f used in the amplicon sequencing approach fig s2 in si in addition due to existing pcr primer and amplification biases amplicon based studies might suffer from lower taxonomic resolution compared to metagenomics thus probably underestimating the community vanwonterghem et al 2016 for example od1 was detected in the metagenomic dataset fig s2 in si while it was absent in the amplicon based dataset the metagenomic data were successfully assembled in 11 high quality draft genomes the 11 genomes ranged in size between 2 2 and 3 7 mb across a gc content range between 47 7 and 66 1 table 1 the genome coverage of the dominant and representative populations was sufficiently complete to confidently infer presence and absence of pathways and thereby allowed a comprehensive metabolic reconstruction table 1 the taxonomic information was evaluated by comparing contigs against ncbi nr database using blastx to decipher potential roles of microorganisms in c n p and s bioconversions in the ds ebpr system functional annotations were conducted interestingly five key types of functional bacteria were assembled including srb bins 1 4 desulfobacteraceae and bins 5 6 desulfobulbaceae nitrate reduction sob nr sob bin 7 thiobacillus gsb bins 8 9 chlorobium denitrifying bacterium bin 10 thauera and other acetate oxidizer bin 11 geobacter most genomes are divergent from the genomes in public databases except for the genomes bin 1 bin 2 and bin 11 comparative genomic analyses indicate that these three bins exhibit a relatively closer relationship to desulfatirhabdium butyrativorans desulfobacter postgatei and geobacter lovleyi respectively sharing 58 5 93 7 and 74 1 with amino acid identity fig s3 in si the genes of the core metabolic pathways of ds ebpr system were listed in table s2 in si these metagenomic sequencing data provided sufficient resolution to obtain a comprehensive insight into the prokaryotic microbial community involved in c n p and s bioconversions in the ds ebpr system 3 3 potential players in p n and s conversions in the ds ebpr system for the p conversion the marker genes polyphosphate kinase ppk1 and exopolyphosphatase ppx are involved in the aggregation and degradation of poly p respectively rao et al 2009 fig 3 and table s2 in si the ppk1 is generally thought to be a phylogenetic marker gene for conventional paos mcmahon et al 2002 rao et al 2009 we retrieved fragments of ppk1 sequences from the metagenome and phylogenetically compared the reference sequences downloaded from the ncbi database and from a previous study carvalho et al 2007 the ppk1 phylogenetic tree shows a variety of categories with five phyla proteobacteria firmicutes chlorobi chloroflexi and bacteroidetes in the ds ebpr system fig 4 moreover some bacteria associated with s conversions were found to be rich in the ppk1 gene such as sob thiobacillus and chlorobium and srb desulfobacter and geobacter indicating their possible function in poly p aggregation the accumulibacter clades are close together and have some evolutionary distance from other populations rich in the ppk1 gene interestingly all retrieved ppk1 sequences were not assigned to accumulibacter clades i abcde and ii abcdefghx even though accumulibacter clades have been recognised as the dominant bacteria responsible for acetate uptake in conventional ebpr systems zhu et al 2010 this matches with previous reports that no conventional paos were detected in the ds ebpr system wu et al 2014 yu et al 2016 based on genomic analysis all assembled bins 1 11 carried the ppk1 and ppx genes fig 3 and table s2 in si in addition bins 1 4 and 11 could shuttle phosphate pi across its plasma membrane via a high affinity pi transporter pst and low affinity inorganic pi transporter pit bins 5 6 bin 7 and bins 8 9 might shuttle pi only via the pst while bin 10 could shuttle pi only through the pit fig 3 and table s2 in si for the n associated conversion we firstly evaluated the genomes for marker genes encoding key enzymes relevant to nitrogen transformations fig 3 and table s2 in si the marker genes used in this study included nitrate reductase alpha subunit narg nitrite reductase no forming nirs nitric oxide reductase subunit b norb and nitrous oxide reductase nosz for denitrification bedzyk et al 1999 jones et al 2008 nitrate reductase napa or narg as well as nitrite reductase cytochrome c 552 nrfa or nitrite reductase nadh large subunit nirb for nh4 formation einsle et al 1999 kraft et al 2011 both bin 7 and bin 10 encoded the key enzymes for complete denitrification from nitrate to dinitrogen gas the bins 1 4 encoded the narg and bins 5 6 encoded the napa for no2 formation from no3 while bins 1 4 5 6 and 11 encoded nrfa and bins 7 and 10 encoded nirb for dissimilatory nitrite reduction to nh4 formation bins 8 and 9 did not contain any of the aforementioned n associated conversion genes nh4 can be further transported into the cytoplasm to synthesize organic n for the survival and growth of bacteria based on the needs of nutrient element n cerqueda garcia et al 2014 as the ds ebpr reactor is an s driven ecosystem s related microorganisms play important roles in sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation in anaerobic and anoxic conditions in the ds ebpr system for the s loop the reversible marker genes mainly include sulfate adenylyltransferase sat adenylylsulfate reductase ab aprab and dsrab type dissimilatory bi sulfite reductase dsrab for sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation wagner et al 1998 zhou et al 2011 the poly s possibly served as electron and energy storage materials like pha and glycogen wu et al 2013 yu et al 2016 the marker gene for poly s metabolisms is the sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr shahak et al 1992 gregersen et al 2011 for poly s formation in addition the poly s was able to be transformed to sulfate via enzymes encoded by the reverse sulfate reduction gene cluster fike et al 2015 we firstly evaluated the distribution of marker genes dsrab in microbial communities fig 5 which either catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide during anaerobic respiration of sulfate sulfite and organosulfonates or acts in reverse during s oxidation muller et al 2015 the reductive type dsra and dsrb genes were mainly derived from the firmicutes supercluster and delta proteobacteria supercluster in this study the main distribution of the reduced dsrab genes appear predominantly in bins 1 4 and 6 delta proteobacteria as typical srb which play important roles in sulfate reduction our results are consistent with previous study muller et al 2015 which has shown that reductive dsrab genes are mainly distributed in the four classes of bacteria delta proteobacteria firmicutes nitrospirae and thermodesulfobacteria and two classes of archaea euryarchaeota and crenarchaeota in contrast the oxidative dsrab sequences from sob are phylogenetically distinct from all other reductive dsrab sequences fig 5 the oxidized dsrab genes appear predominantly in bin 7 beta proteobacteria and bins 8 9 chlorobi for the poly s metabolism we found that the genome of bin 7 and bins 8 9 contained the core genes for poly s formation sqr as well as sulfide oxidation dsrab aprab and sat fig 3 and table s2 in si which are essential for the sulfide oxidation under anoxic conditions 3 4 integrating inferred niches and activities in a system model according to the reactor performance and the functions derived from the assembled draft genomes we propose an ecological model of c n p and s biotransformations catalyzed by various microbial communities in the ds ebpr system fig 6 it highlights the major metabolic pathways likely to be used by these populations during the anaerobic and anoxic conditions of the ds ebpr system there are two major categories srb and sob in this system fig 6 in anaerobic conditions acetate can be taken up by srb and sob into cells forming carbon storage polymers in the cells and producing co2 the so4 2 in the system is completely reduced to the hs s2 by the srb where a small amount of hs s2 is oxidized by the gsb and form poly s in the periplasm it explains why the ds ebpr reactor exhibited an ascending trend in poly s in anaerobic conditions srb degrade poly p and release po4 3 to the bulk liquid when acetate is completely consumed no3 is immediately added as electron acceptor to create anoxic conditions the no3 can be used for complete oxidation of hs s2 to so4 2 by the sob some of the no3 is also used by ordinary denitrifiers whereby complete denitrification occurs for the production of n2 the remainder of the no3 can also be taken up by bacteria for meeting physiological needs of organic n cerqueda garcia et al 2014 the poly s is further oxidized to produce so4 2 as well as co2 fixation by the gsb eisen et al 2002 simultaneously the po4 3 uptake from the bulk liquid occurs together with an increase in intracellular poly p this schematic of the ds ebpr illustrates that the s related bacteria are important for the c n p and s coupling system the metabolic functions of key players are explained below in further details acetate oxidizing srb under anaerobic conditions adding acetate into the system created a niche ecosystem for bins 1 4 and bins 5 6 which metagenomic data indicated complete sulfate reduction sat aprab and dsrab coupled to acetate oxidation zhou et al 2011 also bins 1 4 shuttled pi across its plasma membrane via pst and pit fig 6 the poly p can be used directly to synthesize adenosine triphosphate atp or be degraded into pi encoded by ppx gene for atp production via f atpases garcia martin et al 2006 the atp generated is then used for acetate uptake under anoxic conditions genes necessary for nitrate reduction narg and nrfa kraft et al 2011 and ammonium transportation into the cytoplasm amt soupene et al 1998 were detected in addition since the pi concentrations are at their lowest level the pi transported into the cell during anoxic conditions can be synthesized into poly p encoded by the ppk1 gene via atp the scavenging capability with relatively low levels of pi through the low affinity pit transporter may contribute to superior ds ebpr performance in bins 1 4 glycogen is hydrolyzed via the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway under anaerobic conditions to provide energy and reducing power for synthesis of pha from the assimilated c source while it was synthesized in the subsequent anoxic conditions draft genomic data further indicated that bins 1 4 and bins 5 6 were motile by means of flagella and they also transported amino acids and arginine figs s4 and s5 in si nr sob the draft genomic data indicated that bin 7 could fix carbon dioxide via the calvin benson bassham calvin cycle montoya et al 2012 to support chemolithoautotrophic growth under anaerobic conditions the relevant genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle glycogen degradation and calvin cycle were detected without pha formation in addition the stored glycogen is degraded by the emp pathway gpi erdal 2002 the glycogen will be degraded and coupled with the tca cycle and f atpase for the synthesis of atp the generated atp will meet the need for cell maintenance energy under anoxic conditions nitrate dependent sulfide oxidation occurs for energy generation for the production of glycogen thiobacillus oxidizes sulfide meanwhile reducing nitrate to n2 and ammonium according to the draft genome fig 6 sulfide oxidation may proceed via the sulfide oxidation pathway sqr dsrab aprab and sat with poly s formation this suggests that bin 7 is able to use sulfur compounds as electron donors in its energy metabolism lutters czckalla 1990 like thiobacillus denitrificans in addition on the basis of genomic evidence it was speculated that the poly p cycling could not be performed without the low affinity pit transporter since the pit seems to be a prerequisite for poly p cycling mcllroy et al 2014 fig s6 in si gsb chlorobium belongs to the class chlorobia of the phylum chlorobi which was originally isolated from the acidic hydrothermal waters in new zealand wahlund et al 1991 chlorobia is a proprietary anaerobic photosynthetic autotrophic bacterium which is widely distributed in aquatic environments and is also exposed to hypoxic aquatic environments containing reduced sulfur compounds according to the draft genome assembled fig 6 bins 8 9 could enter into the forward oxidative tca cycle and autotrophic co2 fixation via the reverse reductive rtca cycle it has been reported that chlorobium can not only grow through rtca to assimilate co2 but also generate energy through the tca cycle tang and blankenship 2010 the bins 8 9 also have the glycogen synthesis which is obviously more conducive to utilizing the stored energy in the cell under anoxic conditions it could use sulfide a small amount of the sulfide is produced from sulfate reduction as sources of s as well as co2 as electron acceptor cork et al 1983 the sqr in our metagenomic data operated in oxidizing sulfide to form intracellular poly s fig 6 and fig s7 in si in addition the poly p cycling could not be performed without the pit mcllroy et al 2014 it indicated that the bins 8 9 could couple sulfide oxidation to the co2 fixation in addition the further oxidation of sulfide to sulfate probably took place in the cytoplasm by using dsrab aprab and sat a sulfate exporter encoded by sulp was identified in the genome although it is widely believed that chlorobium is an inorganic autotrophic sob vanwonterghem et al 2016 it can also use glycogen cycling to facilitate cell growth tang and blankenship 2010 here the chlorobium is also a bacterium with sulfide oxidation and autotrophic co2 fixation rtca cycle capabilities denitrifying pao d pao in previous studies some clades of accumulibacter were considered as d paos flowers et al 2009 nielsen et al 2012 only a few studies suggested that thauera was a d pao tsuneda et al 2005 but there is limited information about its capacity of poly p metabolism based on metagenomic sequencing bin 10 belonging to the betaproteobacteria has a heterotrophic acetate assimilation capability in this study bin 10 has the ability to convert acetate into pha coupled with poly p degradation metabolic pathways at the same time poly p was degraded into pi ppx and achieved anaerobic phosphorus release another important role of poly p degradation is to provide atp in the anoxic conditions bin 10 continued the tca for atp supply the f atpase constantly pumped h outside into the cell as the formation of electrochemical proton gradient for driving atp synthesis the atp was used for poly p formation meanwhile the poly p accumulated via ppk1 gene to achieve the effect of biological p removal thauera is also known as nitrate reducing bacteria mao et al 2014 in addition to the complete nitrate reduction to produce n2 narg nirs norb and nosz and the produced nh3 nirb and amt could also enter the cell for organic n biosynthesis nevertheless only limited information could be found to reveal the possible role of thauera in denitrifying poly p accumulation tsuneda et al 2005 and no denitrifying poly p accumulating metabolism was built based on thauera mainly because it has not been described as a model organism like accumulibacter hence up to date little is known about the poly p accumulating function of thauera the key genes dsrab required for s transport and metabolism were absent in bin 10 indicating no existence of sulfide oxidation in addition the key gene for flagellar synthesis by bin 10 was identified bin 10 can be regarded as a d pao with pha synthesis and complete nitrate reduction and could play an important role in the p and n removal in the ds ebpr system the genomic information of bin 10 thauera provides an insight into the ecological functional diversity of this important bacterium with a new metabolic model fig 6 and fig s8 in si other acetate oxidizer geobacter a member of the geobacteraceae family belonging to the delta proteobacteria is known as a metal reducing bacterium and is an important component of subsurface environments methe et al 2003 most of the studies on geobacter focus on heavy metal reduction methe et al 2003 sung et al 2006 and have not been involved in simultaneous studies of c n p and s metabolisms in this study bin 11 was a heterotrophic bacterium ueki et al 2012 that could assimilate acetate into the tca cycle and form glycogen with sulfite reduction fig 6 at the same time the degradation of poly p was achieved in anaerobic conditions under anoxic conditions in order to maintain the proton gradient difference between the inside and outside of the cell extracellular h would be transported through the f atpase into the cell resulting in atp while glycogen degradation produced atp and nadh in addition the pyruvate generated from glycogen degradation also entered the tca cycle to produce atp and nadh the large amount of atp was used for the synthesis of poly p to achieve biological p uptake it could also achieve the reduction of sulfite under the action of the nrfa gene kemp et al 2010 fig s9 in si 4 discussion this study unraveled microbial communities and their interactions in a well controlled ds ebpr system by using high throughput metagenomic sequencing to our knowledge it is the first metagenomic characterization on a microbial ecological system involving c n p and s bioconversions metagenomic data emphasized the diversity of the microbial community metabolic pathways and different evolutionary history of ppk1 and dsrab genes in the ds ebpr system in addition to the microbial community we could assign most of the organisms to niches in the ds ebpr system based on our experimental results and the metagenomic content this allowed us to infer an ecological model of the microbial ecosystem segregating into anaerobic and anoxic conditions a microbial ecology model with coupling c n p and s biotransformations was also proposed in a community context which will improve the understanding of interactions among srb sob denitrifiers and paos the ecological model we proposed provides an explanation for the effective performance of this ds ebpr reactor and is consistent with the performance data of the reactor fig 1 it also offers an ecosystem role for s related paos which was previously not understood however it should be noted that the proposed model is based on genome content and differential abundance of the genomes in a community context and requires further validation through e g metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics or enrichment isolation of critical microorganisms from the ds ebpr reactor furthermore since these organisms evolved from different environments as compared to the ds ebpr reactor that they were cultivated some genetic functions that were identified may have become redundant as also recognised in metagenomic studies regarding other microorganisms metagenomic data emphasized the diversity of mechanisms that may be important in situ allowing the five representative bacteria bins 1 4 desulfobacteraceae bins 5 6 desulfobulbaceae bin 7 thiobacillus bins 8 9 chlorobium bin 10 thauera and bin 11 geobacter to adapt their metabolic activities to changes in environmental conditions our results provide a potential role for the dominant members of the microbial community we retrieved 11 draft genomes from a lab scale ds ebpr system in which some bacteria can be considered as new paos that were not previously cultivated the key enzymes of ppk1 and ppx were found in all of these core bacteria in addition bins 1 4 and bin 11 carried the pst and pit transporters meanwhile bins 5 6 bin 7 and bins 8 9 had only the high affinity pst transporter while bin 10 could shuttle pi only through the pit transporter however it should be noted that only bins 1 4 and bin 10 carried the acetyl coa acetyltransferase phaa garcia martin et al 2006 which mediate the pha formation and storage thus enabling to behave like paos the presence of the low affinity pit transporter has been previously shown to be crucial in distinguishing between typical paos and typical gaos as even gaos who do not accumulate poly p under most conditions found in wastewater treatment plants possess ppk1 ppx and pst mcllroy et al 2014 nobu et al 2014 thus bins 5 6 bin 7 and bins 8 9 should not be considered as new potential paos since they do not possess the low affinity pit transporter further they should also not be considered as gao since they are unable to synthesize pha which is characteristic of anaerobic gao metabolism the organisms of bins 1 4 possess the genetic framework to be considered as s paos since they are capable of anaerobic sulfate reduction in conjunction with acetate uptake pha formation glycolysis and p release as well as anoxic denitrification partial denitrification from no3 to no2 pha consumption glycogen and poly p formation an important function of poly p in bins 1 4 is to adapt to changing environments between anaerobic and anoxic conditions in the ds ebpr system the poly p degradation provides atp which is beneficial to the poly p accumulation under the anoxic condition without the energy from the sulfate reduction these bins generated in this study could serve as an extension and supplement of conventional paos rao et al 2009 he et al 2010 it broadens the understanding of paos diversity and is of great significance to the study of microbial functional diversity from the point view of the s loop sulfate reduction mediated by srb in the ds ebpr system is of great significance however a potential impact of sulfide from sulfate reduction toxicity on community composition and function cannot be excluded the presence of sob might solve the negative effects of high sulfide in this system since the sob can oxidize sulfide as electron donor our recent study has proposed syntrophic growth between srb and nr sob in co culture such that a positive feedback cycle was established between the reductive and oxidative processes of these two bacteria zhang et al 2017 metagenomic results also indicate that a similar mechanism existed between srb bins 1 4 and bins 5 6 and nr sob bin 7 and a syntrophic growth of autotrophic or possibly mixotrophic bins 8 9 were supported by sulfide and co2 generated by heterotrophic respiration the formation of poly s mediated by bin 7 and bins 8 9 might be caused by the partial oxidation of sulfide probably to poly s in the anaerobic conditions and a complete re oxidation from sulfide to sulfate is conducted by bin 7 which is coupled with denitrification and bins 8 9 in anoxic conditions cardoso et al 2006 fig 6 these results suggest s amendment promoted complex organismal and metabolic processes and interactions involved in c n p and s cycling the assembled bins 1 6 have capability for microbial sulfate reduction as srb among these six bins only bins 1 4 can not only perform sulfate reduction but also have capability for poly p storage and release thus playing an important role in this system the bins 1 4 as newly discovered s paos have been overlooked previously in contrast the bins 5 6 only have the metabolism of sulfate reduction bin 7 is nr sob but does not have any p metabolism in addition bins 8 9 only had sulfide oxidation function while bin 10 was d pao and has no s metabolism function it should be noted that the synergy among srb s paos sob and d paos provides a strong guarantee for the denitrifying sulfur conversion assisted ebpr moreover it highlighted the importance of s related bacteria in the ds ebpr system for the competition relationship in the ds ebpr ecosystem the bin 10 d pao competed for acetate with bins 1 4 and 5 6 in anaerobic conditions and nitrate with bin 7 in anoxic conditions as previously reported in zhang s study zhang et al 2017 but this organism likely played a role in anoxic p uptake like bins 1 4 however at the community context the dominant representative bacteria related to c n p and s interacted syntrophically in the ds ebpr system 5 conclusions based on genome resolved metagenomics this study elucidated the functional microorganisms and metabolism integrating c n p and s biotransformation in a lab scale ds ebpr system in total 11 near complete draft genomes that represent a substantial portion of the microbial community 39 4 have been assembled for the first time we obtained 4 genomes which can be considered as s related paos s paos with no previously cultivated or reported members moreover both srb and sob promote complex metabolic processes and interactions for c n p and s conversions this study sheds light on the mechanism of pollutants removal for optimizing application of the engineered ds ebpr

19195,denitrifying sulfur conversion associated enhanced biological phosphorous removal ds ebpr system is not only a novel wastewater treatment process but also an ideal model for microbial ecology in a community context however it exists the knowledge gap on the roles and interactions of functional microorganisms in the ds ebpr system for carbon c nitrogen n phosphorus p and sulfur s bioconversions we use genome resolved metagenomics to build up an ecological model of microbial communities in a lab scale ds ebpr system with stable operation for more than 400 days our results yield 11 near complete draft genomes that represent a substantial portion of the microbial community 39 4 sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob promote complex metabolic processes

srb sob denitrifiers and paos within a community context graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological phosphorus removal sulfate reducing bacteria srb sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob metabolic mechanisms metagenomics 1 introduction biological nutrients removal has been widely applied in wastewater treatment to remove both nitrogen n and phosphorus p from wastewater to protect receiving waters from eutrophication in addition sulfur s associated contamination has caused concerns about corrosion and odor emission due to the application of seawater toilet flushing and sulfate coagulants during drinking water treatment recently the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated sani process has been developed and applied to simultaneously remove organic carbon c and n using sulfur biotransformation for electron transport to achieve sludge minimization and energy saving in saline sewage treatment wang et al 2009 lu et al 2012 very recently this sulfur associated biological process has been further upgraded to achieve sulfur driven denitrifying phosphorous removal in a ds ebpr process denitrifying sulfur conversion associated enhanced biological phosphorous removal process wu et al 2013 2014 the ds ebpr process is based on a synergy between sulfur transformation and poly phosphate poly p accumulating metabolism under anaerobic conditions p will be released associated with acetate uptake poly p and glycogen hydrolysis as well as polyhydroxyalkanoate pha and polysulfide and or elemental sulfur poly s intracellular formation under anoxic conditions p will be luxuriously uptaken associated with poly p and glycogen formation sulfur driven denitrification as well as pha and poly s degradation wu et al 2013 compared with the conventional enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr process the ds ebpr system enables successful biological sludge reduction and simultaneous removal of c n and p in a broad range of operational conditions such as ph and temperature with association of s biotransformation wu et al 2013 2014 yu et al 2016 the ds ebpr system is not only an attractive wastewater treatment process but also an ideal model for microbial ecology because it involves microbial interactions in four key bioconversions including c n p and s however a comprehensive study of the microbial interaction among c n p and s bioconversions is lacking previous studies of microbial communities in the ds ebpr system only focused on the identification of dominant microorganisms based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing for instance it was reported that neither conventional polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos e g candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis and tetrasphaera related bacteria nor major glycogen accumulating organisms gaos e g candidatus competibacter phosphatis and defluviicoccus vanus related bacteria were detected wu et al 2014 yu et al 2016 both sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob were enriched which synergistically contribute to maintain sulfur conversion intensity for achieving a stable ds ebpr performance guo et al 2016 although our recent study offered insights for possible interactions among functional bacteria denitrifying phosphorus removing thauera sulfate reducing desulfobacter and nitrate reducing and sulfide oxidizing thiobacillus zhang et al 2017 both the functional content of their genomes and their interactions among c n p and s bioconversions remain unknown in addition a study rubio rincón et al 2017 indicated that thiothrix caldifontis as a sulfide oxidizing microbe could play pao like roles with a mixotrophic metabolism for p removal using an intracellular sulfur pool as energy source however the understanding and identification of s based paos in ebpr have been largely overlooked the aims of this study are 1 to identify the key microorganisms involved in various biotransformations of c n p and s 2 to unravel the functional potential and metabolic pathways of the identified microorganisms at the genome scale resolution level and 3 to propose a conceptual ds ebpr ecosystem model showing insights into sulfur associated denitrifying p removal based on the representative genomes so the sludge samples from a long term operated ds ebpr system with a stable performance are collected for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and metagenomic sequencing a metagenome of the microbial community in this ds ebpr system is generated and 11 near complete draft genomes are binned to represent a substantial portion of the microbial communities the interactions among key microorganisms involved in c n p and s bioconversions are also elucidated in this study it is expected that our results will uncover important metabolic pathways of n p and s that have been previously overlooked and also shed light on the microbial interactions regarding four key elements c n p and s in a community context 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation conditions a lab scale ds ebpr sbr with a working volume of 20 l was operated under alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions fig 1 a for removing c n and p with s conversion in the stimulated saline wastewater synthetic wastewater the cyclic operation of sbr and the composition of synthetic wastewater were summarized in supplementary information si page s2 in si the sbr was operated with mechanical stirring at 400 rpm at 22 2 c for 400 days to cultivate functional microorganisms and achieve a stable sulfur driven denitrifying phosphorus removal the performance of sbr at steady state i e on day 315 was presented as the typical cycle measurements fig 1c and d 2 2 dna extraction metagenome and 16s rrna gene sequencing and data analyses three dna samples were extracted at the end of anoxic phase in the ds ebpr on day 315 details presented in si one of the dna sample was used for metagenome sequencing and the other two for 16s rrna gene sequencing for metagenomic sequencing two independent libraries with insert size of 500 bp and 750 bp were generated from the total dna dna sequences were pair end sequenced 2 250 bp on an illumina hiseq 2500 instrument producing approximately 17 8 gbp and 36 gbp of sequences respectively raw reads from different libraries were quality controlled using homemade perl scripts as described previously hua et al 2015 briefly the duplicated reads caused by the pcr amplification were removed firstly also we removed the sequences with a significant excess of n 10 of the base pairs for each paired end read the remaining reads with low quality phred value 20 were trimmed at both ends then the combined reads for the two libraries with different insert sizes were assembled using idba ud peng et al 2012 with following parameters mink 20 maxk 100 step 20 min contig 200 pre correction scaffolds with length 2500 bp were eliminated from further analysis due to the lower accuracy of short sequences for genome binning qualified metagenomic data were mapped onto the assembled scaffolds to compute the coverage information using bbmap version 38 85 http sourceforge net projects bbmap with the parameters as k 15 minid 0 9 build 1 then samtools li et al 2009 was used to sort the generated bam format file and coverage information was computed by the jgi summarize bam contig depths command in metabat kang et al 2015 metabat kang et al 2015 was used to generate the initial bins based on the tetranucleotide frequency and coverage information of generated scaffolds genome completeness was estimated using checkm version 1 0 5 parks et al 2015 genome bins with completeness 50 were kept and optimized manually to remove the contaminations the bins and bins that clustered together and shared similar coverage were combined and visualized by esom dick et al 2009 for the final bins gene prediction was determined using genemark zhu et al 2010 finally functional annotations for each bin were conducted based on comparisons to the kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes eggnog evolutionary genealogy of genes non surprised orthologous groups and ncbi nr national center for biotechnology information non redundant databases using the diamond program buchfink et al 2015 with e values 1e 5 to reconstruct the metabolic pathways for each bin kaas moriya et al 2007 was used to map all the predicted putative genes onto different modules in the kegg system especially those genes related to c n p and s pathways the methods of 16s rrna gene sequencing and analysis were detailed as described in our previous study zhang et al 2017 briefly raw reads with low quality phred value 20 at both ends were trimmed as described above flash reyon et al 2012 was used to assemble each pair end reads of the generated quality reads then adaptors and primers were removed for each assembled scaffold by mothur version 1 29 schloss et al 2009 and chimeric sequences were identified and removed using qiime caporaso et al 2010 subsequently after that the remaining sequences were clustered into otus at the 97 similarity level and taxonomic information was assigned using rdp classifier wang et al 2007 also 16s rrna gene sequences from metagenomic data were extracted and analyzed to recruit the 16s rrna gene sequences scaffolds were first used to search the rdp database matched regions were then extracted based on the start and end position of alignments only hits with length 400 bp were kept for later analysis taxonomic assignments were conducted by comparing extracted sequences to web based ncbi nr database as a sequence pool quality reads were mapped on them using bbmap version 38 85 http sourceforge net projects bbmap with the parameters as k 15 minid 0 97 build 1 relative abundance at the genus level were calculated as r i 1 i c i 1 j c j 100 where i represents recruited sequences that belonged to a specific genus and j means all the extracted sequences c stands for the read count of the corresponding sequence in addition programs used for data interpretation are described in si all data supporting the findings of this study are available in this paper and si sequencing data are deposited at the ncbi sequence read archive under the accession numbers srr6924042 and srr6906104 3 results 3 1 ds ebpr reactor performance a lab scale ds ebpr sequencing batch reactor sbr was operated for 400 days fig 1a the solids retention time srt was kept at 80 days the reactor was fed with influent concentrations of acetate and sulfate of 68 5 2 9 mg c l and 208 3 3 6 mg s l respectively in anaerobic phase while nitrate of 29 7 1 5 mg n l was fed to the reactor in anoxic phase after day 270 the concentrations of acetate nitrate and sulfate in the effluent were 0 0 mg c l 0 0 mg n l and 205 1 4 3 mg s l fig 1b indicating that the reactor entered a quasi steady state acetate added at the beginning of the anaerobic phase was completely consumed while glycogen degradation and pha formation occurred during the 7 5 hour period of anaerobic conditions simultaneously phosphate was released from poly p stored within bacterial cells in the subsequent anoxic conditions glycogen was generated while pha was consumed at the same time the phosphate was luxuriously taken up as poly p fig 1c and fig s1 in si the net p removal of the ds ebpr system was 7 5 0 3 mg p l and without chemical p removal these bioconversion trends were consistent with the phenotype of a typical ebpr system carvalho et al 2007 differently through sulfur s related microorganisms sulfate reduction sulfide formation and poly s production were observed during anaerobic conditions fig 1d this illustrates that electrons were transferred to sulfate through the s reduction from acetate in the subsequent anoxic conditions nitrate was immediately added at the end of the anaerobic phase as the only electron acceptor nitrate was completely consumed by using sulfide and poly s as electron donors within 2 h simultaneously sulfate production along with sulfide and poly s oxidation were observed fig 1d this illustrates that electrons were transferred from acetate to drive microbial sulfate reduction to sulfide collectively the unique operational mode of the ds ebpr system achieved efficient removals of total c n and p 3 2 community overview in order to reveal the microbial community structure we conducted both 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and metagenomic sequencing in total 22 834 sequences were generated based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing metagenomic sequencing of the whole community dna extracted from the ds ebpr system yielded a total of 778 914 675 bp total base pairs after quality filtering table s1 in si co assembly of the resulting reads using idba ud peng et al 2012 generated a total of 452 966 scaffolds length 500 bp with an n50 of 2599 bp in total 1 102 134 protein encoding genes average length of 624 bp and average guanine and cytosine gc content of 52 2 were predicted for each draft genome using genemark zhu et al 2010 the community composition was determined by both the amplicon based profiles and the 16s rrna gene sequences extracted from the metagenomes based on the 16s rrna gene from the metagenomes the most abundant populations belonged to the phyla proteobacteria delta and beta proteobacteria with 23 1 and 19 7 respectively chloroflexi 19 4 acidobacteria 17 5 bacteroidetes 3 3 chlorobi 2 8 acidobacteria 2 0 od1 1 4 tenericutes 1 1 and firmicutes 0 6 fig 2 sulfur sulfide oxidizing microorganism e g thiobacillus thiovirga and chromatiaceae accounted for 7 1 while the relative abundance of sulfate sulfite reducing microorganism e g geobacter desulfobulbaceae pelobacteraceae desulfobacteraceae was 22 8 in addition the triangular mark representing photosynthetic sob were detected including green sulfur bacteria gsb of 2 1 and purple sulfur bacteria psb of 1 3 fig s2 in si however several differences could be observed between the amplicon and metagenome based community profiles for example propionicimonas was detected with an abundance of up to 14 7 in the metagenome while this population was not found by16s rrna gene sequencing likely due to a primer mismatch for the forward primer 515f used in the amplicon sequencing approach fig s2 in si in addition due to existing pcr primer and amplification biases amplicon based studies might suffer from lower taxonomic resolution compared to metagenomics thus probably underestimating the community vanwonterghem et al 2016 for example od1 was detected in the metagenomic dataset fig s2 in si while it was absent in the amplicon based dataset the metagenomic data were successfully assembled in 11 high quality draft genomes the 11 genomes ranged in size between 2 2 and 3 7 mb across a gc content range between 47 7 and 66 1 table 1 the genome coverage of the dominant and representative populations was sufficiently complete to confidently infer presence and absence of pathways and thereby allowed a comprehensive metabolic reconstruction table 1 the taxonomic information was evaluated by comparing contigs against ncbi nr database using blastx to decipher potential roles of microorganisms in c n p and s bioconversions in the ds ebpr system functional annotations were conducted interestingly five key types of functional bacteria were assembled including srb bins 1 4 desulfobacteraceae and bins 5 6 desulfobulbaceae nitrate reduction sob nr sob bin 7 thiobacillus gsb bins 8 9 chlorobium denitrifying bacterium bin 10 thauera and other acetate oxidizer bin 11 geobacter most genomes are divergent from the genomes in public databases except for the genomes bin 1 bin 2 and bin 11 comparative genomic analyses indicate that these three bins exhibit a relatively closer relationship to desulfatirhabdium butyrativorans desulfobacter postgatei and geobacter lovleyi respectively sharing 58 5 93 7 and 74 1 with amino acid identity fig s3 in si the genes of the core metabolic pathways of ds ebpr system were listed in table s2 in si these metagenomic sequencing data provided sufficient resolution to obtain a comprehensive insight into the prokaryotic microbial community involved in c n p and s bioconversions in the ds ebpr system 3 3 potential players in p n and s conversions in the ds ebpr system for the p conversion the marker genes polyphosphate kinase ppk1 and exopolyphosphatase ppx are involved in the aggregation and degradation of poly p respectively rao et al 2009 fig 3 and table s2 in si the ppk1 is generally thought to be a phylogenetic marker gene for conventional paos mcmahon et al 2002 rao et al 2009 we retrieved fragments of ppk1 sequences from the metagenome and phylogenetically compared the reference sequences downloaded from the ncbi database and from a previous study carvalho et al 2007 the ppk1 phylogenetic tree shows a variety of categories with five phyla proteobacteria firmicutes chlorobi chloroflexi and bacteroidetes in the ds ebpr system fig 4 moreover some bacteria associated with s conversions were found to be rich in the ppk1 gene such as sob thiobacillus and chlorobium and srb desulfobacter and geobacter indicating their possible function in poly p aggregation the accumulibacter clades are close together and have some evolutionary distance from other populations rich in the ppk1 gene interestingly all retrieved ppk1 sequences were not assigned to accumulibacter clades i abcde and ii abcdefghx even though accumulibacter clades have been recognised as the dominant bacteria responsible for acetate uptake in conventional ebpr systems zhu et al 2010 this matches with previous reports that no conventional paos were detected in the ds ebpr system wu et al 2014 yu et al 2016 based on genomic analysis all assembled bins 1 11 carried the ppk1 and ppx genes fig 3 and table s2 in si in addition bins 1 4 and 11 could shuttle phosphate pi across its plasma membrane via a high affinity pi transporter pst and low affinity inorganic pi transporter pit bins 5 6 bin 7 and bins 8 9 might shuttle pi only via the pst while bin 10 could shuttle pi only through the pit fig 3 and table s2 in si for the n associated conversion we firstly evaluated the genomes for marker genes encoding key enzymes relevant to nitrogen transformations fig 3 and table s2 in si the marker genes used in this study included nitrate reductase alpha subunit narg nitrite reductase no forming nirs nitric oxide reductase subunit b norb and nitrous oxide reductase nosz for denitrification bedzyk et al 1999 jones et al 2008 nitrate reductase napa or narg as well as nitrite reductase cytochrome c 552 nrfa or nitrite reductase nadh large subunit nirb for nh4 formation einsle et al 1999 kraft et al 2011 both bin 7 and bin 10 encoded the key enzymes for complete denitrification from nitrate to dinitrogen gas the bins 1 4 encoded the narg and bins 5 6 encoded the napa for no2 formation from no3 while bins 1 4 5 6 and 11 encoded nrfa and bins 7 and 10 encoded nirb for dissimilatory nitrite reduction to nh4 formation bins 8 and 9 did not contain any of the aforementioned n associated conversion genes nh4 can be further transported into the cytoplasm to synthesize organic n for the survival and growth of bacteria based on the needs of nutrient element n cerqueda garcia et al 2014 as the ds ebpr reactor is an s driven ecosystem s related microorganisms play important roles in sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation in anaerobic and anoxic conditions in the ds ebpr system for the s loop the reversible marker genes mainly include sulfate adenylyltransferase sat adenylylsulfate reductase ab aprab and dsrab type dissimilatory bi sulfite reductase dsrab for sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation wagner et al 1998 zhou et al 2011 the poly s possibly served as electron and energy storage materials like pha and glycogen wu et al 2013 yu et al 2016 the marker gene for poly s metabolisms is the sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr shahak et al 1992 gregersen et al 2011 for poly s formation in addition the poly s was able to be transformed to sulfate via enzymes encoded by the reverse sulfate reduction gene cluster fike et al 2015 we firstly evaluated the distribution of marker genes dsrab in microbial communities fig 5 which either catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide during anaerobic respiration of sulfate sulfite and organosulfonates or acts in reverse during s oxidation muller et al 2015 the reductive type dsra and dsrb genes were mainly derived from the firmicutes supercluster and delta proteobacteria supercluster in this study the main distribution of the reduced dsrab genes appear predominantly in bins 1 4 and 6 delta proteobacteria as typical srb which play important roles in sulfate reduction our results are consistent with previous study muller et al 2015 which has shown that reductive dsrab genes are mainly distributed in the four classes of bacteria delta proteobacteria firmicutes nitrospirae and thermodesulfobacteria and two classes of archaea euryarchaeota and crenarchaeota in contrast the oxidative dsrab sequences from sob are phylogenetically distinct from all other reductive dsrab sequences fig 5 the oxidized dsrab genes appear predominantly in bin 7 beta proteobacteria and bins 8 9 chlorobi for the poly s metabolism we found that the genome of bin 7 and bins 8 9 contained the core genes for poly s formation sqr as well as sulfide oxidation dsrab aprab and sat fig 3 and table s2 in si which are essential for the sulfide oxidation under anoxic conditions 3 4 integrating inferred niches and activities in a system model according to the reactor performance and the functions derived from the assembled draft genomes we propose an ecological model of c n p and s biotransformations catalyzed by various microbial communities in the ds ebpr system fig 6 it highlights the major metabolic pathways likely to be used by these populations during the anaerobic and anoxic conditions of the ds ebpr system there are two major categories srb and sob in this system fig 6 in anaerobic conditions acetate can be taken up by srb and sob into cells forming carbon storage polymers in the cells and producing co2 the so4 2 in the system is completely reduced to the hs s2 by the srb where a small amount of hs s2 is oxidized by the gsb and form poly s in the periplasm it explains why the ds ebpr reactor exhibited an ascending trend in poly s in anaerobic conditions srb degrade poly p and release po4 3 to the bulk liquid when acetate is completely consumed no3 is immediately added as electron acceptor to create anoxic conditions the no3 can be used for complete oxidation of hs s2 to so4 2 by the sob some of the no3 is also used by ordinary denitrifiers whereby complete denitrification occurs for the production of n2 the remainder of the no3 can also be taken up by bacteria for meeting physiological needs of organic n cerqueda garcia et al 2014 the poly s is further oxidized to produce so4 2 as well as co2 fixation by the gsb eisen et al 2002 simultaneously the po4 3 uptake from the bulk liquid occurs together with an increase in intracellular poly p this schematic of the ds ebpr illustrates that the s related bacteria are important for the c n p and s coupling system the metabolic functions of key players are explained below in further details acetate oxidizing srb under anaerobic conditions adding acetate into the system created a niche ecosystem for bins 1 4 and bins 5 6 which metagenomic data indicated complete sulfate reduction sat aprab and dsrab coupled to acetate oxidation zhou et al 2011 also bins 1 4 shuttled pi across its plasma membrane via pst and pit fig 6 the poly p can be used directly to synthesize adenosine triphosphate atp or be degraded into pi encoded by ppx gene for atp production via f atpases garcia martin et al 2006 the atp generated is then used for acetate uptake under anoxic conditions genes necessary for nitrate reduction narg and nrfa kraft et al 2011 and ammonium transportation into the cytoplasm amt soupene et al 1998 were detected in addition since the pi concentrations are at their lowest level the pi transported into the cell during anoxic conditions can be synthesized into poly p encoded by the ppk1 gene via atp the scavenging capability with relatively low levels of pi through the low affinity pit transporter may contribute to superior ds ebpr performance in bins 1 4 glycogen is hydrolyzed via the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway under anaerobic conditions to provide energy and reducing power for synthesis of pha from the assimilated c source while it was synthesized in the subsequent anoxic conditions draft genomic data further indicated that bins 1 4 and bins 5 6 were motile by means of flagella and they also transported amino acids and arginine figs s4 and s5 in si nr sob the draft genomic data indicated that bin 7 could fix carbon dioxide via the calvin benson bassham calvin cycle montoya et al 2012 to support chemolithoautotrophic growth under anaerobic conditions the relevant genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle glycogen degradation and calvin cycle were detected without pha formation in addition the stored glycogen is degraded by the emp pathway gpi erdal 2002 the glycogen will be degraded and coupled with the tca cycle and f atpase for the synthesis of atp the generated atp will meet the need for cell maintenance energy under anoxic conditions nitrate dependent sulfide oxidation occurs for energy generation for the production of glycogen thiobacillus oxidizes sulfide meanwhile reducing nitrate to n2 and ammonium according to the draft genome fig 6 sulfide oxidation may proceed via the sulfide oxidation pathway sqr dsrab aprab and sat with poly s formation this suggests that bin 7 is able to use sulfur compounds as electron donors in its energy metabolism lutters czckalla 1990 like thiobacillus denitrificans in addition on the basis of genomic evidence it was speculated that the poly p cycling could not be performed without the low affinity pit transporter since the pit seems to be a prerequisite for poly p cycling mcllroy et al 2014 fig s6 in si gsb chlorobium belongs to the class chlorobia of the phylum chlorobi which was originally isolated from the acidic hydrothermal waters in new zealand wahlund et al 1991 chlorobia is a proprietary anaerobic photosynthetic autotrophic bacterium which is widely distributed in aquatic environments and is also exposed to hypoxic aquatic environments containing reduced sulfur compounds according to the draft genome assembled fig 6 bins 8 9 could enter into the forward oxidative tca cycle and autotrophic co2 fixation via the reverse reductive rtca cycle it has been reported that chlorobium can not only grow through rtca to assimilate co2 but also generate energy through the tca cycle tang and blankenship 2010 the bins 8 9 also have the glycogen synthesis which is obviously more conducive to utilizing the stored energy in the cell under anoxic conditions it could use sulfide a small amount of the sulfide is produced from sulfate reduction as sources of s as well as co2 as electron acceptor cork et al 1983 the sqr in our metagenomic data operated in oxidizing sulfide to form intracellular poly s fig 6 and fig s7 in si in addition the poly p cycling could not be performed without the pit mcllroy et al 2014 it indicated that the bins 8 9 could couple sulfide oxidation to the co2 fixation in addition the further oxidation of sulfide to sulfate probably took place in the cytoplasm by using dsrab aprab and sat a sulfate exporter encoded by sulp was identified in the genome although it is widely believed that chlorobium is an inorganic autotrophic sob vanwonterghem et al 2016 it can also use glycogen cycling to facilitate cell growth tang and blankenship 2010 here the chlorobium is also a bacterium with sulfide oxidation and autotrophic co2 fixation rtca cycle capabilities denitrifying pao d pao in previous studies some clades of accumulibacter were considered as d paos flowers et al 2009 nielsen et al 2012 only a few studies suggested that thauera was a d pao tsuneda et al 2005 but there is limited information about its capacity of poly p metabolism based on metagenomic sequencing bin 10 belonging to the betaproteobacteria has a heterotrophic acetate assimilation capability in this study bin 10 has the ability to convert acetate into pha coupled with poly p degradation metabolic pathways at the same time poly p was degraded into pi ppx and achieved anaerobic phosphorus release another important role of poly p degradation is to provide atp in the anoxic conditions bin 10 continued the tca for atp supply the f atpase constantly pumped h outside into the cell as the formation of electrochemical proton gradient for driving atp synthesis the atp was used for poly p formation meanwhile the poly p accumulated via ppk1 gene to achieve the effect of biological p removal thauera is also known as nitrate reducing bacteria mao et al 2014 in addition to the complete nitrate reduction to produce n2 narg nirs norb and nosz and the produced nh3 nirb and amt could also enter the cell for organic n biosynthesis nevertheless only limited information could be found to reveal the possible role of thauera in denitrifying poly p accumulation tsuneda et al 2005 and no denitrifying poly p accumulating metabolism was built based on thauera mainly because it has not been described as a model organism like accumulibacter hence up to date little is known about the poly p accumulating function of thauera the key genes dsrab required for s transport and metabolism were absent in bin 10 indicating no existence of sulfide oxidation in addition the key gene for flagellar synthesis by bin 10 was identified bin 10 can be regarded as a d pao with pha synthesis and complete nitrate reduction and could play an important role in the p and n removal in the ds ebpr system the genomic information of bin 10 thauera provides an insight into the ecological functional diversity of this important bacterium with a new metabolic model fig 6 and fig s8 in si other acetate oxidizer geobacter a member of the geobacteraceae family belonging to the delta proteobacteria is known as a metal reducing bacterium and is an important component of subsurface environments methe et al 2003 most of the studies on geobacter focus on heavy metal reduction methe et al 2003 sung et al 2006 and have not been involved in simultaneous studies of c n p and s metabolisms in this study bin 11 was a heterotrophic bacterium ueki et al 2012 that could assimilate acetate into the tca cycle and form glycogen with sulfite reduction fig 6 at the same time the degradation of poly p was achieved in anaerobic conditions under anoxic conditions in order to maintain the proton gradient difference between the inside and outside of the cell extracellular h would be transported through the f atpase into the cell resulting in atp while glycogen degradation produced atp and nadh in addition the pyruvate generated from glycogen degradation also entered the tca cycle to produce atp and nadh the large amount of atp was used for the synthesis of poly p to achieve biological p uptake it could also achieve the reduction of sulfite under the action of the nrfa gene kemp et al 2010 fig s9 in si 4 discussion this study unraveled microbial communities and their interactions in a well controlled ds ebpr system by using high throughput metagenomic sequencing to our knowledge it is the first metagenomic characterization on a microbial ecological system involving c n p and s bioconversions metagenomic data emphasized the diversity of the microbial community metabolic pathways and different evolutionary history of ppk1 and dsrab genes in the ds ebpr system in addition to the microbial community we could assign most of the organisms to niches in the ds ebpr system based on our experimental results and the metagenomic content this allowed us to infer an ecological model of the microbial ecosystem segregating into anaerobic and anoxic conditions a microbial ecology model with coupling c n p and s biotransformations was also proposed in a community context which will improve the understanding of interactions among srb sob denitrifiers and paos the ecological model we proposed provides an explanation for the effective performance of this ds ebpr reactor and is consistent with the performance data of the reactor fig 1 it also offers an ecosystem role for s related paos which was previously not understood however it should be noted that the proposed model is based on genome content and differential abundance of the genomes in a community context and requires further validation through e g metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics or enrichment isolation of critical microorganisms from the ds ebpr reactor furthermore since these organisms evolved from different environments as compared to the ds ebpr reactor that they were cultivated some genetic functions that were identified may have become redundant as also recognised in metagenomic studies regarding other microorganisms metagenomic data emphasized the diversity of mechanisms that may be important in situ allowing the five representative bacteria bins 1 4 desulfobacteraceae bins 5 6 desulfobulbaceae bin 7 thiobacillus bins 8 9 chlorobium bin 10 thauera and bin 11 geobacter to adapt their metabolic activities to changes in environmental conditions our results provide a potential role for the dominant members of the microbial community we retrieved 11 draft genomes from a lab scale ds ebpr system in which some bacteria can be considered as new paos that were not previously cultivated the key enzymes of ppk1 and ppx were found in all of these core bacteria in addition bins 1 4 and bin 11 carried the pst and pit transporters meanwhile bins 5 6 bin 7 and bins 8 9 had only the high affinity pst transporter while bin 10 could shuttle pi only through the pit transporter however it should be noted that only bins 1 4 and bin 10 carried the acetyl coa acetyltransferase phaa garcia martin et al 2006 which mediate the pha formation and storage thus enabling to behave like paos the presence of the low affinity pit transporter has been previously shown to be crucial in distinguishing between typical paos and typical gaos as even gaos who do not accumulate poly p under most conditions found in wastewater treatment plants possess ppk1 ppx and pst mcllroy et al 2014 nobu et al 2014 thus bins 5 6 bin 7 and bins 8 9 should not be considered as new potential paos since they do not possess the low affinity pit transporter further they should also not be considered as gao since they are unable to synthesize pha which is characteristic of anaerobic gao metabolism the organisms of bins 1 4 possess the genetic framework to be considered as s paos since they are capable of anaerobic sulfate reduction in conjunction with acetate uptake pha formation glycolysis and p release as well as anoxic denitrification partial denitrification from no3 to no2 pha consumption glycogen and poly p formation an important function of poly p in bins 1 4 is to adapt to changing environments between anaerobic and anoxic conditions in the ds ebpr system the poly p degradation provides atp which is beneficial to the poly p accumulation under the anoxic condition without the energy from the sulfate reduction these bins generated in this study could serve as an extension and supplement of conventional paos rao et al 2009 he et al 2010 it broadens the understanding of paos diversity and is of great significance to the study of microbial functional diversity from the point view of the s loop sulfate reduction mediated by srb in the ds ebpr system is of great significance however a potential impact of sulfide from sulfate reduction toxicity on community composition and function cannot be excluded the presence of sob might solve the negative effects of high sulfide in this system since the sob can oxidize sulfide as electron donor our recent study has proposed syntrophic growth between srb and nr sob in co culture such that a positive feedback cycle was established between the reductive and oxidative processes of these two bacteria zhang et al 2017 metagenomic results also indicate that a similar mechanism existed between srb bins 1 4 and bins 5 6 and nr sob bin 7 and a syntrophic growth of autotrophic or possibly mixotrophic bins 8 9 were supported by sulfide and co2 generated by heterotrophic respiration the formation of poly s mediated by bin 7 and bins 8 9 might be caused by the partial oxidation of sulfide probably to poly s in the anaerobic conditions and a complete re oxidation from sulfide to sulfate is conducted by bin 7 which is coupled with denitrification and bins 8 9 in anoxic conditions cardoso et al 2006 fig 6 these results suggest s amendment promoted complex organismal and metabolic processes and interactions involved in c n p and s cycling the assembled bins 1 6 have capability for microbial sulfate reduction as srb among these six bins only bins 1 4 can not only perform sulfate reduction but also have capability for poly p storage and release thus playing an important role in this system the bins 1 4 as newly discovered s paos have been overlooked previously in contrast the bins 5 6 only have the metabolism of sulfate reduction bin 7 is nr sob but does not have any p metabolism in addition bins 8 9 only had sulfide oxidation function while bin 10 was d pao and has no s metabolism function it should be noted that the synergy among srb s paos sob and d paos provides a strong guarantee for the denitrifying sulfur conversion assisted ebpr moreover it highlighted the importance of s related bacteria in the ds ebpr system for the competition relationship in the ds ebpr ecosystem the bin 10 d pao competed for acetate with bins 1 4 and 5 6 in anaerobic conditions and nitrate with bin 7 in anoxic conditions as previously reported in zhang s study zhang et al 2017 but this organism likely played a role in anoxic p uptake like bins 1 4 however at the community context the dominant representative bacteria related to c n p and s interacted syntrophically in the ds ebpr system 5 conclusions based on genome resolved metagenomics this study elucidated the functional microorganisms and metabolism integrating c n p and s biotransformation in a lab scale ds ebpr system in total 11 near complete draft genomes that represent a substantial portion of the microbial community 39 4 have been assembled for the first time we obtained 4 genomes which can be considered as s related paos s paos with no previously cultivated or reported members moreover both srb and sob promote complex metabolic processes and interactions for c n p and s conversions this study sheds light on the mechanism of pollutants removal for optimizing application of the engineered ds ebpr

19196,this study i examined the formation of two major carbonaceous disinfection by products c dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas during the chlorination of intracellular algogenic organic matter iom extracted from two commonly blooming algae m aeruginosa ma and chlorella sp ch and ii investigated the roles and relationships of fluorescent and molecular weight mw properties on with iom derived thms and haas the extracted iom samples were separated into different mw fractions by centrifugal devices with membrane support with mw cut offs of 100 30 10 3 and 1 kda we observed an overall reduction of c dbps with a decrease of iom mw from 100 kda to 1 kda of six fractionated iom a large fraction 100 kda contributed the largest amount to the mw distribution of iom accounting for 33 and 42 of the total dissolved organic carbon doc of ma and ch respectively it also had the highest yielding potential to produce significant levels of thms and haas and total c dbps over other small mw fractions although small mw fractions 10 kda contributed around 50 of the total doc they made an insignificant contribution 20 to the thms haas and overall c dbps furthermore the decrease of iom mw caused a shift from the domination of haa formation to thm formation especially when mw was 10 kda by canonical correspondent analysis the relationship of iom derived thms and haas with iom properties was examined in particular large fractions of iom exhibiting aromatic protein ap and soluble microbial product smp like fluorescence are favorable for the formation of haas whereas small mw fractions of iom with ha and fa like fluorescence preferentially tends to form thms our findings evidently show the strong dependence of iom derived thms and haas on the fluorescent and mw properties therefore the characterization of mw and fluorescent properties can provide the advantages in the control of algae derived dbps upon the chlorination of eutrophic water graphical abstract image 1 keywords algogenic organic matter dbps chlorination fluorescence molecular weight 1 introduction bloom of algae in an aquatic environment is a critical problem in water treatment utilities it frequently causes a dramatic deterioration of water quality by increasing turbidity taste and odor and algal toxins in the water column henderson et al 2008a tomlinson et al 2016 importantly algal bloom releases a significant content of algogenic organic matter aom that has been proved to be a major precursor of disinfection by products dbps upon chlor am ination or ozonation fang et al 2010 goslan et al 2017 hua et al 2018a huang et al 2009 plummer and edzwald 2001 zhu et al 2015 aom as a precursor to dbps can be generally categorized into extra eom and intra cellular organic matter iom while eom is rapidly released via algal exudation in soluble organic form fogg et al 1965 iom is the internal organic substances released by the rupture of the cell membrane tomlinson et al 2016 nonetheless they both are difficult to effectively be removed by conventional coagulation sedimentation filtration processes cheng and chi 2003 henderson et al 2010 takaara et al 2007 and controlling aom derived dbps during the algal bloom has thus become the greatest challenge for sustainable production of safe drinking water a better understanding of aom physicochemical properties significantly benefits an effective control of its derived dbps in general probing fluorophores provide valuable information about the possible composition and relatively quantitative content of aom precursor chen et al 2003 coble 2007 the use of fluorescent excitation emission matrices eem as a characterization tool further allows us to acquire more insights into aom derived dbps fang et al 2010 hua et al 2018b li et al 2012 on the other hand molecular weight mw is another important characteristic that also shows significant connection to the effectiveness of aom treatment guo et al 2017 liu et al 2018 and its derived dbps in particular hua et al 2018a lui et al 2012 pivokonsky et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 as the common and effective approaches to trace dbp formation the characterization of aom dbp precursors based on fluorescent and mw properties has attracted more and more attention however current research into aom dbp has as yet not fully resolved such relationships because aom is a complex and heterogeneous mixture varying in size structure and functionality fang et al 2010 hong et al 2008 hua et al 2017 li et al 2012 lui et al 2012 there is a critical need to elucidate the principal role of fluorescent and mw properties and their relationship with the formation of aom derived dbps where the existent knowledge has remained unclear to address this issue heterogeneous aom can be isolated into more homogeneous groups based on molecular size fractionation by a serial ultrafiltration technique is commonly used to isolate om sample into different mw fractions henderson et al 2008b hua and reckhow 2007 pivokonsky et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 this study was aimed at characterizing the fractionated aom precursors based on mw as a function of fluorescence and to examine the relationship between aom fluorescent and mw properties with its derived dbp formation upon chlorination iom derived dbp was the central focus of this research because in practice iom i contributes a significant fraction to total aom 80 tomlinson et al 2016 ii is a more difficult matter to be removed by conventional treatments pivokonsky et al 2014 takaara et al 2017 and iii importantly is a higher yielding dbp precursor compared to eom hua et al 2018b huang et al 2009 li et al 2012 plummer and edzwald 2001 the iom was extracted from a cyanobacterium m aeruginosa ma and a green alga chlorella sp ch ma and ch were selected because they are two commonly blooming algae that occur worldwide ndlela et al 2016 tas and gonulol 2007 furthermore two major classes of carbonaceous dbps including trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas were investigated as they are dominantly found upon chlorination of iom compared to other dbps such as chloroacetones chloroacetonitriles nitrosodimethylamine and chloronitromethanes li et al 2012 lui et al 2011 wert and rosario ortiz 2013 and are regulated worldwide tomlinson et al 2016 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal cultivation and iom extraction m aeruginosa and chlorella sp were isolated from a local reservoir in matsu taiwan they were isolated into the unialgal culture by a commonly used protocol with agar plate streaking technique and successive dilution method their axenic cultures were conducted in a thermostat photobioreactor containing 6 l of modified bg11 and chlorella medium the conditions of algal culture were followed our previous work hua et al 2018b algal growth phases were determined by monitoring the cell population every 2 days the algal suspensions with the volume of 500 ml from the late exponential phase of the two species were selected for iom extraction algal cells were separated from eom by centrifugation for 15 min at 2700 g at 4 c boeco centrifuges u 320r germany and then washed twice with deionized di water to remove the remaining eom the collected cells were lyophilized in a freeze drier pin chen co taiwan at 50 c and 2 10 4 torr for 6 h iom was extracted physically by gently grinding the lyophilized cells for 2 min with a mortar and pestle after grinding iom was extracted by re suspending the ruptured cells in 100 ml of di water and shaking vigorously for 30 s using a vortex mixer this suspension was then spun in a centrifuge again for 15 min at 2700 g at 4 c prior to filtration through a 0 45 μm filter advantec japan to archive the iom 2 2 molecular weight fractionation the iom water samples of the two species were separated into different mw fractions using a series of centrifugal devices with membrane support macrosep advance centrifugal device pall usa with mw cut offs mwco of 100 30 10 3 and 1 kda before using for iom isolation each centrifugal device was washed twice by di water at the identical centrifugation conditions with samples it is noticed that such centrifugation conditions could recover 95 of the blank di water for all mwco 20 ml of concentrated iom samples doc 100 mg l was loaded into the top of the centrifugal devices and spun at 2700 g for 30 min at 4 c after the serial fractionation iom samples were separated into six fractions with the mw ranges of f1 100 kda f2 100 30 kda f3 30 10 kda f4 10 3 kda f5 3 1 kda f6 1 kda this process was duplicated and the duplicates were used for other analyses and dbp formation tests all water samples were adjusted to ph 7 and stored at 20 c before use 2 3 doc and don measurements dissolved organic

difference between the total nitrogenous content tnt persulfate digestion 10071 method and the total inorganic nitrogenous content titanium trichloride reduction 10021 method all doc and don measurements were conducted in duplicate for each mw fraction 2 4 eem spectra fluorescent spectra or eem spectra of the original and fractionated iom samples were analyzed with a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer varian inc palo alto ca usa before eem analysis water samples were adjusted to a doc of 10 mg l for comparison eem scanning was carried out with excitation wavelengths ranged from 200 to 400 nm with 10 nm increments and emission wavelengths ranging from 250 to 550 nm with 2 nm increments the voltage of the photomultiplier tube was set to 800 v for low light detection di water with doc 0 2 mg l was used as a blank the raw eem intensities of each sample were subtracted for the blank di water and rayleigh and raman scattering to remove the background and interference four regional fluorescent spectra were determined based on their excitation emission wavelengths following chen et al 2003 these represent the aromatic protein ap soluble microbial product smp humic ha and fulvic like fa substances the average fluorescent intensity afi of each component was calculated based on the average intensity value of each selected region respectively 2 5 characterization of chemical functional structure the chemical functional groups of the fractionated iom were analyzed with a high resolution x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps physical electronics phi 1600 spectrometer prior to chemical analysis samples were prepared by freeze drying pretreatment for iom solutions xps survey was conducted by coupling with an mg kα x ray source 1253 6 ev low resolution scanning was carried out from 0 to 1400 ev with a pass energy of 117 4 ev for elemental determination high resolution surveys with pass energy set at 23 5 ev were also conducted for the c n and o elements over the 278 298 ev 391 411 ev and 523 543 ev ranges respectively the spectral deconvolution was performed by xps peak fit program with the subtraction of shirley background and was optimized to achieve the r2 0 99 for c and o and r2 0 90 for n 2 6 dbp formation potential tests for dbp formation potential dbpfp tests water samples of different fractions f1 to f6 and original iom were adjusted to doc 5 mg l and ph 7 0 1 the tests were carried out by spiking each sample with sodium hypochlorite cl2 doc 5 1 in headspace free amber glass bottles at room temperature 25 1 c after 7 days of chlorination water samples were acidified and quenched with ammonium chloride to obtain the thmfp and haafp the thmfp were measured by a coupling a purge and trap system model 4660 oi

carbonaceous dbpfp c dbpfp and the ratio of haafp thmfp was calculated by dividing the amount of haafp to thmfp all samples were prepared with bromide free water 2 7 statistical analysis spss statistics 22 0 software ibm armok ny usa was used to compare the differences of thmfp haafp and c dbpfp canonical correspondent analysis cca was carried out by xlstat software anddinsoft paris french to examine the relationship among iom derived dbp mw and fluorescent properties data from six mw fractions of two iom 12 sample sites were applied for this test 3 results and discussion 3 1 mw distributions by doc and don distribution of mw in iom was characterized by the contribution of each fraction to the total doc and don of two species as shown in fig 1 both ma and ch iom had bimodal distributions in which large mw 100 kda f1 and small mw fractions 10 kda f4 f5 and f6 mostly contributed up to 90 of the total doc together with insignificant contributions of fractions f2 and f3 fig 2 a while the total don of ma showed a similar distribution with the doc only a large mw fraction f1 was found abundantly in ch don fig 2b briefly the distributions of six fractions in iom followed the order as f1 f4 f5 f6 f2 f3 and fraction f1 evidently made the greatest contributions to the total doc and don profiles of all iom accounting for 33 and 26 in ma iom and 42 and 64 in ch iom respectively this likely results from the dominance of internal phycobiliproteins and chloroplast in ma and ch cells respectively glazer and fang 1973 purton 2001 furthermore this results further supports previous work where the fractions with mw 100 kda also contributed 50 of the total doc and don from the iom of microcytic aeruginosa guo et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 suggesting the significance of large molecules mw 100 kda in the mw distribution of iom 3 2 fluorescent properties probing fluorescent properties provides valuable insights into the chemical compositions of om precursors and their dbp formation potential chen et al 2003 hua et al 2018b fluorescent properties of the two original ioms were firstly characterized by eem spectroscopy to provide the general fluorescent spectra of the iom before fractionation distinct differences in two were found as shown in fig s1 supporting information in particular the original ma iom consisted of a more complex matrix of all four fluorescent components ap smp ha and fa and accounted for 20 16 33 and 31 of the eem intensity respectively conversely the original ch iom was mainly constituted of ap and smp which contributed up to 66 and 22 of the original intensity with negligible contributions by ha and fa these results concurred with the findings of most current reports henderson et al 2008b hua et al 2017 li et al 2012 indicating that the fluorescent characteristics of iom are species dependent furthermore eem scanning was carried out on the six fractionated ioms of the two species and their afi values for four regional components were calculated for quantitative comparison as showed in fig 2 the afi percentages of the four regional components ap smp ha and fa like vary significantly within the reduction of mw reducing mw particularly caused a shift from the dominance of ap and smp to the dominance of ha and fa components comparing the six fractions ap and smp were most abundant in large fraction f1 accounting for 75 of the total afi of the two species the dominance of ap and smp decreased significantly when the mw decreased to 10 kda in f4 f5 and f6 in contrast ha and fa became the dominant components under this mw range accounting for around 85 and 60 of the total afi in cases of f5 and f6 of both algal species fig 2a however these results differ from those in liu et al 2018 who reported that ap tryptophan and tyrosine like and smp were the dominant components in the small mw fraction of 5 kda of the iom derived from microcytic aeruginosa this can possibly be attributed to the differences in the iom extraction protocol between the two studies nevertheless there requires practical evidence to clarify the effects of extraction methods on iom properties in brief our eem afi results show a strong relationship between mw variations and fluorescent properties of iom in which large mw 100 kda of iom mainly exhibits ap and smp like fluorescence whereas small mw 10 kda of iom is abundant in ha and fa fluorescence 3 3 thm and haa formation potential dbp formation tests were carried out for six mw fractions and the original iom of ma fig 3 a and ch fig 3b as no bromide was included in the dbp tests brominated dbps were negligibly detected in this study trichloromethane tcm was the major thm observed 98 of total thm while monochloroacetic acid mcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa were the three dominantly obtained compounds in haas 99 of total haas the results of formation tests show that the c dbps of the two species rapidly reduced with the decrease of iom mw from f1 to f6 the impact of mw reduction on iom dbp yields was statistically more pronounced in haafp and c dbpfp than in thmfp the largest amounts of c dbps of the six iom fractions was found in the large mw fractions f1 100 kda of both species which significantly were three fold larger than those derived from the smallest mw f6 furthermore the total c dbp produced by f1 was even larger than that of the corresponding original iom these results indicate that the large molecules of iom with mw 100 kda are the most important precursors of iom derived dbps and that iom derived dbps are strongly mw dependent fig 3 also shows a shift from a dominance of haas to a dominance of thms with the decrease of iom mw in particular when the mw was 10 kda f4 f5 and f6 the dominance of thm formation became more significant the ratios of haafp thmfp decreased from 2 5 to 1 with the decrease of iom mw this suggests that small molecules of iom with mw 10 kda are likely favorable precursors to the formation of thms rather than haas by normalizing the doc contributions in fig 1a the distribution of each fractionated mw of iom to thmfp haafp and c dbpfp was calculated as shown in fig s2 as the f1 fractions of the two species comprised the largest contribution to the total doc associated with their greatest dbp formation potential f1 thus contributed the largest proportion to the formation of thms haas and c dbps among six mw fractions accounting for 34 53 70 75 and 54 65 respectively although small fractions with mw 10 kda f4 f5 and f6 also had high contribution of the total doc of about 50 60 fig 1a their final contribution to dbp formation was relatively insignificant 20 fig s2 because they possessed low specific dbpfps the explanation for the iom derived dbps varying within mw will be discussed below 3 4 functionality xps analysis was carried out for iom fractions f1 100 kda and f6 1 kda as they were extremely different in terms of mw fluorescence and dbp formation potential their chemical compositions and functional structures were used to further interpret the formation of iom derived c dbps three essential elements of om c o and n were investigated table 1 lists the contributions of each element and their relative ratios in the chemical structures of the f1 and f6 fractions the percentages and ratios of the three elements were comparable for f1 fractions of the two species while they were very different for f6 of both iom in particular two f1 were similarly constituted with high carbon content which was relatively twice and twelve fold higher than that of the oxygen and nitrogen content respectively as shown in table 1 although the total amount of c and o content in fraction f6 of ma was similar to f1 f6 comprised only 2 of the n content in contrast fraction f6 of ch had a greater o content 50 with a comparable amount of n but significantly less c compared to its corresponding f1 detail scanning for core level spectra of each c1s o1s and n1s was further carried out for f1 and f6 fractions to further understand their functionality as shown in fig s3 and table 2 after resolving the overlapped chemical bonding peaks in c1s three corresponding groups were generally detected in the large fractions f1 of the two species of algae these included aliphatic aromatic cc ch 283 92 0 04 ev alcohol co 285 24 0 10 ev and keto c o 286 57 0 05 ev ting et al 1995 these c functional groups were also found in the small mw fractions of f6 associated with the additions of carboxyl oc o groups 291 89 0 01 ev and unknown groups located at 294 62 0 01 ev as shown in table 2 fractions f1 of the two species comprised of similar and large amounts of aliphatic aromatic groups 55 57 with the absence of carboxylic and unknown groups conversely fractions f6 constituted much less aliphatic aromatic contents with a greater amount carboxylic and unknown carbon particularly in the case of ch iom where only 25 of carbon bonding belonged to aliphatic aromatic compounds but 50 whereas carboxylic and unknown carbon bonds accounted for 50 of the carbon bonding the o1s results mostly correspond with the c1s findings in which carboxylic groups were mainly found in the fractions f6 of both species 40 for n1s both f1 fractions clearly showed higher contents of nc bond compared to f6 fractions the determination of the composition and function of the two distinct fractions f1 and f6 further support the results given in fig 2 implying that i the dominance of ap and smp like fluorescent components in large mw fractions 100 kda f1 of iom is constituted by carbon and nitrogen rich substances with considerable sites of cc ch and nc and ii the abundance of ha and fa like fluorescence in the small mw fractions 1 kda f6 can be attributed to carboxylic based molecules that associates with either less n for ma or more o for ch content in their chemical structures 3 5 discussion 3 5 1 variations of iom derived thms and haas within mw iom derived thms and haas are strongly depended on mw properties for iom mw varying from 100 kda to 1 kda more significant levels of c dbps are formed for mw 100 kda but only low levels of c dbps are produced mw 10 kda the differences in iom derived dbps with large and small mw are attributed to their different fluorescent compositions and functional structures of the precursors large mw iom is evidently constituted by ap and smp like components these are carbon nitrogen rich substances from the essential aromatic proteins in algal cells such as tryptophan tyrosine phenylalanine and histidine fang et al 2010 studies have reported that aromatic proteins and or substances with ap and smp like components are high yielding dbp precursors and produce substantial levels of both thms and haas because they have a large content of highly reactive carbons in their chemical structures for chlorine incorporation hong et al 2009 hua et al 2017 2018b indeed our results show that the abundance of ap and smp like components in the large mw fraction also associates with the more available reactive carbon content cc ch and electron donating functional groups n r2 and or table 2 in contrast the chemical structures of the small mw fractions 10 kda which are mainly presented in ha and fa like fluorescence contain 1 less amount of carbons 2 a considerable number of carbonyl groups coo which is unfavorable for chlorine substitution and 3 limited electron donating functional groups as the om has more available reactive carbon sites the higher the degree of chlorine substitution reckhow et al 1990 large mw iom 100 kda is thus a more important and higher yielding precursor for the formation of c dbps compared to small mw iom 10 kda mw property of iom also influences the ratio of thm and haa formation as shown in fig 3 while mw fractions 10 kda f1 f2 and f3 preferentially follow the formation pathway of haas mw fractions at 10 kda f4 f5 and f6 tend to produce more thms it should be noted that the thms produced in this study were chiefly contributed by tcm and haas were accounted for dcaa and tcaa during the chlorination of om precursors dcaa and tcaa were predominantly formed when the chemical structure of intermediates was constituted by readily oxidizable functional groups i e carbon carbon double bond alcohol and amine otherwise tcm is possibly formed as the final product hong et al 2009 hua et al 2017 reckhow et al 1990 as shown in table 2 the functionality of small mw fractions is more deficient in c c oh and nc compared to large mw fractions this results in a higher tendency to undergo the formation of thms rather than haas from small mw of iom combined with the fluorescent results these results further support our previous findings hua et al 2017 that found that precursors containing ap and smp like components are favorable precursors of haas when precursors with ha and fa like components tend to form thms 3 5 2 fluorescent and mw dependence of iom derived thms and haas our results convincingly demonstrate the dependence of iom derived thms and haas on the fluorescent and mw properties cca was used to explore these relationships and fig 4 shows the cca ordination biplot for twelve mw fractions from two ioms as sample sites associated with four eem components as quantitative explanatory variables and two dbps as object points as can be seen in fig 4 the cca test separates the sample sites into two groups group i of large mw f1 100 kda and f2 100 30 kda and group ii of small mw f3 f4 f5 and f6 30 kda interestingly it also divides thms and haas closely associated with these two sample groups further confirming the dependence of thm and haa formation on iom mw properties furthermore the cca biplot shows distinctly different directions of eem components while ap and smp components are closed and have a positive correlation with haas and two large mw ioms group i ha and fa components by contrast correlate mostly positively with thms and small mw ioms group ii these results are robust confirmation that iom derived thms and haas are strongly dependent on fluorescent and mw properties large mw iom exhibiting ap and smp like fluorescence is favorable for the formation of haas while small mw iom with ha and fa like fluorescence tends to form thms to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to elucidate the role of fluorescent and mw properties on the formation of iom derived thms and haas thus the results from this study will provide useful information for the future dbp research furthermore since fluorescent and mw properties are common and important characteristics of the water matrix our findings imply that the control of dbps derived from algae containing water can significantly be benefited by applying these adequate characterization tools 4 conclusions our experimental and statistical results convincingly show the strong dependence of iom derived thms and haas on the fluorescent and mw properties of iom precursors of the mw varying from 100 kda to 1 kda the large fraction of 100 kda is the most important portion of iom precursors which not only makes the greatest contribution to mw distribution but also produces and contributes the highest levels of thms haas and c dbps this evidently results from the abundance of carbon nitrogen rich substances in such large mw iom which contain a large number of reactive carbon sites for chlorine substitution and exhibits ap and smp like fluorescence by contrast although small mw fractions 10 kda accounts for around half of the total doc of iom they are insignificant in contributing to the overall c dbps low thms and haas derived from small mw fractions are mainly attributed to the dominance of the carboxylic group and the deficiency of the conjugated system and amide content in their chemical structures the outcomes of this study provide more significant insights into the principle of iom derived dbps and potentially benefits the control of algae yielded dbps in drinking water acknowledgments we greatly appreciate the assistance of wouter holleman for proofreading this

19196,this study i examined the formation of two major carbonaceous disinfection by products c dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas during the chlorination of intracellular algogenic organic matter iom extracted from two commonly blooming algae m aeruginosa ma and chlorella sp ch and ii investigated the roles and relationships of fluorescent and molecular weight mw properties on with iom derived thms and haas the extracted iom samples were separated into different mw fractions by centrifugal devices with membrane support with mw cut offs of 100 30 10 3 and 1 kda we observed an overall reduction of c dbps with a decrease of iom mw from 100 kda to 1 kda of six fractionated iom a large fraction 100 kda contributed the largest amount to the mw distribution of iom accounting for 33 and 42 of the total dissolved organic carbon doc of ma and ch respectively it also had the highest yielding potential to produce significant levels of thms and haas and total c dbps over other small mw fractions although small mw fractions 10 kda contributed around 50 of the total doc they made an insignificant contribution 20 to the thms haas and overall c dbps furthermore the decrease of iom mw caused a shift from the domination of haa formation to thm formation especially when mw was 10 kda by canonical correspondent analysis the relationship of iom derived thms and haas with iom properties was examined in particular large fractions of iom exhibiting aromatic protein ap and soluble microbial product smp like fluorescence are favorable for the formation of haas whereas small mw fractions of iom with ha and fa like fluorescence preferentially tends to form thms our findings evidently show the strong dependence of iom derived thms and haas on the fluorescent and mw properties therefore the characterization of mw and fluorescent properties can provide the advantages in the control of algae derived dbps upon the chlorination of eutrophic water graphical abstract image 1 keywords algogenic organic matter dbps chlorination fluorescence molecular weight 1 introduction bloom of algae in an aquatic environment is a critical problem in water treatment utilities it frequently causes a dramatic deterioration of water quality by increasing turbidity taste and odor and algal toxins in the water column henderson et al 2008a tomlinson et al 2016 importantly algal

goslan et al 2017 hua et al 2018a huang et al 2009 plummer and edzwald 2001 zhu et al 2015 aom as a precursor to dbps can be generally categorized into extra eom and intra cellular organic matter iom while eom is rapidly released via algal exudation in soluble organic form fogg et al 1965 iom is the internal organic substances released by the rupture of the cell membrane tomlinson et al 2016 nonetheless they both are difficult to effectively be removed by conventional coagulation sedimentation filtration processes cheng and chi 2003 henderson et al 2010 takaara et al 2007 and controlling aom derived dbps during the algal bloom has thus become the greatest challenge for sustainable production of safe drinking water a better understanding of aom physicochemical properties significantly benefits an effective control of its derived dbps in general probing fluorophores provide valuable information about the possible composition and relatively quantitative content of aom precursor chen

precursors based on fluorescent and mw properties has attracted more and more attention however current research into aom dbp has as yet not fully resolved such relationships because aom is a complex

2008b hua and reckhow 2007 pivokonsky et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 this study was aimed at characterizing the fractionated aom precursors based on mw as a function of fluorescence and to examine the relationship between aom fluorescent and mw properties with its derived dbp formation upon chlorination iom derived dbp was the central focus of this research because in practice iom i contributes a significant fraction to total aom 80 tomlinson et al 2016 ii is a more difficult matter to be removed by conventional treatments pivokonsky et al 2014 takaara et al 2017 and iii importantly is a

chlorella sp ch ma and ch were selected because they are two commonly blooming algae that occur worldwide ndlela et al 2016 tas and gonulol 2007 furthermore two major classes of carbonaceous dbps including trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas were investigated as they are dominantly found upon chlorination of iom compared to other dbps such as chloroacetones chloroacetonitriles

iom extraction m aeruginosa and chlorella sp were isolated from a local reservoir in matsu taiwan they were isolated into the unialgal culture by a commonly used protocol with agar plate streaking technique and successive dilution method their axenic cultures were conducted in a thermostat photobioreactor containing 6 l of modified bg11 and chlorella medium the conditions of algal culture were followed our previous work hua et al 2018b algal growth phases were determined by monitoring the cell population every 2 days the algal suspensions with the volume of 500 ml from the late exponential phase of the two species were selected for iom extraction algal cells were separated from eom by centrifugation for 15 min at 2700 g at 4 c boeco centrifuges u 320r germany and then washed twice with deionized di water to remove the remaining eom the collected cells were lyophilized in a freeze drier pin chen co taiwan at 50 c and 2 10 4 torr for 6 h iom was extracted physically by gently grinding the lyophilized cells for 2 min with a mortar and pestle after grinding iom was extracted by re suspending the ruptured cells in 100 ml of di water and shaking vigorously for 30 s using a vortex mixer this suspension was then spun in a centrifuge again for 15 min at 2700 g at 4 c prior to filtration through a 0 45 μm filter advantec japan to archive the iom 2 2 molecular weight fractionation the iom water samples of the two species were separated into different mw fractions using a series of centrifugal devices with membrane support macrosep advance centrifugal device pall usa with mw cut offs mwco of 100 30 10 3 and 1 kda before using for iom isolation each centrifugal device was washed twice by di water at the identical centrifugation conditions with samples it is noticed that such centrifugation conditions could recover 95 of the blank di water for all mwco 20 ml of concentrated iom samples doc 100 mg l was loaded into the top of the centrifugal devices and spun at 2700 g for 30 min at 4 c after the serial fractionation iom samples were separated into six fractions with the mw ranges of f1 100 kda f2 100 30 kda f3 30 10 kda f4 10 3 kda f5 3 1 kda f6 1 kda this process was duplicated and the duplicates were used for other analyses and dbp formation tests all water samples were adjusted to ph 7 and stored at 20 c before use 2 3 doc and don measurements dissolved organic

measurements were conducted in duplicate for each mw fraction 2 4 eem spectra fluorescent spectra or eem spectra of the original and fractionated iom samples were analyzed with a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer varian inc palo alto ca usa before eem analysis water samples were adjusted to a doc of 10 mg l for comparison eem scanning was carried out with excitation wavelengths ranged from 200 to 400 nm with 10 nm increments and emission wavelengths ranging from 250 to 550 nm with 2 nm increments the voltage of the photomultiplier tube was set to 800 v for low light detection di water with doc 0 2 mg l was used as a blank the raw eem intensities of each sample were subtracted for the blank di water and rayleigh and raman scattering to remove the background and interference four regional fluorescent spectra were determined based on their excitation emission wavelengths following chen et al 2003 these represent the aromatic protein ap soluble microbial product smp humic ha and fulvic like fa substances the average fluorescent intensity afi of each component was calculated based on the average intensity value of each selected region respectively 2 5 characterization of chemical functional structure the chemical functional groups of the fractionated iom were analyzed with a high resolution x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps physical electronics

days of chlorination water samples were acidified and quenched with ammonium chloride to obtain the thmfp and haafp the thmfp were measured by a coupling a purge and trap system model 4660 oi

to examine the relationship among iom derived dbp mw and fluorescent properties data from six mw fractions of two iom 12 sample sites were applied for this test 3 results and discussion 3 1 mw distributions by doc and don distribution of mw in iom was characterized by the contribution of each fraction to the total doc and don of two species as shown in fig 1 both ma and ch iom had bimodal distributions in which large mw 100 kda f1 and small mw fractions 10 kda f4 f5 and f6 mostly contributed up to 90 of the total doc together with insignificant contributions of fractions f2 and f3 fig 2 a while the total don of ma showed a similar distribution with the doc only a large mw fraction f1 was found abundantly in ch don fig 2b briefly the distributions of six fractions in iom followed the order as f1 f4 f5 f6 f2 f3 and fraction f1 evidently made the greatest contributions to the total doc and don profiles of all iom accounting for 33 and 26 in ma iom and 42 and 64 in ch iom respectively this likely results from the dominance of internal phycobiliproteins and chloroplast in ma and ch cells respectively glazer and fang 1973 purton 2001 furthermore this results further supports previous work where the fractions with mw 100 kda also contributed 50 of the total doc and don from the iom of microcytic aeruginosa guo et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 suggesting the significance of large molecules mw 100 kda in the mw distribution of iom 3 2 fluorescent properties probing fluorescent properties provides valuable insights into the chemical compositions of om precursors and their dbp formation potential chen et al 2003 hua et al 2018b fluorescent properties of the two original ioms were firstly characterized by eem spectroscopy to provide the general fluorescent spectra of the iom before fractionation distinct differences in two were found as shown in fig s1 supporting information in particular the original ma iom consisted of a more complex matrix of all four fluorescent components ap smp ha and fa and accounted for 20 16 33 and 31 of the eem intensity respectively conversely the original ch iom was mainly constituted of ap and smp which contributed up to 66 and 22 of the original intensity with negligible contributions by ha and fa these results concurred with the findings of most current reports henderson et al 2008b hua et al 2017 li et al 2012 indicating that the fluorescent characteristics of iom are species dependent furthermore eem scanning was carried out on the six fractionated ioms of the two species and their afi values for four regional components were calculated for quantitative comparison as showed in fig 2 the afi percentages of the four regional components ap smp ha and fa like vary significantly within the reduction of mw reducing mw particularly caused a shift from the dominance of ap and smp to the dominance of ha and fa components comparing the six fractions ap and smp were most abundant in large fraction f1 accounting for 75 of the total afi of the two species the dominance of ap and smp decreased significantly when the mw decreased to 10 kda in f4 f5 and f6 in contrast ha and fa became the dominant components under this mw range accounting for around 85 and 60 of the total afi in cases of f5 and f6 of both algal species fig 2a however these results differ from those in liu et al 2018 who reported that ap tryptophan and tyrosine like and smp were the dominant components in the small mw fraction of 5 kda of the iom derived from microcytic aeruginosa this can possibly be attributed to the differences in the iom extraction protocol between the two studies nevertheless there requires practical evidence to clarify the effects of extraction methods on iom properties in brief our eem afi results show a strong relationship between mw variations and fluorescent properties of iom in which large mw 100 kda of iom mainly exhibits ap and smp like fluorescence whereas small mw 10 kda of iom is abundant in ha and fa fluorescence 3 3 thm and haa formation potential dbp formation tests were carried out for six mw fractions and the original iom of ma fig 3 a and ch fig 3b as no bromide was included in the dbp tests brominated dbps were negligibly detected in this study trichloromethane tcm was the major thm observed 98 of total thm while monochloroacetic acid mcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa were the three dominantly obtained compounds in haas 99 of total haas the results of formation tests show that the c dbps of the two species rapidly reduced with the decrease of iom mw from f1 to f6 the impact of mw reduction on iom dbp yields was statistically more pronounced in haafp and c dbpfp than in thmfp the largest amounts of c dbps of the six iom fractions was found in the large mw fractions f1 100 kda of both species which significantly were three fold larger than those derived from the smallest mw f6 furthermore the total c dbp produced by f1 was even larger than that of the corresponding original iom these results indicate that the large molecules of iom with mw 100 kda are the most important precursors of iom derived dbps and that iom derived dbps are strongly mw dependent fig 3 also shows a shift from a dominance of haas to a dominance of thms with the decrease of iom mw in particular when the mw was 10 kda f4 f5 and f6 the dominance of thm formation became more significant the ratios of haafp thmfp decreased from 2 5 to 1 with the decrease of iom mw this suggests that small molecules of iom with mw 10 kda are likely favorable precursors to the formation of thms rather than haas by normalizing the doc contributions in fig 1a the distribution of each fractionated mw of iom to thmfp haafp and c dbpfp was calculated as shown in fig s2 as the f1 fractions of the two species comprised the largest contribution to the total doc associated with their greatest dbp formation potential f1 thus contributed the largest proportion to the formation of thms haas and c dbps among six mw fractions accounting for 34 53 70 75 and 54 65 respectively although small fractions with mw 10 kda f4 f5 and f6 also had high contribution of the total doc of about 50 60 fig 1a their final contribution to dbp formation was relatively insignificant 20 fig s2 because they possessed low specific dbpfps the explanation for the iom derived dbps varying within mw will be discussed below 3 4 functionality xps analysis was carried out for iom fractions f1 100 kda and f6 1 kda as they were extremely different in terms of mw fluorescence and dbp formation potential their chemical compositions and functional structures were used to further interpret the formation of iom derived c dbps three essential elements of om c o and n were investigated table 1 lists the contributions of each element and their relative ratios in the chemical structures of the f1 and f6 fractions the percentages and ratios of the three elements were comparable for f1 fractions of the two species while they were very different for f6 of both iom in particular two f1 were similarly constituted with high carbon content which was relatively twice and twelve fold higher than that of the oxygen and nitrogen content respectively as shown in table 1 although the total amount of c and o content in fraction f6 of ma was similar to f1 f6 comprised only 2 of the n content in contrast fraction f6 of ch had a greater o content 50 with a comparable amount of n but significantly less c compared to its corresponding f1 detail scanning for core level spectra of each c1s o1s and n1s was further carried out for f1 and f6 fractions to further understand their functionality as shown in fig s3 and table 2 after resolving the overlapped chemical bonding peaks in c1s three corresponding groups were generally detected in the large fractions f1 of the two species of algae these included aliphatic aromatic cc ch 283 92 0 04 ev alcohol co 285 24 0 10 ev and keto c o 286 57 0 05 ev ting et al 1995 these c functional groups were also found in the small mw fractions of f6 associated with the additions of carboxyl oc o groups 291 89 0 01 ev and unknown groups located at 294 62 0 01 ev as shown in table 2 fractions f1 of the two species comprised of similar and large amounts of aliphatic aromatic groups 55 57 with the absence of carboxylic and unknown groups conversely fractions f6 constituted much less aliphatic aromatic contents with a greater amount carboxylic and unknown carbon particularly in the case of ch iom where only 25 of carbon bonding belonged to aliphatic aromatic compounds but 50 whereas carboxylic and unknown carbon bonds accounted for 50 of the carbon bonding the o1s results mostly correspond with the c1s findings in which carboxylic groups were mainly found in the fractions f6 of both species 40 for n1s both f1 fractions clearly showed higher contents of nc bond compared to f6 fractions the determination of the composition and function of the two distinct fractions f1 and f6 further support the results given in fig 2 implying that i the dominance of ap and smp like fluorescent components in large mw fractions 100 kda f1 of iom is constituted by carbon and nitrogen rich substances with considerable sites of cc ch and nc and ii the abundance of ha and fa like fluorescence in the small mw fractions 1 kda f6 can be attributed to carboxylic based molecules that associates with either less n for ma or more o for ch content in their chemical structures 3 5 discussion 3 5 1 variations of iom derived thms and haas within mw iom derived thms and haas are strongly depended on mw properties for iom mw varying from 100 kda to 1 kda more significant levels of c dbps are formed for mw 100 kda but only low levels of c dbps are produced mw 10 kda the differences in iom derived dbps with large and small mw are attributed to their different fluorescent compositions and functional structures of the precursors large mw iom is evidently constituted by ap and smp like components these are carbon nitrogen rich substances from the essential aromatic proteins in algal cells such as tryptophan tyrosine phenylalanine and histidine fang et al 2010 studies have reported that aromatic proteins and or substances with ap and smp like components are high yielding dbp precursors and produce substantial levels of both thms and haas because they have a large content of highly reactive carbons in their chemical structures for chlorine incorporation hong et al 2009 hua et al 2017 2018b indeed our results show that the abundance of ap and smp like components in the large mw fraction also associates with the more available reactive carbon content cc ch and electron donating functional groups n r2 and or table 2 in contrast the chemical structures of the small mw fractions 10 kda which are mainly presented in ha and fa like fluorescence contain 1 less amount of carbons 2 a considerable number of carbonyl groups coo which is unfavorable for chlorine substitution and 3 limited electron donating functional groups as the om has more available reactive carbon sites the higher the degree of chlorine substitution reckhow et al 1990 large mw iom 100 kda is thus a more important and higher yielding precursor for the formation of c dbps compared to small mw iom 10 kda mw property of iom also influences the ratio of thm and haa formation as shown in fig 3 while mw fractions 10 kda f1 f2 and f3 preferentially follow the formation pathway of haas mw fractions at 10 kda f4 f5 and f6 tend to produce more thms it should be noted that the thms produced in this study were chiefly contributed by tcm and haas were accounted for dcaa and tcaa during the chlorination of om precursors dcaa and tcaa were predominantly formed when the chemical structure of intermediates was constituted by readily oxidizable functional groups i e carbon carbon double bond alcohol and amine otherwise tcm is possibly formed as the final product hong et al 2009 hua et al 2017 reckhow et al 1990 as shown in table 2 the functionality of small mw fractions is more deficient in c c oh and nc compared to large mw fractions this results in a higher tendency to undergo the formation of thms rather than haas from small mw of iom combined with the fluorescent results these results further support our previous findings hua et al 2017 that found that precursors containing ap and smp like components are favorable precursors of haas when precursors with ha and fa like components tend to form thms 3 5 2 fluorescent and mw dependence of iom derived thms and haas our results convincingly demonstrate the dependence of iom derived thms and haas on the fluorescent and mw properties cca was used to explore these relationships and fig 4 shows the cca ordination biplot for twelve mw fractions from two ioms as sample sites associated with four eem components as quantitative explanatory variables and two dbps as object points as can be seen in fig 4 the cca test separates the sample sites into two groups group i of large mw f1 100 kda and f2 100 30 kda and group ii of small mw f3 f4 f5 and f6 30 kda interestingly it also divides thms and haas closely associated with these two sample groups further confirming the dependence of thm and haa formation on iom mw properties furthermore the cca biplot shows distinctly different directions of eem components while ap and smp components are closed and have a positive correlation with haas and two large mw ioms group i ha and fa components by contrast correlate mostly positively with thms and small mw ioms group ii these results are robust confirmation that iom derived thms and haas are strongly dependent on fluorescent and mw properties large mw iom exhibiting ap and smp like fluorescence is favorable for the formation of haas while small mw iom with ha and fa like fluorescence tends to form thms to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to elucidate the role of fluorescent and mw properties on the formation of iom derived thms and haas thus the results from this study will provide useful information for the future dbp research furthermore since fluorescent and mw properties are common and important characteristics of the water matrix our findings imply that the control of dbps derived from algae containing water can significantly be benefited by applying these adequate characterization tools 4 conclusions our experimental and statistical results convincingly show the strong dependence of iom derived thms and haas on the fluorescent and mw properties of iom precursors of the mw varying from 100 kda to 1 kda the large fraction of 100 kda is the most important portion of iom precursors which not only makes the greatest contribution to mw distribution but also produces and contributes the highest levels of thms haas and c dbps this evidently results from the abundance of carbon nitrogen rich substances in such large mw iom which contain a large number of reactive carbon sites for chlorine substitution and exhibits ap and smp like fluorescence by contrast although small mw fractions 10 kda accounts for around half of the total doc of iom they are insignificant in contributing to the overall c dbps low thms and haas derived from small mw fractions are mainly attributed to the dominance of the carboxylic group and the deficiency of the conjugated system and amide content in their chemical structures the outcomes of this study provide more significant insights into the

19197,peroxymonosulfate pms has been recently used as an additive to pretreat waste activated sludge was to enhance short chain fatty acids scfas production however the mechanisms of how pms enhances scfas production remain largely unknown this work therefore aims to explore the mechanisms through deeply understanding its impact on the disintegration of sludge cells the biodegradability of organics released and the bioprocesses involved in anaerobic fermentation and differentiating the contributions of its degradation intermediates to scfas production this was demonstrated by a series of batch fermentation tests using either real sludge or model organic compounds as fermentation substrates experimental results showed that the maximal scfas yield increased from 29 69 to 311 67 mg cod g vss with pms level increasing from 0 to 0 09 g g tss no obvious increase in scfas yield was observed when pms further increased the mechanism explorations revealed that pms pretreatment not only enhanced the disintegration of sludge cells but also promoted the biodegradability of organics released thereby providing more biodegradable substrates for subsequent scfas production pms pretreatment decreased the percentages of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances in the released organics moreover the species and total detection frequency of other recalcitrant organics such as cyclopentasiloxane heptasiloxane and ethylene glycol which were hardly degraded in ordinary anaerobic condition also decreased remarkably although pms caused harms to some extents to all the microbes in the anaerobic fermentation its inhibitions to scfas consumers were much severer than that to scfas producers probably due to the less tolerance of methanogens further analyses exhibited that 1o2 so4 and oh were the major contributors to the increased scfas production and their contributions were in the order of 1o2 so4 oh the findings obtained in this work provide insights into pms involved

et al 2014 lu et al 2012 wang et al 2017 among them advanced oxidation processes have attracted great interests for sludge disintegrating and dewatering due to its high efficiency and low cost several oxidants such as peroxide ozone persulfate potassium ferrate potassium permanganate were widely used before chu et al 2009 wu et al 2014 ye et al 2012 peroxymonosulfate pms obtained as a mixture of 2khso5 k2so4 khso4 is widely used in numerous industrial processes as bleaching agent disinfectant and oxidant in organic synthesis because of its powerful oxidative capacity and operation simplicity venkatesh and karunakaran 2013 as the triple salt pms is commercially known as oxone which is a monosubstituted derivative of h2o2 but has a greater powerful oxidizability than h2o2 e0 hso5 hso4 1 82v e0 h2o2 h2o 1 76v when pms is activated in hydrous media sulfate radical sr so4 will be produced which has a higher oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 v wider operative ph range and longer half life in the past great efforts have been made to use the activation of pms to produce sr for removing organic pollutants from wastewater e g pesticides pharmaceuticals dyes aromatics halogenated olefins and perfluorinated compounds or enhancing disintegration and dewaterability of was li et al 2016b liu et al 2017 olmez hanci et al 2011 ye et al 2012 for example rastogi et al founded that fe ii pms systems were very effective in degrading polychlorinated biphenyls in a sediment slurry system with more than 90 polychlorinated biphenyls being removed within 24 h rastogi et al 2009 tan et al demonstrated that 93 3 of orange ii in wastewater could be degraded in 90 min at 60 c by ferrous activated pms tan et al 2017 ren et al 2015 investigated the effects of sr oxidation on disintegration of waste activated sludge and found that with pms level increasing from 0 to 12 mg g ss sludge disintegration degrees in total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen increased from 0 to 24 8 and 29 9 respectively liu et al 2016 reported that compared with the raw sludge the capillary suction time and specific resistance of sludge declined from 201 8s to 19 5s and from 95 2 1012 m kg to 3 5 1012 m kg respectively at n fe2 n hso5 0 9 apart from these applications mentioned above jin and coworkers recently pointed out another new direction being an additive to pretreat was for the enhancement of scfas yield jin et al 2018 it was found that when was was pretreated with 0 08 mg pms mg ss scfas yield of 716 72 mg chemical oxygen demand cod l was achieved which was 43 7 times than that of the control they further demonstrated that pms mainly affected physicochemical property of was microbial community structure and enzymic levels this excellent attempt opens a new door for the application of pms and provides an attractive technology for was treatment by simply adding certain amounts of pms into was pretreatment unit sludge disintegration dewaterability and scfas yield were all enhanced considering numerous amount of was produced everyday worldwide the pms based sludge pretreatment should have significantly environmental and economic benefits despite the useful information details of how pms based sludge pretreatment improves scfas production especially from the aspect of sludge biodegradability remain largely unavailable besides biodegradable substances was also contains a portion of non biodegradable substances which are generally not utilized by scfa producers it is unknown whether pms based pretreatment enhances the sludge biodegradability if it does which recalcitrant substances are degraded after was disintegration the soluble substrates will undergo several bioprocesses e g hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis which are closely related to scfas production or consumption to date however no information is available on whether and how pms pretreatment affects these bioprocesses moreover it is known that several intermediates such as k h oh 1o2 and so4 may be formed with the decomposition of pms but their potential contributions to anaerobic fermentation have not been differentiated as well zhou et al 2015 ahmadi and ghanbari 2018 based on the question above this work therefore aims to explore the underlying mechanisms of how pms enhances scfas production from anaerobic fermentation of was to obtain comprehensive information the effect of pms at different dosages 0 03 0 06 0 09 0 12 or 0 24 g g tss on scfas production was first investigated then the details of how pms pretreatment improves scfas production were explored through evaluating its impact on the disintegration of sludge cells the biodegradability of organics released the contents of several recalcitrant substances and the processes of sludge hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis processes to differentiate the contributions of the intermediates decomposed from pms to scfas production a series of fermentation tests were finally conducted this work deepens our understanding of how pms pretreatment affects anaerobic fermentation of was expands the application of pms and enlightens engineers to develop a promising technology to enhance both the removal of recalcitrant substances and production of scfa from was 2 material and methods 2 1 the sources of raw was and pms the was used in this investigation was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant in changsha china the collected sludge was concentrated by settling at 4 c for 24 h before being used in the following tests the main characteristics of the concentrated was were ph 6 87 0 1 total suspended solids tss 25 667 101 mg l volatile suspended solids vss 15 702 65 mg l total dissolved solids tds 2560 48 mg l total chemical oxygen demand tcod 16 956 243 mg l soluble chemical oxygen demand scod 331 17 mg l potassium peroxymonsulfate triple salt khso5 47 was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagents co shanghai china the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification 2 2 scfas production from anaerobic fermentation of was pretreated by pms at different levels this batch test was performed in six identical serum bottles each bottle was first fed with 500 ml was then 0 0 3851 0 7701 1 1552 1 5402 or 3 0804 g pms was added into these six serum bottles giving rise to the pms dosage of 0 as the control 0 03 0 06 0 09 0 12 or 0 24 g g tss after pms addition was in each bottle was respectively stirred at 300 rpm for 5 min and 150 rpm for 150 min at ambient temperature to mix sludge and pms rapidly and completely afterwards high purity nitrogen gas at a constant flow rate of 0 5 l min was introduced to each reactor for 5 min to remove oxygen before the reactors being capped and sealed for better mass transfer all the bottles were stirred in an air bath shaker 120 rpm at 35 1 c the fermentation test lasted for 12 days during which the maximal yield of scfas in all the fermenters was achieved the ph in all the fermenters was not adjusted but recorded during the entire period 2 3 the impact of pms pretreatment on the disintegration of was and biodegradability of organics released to assess the impact of pms on the disintegration of was the morphology of was the concentrations of soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates toc and vss reduction in the fermenters conducted in section 2 2 were measured in the initial 72 h of fermentation by comparing these data among the fermenters the effect of pms addition on the disintegration of was could be indicated to evaluate the impact of pms on the biodegradability of organics released the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to determine the structure changes of fermentation liquid according to the literature chen et al 2003 jia et al 2013 reynolds 2002 the eem spectrum of fermentation liquor can be generally divided into five regions based on the specific ranges of the excitation and emission wavelength see table s1 supporting information among these organics the organics located in region i i e tyrosine like proteins and region iv i e soluble microbial by product like substances are thought as biodegradable while region iii i e fulvic acid like substances and region v i e humic acid like substances are supposed as non biodegradable the abundances of these organics could be depicted by the percent fluorescence response pi n and the method is detailed in supplementary data see text s1 supporting information to obtain more information on pms affecting the biodegradation of non biodegradable substrates gc ms analysis was also employed to analyze the species and total detection frequency of recalcitrant organics in the fermenters before and after fermentation the analytical method of gc ms is detailed in text s3 supporting information 2 4 the impacts of pms pretreatment on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis processes apart from sludge disintegration and the biodegradability of the released organics several other bio processes such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis are also included in anaerobic fermentation of was which affect scfas production or consumption significantly to assess the potential impacts of pms and its major intermediates on these processes the following set of tests using model substrates was carried out in the tests 15 serum bottles with a working volume of 500 ml each were performed these reactors were divided into five tests test i test ii test iii test iv and test v with three in each a total volume of 450 ml inocula taken from a long term semi continuous fermenter for scfas production operated in our lab in stable operation were equally distributed into the three serum bottles then different amounts of pms were added into the three bottles to achieve pms dosages of 0 0 09 or 0 24 g g tss all other operations were the same as those described in section 2 2 after 24 h treatment the inocula in each bottle were centrifuged 5000 rpm for 10 min and washed with tap water for three times to remove the released substances and potential residual pms and re suspended in tap water with a final volume of 150 ml before being used as inocula for the following fermentation tests test i this test was used to assess the impacts of pms on hydrolysis process in this test each reactor received 270 ml synthetic wastewater and 30 ml inocula treated by 0 0 09 or 0 24 g g tss pms as described above the synthetic wastewater contains 3 5 g bovine serum albumin bsa average molecular weight 67 000 a model protein compound l the test lasted for 3d and bsa concentration in these bottles was measured daily the vss concentration in each fermenter was measured at the end of the test the volumetric degradation rate of bsa was measured by linear regression of the corresponding concentration profile the biomass specific degradation rate of bsa in each bottle was calculated by dividing the corresponding volumetric rate by the vss concentration test ii the test was used to evaluate the impacts of pms on acidogenesis process the operation of this test was performed with the same approach as described in test i except that the fermentation substrate i e bsa was replaced by glucose a model monosaccharide compound test iii the test was utilized to assess the impacts of pms on acetogenesis process the operational procedure of this test was conducted the same as that depicted in test i except that the fermentation substrate in synthetic wastewater was replaced by sodium butyrate test iv this test was used to evaluate the impacts of pms on hydrogen consumption by either homoacetogenesis or methanogenesis process each bottle first received 270 ml tap water and 30 ml inocula treated by 0 0 09 or 0 24 g g tss pms as mentioned above all the bottles were then flushed with a combined gas 40 hydrogen 10 carbon dioxide and 50 nitrogen for 5 min to guarantee that they were filled with the synthetic hydrogen containing gas and it did not need an extra nitrogen gas injection process after that all bottles were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an air bath shaker at stirring speed of 120 rpm test v the test was used to assess the impacts of pms on methanogenesis process the operation of this test was carried out the same as depicted in test i except that bsa in synthetic wastewater was replaced by acetate 2 5 differentiation of the contributions of k2so4 khso4 so4 1o2 and oh to the increased scfas production pms would be decomposed in the fermentation period and k2so4 khso4 so4 1o2 and oh are the major intermediates please see section 3 4 for details to assess their contributions to scfas production the following batch fermentation test was conducted in this test ten replicate serum bottles with identical working volume were performed and each received 500 ml was among them one was set as the blank without any addition of chemicals besides 500 ml was the other nine reactors also received 1 1552 g pms 0 3269 g k2so4 0 2556 g khso4 1 1552 g pms 1 m methanol 1 1552 g pms 1 m tert butanol 1 1552 g pms 1 m sodium azide 1 m sodium azide 1 m methanol or 1 m tert butanol it was reported that sodium azide was used to scavenge 1o2 so4 and oh k 1 o 2 2 109 m 1 s 1 k so 4 2 52 109 m 1 s 1 k oh 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 methanol was used to scavenge both so4 and oh k so 4 0 9 1 3 107 m 1 s 1 k oh 8 0 10 108 m 1 s 1 and tert butanol mainly reacted with oh k so 4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 k oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 zhou et al 2015 wu et al 2018 thus the quenching experiments using sodium azide methanol or tert butanol were employed to identify the contributions of 1o2 so4 and oh on scfas production in the was system the initial concentrations of these chemicals added were selected according to the stoichiometric relationship in the 0 09 g pms g tss fermenter operated in section 2 2 after the addition of the chemicals all the bottles were purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to guarantee anaerobic condition capped with rubber stoppers and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm under 35 1 c all other operations were the same as those described in section 2 2 the test lasted for 5 days during which the concentration of scfas in all the fermenters was measured periodically 2 6 analytical methods ph was measured using a digital ph meter phs 3c leici co ltd shanghai china oxidation reduction potential orp was determined using an hq40d digital meter hach usa total organic carbon toc was determined by toc 5050a analyzer shimadzu japan tcod scod tss vss were determined according to the standard methods apha 1998 soluble proteins were determined by the lowry folin method with bsa as the standard and soluble polysaccharides were determined by the phenol sulfuric method with glucose as the standard chen et al 2007 an agilent 6890 gc agilent usa with aflame ionization detector and a dbwaxtre column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 mm was utilized to analyze the composition of scfas and the method was detailed in a previous study yuan et al 2006 methane was measured using a gas chromatograph gc 14b shimadzu japan with analytical approach being detailed in our previous publication wang et al 2015 the morphologies were observed by scanning electron microscopy jsm 6700f particle size distribution after pretreating was determined by a laser diffraction sensor mas tersizer 2000 malvern firm 3d eem fluorescence spectra were measured using a luminescence spectrometry f 4600 fl spectrophotometer hitachi japan with the methods being detailed in the text s2 supporting information gc ms analysis was used to analyze the recalcitrant organics in was fermentation systems and the method was provided in text s3 supporting information electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis was used for assessing the dynamic changes of free radicals and please see details in text s4 supporting information all the tests were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 scfas production from was anaerobic fermentation in the presence of pms at different dosages fig 1 a shows the total scfas production from was anaerobic fermentation in the presence of pms at different dosages it can be seen that the yield of scfas in the blank fermenter without addition of pms was always low 50 mg cod g vss during the entire fermentation period which was consistent with the data reported previously he et al 2017 li et al 2016a this is mainly due to the low was disintegration rate and the rapid scfas consumption li et al 2015 wu et al 2017 when pms pretreatment was applied scfas yield increased largely with an increase of pms addition from 0 to 0 09 g g tss the maximal scfas yield increased from 29 69 to 311 67 mg cod g vss further increase of pms addition to either 0 12 or 0 24 g g tss did not result in a significant enhancement of maximal scfas yield p 0 05 in the fermenter with 0 or 0 03 g g tss pms addition the produced scfas were consumed completely after 10 days fermentation however in the fermenter with 0 06 0 09 0 12 or 0 24 g g tss pms addition the scfas produced was not consumed largely suggesting that pertinent addition of pms could inhibit effectively the activities of scfas consumers additionally the maximal scfas yield occurred on 10 days in the fermenter with 0 24 g g tss pms addition which was longer than that in other fermenters 3 6 days this indicated that pms addition at such a level caused severe inhibition to scfas producers as well fig 1b exhibits the percentages of individual scfas in all the fermenters at their maximum scfa yield time all the six individual acids i e acetic propionic iso butyric n butyric iso valeric and n valeric acids were detected in the fermenters but their fractions were also affected by pms pretreatment for example the average percentage of acetic acid was 17 3 in the blank while this value increased to 43 4 in the 0 03 g pms g tss added fermenter 56 2 in the 0 06 g pms g tss added fermenter and 60 3 in the 0 09 g pms g tss added fermenter respectively the percentage of propionic acid decreased from 38 9 to 7 5 with pms dosage increasing from 0 to 0 24 g pms g tss to further reflect the effect of pms pretreatment on was anaerobic fermentation cod mass balance analysis among the fermenters was performed based on the determinations of the major intermediates or final fermentation products table 1 it was measured that with an increase of pms addition from 0 to 0 24 g g tss the percentage of vss and methane decreased from 72 8 1 6 and 5 8 0 3 to 56 2 1 2 and 1 3 0 2 respectively indicating that pms pretreatment enhanced the disintegration of was and inhibited the methanongegesis the profiles of methane production in the fermenters are detailed in fig s1 supporting information the percentages of soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates hydrogen and scfas increased with the increase of pms dosage these data suggested that besides was disintegration and methanogenesis other biological processes involved in anaerobic fermentation were affected by pms pretreatment as well besides these compositions several other substances which were mainly non biodegradable organics such as humic substances were also produced in the fermentation process in this study we defined them as others it was found that with an increase of pms dosage from 0 to 0 24 g g tss the fraction of others to total cod decreased from 16 88 0 5 to 6 75 0 4 indicating that the addition of pms enhanced the degradation of non biodegradable substances this deduction would be further elucidated in section 3 2 in the following text the mechanisms of how pms pretreatment affects scfas accumulation were explored 3 2 effect of pms pretreatment on disintegration of was and biodegradability of the soluble organics the organics in was mainly locate in either extracellular or intracellular of sludge cells as solid phase before being fermented they require to be released into liquor phase as soluble organics through was disintegration the major rate limiting step in anaerobic fermentation thus the potential impact of pms pretreatment on was disintegration was first evaluated and the data are displayed in fig 2 soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the supernatant increased with the increase of pms dosage fig 2a for example 1370 12 mg cod l of soluble proteins and 322 71 mg cod l of soluble carbohydrates were measured in the fermenter with 0 24 g pms g tss addition after 24 h which were respectively 5 5 and 8 8 times of those in the blank analogous to soluble proteins and carbohydrates soluble toc also showed an increase trend with the increase of pms addition fig 2b soluble toc in the supernatant increased from 281 81 to 1491 01 mg l with pms addition increasing from 0 to 0 24 g g tss moreover with an increase of pms from 0 to 0 24 g g tss vss reduction after 24 h increased from 6 3 to 27 2 similar observations were also observed on other fermentation times fig s2a supporting information scanning electron microscopy showed that the was without pms addition owned more intact cell flocs than the pms pretreated was figs s3a and 3b supporting information further investigation demonstrated that the pms pretreated was had more flocs with small size than the was without pms addition fig s3c supporting information for example the flocs 50 μm accounted for 38 1 of total sludge volume in the was without pms addition after 24 h while this value increased to 47 2 and 54 6 with pms pretreatment at dosages of 0 09 and 0 24 g pms g tss respectively fig s3c supporting information all the facts demonstrated that pms pretreatment enhanced the disintegration of was which thereby accelerated the transformation of the substrates from sludge cells into fermentation liquor it is known that besides biodegradable substances such as proteins and carbohydrates was also includes several non biodegradable substances which could be released in the fermentation liquor through was disintegration generally these non biodegradable substances can not be utilized by anaerobes in the fermentation process thus it is beneficial to scfas production if pms pretreatment causes transformations of a portion of substances from non biodegradable to biodegradable to assess this possibility the 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to determine the structure changes of fermentation liquid in the fermenters according to the literature the organics located in region i i e tyrosine like proteins and region iv i e soluble microbial by product like substances are thought as biodegradable while the organics located in region iii i e fulvic acid like substances and region v i e humic acid like substances are supposed as non biodegradable fig 3 presents the fluorescence eem spectra and the percentage of fluorescence response pi n of the soluble organics in the fermenters with was pretreated by different dosages of pms for 24 h it can be seen that the fluorescence intensities of the peaks in eem spectra in the fermenter with pms addition were greater than those in the blank i e 0 g g tss pms added fermenter suggesting that more soluble organics were available in the liquor phase in the pms added fermenters li et al 2018 this supported well the data presented in fig 2 it was further calculated that the total percentage of fluorescence responses of region i and region iv were 6 48 and 39 9 in the blank 6 89 and 51 99 in the fermenter with 0 09 g pms g tss addition and 7 35 and 57 59 in the fermenter with 0 24 g pms g tss addition it was obvious that the total percentage of fluorescence response of region i and region iv in the pms added fermenters was greater than that in the blank the higher the pms addition the greater the total percentage of fluorescence response of region i and region iv further analyses with the ratio of bod5 scod in the initial 72 h fermentation supported well the data presented in fig 3 fig s2b supporting information the facts suggested that pms pretreatment enhanced the biodegradability of the soluble organics which thereby provided more biodegradable substances for subsequent bioprocesses for scfas production also from fig 3 it can be found that pi n of region ii was not varied obviously among the fermenters ranging between 11 32 and 13 41 whereas pi n of both region iii and region v decreased largely with the increase of pms addition with an increase of pms addition from 0 to 0 24 g g tss pi n of region iii decreased from 16 63 to 7 48 while pi n of region v decreased from 25 67 to 14 17 it was reported that the organics located in region iii and region v were fulvic acid like substances and humic acid like substances respectively jia et al 2013 previous publications documented that such two substances were at high levels in was accounting for up to 27 of total organics in was li et al 2013 the results indicated that pms pretreatment could remarkably enhance the degradations of fulvic acid like substances and humic acid like substances pms has powerful oxidative capacity with e0 hso5 hso4 being at 1 82v and it is reported previously that pms could degrade many non degradable organics such as pesticides pharmaceuticals dyes aromatics halogenated olefins and perfluorinated compounds guan et al 2012 olmez hanci et al 2011 furthermore it has been reported that hydroxyl and sulfate radicals played major roles in the fulvic acid degradation according to radical scavenger experiments xu et al 2012 to further understand the role of the powerful oxidizability of pms to was gc ms analysis was used to measure the species and total detection frequency of recalcitrant organics in the supernatant of sludge samples thirty recalcitrant organic compounds were detected in the supernatants of raw sludge sample and the total detection frequency was 152 in 7 parallel samples table 2 most of these organics come from cosmetics e g cyclopentasiloxane benzyl alcohol pharmaceutical e g norepinephrine acetaminophen glycine pesticides e g 4 methylbenzoic acid ditertbutylphenol flvor and fragrance e g benzoic aldehyde ethylmethylphenyglycidate and textiles e g 1 ethoxy 2 propanol and are difficult to be degraded in traditional anaerobic digestion or fermentation process after 12 days of anaerobic fermentation 24 organic contaminants were still detected in the blank and the total detection frequency was 125 this suggested that only six species of the organic contaminants could be removed during the ordinary anaerobic fermentation when was was respectively pretreated by 0 09 and 0 24 g pms g tss only 17 and 13 organic contaminants were detected respectively table 2 in addition the total detection frequency in the two fermenters decreased to 54 and 26 respectively all the facts confirmed again that pms could degrade several recalcitrant organics to biodegradable substances which might be one reason for pms enhancing scfas production it was reported that pms could accelerate the contaminant degradation by several folds through scavenging conduction band electrons and forming of sulfate radical zhang et al 2014 moreover considering that most of these complex organics are toxic this pms based sludge pretreatment is helpful to the environment when the treated was is finally disposed 3 3 assessing the impacts of pms on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis it is well known that several bioprocesses such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis are also included in anaerobic fermentation which are closely relevant to the production or the consumption of scfas as a powerful oxidant pms addition may bring negative impacts on these bioprocesses to examine the effect of pms on these processes a series of batch experiments using model substrates was carried out please see section 2 4 for experimental details although the pms pretreatment on inocula lasted for only 24 h the degradations of all the tested model compounds were affected see table s2 supporting information the higher the pms dosage the lower the degradations for example the degradation efficiencies of bsa and butyrate at 3 d fermentation time decreased slightly from 67 3 2 1 and 49 8 1 9 to 54 8 2 4 and 35 1 1 4 respectively similar observations were also observed on other fermentation times this suggested that the activities of the microorganisms in the fermenters were suppressed by pms pretreatment as a result all the bioprocesses involved in anaerobic fermentation were inhibited to some extents by pms table 3 further summarizes the effect of pms on the specific degradation rates of bsa glucose butyrate hydrogen and acetate it can be seen that the specific degradation rate of bsa in the blank was 26 21 1 58 mg g vss h and this could be considered the original activity of hydrolytic microbes when the inocula were treated by 0 09 g pms g tss the specific degradation rate of bsa decreased to 25 02 1 52 mg g vss h suggesting that 0 09 g pms g tss decreased the relative activity expressed as of the original of hydrolytic microbes by 9 5 the specific degradation rate of bsa was 20 68 1 34 mg g vss h in 0 24 g pms g tss reactor this indicated that even though the inocula were treated by 0 24 g pms g tss 78 9 of relative activity of hydrolytic microorganisms was also measured similar observations were also made on the degradations of glucose and butyrate when the inocula were treated by 0 09 g pms g tss the specific degradation rates of glucose and butyrate decreased respectively from 12 34 0 82 and 16 36 0 98 to 10 16 0 64 and 14 71 0 88 mg g vss h indicating that 0 09 g pms g tss decreased the relative activities of the microbes relevant to acidogenesis and acetogenesis by 17 7 and 10 1 respectively further increase of pms dosage to 0 24 g g tss only decreased the relative activities of the microbes relevant to acidogenesis and acetogenesis by 38 1 and 20 4 respectively however the inhibition of pms to the degradation of hydrogen was much severer than that to the degradations of bsa glucose and butyrate it was found that 0 09 g pms g tss decreased the specific degradation rate of hydrogen from 0 21 0 01 to 0 12 0 03 mg g vss h expressed as 57 1 of the original activity when 0 24 g pms g tss was applied 0 07 0 01 mg g vss h of hydrogen degradation rate expressed as 33 3 of the original activity was only measured in this fermentation test hydrogen was mainly consumed by homoacetogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis processes however the accurate inhibition of pms to either homoacetogenesis or hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis could not be differentiated and more work should be carried out in the future analogous to hydrogen degradation pms treatment also caused severe inhibition to acetate degradation with an increase of pms dosage from 0 to 0 24 g g tss the specific degradation rate of acetate decreased from 31 57 1 89 to 7 77 0 47 mg g vss h indicating that the relative activities of scfas consumers was inhibited by 75 4 this indicated that pms resulted in a severe inhibition to the activities of methanogens which was consistent with the ch4 yield presented in fig s1 supporting information this was probably due to the less tolerance of methanogens as compared with scfa producers previous studies also demonstrated that among the different types of anaerobic microorganisms the methanogens was the most sensitive and the least tolerant and was the most likely to cease growth when inhibitory substances were present in wastewaters and sludges chen et al 2008 all the results revealed that although pms inhibited the activities of all the microbes involved in the anaerobic fermentation its inhibitions to scfas consumers were much severer than those to hydrolytic microorganisms and scfas producers this different inhibition was another reason for pms promoting scfas yield in this work 3 4 what happens to pms after being added in the fermentation systems as a triple salt pms not only has powerful oxidative capacity but also can slowly decompose to release k hso5 at a controlled rate when it meet with hydrous media see equation 1 for details the generated hso5 can be further converted to three main free radicals so4 oh and 1o2 via equations 2 5 ahmadi and ghanbari 2018 zhang et al 2014 which are generally considered the major intermediates of pms decomposition additionally a few amount of acid is also produced in the process of pms decomposition equations 3 and 4 resulting in the drop in ph inevitably 1 khso5 hso5 k 2 hso5 e so4 oh 3 hso4 so4 2 h 4 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h 5 so5 2 hso5 hso4 so4 2 1o2 it was found that the residual pms was at a very low level even in the 0 24 g pms g tss fermenter after 24 h and at this time no residual pms was detected in the 0 09 g pms g tss fermenter fig s4 supporting information as shown in fig 4 a the special hyperfine coupling constants a n 14 9 g a h 14 9 g all 0 5 g obtained by simulation were consistent with that of dmpo oh adducts while the special hyperfine coupling constants a n 13 8 g a h 10 0 g a h 1 4 g a h 0 8 g all 0 05 g obtained by simulation were in accordance with that of dmpo so4 adducts confirming the existence of so4 and oh the intensity of dmpo oh radical adducts signals was much stronger than that of dmpo so4 adducts signals in all tested time this might be due to that dmpo oh is stronger to generate signal than dmpo so4 similarly the existence of 1o2 was also confirmed in the pms added systems fig 4b as expected the addition of pms led to the variations of orp fig 4c besides k2so4 and khso4 inevitably co existed in the fermentation systems as well although some investigations have been performed in this field the potential contributions of these individual intermediates or products to the production of scfas have not been differentiated or discussed before as elucidated in equations 3 and 4 the addition of pms caused ph drop about 4 5 7 in all the fermenters in this work fig s5 supporting information but previous work demonstrated that ph variation in this range did not affect scfas production significantly yuan et al 2006 the orp values at pms dose of 0 09 g g tss decreased sharply in the first 24 h and then stayed stable in the remainder period about 200 mv which was similar to that in the blank fig 4c indicating that the orp influence at 0 09 g pms g tss level could be negligible however 0 24 g pms g tss caused greater orp values than both 0 or 0 09 g pms g tss in the initial 6 d fermentation and this might to the reason for the fermenter with 0 24 g pms g tss addition requiring longer fermentation time to achieve the maximal scfas yield than the others fig 1a fig 4d exhibits the effects of pms and its decomposition products on scfas production it can be seen that compared with the blank k2so4 and khso4 did not affect scfas yield obviously however oh so4 and 1o2 promoted the maximal yield of scfas to 168 0 220 3 and 232 4 mg cod g vss respectively suggesting that 1o2 oh and so4 were the main contributors to the enhancement of scfas production in this work and their contributions were in the sequence of 1o2 so4 oh previous work verified that membrane damage of cells provoked by free radicals generated from pms was proportional to the intracellular k efflux and to the extracellular na influx wittmann et al 1989 it was also reported that free radicals are reactive molecules and could cause destructive and irreversible damage to the cell components such as lipids proteins dna and other macromolecules zhang et al 2011 it should be emphasized that the addition of pms would introduce sulfate into the was fermentation system after the decomposition of pms for example 0 36 g l sulfate would be released in the 0 09 g pms g tss fermenter according to our calculation at this level it was demonstrated in this work that sulfate had no adverse effect on sludge fermentative scfas production fig 4d however it is unclear whether this level of sulfate affect other microbes such as hydrolytic microorganisms hydrogen producers and sulfate reducers moreover as the sulfate will be released in the fermentation liquor or absorbed in sludge cells which is finally entered into either the mainstream wastewater line or sludge dewatering unit this presence of sulfate might affect the function microbes responsible for wastewater treatment such as nitrifiers and polyphosphate accumulating organisms or the final disposal of dewatered was more work is therefore required to assess the potential impacts of the released sulfate on these microbes or final disposal of dewatered was in the future 4 overall understanding and implications according to the analyses above it is clear that the addition of pms could effectively enhance scfas production from was anaerobic fermentation and the mechanisms of how pms promotes scfas production were revealed for the first time this was experimentally demonstrated through a series of batch tests using both real sludge and model compounds as fermentation substrates pms benefited the disruption of sludge cells and promoted the biodegradability of organics released thereby provided more biodegradable substrates for subsequent bioprocesses to produce scfas pms pretreatment decreased the percentages of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances in the released organics and the species and total detection frequency of other recalcitrant organics such as cyclopentasiloxane heptasiloxane and ethylene glycol which were hardly degraded in ordinary anaerobic condition or fermentation although pms caused inhibitions to some extents to all the microbes in the anaerobic fermentation its inhibition to scfas consumers was much severer than that to scfas producers after pms entering into the fermentation system k h so4 2 1o2 so4 and oh would be produced as the major intermediates 1o2 so4 and oh were the major contributors to scfas production pms addition also affected orp values in the fermenters and this seemed to affect lag phase time of scfas production rather than scfas yield the findings achieved in this work largely advance the understanding of the pms involved was fermentation which may guide engineers to better manipulate was treatment in the future compared with other scfas production methods e g free nitrous acid or free ammonia based pretreatment the pms based sludge treatment requires extra addition of a certain amount of a chemical i e pms which inevitably increases the input thus one might want to know what advantages this pms based approach has according to our preliminary estimation using the data obtained in this work 180 is required to treat one ton of dried sludge with 311 7 mg cod g vss scfas being produced which is comparable to other oxidants such as calcium peroxide table s3 supporting information although the cost of the pms based approach is higher than free nitrous acid or free ammonia based methods its scfas yield is also much greater it was reported that the maximum scfas yield was 195 7 mg cod g vss for free nitrous acid and 267 2 mg cod g vss for free ammonia li et al 2016a zhang et al 2018 it should be emphasized that this work mainly aimed to explore the mechanisms of pms enhancing scfas production thus technical optimization was not performed thus the dosage of pms may be reduced if activated pms or comprehensive optimizations e g mathematical model study or response surface study is carried out in the future apart from the biodegradable substances such as proteins and carbohydrates several non biodegradable organics such as humic substances are also included in was moreover many types of persistent organic pollutants such as personal care products antibiotics and endocrine disrupting compounds have been growing accumulated in was oh et al 2016 these substances could not be bio degraded effectively in ordinary anaerobic fermentation which brings risks to ecological environment and human health during the final disposal of was this work demonstrated that the addition of pms largely enhanced the degradation of humic substances and other recalcitrant organics such as cyclopentasiloxane heptasiloxane and ethylene glycol which not only erases this concern but also benefits the final disposal of was 5 conclusions in this study scfas production from was is significantly improved by pms pretreatment with an increase of pms level from 0 to 0 09 g g tss the maximal scfas yield increased to 311 67 mg cod g vss it was found pms pretreatment accelerated the disintegration of was and improved the biodegradability of organics released besides pms effectively removed the refractory organic pollutants which are non biodegradable under the ordinary anaerobic condition batch tests showed that pms caused harms to some extents to all the microbes in the anaerobic fermentation but the scfas consumers showed the worse resilience to pms compared to scfas producers further investigations showed that 1o2 so4 and oh were the major contributors to scfas production and their contributions were in the sequence of 1o2 so4 oh

19197,peroxymonosulfate pms has been recently used as an additive to pretreat waste activated sludge was to enhance short chain fatty acids scfas production however the mechanisms of how pms enhances scfas production remain largely unknown this work therefore aims to explore the mechanisms through deeply understanding its impact on the disintegration of sludge cells the biodegradability of organics released and the bioprocesses involved in anaerobic fermentation and differentiating the contributions of its degradation intermediates to scfas production this was demonstrated by a series of batch fermentation tests using either real sludge or model organic compounds as fermentation substrates experimental results showed that the maximal scfas yield increased from 29 69 to 311 67 mg cod g vss with pms level increasing from 0 to 0 09 g g tss no obvious increase in scfas yield was observed when pms further increased the mechanism explorations revealed that pms pretreatment not only enhanced the disintegration of sludge cells but also promoted the biodegradability of organics released thereby providing more biodegradable substrates for subsequent scfas production pms pretreatment decreased the percentages of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances in the released organics moreover the species and total detection frequency of other recalcitrant organics such as cyclopentasiloxane heptasiloxane and ethylene glycol which were hardly degraded in ordinary anaerobic condition also decreased remarkably although pms caused harms to some extents to all the microbes in the anaerobic fermentation its inhibitions to scfas consumers were much severer than that to scfas producers probably due to the less tolerance of methanogens further analyses exhibited that 1o2 so4 and oh were the major contributors to the increased scfas production and their contributions were in the order of 1o2 so4 oh the findings obtained in this work provide insights into pms involved sludge fermentation process and might have important implication for further manipulation of was treatment in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords peroxymonosulfate waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation short chain fatty acids 1 introduction the increasing amount of waste activated sludge was generated from activated sludge process has been the greatest challenge to wastewater treatment plants wwtps nowadays it was documented that more than 11 2 million tons of dry sludge generated annually in china and 10 million tons in eu countries feng et al 2015 sun et al 2015 yu et al 2015 the treatment and disposal of was has already been a serious problem because of its continuous production potentially environmental risk and high cost therefore efficient strategies for was treatment have raised much attention worldwide khursheed and kazmi 2011 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2018a yang et al 2018a 2018b considering was containing plenty of organics and nutrients one of the most widely applied solutions to the was management is anaerobic digestion or fermentation during which was is stabilized and renew resources e g short chain fatty acids scfas hydrogen and methane are recovered hu et al 2018 liu et al 2018 luo et al 2015 wang et al 2018a wu et al 2016 among these recoverable resources scfas particularly acetic and propionic acids present a practically alternative to be an attractive carbon source for biological denitrification cokgor et al 2009 elefsiniotis and wareham 2007 and phosphorus removal li et al 2011 therefore intensive studies have focused on scfas production from was in the recent years chen et al 2018 wang et al 2018b xu et al 2018b yang et al 2012 scfas production via anaerobic fermentation is usually limited by the slow was disintegration rate in the past years therefore many pretreatment methods such as physical chemical biological methods were tested to improve sludge disintegration and hydrolysis chang et al 2011 kim et al 2015 li et al 2014 lu et al 2012 wang et al 2017 among them advanced oxidation processes have attracted great interests for sludge disintegrating and dewatering due to its high efficiency and low cost several oxidants such as peroxide ozone persulfate potassium ferrate potassium permanganate were widely used before chu et al 2009 wu et al 2014 ye et al 2012 peroxymonosulfate pms obtained as a mixture of 2khso5 k2so4 khso4 is widely used in numerous industrial processes as bleaching agent disinfectant and oxidant in organic synthesis because of its powerful oxidative capacity and operation simplicity venkatesh and karunakaran 2013 as the triple salt pms is commercially known as oxone which is a monosubstituted derivative of h2o2 but has a greater powerful oxidizability than h2o2 e0 hso5 hso4 1 82v e0 h2o2 h2o 1 76v when pms is activated in hydrous media sulfate radical sr so4 will be produced which has a higher oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 v wider operative ph range and longer half life in the past great efforts have been made to use the activation of pms to produce sr for removing organic pollutants from wastewater e g pesticides pharmaceuticals dyes aromatics halogenated olefins and perfluorinated compounds or enhancing disintegration and dewaterability of was li et al 2016b liu et al 2017 olmez hanci et al 2011 ye et al 2012 for example rastogi et al founded that fe ii pms systems were very effective in degrading polychlorinated biphenyls in a sediment slurry system with more than 90 polychlorinated biphenyls being removed within 24 h rastogi et al 2009 tan et al demonstrated that 93 3 of orange ii in wastewater could be degraded in 90 min at 60 c by ferrous activated pms tan et al 2017 ren et al 2015 investigated the effects of sr oxidation on disintegration of waste activated sludge and found that with pms level increasing from 0 to 12 mg g ss sludge disintegration degrees in total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen increased from 0 to 24 8 and 29 9 respectively liu et al 2016 reported that compared with the raw sludge the capillary suction time and specific resistance of sludge declined from 201 8s to 19 5s and from 95 2 1012 m kg to 3 5 1012 m kg respectively at n fe2 n hso5 0 9 apart from these applications mentioned above jin and coworkers recently pointed out another new direction being an additive to pretreat was for the enhancement of scfas yield jin et al 2018 it was found that when was was pretreated with 0 08 mg pms mg ss scfas yield of 716 72 mg chemical oxygen demand cod l was achieved which was 43 7 times than that of the control they further demonstrated that pms mainly affected physicochemical property of was microbial community structure and enzymic levels this excellent attempt opens a new door for the application of pms and provides an attractive technology for was treatment by simply adding certain amounts of pms into was pretreatment unit sludge disintegration dewaterability and scfas yield were all enhanced considering numerous amount of was produced everyday worldwide the pms based sludge pretreatment should have significantly environmental and economic benefits despite the useful information details of how pms based sludge pretreatment improves scfas production especially from the aspect of sludge biodegradability remain largely unavailable besides biodegradable substances was also contains a portion of non biodegradable substances which are generally not utilized by scfa producers it is unknown whether pms based pretreatment enhances the sludge biodegradability if it does which recalcitrant substances are degraded after was disintegration the soluble substrates will undergo several bioprocesses e g hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis which are closely related to scfas production or consumption to date however no information is available on whether and how pms pretreatment affects these bioprocesses moreover it is known that several intermediates such as k h oh 1o2 and so4 may be formed with the decomposition of pms but their potential contributions to anaerobic fermentation have not been differentiated as well zhou et al 2015 ahmadi and ghanbari 2018 based on the question above this work therefore aims to explore the underlying mechanisms of how pms enhances scfas production from anaerobic fermentation of was to obtain comprehensive information the effect of pms at different dosages 0 03 0 06 0 09 0 12 or 0 24 g g tss on scfas production was first investigated then the details of how pms pretreatment improves scfas production were explored through evaluating its impact on the disintegration of sludge cells the biodegradability of organics released the contents of several recalcitrant substances and the processes of sludge hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis processes to differentiate the contributions of the intermediates decomposed from pms to scfas production a series of fermentation tests were finally conducted this work deepens our understanding of how pms pretreatment affects anaerobic fermentation of was expands the application of pms and enlightens engineers to develop a promising technology to enhance both the removal of recalcitrant substances and production of scfa from was 2 material and methods 2 1 the sources of raw was and pms the was used in this investigation was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant in changsha china the collected sludge was concentrated by settling at 4 c for 24 h before being used in the following tests the main characteristics of the concentrated was were ph 6 87 0 1 total suspended solids tss 25 667 101 mg l volatile suspended solids vss 15 702 65 mg l total dissolved solids tds 2560 48 mg l total chemical oxygen demand tcod 16 956 243 mg l soluble chemical oxygen demand scod 331 17 mg l potassium peroxymonsulfate triple salt khso5 47 was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagents co shanghai china the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification 2 2 scfas production from anaerobic fermentation of was pretreated by pms at different levels this batch test was performed in six identical serum bottles each bottle was first fed with 500 ml was then 0 0 3851 0 7701 1 1552 1 5402 or 3 0804 g pms was added into these six serum bottles giving rise to the pms dosage of 0 as the control 0 03 0 06 0 09 0 12 or 0 24 g g tss after pms addition was in each bottle was respectively stirred at 300 rpm for 5 min and 150 rpm for 150 min at ambient temperature to mix sludge and pms rapidly and completely afterwards high purity nitrogen gas at a constant flow rate of 0 5 l min was introduced to each reactor for 5 min to remove oxygen before the reactors being capped and sealed for better mass transfer all the bottles were stirred in an air bath shaker 120 rpm at 35 1 c the fermentation test lasted for 12 days during which the maximal yield of scfas in all the fermenters was achieved the ph in all the fermenters was not adjusted but recorded during the entire period 2 3 the impact of pms pretreatment on the disintegration of was and biodegradability of organics released to assess the impact of pms on the disintegration of was the morphology of was the concentrations of soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates toc and vss reduction in the fermenters conducted in section 2 2 were measured in the initial 72 h of fermentation by comparing these data among the fermenters the effect of pms addition on the disintegration of was could be indicated to evaluate the impact of pms on the biodegradability of organics released the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to determine the structure changes of fermentation liquid according to the literature chen et al 2003 jia et al 2013 reynolds 2002 the eem spectrum of fermentation liquor can be generally divided into five regions based on the specific ranges of the excitation and emission wavelength see table s1 supporting information among these organics the organics located in region i i e tyrosine like proteins and region iv i e soluble microbial by product like substances are thought as biodegradable while region iii i e fulvic acid like substances and region v i e humic acid like substances are supposed as non biodegradable the abundances of these organics could be depicted by the percent fluorescence response pi n and the method is detailed in supplementary data see text s1 supporting information to obtain more information on pms affecting the biodegradation of non biodegradable substrates gc ms analysis was also employed to analyze the species and total detection frequency of recalcitrant organics in the fermenters before and after fermentation the analytical method of gc ms is detailed in text s3 supporting information 2 4 the impacts of pms pretreatment on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis processes apart from sludge disintegration and the biodegradability of the released organics several other bio processes such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis are also included in anaerobic fermentation of was which affect scfas production or consumption significantly to assess the potential impacts of pms and its major intermediates on these processes the following set of tests using model substrates was carried out in the tests 15 serum bottles with a working volume of 500 ml each were performed these reactors were divided into five tests test i test ii test iii test iv and test v with three in each a total volume of 450 ml inocula taken from a long term semi continuous fermenter for scfas production operated in our lab in stable operation were equally distributed into the three serum bottles then different amounts of pms were added into the three bottles to achieve pms dosages of 0 0 09 or 0 24 g g tss all other operations were the same as those described in section 2 2 after 24 h treatment the inocula in each bottle were centrifuged 5000 rpm for 10 min and washed with tap water for three times to remove the released substances and potential residual pms and re suspended in tap water with a final volume of 150 ml before being used as inocula for the following fermentation tests test i this test was used to assess the impacts of pms on hydrolysis process in this test each reactor received 270 ml synthetic wastewater and 30 ml inocula treated by 0 0 09 or 0 24 g g tss pms as described above the synthetic wastewater contains 3 5 g bovine serum albumin bsa average molecular weight 67 000 a model protein compound l the test lasted for 3d and bsa concentration in these bottles was measured daily the vss concentration in each fermenter was measured at the end of the test the volumetric degradation rate of bsa was measured by linear regression of the corresponding concentration profile the biomass specific degradation rate of bsa in each bottle was calculated by dividing the corresponding volumetric rate by the vss concentration test ii the test was used to evaluate the impacts of pms on acidogenesis process the operation of this test was performed with the same approach as described in test i except that the fermentation substrate i e bsa was replaced by glucose a model monosaccharide compound test iii the test was utilized to assess the impacts of pms on acetogenesis process the operational procedure of this test was conducted the same as that depicted in test i except that the fermentation substrate in synthetic wastewater was replaced by sodium butyrate test iv this test was used to evaluate the impacts of pms on hydrogen consumption by either homoacetogenesis or methanogenesis process each bottle first received 270 ml tap water and 30 ml inocula treated by 0 0 09 or 0 24 g g tss pms as mentioned above all the bottles were then flushed with a combined gas 40 hydrogen 10 carbon dioxide and 50 nitrogen for 5 min to guarantee that they were filled with the synthetic hydrogen containing gas and it did not need an extra nitrogen gas injection process after that all bottles were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an air bath shaker at stirring speed of 120 rpm test v the test was used to assess the impacts of pms on methanogenesis process the operation of this test was carried out the same as depicted in test i except that bsa in synthetic wastewater was replaced by acetate 2 5 differentiation of the contributions of k2so4 khso4 so4 1o2 and oh to the increased scfas production pms would be decomposed in the fermentation period and k2so4 khso4 so4 1o2 and oh are the major intermediates please see section 3 4 for details to assess their contributions to scfas production the following batch fermentation test was conducted in this test ten replicate serum bottles with identical working volume were performed and each received 500 ml was among them one was set as the blank without any addition of chemicals besides 500 ml was the other nine reactors also received 1 1552 g pms 0 3269 g k2so4 0 2556 g khso4 1 1552 g pms 1 m methanol 1 1552 g pms 1 m tert butanol 1 1552 g pms 1 m sodium azide 1 m sodium azide 1 m methanol or 1 m tert butanol it was reported that sodium azide was used to scavenge 1o2 so4 and oh k 1 o 2 2 109 m 1 s 1 k so 4 2 52 109 m 1 s 1 k oh 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 methanol was used to scavenge both so4 and oh k so 4 0 9 1 3 107 m 1 s 1 k oh 8 0 10 108 m 1 s 1 and tert butanol mainly reacted with oh k so 4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 k oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 zhou et al 2015 wu et al 2018 thus the quenching experiments using sodium azide methanol or tert butanol were employed to identify the contributions of 1o2 so4 and oh on scfas production in the was system the initial concentrations of these chemicals added were selected according to the stoichiometric relationship in the 0 09 g pms g tss fermenter operated in section 2 2 after the addition of the chemicals all the bottles were purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to guarantee anaerobic condition capped with rubber stoppers and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm under 35 1 c all other operations were the same as those described in section 2 2 the test lasted for 5 days during which the concentration of scfas in all the fermenters was measured periodically 2 6 analytical methods ph was measured using a digital ph meter phs 3c leici co ltd shanghai china oxidation reduction potential orp was determined using an hq40d digital meter hach usa total organic carbon toc was determined by toc 5050a analyzer shimadzu japan tcod scod tss vss were determined according to the standard methods apha 1998 soluble proteins were determined by the lowry folin method with bsa as the standard and soluble polysaccharides were determined by the phenol sulfuric method with glucose as the standard chen et al 2007 an agilent 6890 gc agilent usa with aflame ionization detector and a dbwaxtre column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 mm was utilized to analyze the composition of scfas and the method was detailed in a previous study yuan et al 2006 methane was measured using a gas chromatograph gc 14b shimadzu japan with analytical approach being detailed in our previous publication wang et al 2015 the morphologies were observed by scanning electron microscopy jsm 6700f particle size distribution after pretreating was determined by a laser diffraction sensor mas tersizer 2000 malvern firm 3d eem fluorescence spectra were measured using a luminescence spectrometry f 4600 fl spectrophotometer hitachi japan with the methods being detailed in the text s2 supporting information gc ms analysis was used to analyze the recalcitrant organics in was fermentation systems and the method was provided in text s3 supporting information electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis was used for assessing the dynamic changes of free radicals and please see details in text s4 supporting information all the tests were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 scfas production from was anaerobic fermentation in the presence of pms at different dosages fig 1 a shows the total scfas production from was anaerobic fermentation in the presence of pms at different dosages it can be seen that the yield of scfas in the blank fermenter without addition of pms was always low 50 mg cod g vss during the entire fermentation period which was consistent with the data reported previously he et al 2017 li et al 2016a this is mainly due to the low was disintegration rate and the rapid scfas consumption li et al 2015 wu et al 2017 when pms pretreatment was applied scfas yield increased largely with an increase of pms addition from 0 to 0 09 g g tss the maximal scfas yield increased from 29 69 to 311 67 mg cod g vss further increase of pms addition to either 0 12 or 0 24 g g tss did not result in a significant enhancement of maximal scfas yield p 0 05 in the fermenter with 0 or 0 03 g g tss pms addition the produced scfas were consumed completely after 10 days fermentation however in the fermenter with 0 06 0 09 0 12 or 0 24 g g tss pms addition the scfas produced was not consumed largely suggesting that pertinent addition of pms could inhibit effectively the activities of scfas consumers additionally the maximal scfas yield occurred on 10 days in the fermenter with 0 24 g g tss pms addition which was longer than that in other fermenters 3 6 days this indicated that pms addition at such a level caused severe inhibition to scfas producers as well fig 1b exhibits the percentages of individual scfas in all the fermenters at their maximum scfa yield time all the six individual acids i e acetic propionic iso butyric n butyric iso valeric and n valeric acids were detected in the fermenters but their fractions were also affected by pms pretreatment for example the average percentage of acetic acid was 17 3 in the blank while this value increased to 43 4 in the 0 03 g pms g tss added fermenter 56 2 in the 0 06 g pms g tss added fermenter and 60 3 in the 0 09 g pms g tss added fermenter respectively the percentage of propionic acid decreased from 38 9 to 7 5 with pms dosage increasing from 0 to 0 24 g pms g tss to further reflect the effect of pms pretreatment on was anaerobic fermentation cod mass balance analysis among the fermenters was performed based on the determinations of the major intermediates or final fermentation products table 1 it was measured that with an increase of pms addition from 0 to 0 24 g g tss the percentage of vss and methane decreased from 72 8 1 6 and 5 8 0 3 to 56 2 1 2 and 1 3 0 2 respectively indicating that pms pretreatment enhanced the disintegration of was and inhibited the methanongegesis the profiles of methane production in the fermenters are detailed in fig s1 supporting information the percentages of soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates hydrogen and scfas increased with the increase of pms dosage these data suggested that besides was disintegration and methanogenesis other biological processes involved in anaerobic fermentation were affected by pms pretreatment as well besides these compositions several other substances which were mainly non biodegradable organics such as humic substances were also produced in the fermentation process in this study we defined them as others it was found that with an increase of pms dosage from 0 to 0 24 g g tss the fraction of others to total cod decreased from 16 88 0 5 to 6 75 0 4 indicating that the addition of pms enhanced the degradation of non biodegradable substances this deduction would be further elucidated in section 3 2 in the following text the mechanisms of how pms pretreatment affects scfas accumulation were explored 3 2 effect of pms pretreatment on disintegration of was and biodegradability of the soluble organics the organics in was mainly locate in either extracellular or intracellular of sludge cells as solid phase before being fermented they require to be released into liquor phase as soluble organics through was disintegration the major rate limiting step in anaerobic fermentation thus the potential impact of pms pretreatment on was disintegration was first evaluated and the data are displayed in fig 2 soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the supernatant increased with the increase of pms dosage fig 2a for example 1370 12 mg cod l of soluble proteins and 322 71 mg cod l of soluble carbohydrates were measured in the fermenter with 0 24 g pms g tss addition after 24 h which were respectively 5 5 and 8 8 times of those in the blank analogous to soluble proteins and carbohydrates soluble toc also showed an increase trend with the increase of pms addition fig 2b soluble toc in the supernatant increased from 281 81 to 1491 01 mg l with pms addition increasing from 0 to 0 24 g g tss moreover with an increase of pms from 0 to 0 24 g g tss vss reduction after 24 h increased from 6 3 to 27 2 similar observations were also observed on other fermentation times fig s2a supporting information scanning electron microscopy showed that the was without pms addition owned more intact cell flocs than the pms pretreated was figs s3a and 3b supporting information further investigation demonstrated that the pms pretreated was had more flocs with small size than the was without pms addition fig s3c supporting information for example the flocs 50 μm accounted for 38 1 of total sludge volume in the was without pms addition after 24 h while this value increased to 47 2 and 54 6 with pms pretreatment at dosages of 0 09 and 0 24 g pms g tss respectively fig s3c supporting information all the facts demonstrated that pms pretreatment enhanced the disintegration of was which thereby accelerated the transformation of the substrates from sludge cells into fermentation liquor it is known that besides biodegradable substances such as proteins and carbohydrates was also includes several non biodegradable substances which could be released in the fermentation liquor through was disintegration generally these non biodegradable substances can not be utilized by anaerobes in the fermentation process thus it is beneficial to scfas production if pms pretreatment causes transformations of a portion of substances from non biodegradable to biodegradable to assess this possibility the 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to determine the structure changes of fermentation liquid in the fermenters according to the literature the organics located in region i i e tyrosine like proteins and region iv i e soluble microbial by product like substances are thought as biodegradable while the organics located in region iii i e fulvic acid like substances and region v i e humic acid like substances are supposed as non biodegradable fig 3 presents the fluorescence eem spectra and the percentage of fluorescence response pi n of the soluble organics in the fermenters with was pretreated by different dosages of pms for 24 h it can be seen that the fluorescence intensities of the peaks in eem spectra in the fermenter with pms addition were greater than those in the blank i e 0 g g tss pms added fermenter suggesting that more soluble organics were available in the liquor phase in the pms added fermenters li et al 2018 this supported well the data presented in fig 2 it was further calculated that the total percentage of fluorescence responses of region i and region iv were 6 48 and 39 9 in the blank 6 89 and 51 99 in the fermenter with 0 09 g pms g tss addition and 7 35 and 57 59 in the fermenter with 0 24 g pms g tss addition it was obvious that the total percentage of fluorescence response of region i and region iv in the pms added fermenters was greater than that in the blank the higher the pms addition the greater the total percentage of fluorescence response of region i and region iv further analyses with the ratio of bod5 scod in the initial 72 h fermentation supported well the data presented in fig 3 fig s2b supporting information the facts suggested that pms pretreatment enhanced the biodegradability of the soluble organics which thereby provided more biodegradable substances for subsequent bioprocesses for scfas production also from fig 3 it can be found that pi n of region ii was not varied obviously among the fermenters ranging between 11 32 and 13 41 whereas pi n of both region iii and region v decreased largely with the increase of pms addition with an increase of pms addition from 0 to 0 24 g g tss pi n of region iii decreased from 16 63 to 7 48 while pi n of region v decreased from 25 67 to 14 17 it was reported that the organics located in region iii and region v were fulvic acid like substances and humic acid like substances respectively jia et al 2013 previous publications documented that such two substances were at high levels in was accounting for up to 27 of total organics in was li et al 2013 the results indicated that pms pretreatment could remarkably enhance the degradations of fulvic acid like substances and humic acid like substances pms has powerful oxidative capacity with e0 hso5 hso4 being at 1 82v and it is reported previously that pms could degrade many non degradable organics such as pesticides pharmaceuticals dyes aromatics halogenated olefins and perfluorinated compounds guan et al 2012 olmez hanci et al 2011 furthermore it has been reported that hydroxyl and sulfate radicals played major roles in the fulvic acid degradation according to radical scavenger experiments xu et al 2012 to further understand the role of the powerful oxidizability of pms to was gc ms analysis was used to measure the species and total detection frequency of recalcitrant organics in the supernatant of sludge samples thirty recalcitrant organic compounds were detected in the supernatants of raw sludge sample and the total detection frequency was 152 in 7 parallel samples table 2 most of these organics come from cosmetics e g cyclopentasiloxane benzyl alcohol pharmaceutical e g norepinephrine acetaminophen glycine pesticides e g 4 methylbenzoic acid ditertbutylphenol flvor and fragrance e g benzoic aldehyde ethylmethylphenyglycidate and textiles e g 1 ethoxy 2 propanol and are difficult to be degraded in traditional anaerobic digestion or fermentation process after 12 days of anaerobic fermentation 24 organic contaminants were still detected in the blank and the total detection frequency was 125 this suggested that only six species of the organic contaminants could be removed during the ordinary anaerobic fermentation when was was respectively pretreated by 0 09 and 0 24 g pms g tss only 17 and 13 organic contaminants were detected respectively table 2 in addition the total detection frequency in the two fermenters decreased to 54 and 26 respectively all the facts confirmed again that pms could degrade several recalcitrant organics to biodegradable substances which might be one reason for pms enhancing scfas production it was reported that pms could accelerate the contaminant degradation by several folds through scavenging conduction band electrons and forming of sulfate radical zhang et al 2014 moreover considering that most of these complex organics are toxic this pms based sludge pretreatment is helpful to the environment when the treated was is finally disposed 3 3 assessing the impacts of pms on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis it is well known that several bioprocesses such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis are also included in anaerobic fermentation which are closely relevant to the production or the consumption of scfas as a powerful oxidant pms addition may bring negative impacts on these bioprocesses to examine the effect of pms on these processes a series of batch experiments using model substrates was carried out please see section 2 4 for experimental details although the pms pretreatment on inocula lasted for only 24 h the degradations of all the tested model compounds were affected see table s2 supporting information the higher the pms dosage the lower the degradations for example the degradation efficiencies of bsa and butyrate at 3 d fermentation time decreased slightly from 67 3 2 1 and 49 8 1 9 to 54 8 2 4 and 35 1 1 4 respectively similar observations were also observed on other fermentation times this suggested that the activities of the microorganisms in the fermenters were suppressed by pms pretreatment as a result all the bioprocesses involved in anaerobic fermentation were inhibited to some extents by pms table 3 further summarizes the effect of pms on the specific degradation rates of bsa glucose butyrate hydrogen and acetate it can be seen that the specific degradation rate of bsa in the blank was 26 21 1 58 mg g vss h and this could be considered the original activity of hydrolytic microbes when the inocula were treated by 0 09 g pms g tss the specific degradation rate of bsa decreased to 25 02 1 52 mg g vss h suggesting that 0 09 g pms g tss decreased the relative activity expressed as of the original of hydrolytic microbes by 9 5 the specific degradation rate of bsa was 20 68 1 34 mg g vss h in 0 24 g pms g tss reactor this indicated that even though the inocula were treated by 0 24 g pms g tss 78 9 of relative activity of hydrolytic microorganisms was also measured similar observations were also made on the degradations of glucose and butyrate when the inocula were treated by 0 09 g pms g tss the specific degradation rates of glucose and butyrate decreased respectively from 12 34 0 82 and 16 36 0 98 to 10 16 0 64 and 14 71 0 88 mg g vss h indicating that 0 09 g pms g tss decreased the relative activities of the microbes relevant to acidogenesis and acetogenesis by 17 7 and 10 1 respectively further increase of pms dosage to 0 24 g g tss only decreased the relative activities of the microbes relevant to acidogenesis and acetogenesis by 38 1 and 20 4 respectively however the inhibition of pms to the degradation of hydrogen was much severer than that to the degradations of bsa glucose and butyrate it was found that 0 09 g pms g tss decreased the specific degradation rate of hydrogen from 0 21 0 01 to 0 12 0 03 mg g vss h expressed as 57 1 of the original activity when 0 24 g pms g tss was applied 0 07 0 01 mg g vss h of hydrogen degradation rate expressed as 33 3 of the original activity was only measured in this fermentation test hydrogen was mainly consumed by homoacetogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis processes however the accurate inhibition of pms to either homoacetogenesis or hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis could not be differentiated and more work should be carried out in the future analogous to hydrogen degradation pms treatment also caused severe inhibition to acetate degradation with an increase of pms dosage from 0 to 0 24 g g tss the specific degradation rate of acetate decreased from 31 57 1 89 to 7 77 0 47 mg g vss h indicating that the relative activities of scfas consumers was inhibited by 75 4 this indicated that pms resulted in a severe inhibition to the activities of methanogens which was consistent with the ch4 yield presented in fig s1 supporting information this was probably due to the less tolerance of methanogens as compared with scfa producers previous studies also demonstrated that among the different types of anaerobic microorganisms the methanogens was the most sensitive and the least tolerant and was the most likely to cease growth when inhibitory substances were present in wastewaters and sludges chen et al 2008 all the results revealed that although pms inhibited the activities of all the microbes involved in the anaerobic fermentation its inhibitions to scfas consumers were much severer than those to hydrolytic microorganisms and scfas producers this different inhibition was another reason for pms promoting scfas yield in this work 3 4 what happens to pms after being added in the fermentation systems as a triple salt pms not only has powerful oxidative capacity but also can slowly decompose to release k hso5 at a controlled rate when it meet with hydrous media see equation 1 for details the generated hso5 can be further converted to three main free radicals so4 oh and 1o2 via equations 2 5 ahmadi and ghanbari 2018 zhang et al 2014 which are generally considered the major intermediates of pms decomposition additionally a few amount of acid is also produced in the process of pms decomposition equations 3 and 4 resulting in the drop in ph inevitably 1 khso5 hso5 k 2 hso5 e so4 oh 3 hso4 so4 2 h 4 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h 5 so5 2 hso5 hso4 so4 2 1o2 it was found that the residual pms was at a very low level even in the 0 24 g pms g tss fermenter after 24 h and at this time no residual pms was detected in the 0 09 g pms g tss fermenter fig s4 supporting information as shown in fig 4 a the special hyperfine coupling constants a n 14 9 g a h 14 9 g all 0 5 g obtained by simulation were consistent with that of dmpo oh adducts while the special hyperfine coupling constants a n 13 8 g a h 10 0 g a h 1 4 g a h 0 8 g all 0 05 g obtained by simulation were in accordance with that of dmpo so4 adducts confirming the existence of so4 and oh the intensity of dmpo oh radical adducts signals was much stronger than that of dmpo so4 adducts signals in all tested time this might be due to that dmpo oh is stronger to generate signal than dmpo so4 similarly the existence of 1o2 was also confirmed in the pms added systems fig 4b as expected the addition of pms led to the variations of orp fig 4c besides k2so4 and khso4 inevitably co existed in the fermentation systems as well although some investigations have been performed in this field the potential contributions of these individual intermediates or products to the production of scfas have not been differentiated or discussed before as elucidated in equations 3 and 4 the addition of pms caused ph drop about 4 5 7 in all the fermenters in this work fig s5 supporting information but previous work demonstrated that ph variation in this range did not affect scfas production significantly yuan et al 2006 the orp values at pms dose of 0 09 g g tss decreased sharply in the first 24 h and then stayed stable in the remainder period about 200 mv which was similar to that in the blank fig 4c indicating that the orp influence at 0 09 g pms g tss level could be negligible however 0 24 g pms g tss caused greater orp values than both 0 or 0 09 g pms g tss in the initial 6 d fermentation and this might to the reason for the fermenter with 0 24 g pms g tss addition requiring longer fermentation time to achieve the maximal scfas yield than the others fig 1a fig 4d exhibits the effects of pms and its decomposition products on scfas production it can be seen that compared with the blank k2so4 and khso4 did not affect scfas yield obviously however oh so4 and 1o2 promoted the maximal yield of scfas to 168 0 220 3 and 232 4 mg cod g vss respectively suggesting that 1o2 oh and so4 were the main contributors to the enhancement of scfas production in this work and their contributions were in the sequence of 1o2 so4 oh previous work verified that membrane damage of cells provoked by free radicals generated from pms was proportional to the intracellular k efflux and to the extracellular na influx wittmann et al 1989 it was also reported that free radicals are reactive molecules and could cause destructive and irreversible damage to the cell components such as lipids proteins dna and other macromolecules zhang et al 2011 it should be emphasized that the addition of pms would introduce sulfate into the was fermentation system after the decomposition of pms for example 0 36 g l sulfate would be released in the 0 09 g pms g tss fermenter according to our calculation at this level it was demonstrated in this work that sulfate had no adverse effect on sludge fermentative scfas production fig 4d however it is unclear whether this level of sulfate affect other microbes such as hydrolytic microorganisms hydrogen producers and sulfate reducers moreover as the sulfate will be released in the fermentation liquor or absorbed in sludge cells which is finally entered into either the mainstream wastewater line or sludge dewatering unit this presence of sulfate might affect the function microbes responsible for wastewater treatment such as nitrifiers and polyphosphate accumulating organisms or the final disposal of dewatered was more work is therefore required to assess the potential impacts of the released sulfate on these microbes or final disposal of dewatered was in the future 4 overall understanding and implications according to the analyses above it is clear that the addition of pms could effectively enhance scfas production from was anaerobic fermentation and the mechanisms of how pms promotes scfas production were revealed for the first time this was experimentally demonstrated through a series of batch tests using both real sludge and model compounds as fermentation substrates pms benefited the disruption of sludge cells and promoted the biodegradability of organics released thereby provided more biodegradable substrates for subsequent bioprocesses to produce scfas pms pretreatment decreased the percentages of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances in the released organics and the species and total detection frequency of other recalcitrant organics such as cyclopentasiloxane heptasiloxane and ethylene glycol which were hardly degraded in ordinary anaerobic condition or fermentation although pms caused inhibitions to some extents to all the microbes in the anaerobic fermentation its inhibition to scfas consumers was much severer than that to scfas producers after pms entering into the fermentation system k h so4 2 1o2 so4 and oh would be produced as the major intermediates 1o2 so4 and oh were the major contributors to scfas production pms addition also affected orp values in the fermenters and this seemed to affect lag phase time of scfas production rather than scfas yield the findings achieved in this work largely advance the understanding of the pms involved was fermentation which may guide engineers to better manipulate was treatment in the future compared with other scfas production methods e g free nitrous acid or free ammonia based pretreatment the pms based sludge treatment requires extra addition of a certain amount of a chemical i e pms which inevitably increases the input thus one might want to know what advantages this pms based approach has according to our preliminary estimation using the data obtained in this work 180 is required to treat one ton of dried sludge with 311 7 mg cod g vss scfas being produced which is comparable to other oxidants such as calcium peroxide table s3 supporting information although the cost of the pms based approach is higher than free nitrous acid or free ammonia based methods its scfas yield is also much greater it was reported that the maximum scfas yield was 195 7 mg cod g vss for free nitrous acid and 267 2 mg cod g vss for free ammonia li et al 2016a zhang et al 2018 it should be emphasized that this work mainly aimed to explore the mechanisms of pms enhancing scfas production thus technical optimization was not performed thus the dosage of pms may be reduced if activated pms or comprehensive optimizations e g mathematical model study or response surface study is carried out in the future apart from the biodegradable substances such as proteins and carbohydrates several non biodegradable organics such as humic substances are also included in was moreover many types of persistent organic pollutants such as personal care products antibiotics and endocrine disrupting compounds have been growing accumulated in was oh et al 2016 these substances could not be bio degraded effectively in ordinary anaerobic fermentation which brings risks to ecological environment and human health during the final disposal of was this work demonstrated that the addition of pms largely enhanced the degradation of humic substances and other recalcitrant organics such as cyclopentasiloxane heptasiloxane and ethylene glycol which not only erases this concern but also benefits the final disposal of was 5 conclusions in this study scfas production from was is significantly improved by pms pretreatment with an increase of pms level from 0 to 0 09 g g tss the maximal scfas yield increased to 311 67 mg cod g vss it was found pms pretreatment accelerated the disintegration of was and improved the biodegradability of organics released besides pms effectively removed the refractory organic pollutants which are non biodegradable under the ordinary anaerobic condition batch tests showed that pms caused harms to some extents to all the microbes in the anaerobic fermentation but the scfas consumers showed the worse resilience to pms compared to scfas producers further investigations showed that 1o2 so4 and oh were the major contributors to scfas production and their contributions were in the sequence of 1o2 so4 oh

tested phenolic compounds was 0 22 clo2 pre oxidation reduced the yields of chloroform from phenol derivatives by 37 97 except 4 methoxyphenol catechol and 2 3 dihydroxyphenol on the contrary clo2 pre oxidation of di and tri hydroxybenzenes tended to increase chloral hydrate yields in post chlorination mixed results both increases and decreases were observed in chloral hydrate formation from chlorination of mono hydroxybenzenes after clo2 pre oxidation the changes of their formation were dependent on clo2 pre oxidation time and dosages identification of transformation products suggested that phenolic compounds were mainly converted to unsaturated carbonyl structures by clo2 chlorine substituted benzoquinones and cyclopent 4 ene 1 3 diones were important transformation products after a series of ring open decarboxylation hydrolysis and chlorine substitution reactions the changes in the formation yields of chloral hydrate and chloroform were governed by the difference in initial phenolic precursors and the transformation products after clo2 pre oxidation clo2 pre oxidation in water treatment can effectively reduce chloroform formation but may have a risk of increasing chloral

because of the complexity of nom the mechanisms of thms and chloral hydrate formation in synthetic waters are often conducted with model phenolic compounds phenolic compounds have been found to be important precursors for thm and chloral hydrate formation chuang et al 2015 gallard and von gunten 2002b previous studies have demonstrated that resorcinol and its di hydroxybenzenes derivatives can generate chloroform at high yields 60 boyce and hornig 1983 the reaction mechanisms include chlorine substitution oxidation hydrolysis and decarboxylation reactions smith et al 1976 gallard and his co workers found that mono hydroxybenzene structures though having lower yields of chloroform 0 4 30 could be an important pool of slowly reacting thm precursors due to their more prevalence in nom than di hydroxybenzene moieties gallard and von gunten 2002a chloral hydrate was also generated from chlorination of phenolic compounds though not as extensively studied as thms chloral hydrate yields from chlorination of phenolic compounds were much lower than chloroform which was around 0 1 0 7 depending on applied dose of chlorine chuang et al 2015 a recent study found that chlorinated cyclohexadiene

average reduction of 23 yang et al 2013b however clo2 pre oxidation showed mixed impacts on chloral hydrate formation that is both increases and decreases were observed yang et al 2013b yao et al 2018 the reason behind the inconsistent effects on chloral hydrate control of clo2 pre oxidation remains unknown the changes on nom properties during clo2 pre oxidation especially the alterations of the phenolic structures need to be investigated to explore the key factors affecting the thms and chloral hydrate formation as such the objectives of this study are to explore the role of clo2 pre

hydrate formation from chlorination of phenolic compounds 3 1 1 dbps formation in chlorination chlorine 1 mm as cl2 was added to each phenolic compound solution 0 1 mm at a molar concentration ratio of 10 1 and their dbp formation potentials after 24 h were shown in table 1 among the tested model compounds resorcinol and 3 5 dihydroxyphenol produced the highest chloroform yields mol mol defined as individual dbp concentration divided by initial precursor concentration on a molar concentration basis of 84 06 3 19 and 98 58 1 40 respectively chloroform yields from the other phenolic compounds were relatively lower 20 the results were basically in consistent with previous studies which reported that resorcinol and its derivatives were extremely reactive chloroform precursors with yields more than 80 boyce and hornig 1983 gallard and von gunten 2002b norwood et al 1980 on the other side chlorination of resorcinol exhibited the highest chloral hydrate yield 2 83 0 13 followed by chlorination of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 0 61 0 03 the chloral hydrate yields from the other phenolic compounds were below 0 5 however 3 5 dihydroxyphenol a reactive chloroform precursor did not form detectable level of chloral hydrate during chlorination indicating that the formation of chloroform and chloral hydrate may derive from different precursors or distinct pathways besides the yields of chloral hydrate depend on the substituted positions on phenols for example the yields of chloral hydrate from 3 carboxylphenol 2 carboxylphenol and 4 carboxylphenol were 0 19 0 03 0 27 0 01 and 0 32 0 03 respectively notable differences in the yields of chloral hydrate were also observed on di hydroxybenzenes compounds 3 hydroxyphenol resorcinol served as a significant chloral hydrate precursor in chlorination while 4 hydroxylphenol and 2 hydroxyphenol were unreactive to form chloral hydrate table 1 to further illustrate the effect of substituents on chloral hydrate formation from phenol derivatives hammett substituent constants σσo m p were used gallard and von gunten 2002b the unsubstituted phenol was used as a reference compound σσo m p 0 substituents with a positive σ value σ 0 generally exhibit electron withdrawing effects on phenol structure e g cooh while substituents with negative σ values σ 0 tend to have electron donating effect e g ch3 the values of σσo m p for model compounds were displayed in table 1 fig 2 showed the relationships between hammett constants of substituents and the yields of chloral hydrate from chlorination of mono hydroxybenzenes please note that di and tri hydroxybenzenes are not included as the numbers and position of oh in the benzene ring have different impacts on chloral hydrate formation especially for resorcinol chloral hydrate yields had a moderate correlation with σσo m p r2 0 60 p 0 05 this indicated that mono hydroxybenzenes substituted by electron withdrawing groups tend to exhibit higher chloral hydrate yields in general however no correlations can be found between σσo m p and chloroform formation data not shown this result also suggested the different precursors for chloral hydrate and chloroform 3 1 2 effect of reaction time and chlorine dose among the tested phenolic compounds resorcinol and 4 acetylphenol showed high formation level of both chloroform and chloral hydrate table 1 therefore they were chosen to further evaluate the effect of reaction time and chlorine dose fig 3 a shows the formation of chloroform and chloral hydrate during chlorination of resorcinol and 4 acetylphenol versus reaction time resorcinol exhibited a fast formation kinetics of chloroform about 80 of final formation potential was formed in the first 30 min which was in agreement with the reported fast chloroform formation rate for resorcinol gallard and von gunten 2002b formation of chloroform from 4 acetylphenol increased in the first 5 h at a relatively low rate until a plateau was reached in comparison to chloroform chloral hydrate formation had a much lower rate chloral hydrate formation from resorcinol and 4 acetylphenol kept increasing within 24 h reaction time fig 3 b shows the chloroform and chloral hydrate formation from resorcinol and 4 acetylphenol at various chlorine doses the yields of chloral hydrate from resorcinol increased from 0 7 to 3 5 and the yields of chloroform increased from 57 6 to 98 0 when chlorine dose raised from 5 to 20 times of the molar concentration of precursors similar tendency was observed in chlorination of 4 acetylphenol although chloroform and chloral hydrate formation of resorcinol was much higher than 4 acetylphenol chlorine consumption of resorcinol was much less than 4 acetylphenol fig s1 when 4 acetylphenol reacted with chlorine at a molar concentration ratio of 1 5 or 1 10 chlorine was depleted after 5 h however residual chlorine was present after 24h reaction when resorcinol reacted with chlorine at a molar concentration ratio of 1 10 the chlorine incorporation in chloral hydrate formation from model compounds was further examined by plotting the dbps yields against chlorine demands fig s2 the slope representing the chlorine incorporation in chloral hydrate formation varied with different compounds the chlorine incorporation in chloral hydrate from chlorination of resorcinol was the highest besides the intercepts of the correlations were all below origin indicating that the initial chlorine consumption was attributed to chlorine substitution on phenolic structure without ring cleavage this was in agreement with observations from previous studies gallard and von gunten 2002b yan et al 2014 3 2 chloroform and chloral hydrate formation from phenolic compounds in chlorination with clo2 pre oxidation 3 2 1 dbps formation in chlorination with clo2 pre oxidation table 1 shows the changes of chloroform and chloral hydrate formation when clo2 pre treatment was applied to the phenolic compounds prior to chlorination generally pre oxidation with clo2 reduced the formation of chloroform from phenol derivatives by 37 97 except catechol 4 methoxyphenol and 2 3 dihydroxyphenol the chloroform yields from catechol 4 methoxyphenol and 2 3 dihydroxyphenol increased about 15 7 and 2 times respectively of those in chlorination alone on the other hand clo2 pre oxidation had varied impacts on chloral hydrate formation from chlorination of phenol derivatives with respect to mono hydroxybenzenes both increases and decreases of chloral hydrate formation were observed after clo2 pre oxidation table 1 and fig s3 chloral hydrate yields from phenol increased by 70 after clo2 pre oxidation from 0 14 0 02 to 0 24 0 00 the phenolic structures with substituents of 4 methoxy 4 aldehyde 3 methyl 4 carboxy and 2 methoxy 4 carboxy exhibited 30 640 increase in chloral hydrate formation after clo2 pre oxidation oppositely clo2 pre oxidation of the phenol derivatives with substituents of 4 acetyl 2 carboxy 3 carboxy 2 4 6 trichloro and 2 methyl 4 carboxy reduced the chloral hydrate formation in post chlorination for di and trihydroxybenzenes clo2 pre oxidation tended to increase their chloral hydrate yields in post chlorination table 1 and fig s4 for example chloral hydrate was not detectable from chlorination of 3 5 dihydroxyphenol but a chloral hydrate yield of 0 37 0 02 occurred when clo2 pre oxidation was applied chloral hydrate yields with clo2 pre oxidation from catechol 2 3 dihydroxyphenol and 2 4 dihydroxyphenol were about 4 times higher than those in chlorination alone it should be noted that negligible formation of chloroform and choral hydrate was detected after clo2 oxidation of phenolic derivates with an initial molar concentration ratio of 5 1 for 2 h without nitrogen purging less than 0 02 of molar yields in most of cases table s2 which only occupied 0 2 of the formation after post chlorination i e clo2 cl2 treatment therefore the distinct clo2 oxidized products from phenolic moieties with 4 aldehydephenol was an exception that chloroform and chloral hydrate formation from clo2 treatment alone occupied about 13 5 and 5 2 of that after post chlorination respectively therefore the distinct clo2 oxidized products from phenolic moieties with varied types of substituents and positions may result in the inconsistent effects on chloral hydrate formation in post chlorination 3 2 2 effect of pre oxidation time and clo2 dose as discussed above the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on chloroform and chloral hydrate formation from chlorination of phenolic compounds could be classified into three categories reducing formation in both chloroform and chloral hydrate formation increasing formation in both chloroform and chloral hydrate and reducing chloroform formation but increasing chloral hydrate formation thus resorcinol 4 methoxyphenol and 4 carboxyphenol representatives of each category were chosen to further examine the effect of pre treatment time and clo2 pre oxidation dose on the yields of chloroform and chloral hydrate the yields of chloroform and chloral hydrate from chlorination of resorcinol were both greatly reduced after clo2 pre oxidation fig 4 the chloroform yields from resorcinol decreased over 80 when clo2 pre oxidation was applied reduction of chloral hydrate formation from resorcinol increased from 19 to 54 when clo2 pre oxidation time increased from 10 min to 120 min on the contrary increase of chloroform and chloral hydrate formation were observed for 4 methoxyphenol with increasing clo2 pre oxidation time the yields of chloroform increased from 0 22 0 04 to 5 37 0 25 and the yields of chloral hydrate were also enhanced from 0 30 0 01 to 5 37 0 25 when clo2 pre oxidation lasted for 120 min clo2 pre oxidation of 4 carboxyphenol for 120 min greatly reduced its chloroform formation from 8 46 0 84 to 0 36 0 05 but increased the chloral hydrate formation from 0 32 0 01 to 0 66 0 04 similar tendency was also observed when 4 carboxyphenol was treated with different clo2 doses chloroform formation from 4 carboxyphenol was reduced by 90 98 while chloral hydrate formation increased by 75 126 when clo2 dose increased from 2 to 5 times of the molar concentration of precursors the trend of dbps formation altered by clo2 pre oxidation became more obvious with increasing clo2 pre oxidation time and clo2 dose 3 3 mechanism of clo2 pre oxidation on phenolic compounds 3 3 1 transformation products of phenolic compounds after clo2 oxidation to understand why clo2 pre oxidation of phenolic compounds has the diverse changes in chloroform and chloral hydrate formation from post chlorination the transformation products from clo2 oxidation of resorcinol 4 methoxyphenol and 4 carboxyphenol were further evaluated besides 3 methlyphenol catechol and hydroquinone which show increasing chloral hydrate formation after clo2 pre oxidation were also included these six phenolic model compounds 0 1 mm were all separately treated with clo2 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 mm for 2 h at ph 7 0 to identify the key reaction intermediates analysis of transformation products of resorcinol after clo2 oxidation were illustrated as an example table 2 the intermediate products are dependent on the molar ratios of clo2 dose to resorcinol concentration at a clo2 to resorcinol molar ratio of 2 product p164 rt 8 10 min was detected on gc msd and product p176 rt 0 79 min was observed on lc qtof p164 was the dominant transformation product observed on gc msd spectrum the major ion cluster m z 164 166 168 i e m e was observed with relative abundances at ratio of 9 6 1 suggesting the presence of two chlorine atoms in it the loss of co groups loss of 28 da was observed from m z 164 to m z 136 and from m z 110 to m z 82 fig s5 therefore p164 was assumed to be a dichlorocyclopent 4 ene 1 3 dione c5h2o2cl2 table 2 p164 has also been identified in previous studies during clo2 oxidation and chlorination of resorcinol boyce and hornig 1983 jackson et al 1987 p176 with the observed exact mass m z of 176 9958 corresponded to a chemical formula of c6h2o4cl the peak clusters at m z 177 179 at an isotopic ratio of 3 1 confirmed the molecule having one chlorine atom loss of 18 da and 30 da was observed from the dominant fragments of m z 159 and 127 indicating the loss of a oh h and ch2o group respectively fig s6 it should be noted that halobenzoquinones formed parent ions m h 2e in negative esi spectra instead of m h huang et al 2013 accordingly p176 was proposed as chloro trihydroxycyclohexadienones table 2 when molar ratio of clo2 to resorcinol increased to 5 or 10 products p180 rt 1 02 min and p214 rt 1 432 min were found on lc qtof ms p180 observed at m z 180 9462 corresponded to a chemical formula of c5h2o3cl2 it was proposed as hydroxy substituted form of p164 based on the fragments provided in fig s6 p214 observed at m z 212 8917 corresponded to a chemical formula of c5ho3cl3 it can be formed after chlorine substitution on p180 substituted cyclopent 4 ene 1 3 diones have been detected in chlorinated drinking waters in a previous study gong et al 2005 which were structurally similar to p180 and p214 besides chloroacetones p160b and p194 were detected as ring cleaved products from clo2 oxidation of resorcinol based on library matches of their ei mass spectrum with the mass spectra database the transformation products of 4 methoxyphenol 4 carboxyphenol 3 methlyphenol catechol and hydroquinone during clo2 oxidation were displayed in table s3 and the corresponding chromatogram records were shown in figs s5 s6 notably these compounds all exhibited higher chloral hydrate formation potential after clo2 pre oxidation table 1 p164 dichlorocyclopent 4 ene 1 3 dione was commonly found from clo2 oxidation of these compounds in addition 1 4 benzoquinone p108 and chlorine or hydroxy substituted benzoquinones p124 p138 p140 and p142 were also transformation products commonly observed 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone though not found from the tested phenols in this study was reported to be formed from clo2 oxidation of phenol and para substituted phenols ganiev et al 2006 kosaka et al 2016 on the basis of the transformation products from clo2 oxidation of phenolic compounds there appeared to have some commonality in the pathways for the change of dbps formation potential after clo2 pre treatment phenolic moieties were mainly converted to quinone moieties by clo2 i e oh groups converted to co groups substitution of hydroxy or chlorine atoms on aromatic structures occurred simultaneously in addition the process was accompanied with formation of five carbon chlorinated cyclic carbonyls after ring cleavage and decarboxylation of benzene rings although chlorinated carbonyls were formed after clo2 pre treatment the amount of these chlorinated products were expected to be much lower than in chlorination stevens 1982 it should be noted that non chlorinated transformation products were also observed such as carboxylic acids and aldehydes rav acha 1998 3 3 2 chloroform and chloral hydrate formation from transformation products in chlorination the difference in dbps formation yields between phenolic precursors and their transformation products after clo2 pre oxidation governs the changes of dbps yields in subsequent chlorination in order to evaluate the impact of these intermediates on the formation of chloroform and chloral hydrate dbp formation potential tests were conducted on 1 4 benzoquinone p108 and 2 6 dichlobenzoquinone these two chemicals were commercially available among detected transformation products chloroform yields from chlorination of 1 4 benzoquionone was low 0 13 0 01 but 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone exhibited considerable yields of chloroform in chlorination of 1 45 0 09 therefore for compounds with very low yields of chloroform e g 0 22 for 4 methoxyphenol 0 33 for catechol 0 52 for 2 3 dihydroxyphenol the conversion to 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone after clo2 oxidation thus may enhance chloroform formation however in the case of those phenols with high chloroform yields 2 conversions to 1 4 benzoquionone or 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone in clo2 pre treatment led to reductions on chloroform formation taken resorcinol as an example chloroform yield was 84 06 in chlorination when resorcinol reacted with clo2 at a molar concentration ratio of 1 5 clo2 was depleted data not shown still around 14 of chloroform yields was observed in post chlorination it indicated that the transformation products after clo2 pre oxidation can still generate chloroform but at much lower yields than resorcinol similarly the effect of clo2 pre oxidation on chloral hydrate formation in post chlorination was also dependent on the relative formation yields of the initial precursors and the transformation products given that the chloral hydrate yields from phenolic compounds were generally low 0 7 of yields we found both increases and decreases in chloral hydrate formation after clo2 oxidation without any clear border yields table 1 the chloral hydrate yields from chlorination of two clo2 oxidized intermediates 1 4 benzoquionone and 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone were 2 20 0 01 and 0 13 0 01 respectively since the high chloral hydrate yield for 1 4 benzoquionone was about 10 times of the median chloral hydrate yields of the tested phenolic compounds 0 22 the occurrence of 1 4 benzoquionone as a clo2 oxidized intermediate of 4 methoxyphenol 4 carboxyphenol and hydroquinone table s3 may contribute to their increased chloral hydrate formation by clo2 pre oxidation furthermore di and tri hydroxybenzenes generally had enhanced chloral hydrate yields after clo2 pre oxidation given that 1 4 benzoquinone was a significant chloral hydrate precursor the enhanced chloral hydrate yields of di and tri hydroxybenzenes may be relevant with the conversions to benzoquinones moieties by clo2 besides benzoquinones other transformation products e g substituted cyclopent 4 ene 1 3 diones may also contribute to chloroform and chloral hydrate formation in post chlorination for instance an approximate 78 increase in chloroform yields and 41 increase in chloral hydrate yields from 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone were observed with clo2 pre treatment compared to chlorination alone table 1 that is further decomposition of 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone by clo2 seemed to produce more potent moieties for chloroform and chloral hydrate formation p214 the chlorinated cyclopent 4 ene 1 3 dione was identified as the major degradation product of 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone during clo2 oxidation data not shown which indirectly proved that transformation product cyclopent 4 ene 1 3 diones also contribute to chloroform and chloral hydrate formation in post chlorination 3 3 3 reaction mechanisms the effect of clo2 pre oxidation on chloroform and chloral hydrate formation pathways were shown in fig 5 using resorcinol as an example clo2 pre oxidation can alter chloral hydrate or chloroform formation via shifting the distribution of intermediate products of phenols chlorine reacts with phenolic compounds via electrophilic incorporation leading to prevalence of chlorinated phenols and cyclohexenones as intermediates subsequently these chlorinated intermediates undergo a series of decarboxylation and chlorine substitution reactions with release of chloroform illustrated as pathway a arnold et al 2008 bond et al 2012 de leer and erkelens 1985 tretyakova et al 1994 hydrolysis coupled with further chlorination also led to the formation of chloral hydrate illustrated as pathway b chuang et al 2015 although halobenzoquinones and chlorocyclopent 4 ene 1 3 diones were also identified in chlorination of phenols gong et al 2005 norwood et al 1980 their yields were generally less than 1 according to results from chlorination of aromatic compounds boyce and hornig 1983 kosaka et al 2016 application of clo2 pre oxidation could significantly promote the conversions from phenols to unsaturated ketones intermediates clo2 oxidized phenols mainly via electron transfer with hydroquinones or unsaturated ketones and their chlorine substituted products as main products wenk et al 2013 illustrated as pathway c besides limited chlorine incorporation occurs during clo2 oxidation which may increase the stability of these ketones chlorocyclopent 4 ene 1 3 diones and their isomers were also generated in further clo2 oxidation of hydroquinones after decarboxylation consequently abundant unsaturated ketones were formed after clo2 pre oxidation which leads to different dbps formation pathways in post chlorination clearly clo2 oxidation changes the structure of chloral hydrate and chloroform precursors and thus the formation pathways a previous study using 13c labeled resorcinol proved that chloroform yields in chlorination originated from the cleavage about the c2 site of benzene ring however after clo2 pre oxidation the dominant products chlorocyclopent 4 ene 1 3 diones and their isomers may follow different ring cleavage patterns besides cleavage on c2 site the breakage on c3 site was also expected gong et al 2010 lin et al 1984 aliphatic ketone acid type structures were also formed as the main ring cleavage products dickenson et al 2008 3 4 phenolic moieties in nom are major choral hydrate precursors the results from this study highlight that phenolic compounds serve as an important pool of chloral hydrate precursors despite of their relatively low yields the phenolic compounds account for about 21 of the total carbon in humic substances norwood et al 1987 assuming the number of carbon atom in phenolic compounds is six there are about three phenolic molecules per hundred carbon atoms in humic substances according to the information collection rule icr database the median dissolve organic carbon doc level of source waters from 500 water treatment plants in the united states was 2 35 mg l 1 obolensky et al 2007 which can be translated to about 6 μm phenolic molecules if the median of choral hydrate yields 0 22 from the tested phenols in 24 h chlorination was used for calculation about 2 2 μg l 1 chloral hydrate will be generated during chlorination this is in consistence with the median 2 3 μg l 1 chloral hydrate occurrence levels reported in icr database wang et al 2015 although the estimation was not exactly accurate without considering the variations of other factors e g water treatment conditions nom characteristics it still indirectly supports the importance of phenolic moieties as chloral hydrate precursors considering the estimation of chloral hydrate levels falls in the reported levels in finished drinking waters gan et al 2013 krasner et al 1989 although some amino acids e g aspartic acid tyrosine and tryptophan were also reported to serve as chloral hydrate precursors ueno et al 1995 the occurrences of amino acids in source waters are too low around 40 μg l 1 on average to explain the chloral hydrate levels in drinking waters dotson and westerhoff 2009 this study also demonstrates the possibility of increasing chloral hydrate formation after clo2 pre oxidation the enhanced dbp formation is probably attributed to the increases in unsaturated carbonyl moieties after clo2 pre oxidation of phenolic compounds because of water scarcity water supply systems are increasingly exploiting water sources affected by agricultural runoff and industrial and municipal wastewater discharges these types of impaired waters often contain phenolic compounds that are widely used in dyes surfactants pharmaceuticals and pesticides prasse et al 2018 therefore when clo2 pre oxidation is applied to these source waters the risk of increased chloral hydrate formation in post chlorination needs attention 4 conclusions phenolic moieties play a central role in the structures of nom and serve as an important pool of dbp precursors the chloral hydrate yields from chlorination of phenolic compounds were below 0 5 with a median value of 0 22 except for resorcinol with significant chloral hydrate and chloroform yields increased chloral hydrate yields were observed after clo2 pre oxidation of some phenolic compounds especially di and tri hydroxybenzenes this result helps to understand the mixed impacts of clo2 pre oxidation on chloral hydrate formation in water treatments phenolic compounds were mainly transformed to unsaturated ketone moieties i e chlorinated or non chlorinated benzoquinones and cyclopentene diones after clo2 pre oxidation these unsaturated ketones tend to have much higher chloral hydrate yields but much lower chloroform yields in post chlorination compared to those original phenolic compounds the increased chloral hydrate formation and decreased chloroform formation from phenolic compounds after clo2 pre oxidation are relevant with the dominant formation of unsaturated ketone moieties therefore there might be trade offs between the formation of chloroform and chloral hydrate of clo2 cl2 treatment water utilities receiving source waters affected by discharges containing phenolic compounds should be cautious with application of clo2 cl2 treatment acknowledgements we thank the national science foundation of china 21622706

compounds including mono di and tri hydroxybenzenes were evaluated and the role of chlorine dioxide clo2 pre oxidation on its formation pathways was explored chloroform was also evaluated for comparison chlorination of resorcinol exhibited the highest chloral hydrate yield 2 83 0 13 followed by chlorination of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 0 61 0 03 the median of chloral hydrate yields from the tested phenolic compounds was 0 22 clo2 pre oxidation reduced the yields of chloroform from phenol derivatives by 37 97 except 4 methoxyphenol catechol and 2 3 dihydroxyphenol on the contrary clo2 pre oxidation of di and tri hydroxybenzenes tended to increase chloral hydrate yields in post chlorination mixed results both increases and decreases were observed in chloral hydrate formation from chlorination of mono hydroxybenzenes after clo2 pre oxidation the changes of their formation were dependent on clo2 pre oxidation time and dosages identification of transformation products suggested that phenolic compounds were mainly converted to unsaturated carbonyl structures by clo2 chlorine substituted benzoquinones and cyclopent 4 ene 1 3 diones were important transformation products after a series of ring open decarboxylation hydrolysis and chlorine substitution reactions the changes in the formation yields of chloral hydrate and chloroform were governed by the difference in initial phenolic precursors and the transformation products after clo2 pre oxidation clo2 pre oxidation in water treatment can effectively reduce chloroform formation but may have a risk of increasing chloral

generate chloroform at high yields 60 boyce and hornig 1983 the reaction mechanisms include chlorine substitution oxidation hydrolysis and decarboxylation reactions smith et al 1976 gallard and his co workers found that mono hydroxybenzene structures though having lower yields of chloroform 0 4 30 could be an important pool of slowly reacting thm precursors due to their more prevalence in nom than di hydroxybenzene moieties gallard and von gunten 2002a chloral hydrate was also generated from chlorination of phenolic compounds though not as extensively studied as thms chloral hydrate yields from

average reduction of 23 yang et al 2013b however clo2 pre oxidation showed mixed impacts on chloral hydrate formation that is both increases and decreases were observed yang et al 2013b yao et al 2018 the reason behind the inconsistent effects on chloral hydrate control of clo2 pre oxidation remains unknown the changes on nom properties during clo2 pre oxidation especially the alterations of the phenolic structures need to be investigated to explore the key factors affecting the thms and chloral hydrate formation as such the objectives of this study are to explore the role of clo2 pre oxidation in the formation of chloroform and chloral hydrate from chlorination of phenolic model compounds seventeen phenolic compounds including mono di and tri hydroxybenzenes were selected as representative moieties in nom with structures shown in fig 1 the yields of chloroform and chloral hydrate from phenolic compounds during chlorination were compared with out clo2 pre oxidation the

as individual dbp concentration divided by initial precursor concentration on a molar concentration basis of 84 06 3 19 and 98 58 1 40 respectively chloroform yields from the other phenolic compounds were relatively lower 20 the results were basically in consistent with previous studies which reported that resorcinol and its derivatives were extremely reactive chloroform precursors with yields more than 80 boyce and hornig 1983 gallard and von gunten 2002b norwood et al 1980 on the other side chlorination of resorcinol exhibited the highest chloral hydrate yield 2 83 0 13 followed by chlorination of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 0 61 0 03 the chloral hydrate yields from the other phenolic compounds were below 0 5 however 3 5 dihydroxyphenol a reactive chloroform precursor did not form detectable level of chloral hydrate during chlorination indicating that the formation of chloroform and chloral hydrate may derive from different precursors or distinct pathways besides the yields of chloral hydrate depend on the substituted positions on phenols for example the yields of chloral hydrate from 3 carboxylphenol 2 carboxylphenol and 4 carboxylphenol were 0 19 0 03 0 27 0 01 and 0 32 0 03 respectively notable differences in the yields of chloral hydrate were also observed on di hydroxybenzenes compounds 3 hydroxyphenol resorcinol served as a significant chloral hydrate precursor in chlorination while 4 hydroxylphenol and 2 hydroxyphenol were unreactive to form chloral hydrate table 1 to further illustrate the effect of substituents on chloral hydrate formation from phenol derivatives hammett substituent constants σσo m p were used gallard and von gunten 2002b the unsubstituted phenol was used as a reference compound σσo m p 0 substituents with a positive σ value σ 0 generally exhibit electron withdrawing effects on phenol structure e g cooh while substituents with negative σ values σ 0 tend to have electron donating effect e g ch3 the values of σσo m p for model compounds were displayed in table 1 fig 2 showed the relationships between hammett constants of substituents and the yields of chloral hydrate from chlorination of mono hydroxybenzenes please note that di and tri hydroxybenzenes are not included as the numbers and position of oh in the benzene ring have different impacts on chloral hydrate formation especially for resorcinol chloral hydrate yields had a moderate correlation with σσo m p r2 0 60 p 0 05 this indicated that mono hydroxybenzenes substituted by electron withdrawing groups tend to exhibit higher chloral hydrate yields in general however no correlations can be found between σσo m p and chloroform formation data not shown this result also suggested the different precursors for chloral hydrate and chloroform 3 1 2 effect of reaction time and chlorine dose among the tested phenolic compounds resorcinol and 4 acetylphenol showed high formation level of both chloroform and chloral hydrate table 1 therefore they were chosen to further evaluate the effect of reaction time and chlorine dose fig 3 a shows the formation of chloroform and chloral hydrate during chlorination of resorcinol and 4 acetylphenol versus reaction time resorcinol exhibited a fast formation kinetics of chloroform about 80 of final formation potential was formed in the first 30 min which was in agreement with the reported fast chloroform formation rate for resorcinol gallard and von gunten 2002b formation of chloroform from 4 acetylphenol increased in the first 5 h at a relatively low rate until a plateau was reached in comparison to chloroform chloral hydrate formation had a much lower rate chloral hydrate formation from resorcinol and 4 acetylphenol kept increasing within 24 h reaction time fig 3 b shows the chloroform and chloral hydrate formation from resorcinol and 4 acetylphenol at various chlorine doses the yields of chloral hydrate from resorcinol increased from 0 7 to 3 5 and the yields of chloroform increased from 57 6 to 98 0 when chlorine dose raised from 5 to 20 times of the molar concentration of precursors similar tendency was observed in chlorination of 4 acetylphenol although chloroform and chloral hydrate formation of resorcinol was much higher than 4 acetylphenol chlorine consumption of resorcinol was much less than 4 acetylphenol fig s1 when 4 acetylphenol reacted with chlorine at a molar concentration ratio of 1 5 or 1 10 chlorine was depleted after 5 h however residual chlorine was present after 24h reaction when resorcinol reacted with chlorine at a molar concentration ratio of 1 10 the chlorine incorporation in chloral hydrate formation from model compounds was further examined by plotting the dbps yields against chlorine demands fig s2 the slope representing the chlorine incorporation in chloral hydrate formation varied with different compounds the chlorine incorporation in chloral hydrate from chlorination of resorcinol was the highest besides the intercepts of the correlations were all below origin indicating that the initial chlorine consumption was attributed to chlorine substitution on phenolic structure without ring cleavage this was in agreement with observations from previous studies gallard and von gunten 2002b yan et al 2014 3 2 chloroform and chloral hydrate formation from phenolic compounds in chlorination with clo2 pre oxidation 3 2 1 dbps formation in chlorination with clo2 pre oxidation table 1 shows the changes of chloroform and chloral hydrate formation when clo2 pre treatment was applied to the phenolic compounds prior to chlorination generally pre oxidation with clo2 reduced the formation of chloroform from phenol derivatives by 37 97 except catechol 4 methoxyphenol and 2 3 dihydroxyphenol the chloroform yields from catechol 4 methoxyphenol and 2 3 dihydroxyphenol increased about 15 7 and 2 times respectively of those in chlorination alone on the other hand clo2 pre oxidation had varied impacts on chloral hydrate formation from chlorination of phenol derivatives with respect to mono hydroxybenzenes both increases and decreases of chloral hydrate formation were observed after clo2 pre oxidation table 1 and fig s3 chloral hydrate yields from phenol increased by 70 after clo2 pre oxidation from 0 14 0 02 to 0 24 0 00 the phenolic structures with substituents of 4 methoxy 4 aldehyde 3 methyl 4 carboxy and 2 methoxy 4 carboxy exhibited 30 640 increase in chloral hydrate formation after clo2 pre oxidation oppositely clo2 pre oxidation of the phenol derivatives with substituents of 4 acetyl 2 carboxy 3 carboxy 2 4 6 trichloro and 2 methyl 4 carboxy reduced the chloral hydrate formation in post chlorination for di and trihydroxybenzenes clo2 pre oxidation tended to increase their chloral hydrate yields in post chlorination table 1 and fig s4 for example chloral hydrate was not detectable from chlorination of 3 5 dihydroxyphenol but a chloral hydrate yield of 0 37 0 02 occurred when clo2 pre oxidation was applied chloral hydrate yields with clo2 pre oxidation from catechol 2 3 dihydroxyphenol and 2 4 dihydroxyphenol were about 4 times higher than those in chlorination alone it should be noted that negligible formation of chloroform and choral hydrate was detected after clo2 oxidation of phenolic derivates with an initial molar concentration ratio of 5 1 for 2 h without nitrogen purging less than 0 02 of molar yields in most of cases table s2 which only occupied 0 2 of the formation after post chlorination i e clo2 cl2 treatment therefore the distinct clo2 oxidized products from phenolic moieties with 4 aldehydephenol was an exception that chloroform and chloral hydrate formation from clo2 treatment alone occupied about 13 5 and 5 2 of that after post chlorination respectively therefore the distinct clo2 oxidized products from phenolic moieties with varied types of substituents and positions may result in the inconsistent effects on chloral hydrate formation in post chlorination 3 2 2 effect of pre oxidation time and clo2 dose as discussed above the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on chloroform and chloral hydrate formation from chlorination of phenolic compounds could be classified into three categories reducing formation in both chloroform and chloral hydrate formation increasing formation in both chloroform and chloral hydrate and reducing chloroform formation but increasing chloral hydrate formation thus resorcinol 4 methoxyphenol and 4 carboxyphenol representatives of each category were chosen to further examine the effect of pre treatment time and clo2 pre oxidation dose on the yields of chloroform and chloral hydrate the yields of chloroform and chloral hydrate from chlorination of resorcinol were both greatly reduced after clo2 pre oxidation fig 4 the chloroform yields from resorcinol decreased over 80 when clo2 pre oxidation was applied reduction of chloral hydrate formation from resorcinol increased from 19 to 54 when clo2 pre oxidation time increased from 10 min to 120 min on the contrary increase of chloroform and chloral hydrate formation were observed for 4 methoxyphenol with increasing clo2 pre oxidation time the yields of chloroform increased from 0 22 0 04 to 5 37 0 25 and the yields of chloral hydrate were also enhanced from 0 30 0 01 to 5 37 0 25 when clo2 pre oxidation lasted for 120 min clo2 pre oxidation of 4 carboxyphenol for 120 min greatly reduced its chloroform formation from 8 46 0 84 to 0 36 0 05 but increased the chloral hydrate formation from 0 32 0 01 to 0 66 0 04 similar tendency was also observed when 4 carboxyphenol was treated with different clo2 doses chloroform formation from 4 carboxyphenol was reduced by 90 98 while chloral hydrate formation increased by 75 126 when clo2 dose increased from 2 to 5 times of the molar concentration of precursors the trend of dbps formation altered by clo2 pre oxidation became more obvious with increasing clo2 pre oxidation time and clo2 dose 3 3 mechanism of clo2 pre oxidation on phenolic compounds 3 3 1 transformation products of phenolic compounds after clo2 oxidation to understand why clo2 pre oxidation of phenolic compounds has the diverse changes in chloroform and chloral hydrate formation from post chlorination the transformation products from clo2 oxidation of resorcinol 4 methoxyphenol and 4 carboxyphenol were further evaluated besides 3 methlyphenol catechol and hydroquinone which show increasing chloral hydrate formation after clo2 pre oxidation were also included these six phenolic model compounds 0 1 mm were all separately treated with clo2 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 mm for 2 h at ph 7 0 to identify the key reaction intermediates analysis of transformation products of resorcinol after clo2 oxidation were illustrated as an example table 2 the intermediate products are dependent on the molar ratios of clo2 dose to resorcinol concentration at a clo2 to resorcinol molar ratio of 2 product p164 rt 8 10 min was detected on gc msd and product p176 rt 0 79 min was observed on lc qtof p164 was the dominant transformation product observed on gc msd spectrum the major ion cluster m z 164 166 168 i e m e was observed with relative abundances at ratio of 9 6 1 suggesting the presence of two chlorine atoms in it the loss of co groups loss of 28 da was observed from m z 164 to m z 136 and from m z 110 to m z 82 fig s5 therefore p164 was assumed to be a dichlorocyclopent 4 ene 1 3 dione c5h2o2cl2 table 2 p164 has also been identified in previous studies during clo2 oxidation and chlorination of resorcinol boyce and hornig 1983 jackson et al 1987 p176 with the observed exact mass m z of 176 9958 corresponded to a chemical formula of c6h2o4cl the peak clusters at m z 177 179 at an isotopic ratio of 3 1 confirmed the molecule having one chlorine atom loss of 18 da and 30 da was observed from the dominant fragments of m z 159 and 127 indicating the loss of a oh h and ch2o group respectively fig s6 it should be noted that halobenzoquinones formed parent ions m h 2e in negative esi spectra instead of m h huang et al 2013 accordingly p176 was proposed as chloro trihydroxycyclohexadienones table 2 when molar ratio of clo2 to resorcinol increased to 5 or 10 products p180 rt 1 02 min and p214 rt 1 432 min were found on lc qtof ms p180 observed at m z 180 9462 corresponded to a chemical formula of c5h2o3cl2 it was proposed as hydroxy substituted form of p164 based on the fragments provided in fig s6 p214 observed at m z 212 8917 corresponded to a chemical formula of c5ho3cl3 it can be formed after chlorine substitution on p180 substituted cyclopent 4 ene 1 3 diones have been detected in chlorinated drinking waters in a previous study gong et al 2005 which were structurally similar to p180 and p214 besides chloroacetones p160b and p194 were detected as ring cleaved products from clo2 oxidation of resorcinol based on library matches of their ei mass spectrum with the mass spectra database the transformation products of 4 methoxyphenol 4 carboxyphenol 3 methlyphenol catechol and hydroquinone during clo2 oxidation were displayed in table s3 and the corresponding chromatogram records were shown in figs s5 s6 notably these compounds all exhibited higher chloral hydrate formation potential after clo2 pre oxidation table 1 p164 dichlorocyclopent 4 ene 1 3 dione was commonly found from clo2 oxidation of these compounds in addition 1 4 benzoquinone p108 and chlorine or hydroxy substituted benzoquinones p124 p138 p140 and p142 were also transformation products commonly observed 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone though not found from the tested phenols in this study was reported to be formed from clo2 oxidation of phenol and para substituted phenols ganiev et al 2006 kosaka et al 2016 on the basis of the transformation products from clo2 oxidation of phenolic compounds there appeared to have some commonality in the pathways for the change of dbps formation potential after clo2 pre treatment phenolic moieties were mainly converted to quinone moieties by clo2 i e oh groups converted to co groups substitution of hydroxy or chlorine atoms on aromatic structures occurred simultaneously in addition the process was accompanied with formation of five carbon chlorinated cyclic carbonyls after ring cleavage and decarboxylation of benzene rings although chlorinated carbonyls were formed after clo2 pre treatment the amount of these chlorinated products were expected to be much lower than in chlorination stevens 1982 it should be noted that non chlorinated transformation products were also observed such as carboxylic acids and aldehydes rav acha 1998 3 3 2 chloroform and chloral hydrate formation from transformation products in chlorination the difference in dbps formation yields between phenolic precursors and their transformation products after clo2 pre oxidation governs the changes of dbps yields in subsequent chlorination in order to evaluate the impact of these intermediates on the formation of chloroform and chloral hydrate dbp formation potential tests were conducted on 1 4 benzoquinone p108 and 2 6 dichlobenzoquinone these two chemicals were commercially available among detected transformation products chloroform yields from chlorination of 1 4 benzoquionone was low 0 13 0 01 but 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone exhibited considerable yields of chloroform in chlorination of 1 45 0 09 therefore for compounds with very low yields of chloroform e g 0 22 for 4 methoxyphenol 0 33 for catechol 0 52 for 2 3 dihydroxyphenol the conversion to 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone after clo2 oxidation thus may enhance chloroform formation however in the case of those phenols with high chloroform yields 2 conversions to 1 4 benzoquionone or 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone in clo2 pre treatment led to reductions on chloroform formation taken resorcinol as an example chloroform yield was 84 06 in chlorination when resorcinol reacted with clo2 at a molar concentration ratio of 1 5 clo2 was depleted data not shown still around 14 of chloroform yields was observed in post chlorination it indicated that the transformation products after clo2 pre oxidation can still generate chloroform but at much lower yields than resorcinol similarly the effect of clo2 pre oxidation on chloral hydrate formation in post chlorination was also dependent on the relative formation yields of the initial precursors and the transformation products given that the chloral hydrate yields from phenolic compounds were generally low 0 7 of yields we found both increases and decreases in chloral hydrate formation after clo2 oxidation without any clear border yields table 1 the chloral hydrate yields from chlorination of two clo2 oxidized intermediates 1 4 benzoquionone and 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone were 2 20 0 01 and 0 13 0 01 respectively since the high chloral hydrate yield for 1 4 benzoquionone was about 10 times of the median chloral hydrate yields of the tested phenolic compounds 0 22 the occurrence of 1 4 benzoquionone as a clo2 oxidized intermediate of 4 methoxyphenol 4 carboxyphenol and hydroquinone table s3 may contribute to their increased chloral hydrate formation by clo2 pre oxidation furthermore di and tri hydroxybenzenes generally had enhanced chloral hydrate yields after clo2 pre oxidation given that 1 4 benzoquinone was a significant chloral hydrate precursor the enhanced chloral hydrate yields of di and tri hydroxybenzenes may be relevant with the conversions to benzoquinones moieties by clo2 besides benzoquinones other transformation products e g substituted cyclopent 4 ene 1 3 diones may also contribute to chloroform and chloral hydrate formation in post chlorination for instance an approximate 78 increase in chloroform yields and 41 increase in chloral hydrate yields from 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone were observed with clo2 pre treatment compared to chlorination alone table 1 that is further decomposition of 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone by clo2 seemed to produce more potent moieties for chloroform and chloral hydrate formation p214 the chlorinated cyclopent 4 ene 1 3 dione was identified as the major degradation product of 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone during clo2 oxidation data not shown which indirectly proved that transformation product cyclopent 4 ene 1 3 diones also contribute to chloroform and chloral hydrate formation in post chlorination 3 3 3 reaction mechanisms the effect of clo2 pre oxidation on chloroform and chloral hydrate formation pathways were shown in fig 5 using resorcinol as an example clo2 pre oxidation can alter chloral hydrate or chloroform formation via shifting the distribution of intermediate products of phenols chlorine reacts with phenolic compounds via electrophilic incorporation leading to prevalence of chlorinated phenols and cyclohexenones as intermediates subsequently these chlorinated intermediates undergo a series of decarboxylation and chlorine substitution reactions with release of chloroform illustrated as pathway a arnold et al 2008 bond et al 2012 de leer and erkelens 1985 tretyakova et al 1994 hydrolysis coupled with further chlorination also led to the formation of chloral hydrate illustrated as pathway b chuang et al 2015 although halobenzoquinones and chlorocyclopent 4 ene 1 3 diones were also identified in chlorination of phenols gong et al 2005 norwood et al 1980 their yields were generally less than 1 according to results from chlorination of aromatic compounds boyce and hornig 1983 kosaka et al 2016 application of clo2 pre oxidation could significantly promote the conversions from phenols to unsaturated ketones intermediates clo2 oxidized phenols mainly via electron transfer with hydroquinones or unsaturated ketones and their chlorine substituted products as main products wenk et al 2013 illustrated as pathway c besides limited chlorine incorporation occurs during clo2 oxidation which may increase the stability of these ketones chlorocyclopent 4 ene 1 3 diones and their isomers were also generated in further clo2 oxidation of hydroquinones after decarboxylation consequently abundant unsaturated ketones were formed after clo2 pre oxidation which leads to different dbps formation pathways in post chlorination clearly clo2 oxidation changes the structure of chloral hydrate and chloroform precursors and thus the formation pathways a previous study using 13c labeled resorcinol proved that chloroform yields in chlorination originated from the cleavage about the c2 site of benzene ring however after clo2 pre oxidation the dominant products chlorocyclopent 4 ene 1 3 diones and their isomers may follow different ring cleavage patterns besides cleavage on c2 site the breakage on c3 site was also expected gong et al 2010 lin et al 1984 aliphatic ketone acid type structures were also formed as the main ring cleavage products dickenson et al 2008 3 4 phenolic moieties in nom are major choral hydrate precursors the results from this study highlight that phenolic compounds serve as an important pool of chloral hydrate precursors despite of their relatively low yields the phenolic compounds account for about 21 of the total carbon in humic substances norwood et al 1987 assuming the number of carbon atom in phenolic compounds is six there are about three phenolic molecules per hundred carbon atoms in humic substances according to the information collection rule icr database the median dissolve organic carbon doc level of source waters from 500 water treatment plants in the united states was 2 35 mg l 1 obolensky et al 2007 which can be translated to about 6 μm phenolic molecules if the median of choral hydrate yields 0 22 from the tested phenols in 24 h chlorination was used for calculation about 2 2 μg l 1 chloral hydrate will be generated during chlorination this is in consistence with the median 2 3 μg l 1 chloral hydrate occurrence levels reported in icr database wang et al 2015 although the estimation was not exactly accurate without considering the variations of other factors e g water treatment conditions nom characteristics it still indirectly supports the importance of phenolic moieties as chloral hydrate precursors considering the estimation of chloral hydrate levels falls in the reported levels in finished drinking waters gan et al 2013 krasner et al 1989 although some amino acids e g aspartic acid tyrosine and tryptophan were also reported to serve as chloral hydrate precursors ueno et al 1995 the occurrences of amino acids in source waters are too low around 40 μg l 1 on average to explain the chloral hydrate levels in drinking waters dotson and westerhoff 2009 this study also demonstrates the possibility of increasing chloral hydrate formation after clo2 pre oxidation the enhanced dbp formation is probably attributed to the increases in unsaturated carbonyl moieties after clo2 pre oxidation of phenolic compounds because of water scarcity water supply systems are increasingly exploiting water sources affected by agricultural runoff and industrial and municipal wastewater discharges these types of impaired waters often contain phenolic compounds that are widely used in dyes surfactants pharmaceuticals and pesticides prasse et al 2018 therefore when clo2 pre oxidation is applied to these source waters the risk of increased chloral hydrate formation in post chlorination needs attention 4 conclusions phenolic moieties play a central role in the structures of nom and serve as an important pool of dbp precursors the chloral hydrate yields from chlorination of phenolic compounds were below 0 5 with a median value of 0 22 except for resorcinol with significant chloral hydrate and chloroform yields increased chloral hydrate yields were observed after clo2 pre oxidation of some phenolic compounds especially di and tri hydroxybenzenes this result helps to understand the mixed impacts of clo2 pre oxidation on chloral hydrate formation in water treatments phenolic compounds were mainly transformed to unsaturated ketone moieties i e chlorinated or non chlorinated benzoquinones and cyclopentene diones after clo2 pre oxidation these unsaturated ketones tend to have much higher chloral hydrate yields but much lower chloroform yields in post chlorination compared to those original phenolic compounds the increased chloral hydrate formation and decreased chloroform formation from phenolic compounds after clo2 pre oxidation are relevant with the dominant formation of unsaturated ketone moieties therefore there might be trade offs between the formation of chloroform and chloral hydrate of clo2 cl2 treatment water utilities receiving source waters affected by discharges containing phenolic compounds should be cautious with application of clo2 cl2 treatment acknowledgements we thank the national science foundation of china 21622706

19199,reverse electrodialysis red has vast potential as a clean nonpolluting and sustainable renewable energy source however pilot scale red studies employing real waters remain rare this study reports the largest red 1000 cell pairs 250 m2 with municipal wastewater effluent 1 3 5 7 ms cm and seawater 52 9 53 8 ms cm as feed solutions the red stack was operated at a velocity of 1 5 cm s and the pilot plant produced 95 8 w of power 0 38 w m2 total membrane or 0 76 w m2 cell pair during operation of the red the inlet design of the stack comprising thin spacers and the water dissociation reaction at the cathode were revealed as vulnerabilities of the stack specifically pressure drops at the fluid inlet parts had the most detrimental effects on power output due to clogged spacers around the inlet parts in addition precipitates resulting in inorganic fouling were inevitable during the water dissociation reaction due to significant potential generated by the stack in the cathode chamber na and cl accounted for the majority of ions transferred from seawater to wastewater effluent through ion exchange membranes iems moreover some divalent cations in seawater mg2 and ca2 were also transferred to the wastewater effluent some organics with relatively low molecular weights in the wastewater effluent passed through the iems and their hydrophobic properties elevated the specific uv absorbance suva level in the seawater keywords power generation reverse electrodialysis seawater salinity gradient wastewater effluent 1 introduction developing global energy from renewable energy sources is a key goal given the limited supply of fossil fuels unlike fossil fuels renewable sources of energy e g wind solar hydropower geothermal do not directly emit greenhouse gases sequeira and santos 2018 however renewable sources are not always feasible because their availability is closely related to the weather time of day climate and geographical location therefore we still need to find a renewable energy source that is easy to store and able to ensure a consistent supply when required recently reverse electrodialysis red which generates electricity using two solutions of different salinities has attracted substantial attention as a potential renewable energy source because the salinity gradient energy sge is clean nonpolluting and sustainable logan and elimelech 2012 mei and tang 2018 moreover this process is not affected by the weather time of day or climate conditions as it requires saline water it was thought that the sge production process may need to be located in a constrained environment on the coast however the need for ready access to seawater can be avoided by using alternative saline solutions made from a recyclable source such as ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 cusick et al 2012 nam et al 2012 due to such advantages red technology has made remarkable advances in areas such as fundamental studies experimental investigations and field demonstrations logan and elimelech 2012 yip et al 2016 yip and elimelech 2014 an red cell consists of an anode chamber a stack a series of membrane cells with alternating cation exchange membranes cems and anion exchange membranes aems and a cathode chamber kim et al 2015 in the stack both a high concentration hc solution and a low concentration lc solution are supplied to generate an ion flux and a potential difference is created by the difference in salinity between hc and lc solutions the electrodes in each chamber are used to convert the ion flux into an electrical current through reduction oxidation reactions in this case water splitting or reversible redox reactions chen et al 2017 scialdone et al 2012 tedesco et al 2017 many studies have been carried out in an effort to develop red technology mei and tang 2018 early studies were focused on ion exchange membranes iems capable of viable energy production in red applications improved stack designs suitable spacers and operational conditions tremendous advances in red performance capabilities have been reported with regard to the significant role of iems and uniquely tailored iems with low resistance high ionic conductivity and monovalent ion selectivity cho et al 2017 güler et al 2013 hong and chen 2014 hong et al 2015 kim et al 2015 the spacers between cems and aems are also an important component determining the red performance outcome as the concentration gradient in the boundary layer between the membrane surface and the bulk fluid affect the gross power moreover the geometric characteristics of the spacers are related to pressure drops which reduce the net power produced during the red process długołęcki et al 2010 gurreri et al 2016 conversely there have been several attempts to eliminate the use of spacers through the use of profiled membranes also known as patterned membranes an enhanced effective membrane surface area and the promotion of good fluid mixing under low hydraulic resistance have been achieved by the successful development of profiled membranes pawlowski et al 2017 operational parameters have been assessed to determine the optimal parameters to generate maximum power density a higher flow velocity was found to be advantageous as it reduces the overall resistance resulting in higher maximum power density however concerns remain because a higher flow velocity requires extra energy to feed the pumps leading to a decrease in the net power density tedesco et al 2015 an elevated temperature of the feed solutions has had a positive impact on red performance warmer solutions increased the feed conductivity facilitate ionic mobilities and reduce ohmic losses ultimately resulting in increased power density levels benneker et al 2018 despite these significant contributions and improvements in the performance of the red process so far it has predominantly been assessed using nacl solutions to mimic seawater brine solutions and river water with lab scale red systems recently several reports regarding the use of natural feed solutions or scaled up red processes have been published d angelo et al 2017 kingsbury et al 2017 luque di salvo et al 2018 tedesco et al 2017 luque di salvo et al 2018 used fish canning factory wastewater pre filtered with 5 μm cartridge filters as a high concentration solution hc and reclaimed water from an mbr membrane bioreactor pilot plant in a wastewater treatment plant a long run test was conducted with various flow velocities and chemical cleaning kingsbury et al 2017 tested different natural feedwater sources including seawater river water desalination brine saline wastewater from a pickling plant and treated wastewater and found that the presence of natural organic matter nom has a considerable impact on the power density both studies used a small scale red system with a single membrane active area of less than 10 10 cm2 with ten cell pairs of iems a pilot scale red system was initially reported by tedesco et al 2016 whereby 40 w 1 6 w m2 of cell pair from a 125 cell pair stack was achieved with brackish water and brine as feed solutions and iron salt fecl2 fecl3 as an electrode solution source the plant was later expanded by installing two additional 500 cell pair red systems for the purpose of constructing a 1 kw power plant tedesco et al 2017 although several studies have employed real waters no previous research has used wastewater effluent and seawater at the pilot scale this combination of real waters could be important for plants located on the coast because many wastewater treatment plants discharge into the ocean in this work we present a pilot scale red equipped with a 1000 cell pair stack total membrane area 250 m2 which is twice as large as previous studies in terms of the number of cell pairs tedesco et al 2017 ocean lava seawater was used as the high concentration solution hc and wastewater effluent from a sewage treatment plant located beside the sea in jeju korea was used as the low concentration solution lc wastewater effluent was also selected as an electrode rinse solution es to minimize costs remove the environmental impacts from using chemicals such as k4fe cn 6 k3fe cn 6 or fecl2 fecl3 and avoid scale and cl2 formation due to excess divalent cations and chloride ions in the seawater unlike previous attempts which focused on power production we predominantly evaluated the behavior of inorganic solutes in solution and natural organic matter nom in the wastewater effluent because a change in the quality of seawater at the outlet of the red stack could be a concern if it is reused for example if red is integrated with other processes such as reverse osmosis ro we also disassembled the red stack after operation and analyzed the iems spacers and electrode to determine the causes of operational vulnerability in our system 2 materials and methods 2 1 red pilot plant set up preparations for pilot plant operation the pilot scale red stack consisted of two end plates made of acrylic resin and 1000 cell pairs total membrane area 250 m2 fig 1 cems type i fujifilm manufacturing europe netherlands and aems type i fujifilm manufacturing europe netherlands were alternately stacked between the electrodes 432 mm 290 mm pt coated ti plates and shielding membranes adjacent to the anode the cathode electrodes were both cems each membrane was separated from the adjacent membrane by a gasket ptfe thickness 100 μm tommy hecco korea and a spacer thickness 100 μm open area 59 ds mesh korea in order to prevent contact between membranes and to provide a channel for the feed solutions between the shielding membrane cem and the electrode we used a different spacer thickness 0 5 mm sefar korea a picture of the stack is provided in fig s1 in order to characterize the feed solution constituents table 1 the feed water was sampled prior to the pretreatment processes online real time monitoring for ph and conductivity of the feed solutions was performed with sampling conducted twice a week for the analysis of other parameters each sample was analyzed in duplicate the average values obtained during operation are shown in table 1 the location of the red pilot plant is considered ideal because seawater the hc solution and domestic wastewater effluent the lc solution can be taken from a well under the plant and from a wastewater treatment plant located near the plant on the coast of jeju island respectively both the seawater and wastewater effluent are pretreated before being fed into the red stack raw seawater which is somewhat cleaner and requires only minor pretreatment was filtered with a 5 μm cartridge filter and stored in a buffer tank prior to being fed into the red stack the wastewater effluent was pretreated by dual media filtration dmf followed by a bag filter 50 μm and cartridge filters 5 μm the pretreated wastewater effluent was also stored in a buffer tank before being fed into the red stack due to the limited supply of wastewater effluent the red stack was operated intermittently 8 h per day for 12 days before beginning continuous operation of the red stack the maximum power density was obtained by varying the external resistances the external resistance where the maximum power density was obtained was loaded for the continuous operation after the 8 h operation the red stack was placed in a stand by condition without any procedures until operation of the stack was started again the following day the feed waters were supplied to the red at a flow

physicochemical properties including the ion exchange capacity electrical resistance and permselectivity of the iems were measured in triplicate the methods are described in the supplementary material yang et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the pilot scale red the maximum power on each day is shown in fig 2 a the maximum power 95 8 w was achieved on day 4 and the corresponding power density was approximately 0 38 w m2 total membrane 0 76 w m2 cell pair although a higher power density 1 6 w m2 cell pair was previously achieved from a unit cell due to a higher salinity ratio of feed waters with a stack equipped with 500 cell pairs fed with brackish water and brine tedesco et al 2016 2017 the power obtained from the stack with 1000 cell pairs in this study is the first obtained using solutions with lower salinity gradients wastewater effluent and seawater the energy efficiency η ranged from 11 4 to 13 3 which was higher than that obtained from the 500 cell pair red using brine and brackish water tedesco et al 2016 the lower power obtained in this study can be explained by the findings of previous reports it is often reported that multivalent ions in seawater are detrimental to power generation in a red system for example mg2 which is the most abundant cation in seawater after na inhibits the performance of the red system by increasing the resistance of the cem avci et al 2016 the presence of nom in the lc solution could also affect power generation because it typically lowers the effective salt concentration gradient by increasing the degree of concentration polarization near the membrane surface kingsbury et al 2017 at the start of operation the power was 74 1 w due to the higher salinity 5 7 ms cm of the lc influent fig 2b a concern during the initial phase was the pressure for both channels which started at 0 9 bar due to the supply of the natural solution fig 2c the conductivity of the lc influent was consistently lower on day 4 when maximum power was achieved on the day when the best performance was achieved the conductivities of the influents were 53 4 ms cm hc and 1 4 ms cm lc which changed to 45 3 ms cm hc and 10 2 ms cm lc at the outlet of the stack the maximum power then decreased to 62 7 w on the last day when operation had to be interrupted due to consistent pressure drops fig 2c this decrease in power indicates that some component impaired the process the conductivities of both effluents remained similar fig 2b meaning that the decrease in membrane performance was not significant as indicated in table 2 table 2 presents the physicochemical characteristics for virgin membranes and the membranes used here iecs and permselectivities were similar between the virgin and used membranes but slight increases in the electrical resistance of the used cem and aem were observed this could be due to adsorbed organics and divalent ions which can increase the resistance in iems as reported previously avci et al 2016 rijnaarts et al 2018 the temperature of the hc and lc influents decreased by 2 and 4 c respectively fig 2d however this decrease cannot be the main reason for the reduced power because the theoretical power is reduced by only approximately 1 when the temperature decreases by 2 4 c therefore we instead considered the performance of the electrodes as discussed in section 3 3 the cathode chamber was damaged by precipitates such as calcium carbonate ca2 hco3 oh caco3 h2o and magnesium hydroxide mg2 2oh mg oh 2 which formed due to the alkaline conditions caused by the cathodic reaction 2h2o 2e h2 2oh it has been reported that a high cathode ph is detrimental to hydrogen generation at cathodes in a low salinity solution in an electrolysis cell nam and logan 2012 and spacers clogged by precipitates at the cathode chamber could deteriorate the cathodic reaction by reducing the effective surface area of the electrode we discuss the precipitates further in section 3 3 3 2 characterization of inorganic and organic solutes the representative ion composition results day 4 show that na and cl accounted for the majority of ions transferred through the iems table 3 in addition some divalent cations mg2 and ca2 in this case were also transferred to the wastewater effluent so4 2 transfer was negligible as the concentration of so4 2 in the lc influent remained similar to that in the lc effluent in the electrode chamber the concentrations of na and cl were increased whereas those of other ions remained the same the reduced content of ions in the hc effluent could reduce the burden for subsequent processes for example if red is integrated with seawater reverse osmosis swro processes a hybrid red ro process the energy consumed during the swro process would be reduced due to the reduced salinity of seawater li et al 2013 fig 3 shows the mass concentration and hydrophobicity of carbonaceous organic matter in the influent and effluent of three different streams used in operation of the red stack while the es travelled through the red stack the doc decreased by 23 possibly due to the preferential degradation of nucleophilic and electrophilic organic components that were exposed to oxidation and reduction conditions in the electrode chambers anglada et al 2009 d angelo et al 2017 a decrease in doc was also observed for the lc from 4 4 mg l lc es influent to 3 4 mg l lc effluent during red stack operation whereas a corresponding increase of doc and suva was found for the hc effluent fig 3 suva has been used as an indicator of the humic content in water environmental systems ratpukdi et al 2010 and also been frequently employed to define the hydrophobicity of carbonaceous organic matter maeng et al 2018 in this study a significant increase in suva was found as the hc travelled through the red stack which was attributed to an approximate 5 fold increase in carbonaceous organic matter in the hc effluent meanwhile the lc showed a slight change in the suva despite a notable decrease in the doc indicating that the loss of organic compounds in the lc compartment was minimally correlated with their hydrophobicity fig 3 our results suggest the transport of organic matter from the lc wastewater effluent to the hc seawater compartment across the iems similar to previously reported observations of natural surface water as the dilute stream pawlowski et al 2016 fig 4 shows the variation of the molecular weight mw distributions of doc in the lc and hc more than 78 of doc in the lc was 1 kda this is similar to a previous study which showed that the organic acid fraction of wastewater effluent organic matter efom accounted for 14 36 of doc including 78 of efom 3 kda maeng et al 2015 the decrease of doc in the lc compartment fig 4 is attributed to loss of the organic fraction with mw between 0 5 and 5 kda which coincided with the observed increase in organic matter 5 kda in the hc effluent similarly the transport of low mw organic acids e g acetate through aems has been previously observed kim et al 2002 despite present knowledge and experience suggesting that the high mw components of nom should not pass through non porous iems thus the causes of organic transport are not clearly understood it is well known that efom is dominated by very small organic molecules including polysaccharides organic acids humic materials amino sugars proteins and cell components kim and dempsey 2008 the charge density of organic acids is generally much higher than that of organic base neutrals bose and reckhow 2007 thus it is expected that the anionic organic species in the lc can readily migrate toward the positively charged aems and may further adsorb onto the membrane surface with an opposite charge in contrast to the possible accumulation of organic acids on the surface of aems non charged and less mobile ionic components would be retained in the lc compartment unless the iems had inherent defects in their interior which could allow the penetration of solutes the fluorescence characteristics of the organic matter were consistent with observed variations in the doc and suva of organic matter in the different streams lc hc and es natural seawater showed negligible fluorescence signals fig 5 d typical fluorophores of efom were observed for the lc es influent fig 5a including humic like components a and c and tryptophan like components t1 and t2 and a pair of identical fluorescent components appeared in the hc effluent fig 5e due to the transport of fluorescent organic constituents from the lc to the hc compartment irrespective of the peak regions identified the intensities of all fluorescent components decreased by 24 26 for the lc and by 11 15 for the es which agree with the decrease in doc from each of the compartments in the red stack as discussed earlier in this section a potentially relevant observation was reported by kim et al 2017 they fractionated the organic matter components in urban surface water based on their hydrophobicity and acidity and showed that the removal of organic acids resulted in a significant decrease in the intensities of all fluorescent components here we discuss the relative benefits of using nom and efom for red stack operation humic substances are acidic and dark colored in nature thus they are typically linked to uv absorbance at 254 nm kingsbury et al 2017 reported that uv absorbing nom in the dilute compartment of a red stack was strongly associated with deteriorated membrane permselectivity and energy efficiency previous studies have shown that pristine nom contains significantly higher amounts of uv causing acidic organic fractions compared to that observed for efom kim and dempsey 2012 2013 such humic like substances with high uv absorptivity have also been most frequently implicated as the causes of fouling in low pressure membrane filtrations uf and mf it is worth noting that inconsistency in the reported causes of membrane fouling can occur due to the diversity and complexity of nom and efom in summary it appears that wastewater effluent is highly preferable for red stack operation compared to natural river water especially for minimizing the extent of organic matter transport through the aems 3 3 analysis of iems spacers and electrodes visual inspections were carried out after the post operation disassembly of the red stack unexpectedly membrane fouling did not appear to be serious as noted in section 3 1 the cems and spacers remained in their original condition quite clean without a noticeable fouling layer with regard to the aems the membrane color was altered and brownish but there were no notable layers on the membrane surfaces one issue and a possible reason for the elevated pressure in the lc chambers was the fluid inlet parts the woven spacers around the inlet part were clogged with fine particles which could be aggregates of certain constituents such as colloids in the pretreated wastewater effluent thinner spacers are required to deter the formation of a concentration polarization layer kim et al 2015 but the narrow inlet parts were surrounded by thin spacers with a small mesh spacer resulting in a pressure buildup in the inlet part caused by sieving of particles around the inlet the membrane and spacer surfaces were analyzed by sem eds to examine their morphologies and elemental compositions fig 6 there were some deposits on the surfaces but the iems were quite clean as its original structure could still be observed there were no intact microorganisms observed allowing us to eliminate any possibility of biofouling on both sides of the aem some deposits were observed but an element analysis showed a high carbon content without any divalent cations fig 6a on the other hand the deposits on both sides of the cem were a combination of carbon and ca and mg which were absorbed onto the cem or organic aggregates with divalent cations the main elements of these inorganics were mg with a trace of ca fig 6b in a previous study of a pilot scale red iron salts were used for the electrode rinse solution and the ph of the solution was maintained at 2 3 to avoid the precipitation of iron compounds tedesco et al 2016 in this study we used natural water wastewater effluent for the es and expected that there could be scale formation at the cathode due to the excessive presence of oh ions which favor the build up of scale jwa et al 2017 we initially supplied the es to the anode chamber to acidify the solution after which the acidified solution was flowed to the cathode in order to prevent a strong alkaline condition at the cathode however the ph of the es effluent from the cathode increased consistently during operation and eventually reached 11 3 in consequence all components in the cathode chamber underwent inorganic fouling fig 7 shows sem images and the element analysis results of the electrodes and spacers in the electrode chambers in contrast to the surface of the anode used here which was mainly pt the scaled cathode was covered with agglomerated deposits consisting of diverse structures with different sizes the spacers in the cathode chamber were clogged by inorganic precipitates while the spacer in the anode chamber was relatively clean fig 7c and d the main elements of these inorganics were mg with a trace of ca fig 7b the xrd results of the precipitates are shown in fig 8 and all xrd peaks are indexed and in good agreement with the standard mineral power diffraction files the xrd pattern contained peaks corresponding to brucite mg oh 2 the shielding membrane cem in the cathode chamber also underwent scale fouling fig 5c the cem surface facing the cathode was mostly covered with precipitates moreover as shown in the xrd results fig 8 the precipitates were mostly brucite 96 5 with some calcite 3 5 seawater was supplied to the chamber beside the electrode chamber and the ca2 and mg2 ions transferred to the electrode chamber through the cem formed precipitates due to the alkaline conditions in the cathode chamber additionally scale formation was difficult to control despite the acidified es supplied from the anode chamber 4 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this study presents the first practical demonstration of a pilot scale red fed with wastewater effluent and seawater this feed solution combination is applicable for a power plant located near a coastal area close to a wastewater treatment plant we quantitatively evaluated and characterized the behaviors of inorganic and organic solutes as expected a significant amount of monovalent ions accounted for the vast majority of ions transferred to the lc chamber but a considerable amount of multivalent ions were also transferred through the iems some organics with relatively low molecular weights passed through the iems and their hydrophobic properties elevated the suva level in the seawater an accurate identification of the organic matter transferred to the hc chamber as provided in this study is important when considering red integration with membrane based processes such as

19199,reverse electrodialysis red has vast potential as a clean nonpolluting and sustainable renewable energy source however pilot scale red studies employing real waters remain rare this study reports the largest red 1000 cell pairs 250 m2 with municipal wastewater effluent 1 3 5 7 ms cm and seawater 52 9 53 8 ms cm as feed solutions the red stack was operated at a velocity of 1 5 cm s and the pilot plant produced 95 8 w of power 0 38 w m2 total membrane or 0 76 w m2 cell pair during operation of the red the inlet design of the stack comprising thin spacers and the water dissociation reaction at the cathode were revealed as vulnerabilities of the stack specifically pressure drops at the fluid inlet parts had the most detrimental effects on power output due to clogged spacers around the inlet parts in addition precipitates resulting in inorganic fouling were inevitable during the water dissociation reaction due to significant potential generated by the stack in the cathode chamber na and cl accounted for the majority of ions transferred from seawater to wastewater effluent through ion exchange membranes iems moreover some divalent cations in seawater mg2 and ca2 were also transferred to the wastewater effluent some organics with relatively low molecular weights in the wastewater effluent passed through the iems and their hydrophobic properties elevated the specific uv absorbance suva level in the seawater keywords power generation reverse electrodialysis seawater salinity gradient wastewater effluent 1 introduction developing global energy from renewable energy sources is a key goal given the limited supply of fossil fuels unlike fossil fuels renewable sources of energy e g wind solar hydropower geothermal do not directly emit greenhouse gases sequeira and santos 2018 however renewable sources are not always feasible because their availability is closely related to the weather time of day climate and geographical location therefore we still need to find a renewable energy source that is easy to store and able to ensure a consistent supply when required recently reverse electrodialysis red which generates electricity using two solutions of different salinities has attracted substantial attention as a potential renewable energy source because the salinity gradient energy sge is clean nonpolluting and sustainable logan and elimelech 2012 mei and tang 2018 moreover this process is not affected by the weather time of day or climate conditions as it requires saline water it was thought that the sge production process may need to be located in a constrained environment on the coast however the need for ready access to seawater can be avoided by using alternative saline solutions made from a recyclable source such as ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 cusick et al 2012 nam et al 2012 due to such advantages red technology has made remarkable advances in areas such as fundamental studies experimental investigations and field demonstrations logan and elimelech 2012 yip et al 2016 yip and elimelech 2014 an red cell consists of an anode chamber a stack a series of membrane cells with alternating cation exchange membranes cems and anion exchange membranes aems and a cathode chamber kim et al 2015 in the stack both a high concentration hc solution and a low concentration lc solution are supplied to generate an ion flux and a potential difference is created by the difference in salinity between hc and lc solutions the electrodes in each chamber are used to convert the ion flux into an electrical current through reduction oxidation reactions in this case water splitting or reversible redox reactions chen et al 2017 scialdone et al 2012 tedesco et al 2017 many studies have been carried out in an effort to develop red technology mei and tang 2018 early studies were focused on ion exchange membranes iems capable of viable energy production in red applications improved stack designs suitable spacers and operational conditions tremendous advances in red performance capabilities have been reported with regard to the significant role of iems and uniquely tailored iems with low resistance high ionic conductivity and monovalent ion selectivity cho et al 2017 güler et al 2013 hong and chen 2014 hong et al 2015 kim et al 2015 the spacers between cems and aems are also an important component determining the red performance outcome as the concentration gradient in the boundary layer between the membrane surface and the bulk fluid affect the gross power moreover the geometric characteristics of the spacers are related to pressure drops which reduce the net power produced during the red process długołęcki et al 2010 gurreri et al 2016 conversely there have been several attempts to eliminate the use of spacers through the use of profiled membranes also known as patterned membranes an enhanced effective membrane surface area and the promotion of good fluid mixing under low hydraulic resistance have been achieved by the successful development of profiled membranes pawlowski et al 2017 operational parameters have been assessed to determine the optimal parameters to generate maximum power density a higher flow velocity was found to be advantageous as it reduces the overall resistance resulting in higher maximum power density however concerns remain because a higher flow velocity requires extra energy to feed the pumps leading to a decrease in the net power density tedesco et al 2015 an elevated temperature of the feed solutions has had a positive impact on red performance warmer solutions increased the feed conductivity facilitate ionic mobilities and reduce ohmic losses ultimately resulting in increased power density levels benneker et al 2018 despite these significant contributions and improvements in the performance of the red process so far it has predominantly been assessed using nacl solutions to mimic seawater brine solutions and river water with lab scale red systems recently several reports regarding the use of natural feed solutions or scaled up red processes have been published d angelo et al 2017 kingsbury et al 2017 luque di salvo et al 2018 tedesco et al 2017 luque di salvo et al 2018 used fish canning factory wastewater pre filtered with 5 μm cartridge filters as a high concentration solution hc and reclaimed water from an mbr membrane bioreactor pilot plant in a wastewater treatment plant a long run test was conducted with various flow velocities and chemical cleaning kingsbury et al 2017 tested different natural feedwater sources including seawater river water desalination brine saline wastewater from a pickling plant and treated wastewater and found that the presence of natural organic matter nom has a considerable impact on the power density both studies used a small scale red system with a single membrane active area of less than 10 10 cm2 with ten cell pairs of iems a pilot scale red system was initially reported by tedesco et al 2016 whereby 40 w 1 6 w m2 of cell pair from a 125 cell pair stack was achieved with brackish water and brine as feed solutions and iron salt fecl2 fecl3 as an electrode solution source the plant was later expanded by installing two additional 500 cell pair red systems for the purpose of constructing a 1 kw power plant tedesco et al 2017 although several studies have employed real waters no previous research has used wastewater effluent and seawater at the pilot scale this combination of real waters could be important for plants located on the coast because many wastewater treatment plants discharge into the ocean in this work we present a pilot scale red equipped with a 1000 cell pair stack total membrane area 250 m2 which is twice as large as previous studies in terms of the number of cell pairs tedesco et al 2017 ocean lava seawater was used as the high concentration solution hc and wastewater effluent from a sewage treatment plant located beside the sea in jeju korea was used as the low concentration solution lc wastewater effluent was also selected as an electrode rinse solution es to minimize costs remove the environmental impacts from using chemicals such as k4fe cn 6 k3fe cn 6 or fecl2 fecl3 and avoid scale and cl2 formation due to excess divalent cations and chloride ions in the seawater unlike previous attempts which focused on power production we predominantly evaluated the behavior of inorganic solutes in solution and natural organic matter nom in the wastewater effluent because a change in the quality of seawater at the outlet of the red stack could be a concern if it is reused for example if red is integrated with other processes such as reverse osmosis ro we also disassembled the red stack after operation and analyzed the iems spacers and electrode to determine the causes of operational vulnerability in our system 2 materials and methods 2 1 red pilot plant set up preparations for pilot plant operation the pilot scale red stack consisted of two end plates made of acrylic resin and 1000 cell pairs total membrane area 250 m2 fig 1 cems type i fujifilm manufacturing europe netherlands and aems type i fujifilm manufacturing europe netherlands were alternately stacked between the electrodes 432 mm 290 mm pt coated ti plates and shielding membranes adjacent to the anode the cathode electrodes were both cems each membrane was separated from the adjacent membrane by a gasket ptfe thickness 100 μm tommy hecco korea and a spacer thickness 100 μm open area 59 ds mesh korea in order to prevent contact between membranes and to provide a channel for the feed solutions between the shielding membrane cem and the electrode we used a different spacer thickness 0 5 mm sefar korea a picture of the stack is provided in fig s1 in order to characterize the feed solution constituents table 1 the feed water was sampled prior to the pretreatment processes online real time monitoring for ph and conductivity of the feed solutions was performed with sampling conducted twice a week for the analysis of other parameters each sample was analyzed in duplicate the average values obtained during operation are shown in table 1 the location of the red pilot plant is considered ideal because seawater the hc solution and domestic wastewater effluent the lc solution can be taken from a well under the plant and from a wastewater treatment plant located near the plant on the coast of jeju island respectively both the seawater and wastewater effluent are pretreated before being fed into the red stack raw seawater which is somewhat cleaner and requires only minor pretreatment was filtered with a 5 μm cartridge filter and stored in a buffer tank prior to being fed into the red stack the wastewater effluent was pretreated by dual media filtration dmf followed by a bag filter 50 μm and cartridge filters 5 μm the pretreated wastewater effluent was also stored in a buffer tank before being fed into the red stack due to the limited supply of wastewater effluent the red stack was operated intermittently 8 h per day for 12 days before beginning continuous operation of the red stack the maximum power density was obtained by varying the external resistances the external resistance where the maximum power density was obtained was loaded for the continuous operation after the 8 h operation the red stack was placed in a stand by condition without any procedures until operation of the stack was started again the following day the feed waters were supplied to the red at a flow

power density was approximately 0 38 w m2 total membrane 0 76 w m2 cell pair although a higher power density 1 6 w m2 cell pair was previously achieved from a unit cell due to a higher salinity ratio of feed waters with a stack equipped with 500 cell pairs fed with brackish water and brine tedesco et al 2016 2017 the power obtained from the stack with 1000 cell pairs in this study is the first obtained using solutions with lower salinity gradients wastewater effluent and seawater the energy efficiency η ranged from 11 4 to 13 3 which was higher than that obtained from the 500 cell pair red using brine and brackish water tedesco et al 2016 the lower power obtained in this study can be explained by the findings of previous reports it is often reported that multivalent ions in seawater are detrimental to power generation in a red system for example mg2 which is the most abundant cation in seawater after na inhibits the performance of the red system by increasing the resistance of the cem avci et al 2016 the presence of nom in the lc solution could also affect power generation because it typically lowers the effective salt concentration gradient by increasing the degree of concentration polarization near the membrane surface kingsbury et al 2017 at the start of operation the power was 74 1 w due to the higher salinity 5 7 ms cm of the lc influent fig 2b a concern during the initial phase was the pressure for both channels which started at 0 9 bar due to the supply of the natural solution fig 2c the conductivity of the lc influent was consistently lower on day 4 when maximum power was achieved on the day when the best performance was achieved the conductivities of the influents were 53 4 ms cm hc and 1 4 ms cm lc which changed to 45 3 ms cm hc and 10 2 ms cm lc at the outlet of the stack the maximum power then decreased to 62 7 w on the last day when operation had to be interrupted due to consistent pressure drops fig 2c this decrease in power indicates that some component impaired the process the conductivities of both effluents remained similar fig 2b meaning that the decrease in membrane performance was not significant as indicated in table 2 table 2 presents the physicochemical characteristics for virgin membranes and the membranes used here iecs and permselectivities were similar between the virgin and used membranes but slight increases in the electrical resistance of the used cem and aem were observed this could be due to adsorbed organics and divalent ions which can increase the resistance in iems as reported previously avci et al 2016 rijnaarts et al 2018 the temperature of the hc and lc influents decreased by 2 and 4 c respectively fig 2d however this decrease cannot be the main reason for the reduced power because the theoretical power is reduced by only approximately 1 when the temperature decreases by 2 4 c therefore we instead considered the performance of the electrodes as discussed in section 3 3 the cathode chamber was damaged by precipitates such as calcium carbonate ca2 hco3 oh caco3 h2o and magnesium hydroxide mg2 2oh mg oh 2 which formed due to the alkaline conditions caused by the cathodic reaction 2h2o 2e h2 2oh it has been reported that a high cathode ph is detrimental to hydrogen generation at cathodes in a low salinity solution in an electrolysis cell nam and logan 2012 and spacers clogged by precipitates at the cathode chamber could deteriorate the cathodic reaction by reducing the effective surface area of the electrode we discuss the precipitates further in section 3 3 3 2 characterization of inorganic and organic solutes the representative ion composition results day 4 show that na and cl accounted for the majority of ions transferred through the iems table 3 in addition some divalent cations mg2 and ca2 in this case were also transferred to the wastewater effluent so4 2 transfer was negligible as the concentration of so4 2 in the lc influent remained similar to that in the lc effluent in the electrode chamber the concentrations of na and cl were increased whereas those of other ions remained the same the reduced content of ions in the hc effluent could reduce the burden for subsequent processes for example if red is integrated with seawater reverse osmosis swro processes a hybrid red ro process the energy consumed during the swro process would be reduced due to the reduced salinity of seawater li et al 2013 fig 3 shows the mass concentration and hydrophobicity of carbonaceous organic matter in the influent and effluent of three different streams used in operation of the red stack while the es travelled through the red stack the doc decreased by 23 possibly due to the preferential degradation of nucleophilic and electrophilic organic components that were exposed to oxidation and reduction conditions in the electrode chambers anglada et al 2009 d angelo et al 2017 a decrease in doc was also observed for the lc from 4 4 mg l lc es influent to 3 4 mg l lc effluent during red stack operation whereas a corresponding increase of doc and suva was found for the hc effluent fig 3 suva has been used as an indicator of the humic content in water environmental systems ratpukdi et al 2010 and also been frequently employed to define the hydrophobicity of carbonaceous organic matter maeng et al 2018 in this study a significant increase in suva was found as the hc travelled through the red stack which was attributed to an approximate 5 fold increase in carbonaceous organic matter in the hc effluent meanwhile the lc showed a slight change in the suva despite a notable decrease in the doc indicating that the loss of organic compounds in the lc compartment was minimally correlated with their hydrophobicity fig 3 our results suggest the transport of organic matter from the lc wastewater effluent to the hc seawater compartment across the iems similar to previously reported observations of natural surface water as the dilute stream pawlowski et al 2016 fig 4 shows the variation of the molecular weight mw distributions of doc in the lc and hc more than 78 of doc in the lc was 1 kda this is similar to a previous study which showed that the organic acid fraction of wastewater effluent organic matter efom accounted for 14 36 of doc including 78 of efom 3 kda maeng et al 2015 the decrease of doc in the lc compartment fig 4 is attributed to loss of the organic fraction with mw between 0 5 and 5 kda which coincided with the observed increase in organic matter 5 kda in the hc effluent similarly the transport of low mw organic acids e g acetate through aems has been previously observed kim et al 2002 despite present knowledge and experience suggesting that the high mw components of nom should not pass through non porous iems thus the causes of organic transport are not clearly understood it is well known that efom is dominated by very small organic molecules including polysaccharides organic acids humic materials amino sugars proteins and cell components kim and dempsey 2008 the charge density of organic acids is generally much higher than that of organic base neutrals bose and reckhow 2007 thus it is expected that the anionic organic species in the lc can readily migrate toward the positively charged aems and may further adsorb onto the membrane surface with an opposite charge in contrast to the possible accumulation of organic acids on the surface of aems non charged and less mobile ionic components would be retained in the lc compartment unless the iems had inherent defects in their interior which could allow the penetration of solutes the fluorescence characteristics of the organic matter were consistent with observed variations in the doc and suva of organic matter in the different streams lc hc and es natural seawater showed negligible fluorescence signals fig 5 d typical fluorophores of efom were observed for the lc es influent fig 5a including humic like components a and c and tryptophan like components t1 and t2 and a pair of identical fluorescent components appeared in the hc effluent fig 5e due to the transport of fluorescent organic constituents from the lc to the hc compartment irrespective of the peak regions identified the intensities of all fluorescent components decreased by 24 26 for the lc and by 11 15 for the es which agree with the decrease in doc from each of the compartments in the red stack as discussed earlier in this section a potentially relevant observation was reported by kim et al 2017 they fractionated the organic matter components in urban surface water based on their hydrophobicity and acidity and showed that the removal of organic acids resulted in a significant decrease in the intensities of all fluorescent components here we discuss the relative benefits of using nom and efom for red stack operation humic substances are acidic and dark colored in nature thus they are typically linked to uv absorbance at 254 nm kingsbury et al 2017 reported that uv absorbing nom in the dilute compartment of a red stack was strongly associated with deteriorated membrane permselectivity and energy efficiency previous studies have shown that pristine nom contains significantly higher amounts of uv causing acidic organic fractions compared to that observed for efom kim and dempsey 2012 2013 such humic like substances with high uv absorptivity have also been most frequently implicated as the causes of fouling in low pressure membrane filtrations uf and mf it is worth noting that inconsistency in the reported causes of membrane fouling can occur due to the diversity and complexity of nom and efom in summary it appears that wastewater effluent is highly preferable for red stack operation compared to natural river water especially for minimizing the extent of organic matter transport through the aems 3 3 analysis of iems spacers and electrodes visual inspections were carried out after the post operation disassembly of the red stack unexpectedly membrane fouling did not appear to be serious as noted in section 3 1 the cems and spacers remained in their original condition quite clean without a noticeable fouling layer with regard to the aems the membrane color was altered and brownish but there were no notable layers on the membrane surfaces one issue and a possible reason for the elevated pressure in the lc chambers was the fluid inlet parts the woven spacers around the inlet part were clogged with fine particles which could be aggregates of certain constituents such as colloids in the pretreated wastewater effluent thinner spacers are required to deter the formation of a concentration polarization layer kim et al 2015 but the narrow inlet parts were surrounded by thin spacers with a small mesh spacer resulting in a pressure buildup in the inlet part caused by sieving of particles around the inlet the membrane and spacer surfaces were analyzed by sem eds to examine their morphologies and elemental compositions fig 6 there were some deposits on the surfaces but the iems were quite clean as its original structure could still be observed there were no intact microorganisms observed allowing us to eliminate any possibility of biofouling on both sides of the aem some deposits were observed but an element analysis showed a high carbon content without any divalent cations fig 6a on the other hand the deposits on both sides of the cem were a combination of carbon and ca and mg which were absorbed onto the cem or organic aggregates with divalent cations the main elements of these inorganics were mg with a trace of ca fig 6b in a previous study of a pilot scale red iron salts were used for the electrode rinse solution and the ph of the solution was maintained at 2 3 to avoid the precipitation of iron compounds tedesco et al 2016 in this study we used natural water wastewater effluent for the es and expected that there could be scale formation at the cathode due to the excessive presence of oh ions which favor the build up of scale jwa et al 2017 we initially supplied the es to the anode chamber to acidify the solution after which the acidified solution was flowed to the cathode in order to prevent a strong alkaline condition at the cathode however the ph of the es effluent from the cathode increased consistently during operation and eventually reached 11 3 in consequence all components in the cathode chamber underwent inorganic fouling fig 7 shows sem images and the element analysis results of the electrodes and spacers in the electrode chambers in contrast to the surface of the anode used here which was mainly pt the scaled cathode was covered with agglomerated deposits consisting of diverse structures with different sizes the spacers in the cathode chamber were clogged by inorganic precipitates while the spacer in the anode chamber was relatively clean fig 7c and d the main elements of these inorganics were mg with a trace of ca fig 7b the xrd results of the precipitates are shown in fig 8 and all xrd peaks are indexed and in good agreement with the standard mineral power diffraction files the xrd pattern contained peaks corresponding to brucite mg oh 2 the shielding membrane cem in the cathode chamber also underwent scale fouling fig 5c the cem surface facing the cathode was mostly covered with precipitates moreover as shown in the xrd results fig 8 the precipitates were mostly brucite 96 5 with some calcite 3 5 seawater was supplied to the chamber beside the electrode chamber and the ca2 and mg2 ions transferred to the electrode chamber through the cem formed precipitates due to the alkaline conditions in the cathode chamber additionally scale formation was difficult to control despite the acidified es supplied from the anode chamber 4 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this study presents the first practical demonstration of a pilot scale red fed with wastewater effluent and seawater this feed solution combination is applicable for a power plant located near a coastal area close to a wastewater treatment plant we quantitatively evaluated and characterized the behaviors of inorganic and organic solutes as expected a significant amount of monovalent ions accounted for the vast majority of ions transferred to the lc chamber but a considerable amount of multivalent ions were also transferred through the iems some organics with relatively low molecular weights passed through the iems and their hydrophobic properties elevated the suva level in the seawater an accurate identification of the organic matter transferred to the hc chamber as provided in this study is important when considering red integration with membrane based processes such as
