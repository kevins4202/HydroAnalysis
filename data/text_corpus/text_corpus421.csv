2105,snow is an important type of surface cover and an important freshwater resource in the arid regions of northwest china and optical satellites are an important means for monitoring variation in snow cover however the radiation values measured by satellite sensors are affected by cloud cover and cloud shadows thus the reconstruction of snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows becomes a bottleneck problem especially in mountains areas based on the digital elevation model dem in this paper an integrated method of snow cover reconstruction on sentinel 2 images is created by combining the improved snowl snow line algorithm considering unstable snow cover areas fmask cloud detection algorithms and the sen2cor clear sky snow cover detection tool with a geospatial processing platform gee google earth engine considering the babao river basin as the study area 474 sentinel 2 scenes 10 m were selected to obtain the snow cover spatiotemporal variations of 158 days from november 2016 to march 2021 compared with the high resolution gf 2 satellite images the integrated method can extract snow under clouds and cloud shadows well and the improved snowl algorithm improves the overall accuracy from 66 05 to 84 26 the experimental results show that approximately half of the babao river basin is unstable snow cover and areas above 3977 m are covered with snow for at least half a year keywords cloud detection sen2cor fmask snowl algorithm babao river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction snow cover is an important land cover type and one of the most active environmental factors in the cryosphere robinson et al 1993 wang 1999 zhang et al 2022 che et al 2019 due to the properties of high reflectance low thermal conductivity and snowmelt water effect snow cover plays vital roles in the global energy balance in hydrological and ecological models and climate change ault et al 2006 mccabe and wolock 2010 the distribution of snow cover in mountainous areas has strong spatial heterogeneity usually with more on the northern slope and less on the southern slope some researchers discussed the distribution law of snow cover in china based on meteorological observation data wei et al 2001 hao et al 2009 however it is difficult for traditional ground monitoring to the obtain large scale spatiotemporal variation characteristics of snow cover because most of the snow is distributed in inaccessible areas with harsh natural conditions and limited ground sites therefore satellite remote sensing has become an important means of extracting and monitoring high precision snow cover information because of its wide coverage short observation period and strong spatiotemporal continuity hall et al 2001 although microwave remote sensing can effectively detect snow cover properties such as snow water equivalent snow density etc optical remote sensing has more advantages in snow cover identification and its area variation research than microwave remote sensing due to the limitations of the latter such as penetration of snow cover especially dry snow zhang 1997 yu et al 2009 tedesco and narvekar 2010 since the 1960s many scholars have made useful explorations into snow cover identification with optical remote sensing images wang 1999 dozier 1989 proposed the concept of a snow cover index ndsi to distinguish snow cover from clouds and other types of land cover using the high reflectivity of snow in the green band 0 5 μm and the strong absorption in the shortwave infrared 1 6 μm hall et al 1995 developed a global snow cover mapping snomap algorithm based on ndsi to improve snow recognition accuracy nowadays both polar orbiting satellites and geostationary satellites have released a variety of high quality snow cover products for free for global users such as avhrr modis and meteosat msg terzago et al 2012 tong et al 2020 however in rugged terrain existing snow cover products are greatly limited on the one hand the spatial heterogeneity of snow distribution in mountainous areas is very strong and the images with coarse spatial resolution cannot describe the snow cover in detail on the other hand these images are often saturated with snow pixels especially on sun facing slopes zhang et al 2020 therefore high resolution remote sensing images with high radiometric resolution have become an important data source for snow cover identification in mountainous areas since 2008 high resolution satellite images such as those from landsat have been freely available to users worldwide making time series images convenient for snow cover monitoring the sentinel 2 a b s2 a b satellites launched by the esa european space agency in 2015 and 2017 also release images for free for global users compared with the landsat tm the s2 a b multi spectral instrument msi with higher spatial resolution 10 m 20 m 60 m higher temporal resolution 5 days higher radiometric resolution 12 bit and higher spectral resolution 13 bands has undoubtedly become an important data source for snow cover extraction and monitoring in mountainous areas wayand et al 2018 zhang and zhang 2020 however optical remote sensing images are easily affected by clouds and cloud shadows although the ndsi can distinguish most snow cover from clouds it cannot identify snow information blocked by clouds and the ndsi easily misidentifies cloud shadows and water as snow cover some studies have shown that nearly half of multispectral satellite data are affected by clouds and cloud shadows qiu 2018 zhang et al 2019 therefore how to reconstruct snow cover underlying clouds and cloud shadows based on sentinel 2 a b images has become the primary task of snow cover monitoring compared with surface objects clouds usually show dynamic changes on a time scale of minutes to hours and the frequency of observations from satellite images in one day is sufficient to identify snow cover under clouds qiao and zhang 2020 the snow cover products mod myd 10 a1 released by modis sensors mounted on the terra and aqua satellites are widely used in snow cover dynamic monitoring based on these products many scholars have carried out research on snow cover reconstruction under clouds which is mainly divided into four methods temporal filtering multi sensor synthesis spatial filtering and the snow line snowl cloud removal algorithm based on the digital elevation model dem riggs and hall 2002 parajka and bloschl 2008 gafurov and bárdossy 2009 gao et al 2010 parajka et al 2010 laba et al 2016 however the temporal filtering method requires a high temporal resolution the multi sensor synthesis method needs to integrate multiple images and the spatial filtering method will reduce the resolution the snowl algorithm proposed by parajka et al 2010 reclassifies the cloud pixels into snow or land cover pixels based on the position of the pixel relative to the elevation of the regional snow line which is more suitable for reconstructing snow cover under clouds for single phase sentinel 2 images with a low temporal resolution however the original snowl algorithm has the following three deficiencies when reconstructing snow cover underlying clouds and cloud shadows 1 by comparing the surface elevation corresponding to the cloud pixel with the average snow line elevation the cloud pixel is divided into snow and non snow pixels which does not consider the effects of the unstable snow cover areas li and mi 1983 in mountainous areas it means that pixels are not covered with snow all the time during the snow season due to various factors affecting snow melting such as slope aspect and solar radiation 2 the algorithm proposes snow cover extraction from coarse resolution images without considering the influence of cloud shadows but this cannot be ignored in high spatial resolutions such as in landsat and sentinel 2 images zhu et al 2010 he et al 2013 3 the snowl algorithm also requires a preprocessing step for cloud and cloud shadow detection therefore on one hand the snowl algorithm needs to be improved according to the previous two shortcomings on the other hand cloud and cloud shadow detection on images is the key to snow reconstruction at present the cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithms of single phase multi spectral sensors mainly include two types machine learning algorithms and spectral threshold detection methods based on features of cloud physics machine learning methods rely on the cloud and ground conditions of the training images and cannot be widely used in large scale scenarios huang et al 2010 qiu et al 2019 the spectral threshold detection algorithms can construct spectral indexes to automatically separate clouds cloud shadows and clear sky pixels which are the most widely used sun et al 2018 different from land cover clouds have the characteristics of whiteness coolness and brightness but cloud shadows have a fixed geometric projection relationship with the sun cloud sensor thus various cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithms are proposed such as sen2cor fmask tmask maja and lasrc sen2cor is an atmospheric correction software tool developed by the esa specifically for sentinel 2 which can effectively distinguish image pixels into clouds volumes clouds cloud shadows snow cover etc richter et al 2011 the fmask algorithm proposed by zhu and woodcock 2012 achieves an average overall accuracy of 96 4 for cloud and cloud shadow detection the tmask algorithm is a multi temporal cloud detection algorithm which is used to extract snow cover from multi temporal landsat images zhu and woodcock 2014 the maja method proposed by the french national spatial data center cnes can be widely used in landsat sentinel 2 and other satellite clouds and cloud shadow recognition but the detection results often contain overestimations tarrioa et al 2020 lasrc is a surface reflection inversion algorithm for single phase landsat 8 images which can extract cloud masks and cloud shadows during atmospheric correction vermote et al 2016 skakun et al 2019 tarrioa et al 2020 compared the above five widely used cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithms and found that sen2cor s detection ability for clouds and cloud shadows is weak but it is better for clear sky snow cover extraction in addition the fmask algorithm has a balanced effect in cloud and cloud shadow detection with high accuracy and a fast calculation speed and is used by usgs united states geological survey for landsat data processing the purpose of this research is to combine the improved snowl algorithms the fmask and sen2cor to reconstruct snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows on sentinel 2 images based on the google earth engine gee a cloud based platform for global geospatial data processing gorelick et al 2017 which is convenient for use in a time series analysis of snow cover spatial distribution the study is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area and data used section 3 describes the integrated approach to reconstructing snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows on images the results and discussion are presented in section 4 and section 5 respectively and the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the selected study area is located in the babao river basin in the northeastern of region of the qilian mountains in china and is widely covered by snow and glaciers li et al 2020 cai et al 2022 as shown in fig 1 the babao river basin is located between 100 06 00 101 09 05 e and 37 43 01 38 19 02 n is approximately 105 km in length and has an area of 2452 km2 it is surrounded by high mountains with a height difference greater than 2000 m and seasonal snow cover areas are widely distributed kang et al 2017 li et al 2020 the annual average temperature is approximately 4 2 c ning et al 2019 which is influenced by its typical continental alpine region climate and it has obvious continental and plateau climate characteristics due to the steep terrain and large altitude differences it is considered an ideal area for studying snow cover and permafrost hydrology in cold regions qi and luo 2007 kang et al 2017 2 2 data sources the gee platform not only enables to process analyze and visualize geographic data but also stores a large number of public geospatial datasets including satellite remote sensing images land cover climate prediction which is constantly updated every day as shown in table 1 four datasets including gf 2 sentinel 2 dem and daily average air temperature are used the latter three data are all from the gee data catalog https developers google com earth engine datasets 1 sentinel 2 a b level 1c l1c is an atmospheric top reflectivity product that has undergone geometric correction in order to extract snow cover seven bands are selected b2 blue b3 green b4 red b8 nir near infrared b10 cirrus b11 swir1 shortwave infrared 1 and b12 swir2 while the cirrus band b10 is used for cloud detection since three scenes of sentinel 2 images are required to cover the babao river basin 474 sentinel 2 images of 158 days were obtained from november 2016 to march 2021 which come from the gee 2 the gf 2 satellite is the first high resolution optical satellite independently developed by china with a 0 8 m panchromatic band and a 3 2 m multi spectral band two scenes of gf 2 satellite images were collected to verify the accuracy of the reconstructed snow cover and these are from a major special project of the state key laboratory of remote sensing science at the chinese academy of sciences institute of aerospace information science 3 the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem with a 30 m spatial resolution was provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and is also from the gee 4 era5 land is the land component of the ecmwf era5 climate reanalysis which can provide an accurate description of the climate of the past and the daily average air temperature 2 m is also provided by gee 3 methodology the reconstruction of the snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows in the sentinel 2 image is mainly divided into the following three steps as shown in fig 2 clouds and cloud shadow detection based on the fmask algorithm snow cover extraction of cloudless pixels based on sen2cor and reconstruction of the snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows using the improved snowl algorithm furthermore it is necessary to prepare the datasets of snow cover based on the gf 2 satellite for accuracy verification of snow cover extraction 3 1 cloud and cloud shadow detection cloud detection is carried out by separating cloud pixels from surface objects through band thresholds normalized difference vegetation index ndvi ndsi and other thresholds as shown in table 2 including potential cloud pixel detection using cloud spectrum testing and cloud probability calculation in this study the fmask version 3 2 zhu et al 2015 is introduced into the gee platform and modified because of the small area of water in the study area and the lack of thermal infrared bands in sentinel 2 images for detecting the cold feature of clouds first in order to distinguish clouds from ground objects with similar spectral characteristics potential cloud pixel detection should be carried out according to the physical characteristics of clouds such as whiteness brightness and coolness by constructing a series of specific spectral tests and corresponding thresholds as shown in table 2 the specific spectral tests mainly include five steps formulas the basic test the whiteness test the hot haze optimization transformation test the rock test and the cirrus test while the water test is not considered because of the very small water area in this study region these five spectral tests mainly use five of the sentinel 2 bands 2 blue 3 green 4 red 8 nir and 11 swir1 which have good separation effects between clouds and snow cover richter et al 2011 for the detailed principles methods and terms used in the formulas refer to zhu et al 2015 which will not be discussed here thus most of the thick cloud pixels can be detected through the five spectral index threshold tests mentioned above but some thin cloud pixels at the edge of the clouds are still not able to be recognized second the newly designed cloud probability and spectral change rate of the fmask algorithm is used to detect the remaining thin cloud pixels at the edge of the clouds qiu et al 2019 shown as table 2 after cloud detection is completed snow cover and cloud shadow identifications are performed to obtain the clear sky snow cover not blocked by clouds and the cloud shadow pixels respectively compared with general surface objects the spectral characteristics of snow cover under cloud shadows are obvious which can be extracted directly by using the spectral threshold method shown in the formula 8 sun et al 2018 especially for snow cover under thin cloud shadows therefore cloud shadow detection can be conducted using a more simplified two band threshold method instead of using the geometric projection relationship of the sun cloud sensor to detect cloud shadows 3 2 snow cover extraction according to whether the pixels of the satellite image are covered by clouds the snow cover extraction methods based on sentinel 2 are divided into two parts snow cover extraction in clear sky and snow cover extraction under clouds and cloud shadows the former uses the sen2cor tool provided by the esa for snow cover detection of cloudless pixels then based on the average elevation of snow cover pixels in clear sky snow cover pixels under clouds and cloud shadows are extracted using the improved snowl algorithm 3 2 1 snow cover extraction of cloudless pixels the sen2cor tool released by the esa official website provides the snow cover extraction algorithm for cloudless pixels as shown in formula 9 by setting four thresholds ndsi blue band near infrared band and the blue green band ratio threshold the snow distribution information in cloudless areas can be accurately extracted in sentinel 2 l1c images for the detailed principles of the method refer to the algorithm document richter et al 2011 9 ndsi 0 2 ρ n i r 0 15 ρ b l u e 0 28 ρ b l u e ρ red 0 85 3 2 2 improved snowl algorithm due to the limitations of the satellite revisit period this study uses the snowl algorithm suitable for single phase sentinel 2 images to reconstruct snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows in mountainous areas with complex topography however in addition to surface elevation many other factors will affect the accumulation and ablation of snow cover such as surface energy balance windward leeward position and slope aspect which all cause the strong spatial heterogeneity of snow cover tong et al 2009 therefore unstable snow cover areas are introduced into the snowl algorithm to correct the initial extraction results of snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows in mountains the improved snowl is divided into two steps first by comparing the elevation values of clouds and cloud shadows the pixels higher than the average snow line elevation are regarded as snow cover and the initial snow cover distribution under clouds and cloud shadows is obtained and the second step is to calculate days with snow cover based on the initial snow cover distribution for many years and determine the unstable snow cover areas below the threshold of days with snow cover li and mi 1983 defined the pixels with less than 60 days with snow cover in one year as the unstable snow cover areas in this study considering the five day revisit period of sentinel 2 22 days were used as the threshold to obtain the unstable snow cover area finally the snow cover pixels in the unstable snow cover areas are removed from the preliminarily extracted snow cover pixels under clouds and cloud shadows 3 3 verification datasets of snow cover extracted from gf 2 gf 2 images were selected to verify the snow cover extraction accuracy based on sentinel 2 thus requiring snow cover extraction based on gf 2 for the preparation of an accuracy verification dataset since gf 2 has three visible light bands and one near infrared band and lacks a swir1 band 1 6 um it is impossible to extract snow cover by constructing an ndsi at present there is little research on snow cover extraction methods based on gf 2 jiang et al 2019 proposed a snow cover identification method for zy 3 images where the pixels with reflectance in the near infrared band greater than 0 74 and an ndvi less than 0 were determined as snow cover which can be applied to gf 2 however experiments have found that this method underestimates the snow cover in the shadows of mountainous areas and cannot identify the snow cover with high reflectivity in high altitude areas therefore this study uses three visible light bands to detect snow cover in gf 2 images since snow cover shows bright and white characteristics in all visible light bands compared with other land covers when the average value of three visible light bands is greater than 0 21 snow cover can be effectively detected as shown in formula 10 10 m ea n v i s ρ red ρ green ρ blue 3 0 21 3 4 accuracy assessment method in this study the snow cover extracted from gf 2 satellite was used as the true value pixel to evaluate the effect of sentinel 2 snow cover extraction based on the confusion matrix or error matrix shown in table 3 five accuracy evaluation indexes are defined namely omission error l multi measurement error m overall accuracy o mapping accuracy s and user accuracy u their corresponding calculation formulas are shown as follows 11 l b b a 100 12 m c c d 100 13 o a d a b c d 100 14 s a a b 100 o r d d c 100 15 u a a c 100 o r d d b 100 4 results 4 1 cloudless snow cover detection and accuracy evaluation clear sky snow cover extraction based on sentinle 2 images is the basis of snow cover reconstruction under clouds and cloud shadows this study uses gf 2 data at e100 8 n37 9 on 23 march 2020 to detect snow cover to verify sen2cor s ability to detect snow cover in sentinel 2 data where the sentinel 2 data is from the same day with a track number of 47spc as shown in fig 3 compared with the gf 2 image and its snow cover the snow cover from the sentinel 2 image has very similar spatial distribution characteristics and the accuracy evaluation results are shown in table 4 the overall accuracy rate is 87 98 indicating that sen2cor can correctly classify 87 98 of the pixels in the image the user accuracy of snow pixels is 74 38 which means that when sen2cor detects snow pixels in the sentinel 2 image the probability that the same location in the gf 2 image is also a snow pixel is 74 38 the mapping accuracy is 76 40 indicating that the probability that sen2cor can correctly classify sentinel 2 images as snow pixels is 76 40 the calculation shows that the kappa coefficient is 0 67 illustrating that the snow cover detected by sen2cor and the snow cover detected by the gf 2 data are highly consistent in spatial distribution in addition the snow cover area sca is an important indicator for accuracy evaluation in the area shown in fig 3 the sca on march 23 2020 extracted from sentinel 2 is 99 78 km2 while that extracted from gf 2 is 97 13 km2 the ratio of the sca extracted from two satellite images was 102 72 indicating that sen2cor is used to detect the snow cover in sentinel 2 data with high accuracy 4 2 cloud and cloud shadow detection effects in order to evaluate the detection results of clouds with different thicknesses and their shadows on different types of land cover two cloud covered images were selected from 8 may 2019 and 4 november 2019 to avoid misjudging the dark land cover as a cloud shadow it is generally necessary to compare the results with the dynamic world class a 10 m near real time nrt land use land cover lulc dataset provided by gee the original sentinel 2 image in fig 4 a shows that the land surface is covered by scattered thick clouds and the surface objects in the gaps of the clouds are snow cover with similar spectral characteristics to the clouds on may 8 2019 the cloud detection results in fig 4 b show that the fmask algorithm has a strong ability to detect thick clouds and can separate clouds and snow cover well the surface objects in the original image in fig 4 d are covered by thin clouds on november 4 2019 the terrain of the area is flat and its surface is covered with a single surface and no snow cover as the thin cloud has strong radiation transmittance the cloud pixel contains more ground object information which makes it difficult to detect and more thin cloud pixels are missed in general the fmask algorithm is more accurate for detecting thick clouds and their shadows in sentinel 2 images and there are omissions when detecting thin cloud pixels however due to the high reflection characteristics of snow cover some thin clouds and their shadows do not affect the detection of snow cover 4 3 improved snowl algorithm results and accuracy evaluation in order to evaluate the extraction accuracy of snow cover under clouds the clear sky gf 2 image e100 3 n38 1 one day apart from the date of the sentinel 2 data was selected for comparison as shown in fig 5 c using the cloud and cloud shadow obtained from sentinel 2 as a mask the snow cover on the gf 2 cloudless image was extracted with this boundary and used to verify the snow cover reconstruction accuracy of the cloud and the cloud shadow comparing the spatial distribution of clear sky snow in the image and during this period no snowfall occurred and almost no snow melted the sentinel 2 image is shown in false color fig 5 d and there is a small amount of cloud cover over the snow area on march 21 2020 comparing the gf 2 snow map on march 23 2020 fig 5 b the cloud free snow map obtained by the original snowl algorithm and the improved snowl algorithm fig 5 e and g it can be seen that in the cloud free snow map obtained by the original snowl algorithm there is an overestimation phenomenon in the snow cover in the mountainous areas in addition the cloudless snow map obtained by the improved snowl algorithm is more like the gf 2 snow cover map and contains more mountainous details as shown in table 5 this study uses the error matrix to quantitatively analyze the superiority of the improved snowl algorithm in extracting snow cover under clouds the multi measurement error of the original snowl algorithm is 46 38 which is the main thing that affects the overall accuracy by combining the unstable snow cover area in the study area to improve the snowl algorithm the multi measurement error is reduced to 9 22 and the overall accuracy is improved from 66 42 to 84 26 among them a total of 131 days of clear sky images from november 2016 to march 2021 were selected for snow cover detection and superimposed to obtain the days with snow cover thus extract the unstable snow area however the omission error has increased from 5 38 for the original algorithm to 25 68 which shows that the improved snowl algorithm is relatively conservative it is well known that the aspect and elevation are important factors affecting snow cover distribution in mountainous areas therefore it is necessary to further analyze the accuracy of the improved snowl snow extraction algorithm from aspect and elevation based on table 5 to facilitate the analysis the aspect is divided into five categories flat surface shady slope semi shady slope sunny slope and semi sunny slope shown as in table 6 it can be seen that the snow cover extraction accuracy in flat surface and shady slope is the highest and their user accuracy mapping accuracy and overall accuracy are all above 79 followed by semi shady slope the sunny slope has the worst snow recognition accuracy which may be due to the fact that it is located in the unstable snow cover area and the snow ablation changes rapidly while the gf 2 image used for accuracy validation was obtained after two days as shown in table 7 the terrain was roughly divided into 6 elevation zones according to the 200 m elevation difference interval and the snow extraction accuracy of each elevation zone was obtained based on the improved snowl algorithm with the increase of elevation the mapping accuracy increases linearly and the user accuracy also increases with increasing elevation but is slightly decreased in the last elevation zone similarly the reason for the poor accuracy of snow cover extraction in the low elevation zones melted rapidly for snow cover may be related to the time difference of satellite data acquisition between gf 2 and sentinel 2 4 4 spatiotemporal variation characteristics of snow cover distribution the snow cover ratio scr is the ratio of snow cover in a designated area to the total area in order to reflect the changes in the snow cover rate of the babao river basin a hydrological year 1 september to 30 august of the following year is used as a unit to divide 4 november 2016 to 11 march 2021 and to analyze the changing trend of scr over the past five years among them september november is defined as autumn december february is defined as winter march may is defined as spring and june august is defined as summer formula 12 is used to calculate the snow cover rate 16 scr s snow s all 100 where s snow is the area covered by snow and s all represents the entire area of the babao river basin the change in the scr in the babao river basin over the past five years is shown in fig 6 a total of 158 days of images could be obtained for snow cover of which 27 days of images are due to cloud cover using an improved snowl algorithm providing approximately 17 of the images in this time series study there are obvious differences in the snow cover rate between the hydrological years of the babao river basin due to the limitation of the sentinrl 2 temporal resolution 10 days at that time and the influence of cloud cover the number of available images from november 2016 to august 2017 was small since the second hydrological year the number of available images has increased significantly due to the supplementation of sentinrl 2b satellite images which is beneficial for time series snow cover change analysis comparing the fluctuation trend of scr in various hydrological years it can be seen that the fluctuation degree of scr has increased year by year during the three hydrological years from 2017 to 2020 and there are different periods of concentrated snowfall in each hydrological year the snow cover in the hydrological year from september 2017 to august 2018 was generally less and the large scale snow cover in the basin mainly occurred in spring after entering the summer the snow melted rapidly and no snowfall occurred the distribution of snow cover from september 2018 to august 2019 was similar to that of the previous hydrological year snowfall mainly occurred in winter and spring in this hydrological year and the snow coverage and snowfall frequency increased compared with the previous hydrological year from september 2019 to august of the following year 13 of the 40 days images used the improved snowl algorithm to reconstruct their clouds and snow under cloud shadows compared with the same period in previous years the hydrological year has abundant snowfall and the date of large scale snow cover is earlier from october 2019 to march of the following year the scr exceeded 50 with large fluctuations fig 7 describes in detail the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of snow cover changes in this hydrological year and variation of snow cover area has a large fluctuation to further analyze the reasons for the rapid change in snow cover we obtained the daily average air temperature changes of the basin from the era5 land dataset in gee as shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the change trend of snow area is consistent with the daily average air temperature at the same time the improved snowl method can reconstruct snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows with high accuracy which can provide basic data for monitoring snow cover changes 4 5 spatial distribution characteristics of days with snow cover within a hydrological year the study area can be divided into stable snow area and unstable snow area according to the length of snow cover time with 60 days as the threshold li et al 1983 this study uses 158 days of images to analyze the spatial distribution of days with snow cover in the babao river basin over the past five years considering that the time resolution of sentinel 2 data is 5 days this study uses 22 days as the threshold to obtain the unstable snow area from the perspective of the spatial distribution of days with snow cover in the babao river basin fig 9 the unstable snow cover areas in the basin are mainly light blue and are mainly distributed in the valley areas of the babao river basin accounting for 49 82 of the basin area with an average altitude of 3396 m the area with more than 79 days with snow cover accounts for 13 06 of the basin area with an average elevation of 4034 m these areas are distributed in the northernmost and southeastern parts of the basin indicating that they are covered with snow for at least half a year each year 5 discussion 5 1 compare gf 2 data snow detection methods currently there are few related studies on snow cover detection based on gf 2 data jiang et al 2019 combined the near infrared band and the normalized difference vegetable index ndvi and proposed a decision tree based snow extraction method experiments have found that this method underestimates the snow in the shadows of the mountain fig 10 e and cannot identify the snow with high reflectivity in high altitude areas fig 10 b therefore this study needs to solve the issues of using gf 2 data to detect snow cover the babao river basin has complex terrain and large areas of snow cover on the surface fig 10 the average value of the visible light band meanvis is used to extract the snow and the scatter plot tool in envi 5 3 is used to select the snow critical point experiments show that in this study area when meanvis is greater than 0 21 the snow in the image can be effectively extracted comparing the two methods it is found that meanvis has a higher accuracy in extracting snow in this area at the same time the underestimation of snow detection in the shadow areas of mountains has also been greatly improved fig 10 b and c and this method can also accurately extract snow in high altitude areas fig 10 e and f 5 2 the impact of improvements on the snowl algorithm the original snowl algorithm combines dem data to calculate the expected snow line and redefines the cloud pixels above the snow line height as snow pixels however due to the influence of terrain wind solar radiation and other factors the speed of snow melting in some areas has been accelerated and the number of snowfall days in these areas has been reduced this study uses all clear sky images of the babao river basin to calculate and remove unstable snow areas in the study area to improve the accuracy of the snowl algorithm due to the strong spatial heterogeneity of snow distribution in mountainous areas it is inevitable that errors will occur if a unified unstable snow cover area is used in the study area to eliminate factors that affect the snowmelt speed therefore in follow up research we will consider using the dynamic unstable snow area to adapt to the snow distribution in different periods and further improve the accuracy of the snowl algorithm when there are fewer clear sky snow pixels in the image its average elevation has greater uncertainty which will further affect the accuracy of snow extraction under clouds therefore in practical applications an image with a large number of clear sky and snow pixels should be selected as much as possible to ensure the accuracy of snow reconstruction 5 3 insufficient accuracy validation the gf 2 data used for accuracy evaluation must not only have a high spatial resolution but it must also avoid the impact of cloud cover and its date must be close to the date of the sentinel 2 data therefore it is difficult to obtain gf 2 verification data that meets the verification conditions unmanned aerial vehicles uavs are not affected by clouds when acquiring ground information and can be used to verify the accuracy of snow reconstruction in subsequent studies 6 conclusions snow cover is an important input parameter for climate and hydrological models in mountainous and seasonal snow covered regions and it has become one of the most important components of climate change research while remote sensing monitoring has also become an important means of snow cover research however clouds will inevitably have an impact on the process of optical remote sensing to detect surface information this study improved the snowl algorithm to make it suitable for sentinel 2 images with a high spatial resolution the improved snowl algorithm is based on the original snowl algorithm and combines the unstable snow area in the study area to eliminate the influence of terrain wind solar radiation and other factors on the spatial distribution of snow cover based on the improved snowl algorithm the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of snow distribution in the babao river basin over the past five years are analyzed in the 158 days of images the improved snowl algorithm provided approximately 17 of the data the scr temporal and spatial variation research shows that there are significant differences in snow cover in different hydrological years in the babao river basin the time period of concentrated snowfall varies in different hydrological years at the same time the start date of snow cover has been advancing year by year analyzing the spatial distribution of snow days in the babao river basin it is found that approximately half of the areas in the basin are unstable snow areas these areas are mainly distributed in valley areas and the areas over 3977 m above sea level are covered by snow for at least half

2105,snow is an important type of surface cover and an important freshwater resource in the arid regions of northwest china and optical satellites are an important means for monitoring variation in snow cover however the radiation values measured by satellite sensors are affected by cloud cover and cloud shadows thus the reconstruction of snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows becomes a bottleneck problem especially in mountains areas based on the digital elevation model dem in this paper an integrated method of snow cover reconstruction on sentinel 2 images is created by combining the improved snowl snow line algorithm considering unstable snow cover areas fmask cloud detection algorithms and the sen2cor clear sky snow cover detection tool with a geospatial processing platform gee google earth engine considering the babao river basin as the study area 474 sentinel 2 scenes 10 m were selected to obtain the snow cover spatiotemporal variations of 158 days from november 2016 to march 2021 compared with the high resolution gf 2 satellite images the integrated method can extract snow under clouds and cloud shadows well and the improved snowl algorithm improves the overall accuracy from 66 05 to 84 26 the experimental results show that approximately half of the babao river basin is unstable snow cover and areas above 3977 m are covered with snow for at least half a year keywords cloud detection sen2cor fmask snowl algorithm babao river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction snow cover is an important land cover type and one of the most active environmental factors in the cryosphere robinson et al 1993 wang 1999 zhang et al 2022 che et al 2019 due to the properties of high reflectance low thermal conductivity and snowmelt water effect snow cover plays vital roles in the global energy balance in hydrological and ecological models and climate change ault et al 2006 mccabe and wolock 2010 the distribution of snow cover in mountainous areas has strong spatial heterogeneity usually with more on the northern slope and less on the southern slope some researchers discussed the distribution law of snow cover in china based on meteorological observation data wei et al 2001 hao et al 2009 however it is difficult for traditional ground monitoring to the obtain large scale spatiotemporal variation characteristics of snow cover because most of the snow is distributed in inaccessible areas with harsh natural conditions and limited ground sites therefore satellite remote sensing has become an important means of extracting and monitoring high precision snow cover information because of its wide coverage short observation period and strong spatiotemporal continuity hall et al 2001 although microwave remote sensing can effectively detect snow cover properties such as snow water equivalent snow density etc optical remote sensing has more advantages in snow cover identification and its area variation research than microwave remote sensing due to the limitations of the latter such as penetration of snow cover especially dry snow zhang 1997 yu et al 2009 tedesco and narvekar 2010 since the 1960s many scholars have made useful explorations into snow cover identification with optical remote sensing images wang 1999 dozier 1989 proposed the concept of a snow cover index ndsi to distinguish snow cover from clouds and other types of land cover using the high reflectivity of snow in the green band 0 5 μm and the strong absorption in the shortwave infrared 1 6 μm hall et al 1995 developed a global snow cover mapping snomap algorithm based on ndsi to improve snow recognition accuracy nowadays both polar orbiting satellites and geostationary satellites have released a variety of high quality snow cover products for free for global users such as avhrr modis and meteosat msg terzago et al 2012 tong et al 2020 however in rugged terrain existing snow cover products are greatly limited on the one hand the spatial heterogeneity of snow distribution in mountainous areas is very strong and the images with coarse spatial resolution cannot describe the snow cover in detail on the other hand these images are often saturated with snow pixels especially on sun facing slopes zhang et al 2020 therefore high resolution remote sensing images with high radiometric resolution have become an important data source for snow cover identification in mountainous areas since 2008 high resolution satellite images such as those from landsat have been freely available to users worldwide making time series images convenient for snow cover monitoring the sentinel 2 a b s2 a b satellites launched by the esa european space agency in 2015 and 2017 also release images for free for global users compared with the landsat tm the s2 a b multi spectral instrument msi with higher spatial resolution 10 m 20 m 60 m higher temporal resolution 5 days higher radiometric resolution 12 bit and higher spectral resolution 13 bands has undoubtedly become an important data source for snow cover extraction and monitoring in mountainous areas wayand et al 2018 zhang and zhang 2020 however optical remote sensing images are easily affected by clouds and cloud shadows although the ndsi can distinguish most snow cover from clouds it cannot identify snow information blocked by clouds and the ndsi easily misidentifies cloud shadows and water as snow cover some studies have shown that nearly half of multispectral satellite data are affected by clouds and cloud shadows qiu 2018 zhang et al 2019 therefore how to reconstruct snow cover underlying clouds and cloud shadows based on sentinel 2 a b images has become the primary task of snow cover monitoring compared with surface objects clouds usually show dynamic changes on a time scale of minutes to hours and the frequency of observations from satellite images in one day is sufficient to identify snow cover under clouds qiao and zhang 2020 the snow cover products mod myd 10 a1 released by modis sensors mounted on the terra and aqua satellites are widely used in snow cover dynamic monitoring based on these products many scholars have carried out research on snow cover reconstruction under clouds which is mainly divided into four methods temporal filtering multi sensor synthesis spatial filtering and the snow line snowl cloud removal algorithm based on the digital elevation model dem riggs and hall 2002 parajka and bloschl 2008 gafurov and bárdossy 2009 gao et al 2010 parajka et al 2010 laba et al 2016 however the temporal filtering method requires a high temporal resolution the multi sensor synthesis method needs to integrate multiple images and the spatial filtering method will reduce the resolution the snowl algorithm proposed by parajka et al 2010 reclassifies the cloud pixels into snow or land cover pixels based on the position of the pixel relative to the elevation of the regional snow line which is more suitable for reconstructing snow cover under clouds for single phase sentinel 2 images with a low temporal resolution however the original snowl algorithm has the following three deficiencies when reconstructing snow cover underlying clouds and cloud shadows 1 by comparing the surface elevation corresponding to the cloud pixel with the average snow line elevation the cloud pixel is divided into snow and non snow pixels which does not consider the effects of the unstable snow cover areas li and mi 1983 in mountainous areas it means that pixels are not covered with snow all the time during the snow season due to various factors affecting snow melting such as slope aspect and solar radiation 2 the algorithm proposes snow cover extraction from coarse resolution images without considering the influence of cloud shadows but this cannot be ignored in high spatial resolutions such as in landsat and sentinel 2 images zhu et al 2010 he et al 2013 3 the snowl algorithm also requires a preprocessing step for cloud and cloud shadow detection therefore on one hand the snowl algorithm needs to be improved according to the previous two shortcomings on the other hand cloud and cloud shadow detection on images is the key to snow reconstruction at present the cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithms of single phase multi spectral sensors mainly include two types machine learning algorithms and spectral threshold detection methods based on features of cloud physics machine learning methods rely on the cloud and ground conditions of the training images and cannot be widely used in large scale scenarios huang et al 2010 qiu et al 2019 the spectral threshold detection algorithms can construct spectral indexes to automatically separate clouds cloud shadows and clear sky pixels which are the most widely used sun et al 2018 different from land cover clouds have the characteristics of whiteness coolness and brightness but cloud shadows have a fixed geometric projection relationship with the sun cloud sensor thus various cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithms are proposed such as sen2cor fmask tmask maja and lasrc sen2cor is an atmospheric correction software tool developed by the esa specifically for sentinel 2 which can effectively distinguish image pixels into clouds volumes clouds cloud shadows snow cover etc richter et al 2011 the fmask algorithm proposed by zhu and woodcock 2012 achieves an average overall accuracy of 96 4 for cloud and cloud shadow detection the tmask algorithm is a multi temporal cloud detection algorithm which is used to extract snow cover from multi temporal landsat images zhu and woodcock 2014 the maja method proposed by the french national spatial data center cnes can be widely used in landsat sentinel 2 and other satellite clouds and cloud shadow recognition but the detection results often contain overestimations tarrioa et al 2020 lasrc is a surface reflection inversion algorithm for single phase landsat 8 images which can extract cloud masks and cloud shadows during atmospheric correction vermote et al 2016 skakun et al 2019 tarrioa et al 2020 compared the above five widely used cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithms and found that sen2cor s detection ability for clouds and cloud shadows is weak but it is better for clear sky snow cover extraction in addition the fmask algorithm has a balanced effect in cloud and cloud shadow detection with high accuracy and a fast calculation speed and is used by usgs united states geological survey for landsat data processing the purpose of this research is to combine the improved snowl algorithms the fmask and sen2cor to reconstruct snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows on sentinel 2 images based on the google earth engine gee a cloud based platform for global geospatial data processing gorelick et al 2017 which is convenient for use in a time series analysis of snow cover spatial distribution the study is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area and data used section 3 describes the integrated approach to reconstructing snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows on images the results and discussion are presented in section 4 and section 5 respectively and the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the selected study area is located in the babao river basin in the northeastern of region of the qilian mountains in china and is widely covered by snow and glaciers li et al 2020 cai et al 2022 as shown in fig 1 the babao river basin is located between 100 06 00 101 09 05 e and 37 43 01 38 19 02 n is approximately 105 km in length and has an area of 2452 km2 it is surrounded by high mountains with a height difference greater than 2000 m and seasonal snow cover areas are widely distributed kang et al 2017 li et al 2020 the annual average temperature is approximately 4 2 c ning et al 2019 which is influenced by its typical continental alpine region climate and it has obvious continental and plateau climate characteristics due to the steep terrain and large altitude differences it is considered an ideal area for studying snow cover and permafrost hydrology in cold regions qi and luo 2007 kang et al 2017 2 2 data sources the gee platform not only enables to process analyze and visualize geographic data but also stores a large number of public geospatial datasets including satellite remote sensing images land cover climate prediction which is constantly updated every day as shown in table 1 four datasets including gf 2 sentinel 2 dem and daily average air temperature are used the latter three data are all from the gee data catalog https developers google com earth engine datasets 1 sentinel 2 a b level 1c l1c is an atmospheric top reflectivity product that has undergone geometric correction in order to extract snow cover seven bands are selected b2 blue b3 green b4 red b8 nir near infrared b10 cirrus b11 swir1 shortwave infrared 1 and b12 swir2 while the cirrus band b10 is used for cloud detection since three scenes of sentinel 2 images are required to cover the babao river basin 474 sentinel 2 images of 158 days were obtained from november 2016 to march 2021 which come from the gee 2 the gf 2 satellite is the first high resolution optical satellite independently developed by china with a 0 8 m panchromatic band and a 3 2 m multi spectral band two scenes of gf 2 satellite images were collected to verify the accuracy of the reconstructed snow cover and these are from a major special project of the state key laboratory of remote sensing science at the chinese academy of sciences institute of aerospace information science 3 the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem with a 30 m spatial resolution was provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and is also from the gee 4 era5 land is the land component of the ecmwf era5 climate reanalysis which can provide an accurate description of the climate of the past and the daily average air temperature 2 m is also provided by gee 3 methodology the reconstruction of the snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows in the sentinel 2 image is mainly divided into the following three steps as shown in fig 2 clouds and cloud shadow detection based on the fmask algorithm snow cover extraction of cloudless pixels based on sen2cor and reconstruction of the snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows using the improved snowl algorithm furthermore it is necessary to prepare the datasets of snow cover based on the gf 2 satellite for accuracy verification of snow cover extraction 3 1 cloud and cloud shadow detection cloud detection is carried out by separating cloud pixels from surface objects through band thresholds normalized difference vegetation index ndvi ndsi and other thresholds as shown in table 2 including potential cloud pixel detection using cloud spectrum testing and cloud probability calculation in this study the fmask version 3 2 zhu et al 2015 is introduced into the gee platform and modified because of the small area of water in the study area and the lack of thermal infrared bands in sentinel 2 images for detecting the cold feature of clouds first in order to distinguish clouds from ground objects with similar spectral characteristics potential cloud pixel detection should be carried out according to the physical characteristics of clouds such as whiteness brightness and coolness by constructing a series of specific spectral tests and corresponding thresholds as shown in table 2 the specific spectral tests mainly include five steps formulas the basic test the whiteness test the hot haze optimization transformation test the rock test and the cirrus test while the water test is not considered because of the very small water area in this study region these five spectral tests mainly use five of the sentinel 2 bands 2 blue 3 green 4 red 8 nir and 11 swir1 which have good separation effects between clouds and snow cover richter et al 2011 for the detailed principles methods and terms used in the formulas refer to zhu et al 2015 which will not be discussed here thus most of the thick cloud pixels can be detected through the five spectral index threshold tests mentioned above but some thin cloud pixels at the edge of the clouds are still not able to be recognized second the newly designed cloud probability and spectral change rate of the fmask algorithm is used to detect the remaining thin cloud pixels at the edge of the clouds qiu et al 2019 shown as table 2 after cloud detection is completed snow cover and cloud shadow identifications are performed to obtain the clear sky snow cover not blocked by clouds and the cloud shadow pixels respectively compared with general surface objects the spectral characteristics of snow cover under cloud shadows are obvious which can be extracted directly by using the spectral threshold method shown in the formula 8 sun et al 2018 especially for snow cover under thin cloud shadows therefore cloud shadow detection can be conducted using a more simplified two band threshold method instead of using the geometric projection relationship of the sun cloud sensor to detect cloud shadows 3 2 snow cover extraction according to whether the pixels of the satellite image are covered by clouds the snow cover extraction methods based on sentinel 2 are divided into two parts snow cover extraction in clear sky and snow cover extraction under clouds and cloud shadows the former uses the sen2cor tool provided by the esa for snow cover detection of cloudless pixels then based on the average elevation of snow cover pixels in clear sky snow cover pixels under clouds and cloud shadows are extracted using the improved snowl algorithm 3 2 1 snow cover extraction of cloudless pixels the sen2cor tool released by the esa official website provides the snow cover extraction algorithm for cloudless pixels as shown in formula 9 by setting four thresholds ndsi blue band near infrared band and the blue green band ratio threshold the snow distribution information in cloudless areas can be accurately extracted in sentinel 2 l1c images for the detailed principles of the method refer to the algorithm document richter et al 2011 9 ndsi 0 2 ρ n i r 0 15 ρ b l u e 0 28 ρ b l u e ρ red 0 85 3 2 2 improved snowl algorithm due to the limitations of the satellite revisit period this study uses the snowl algorithm suitable for single phase sentinel 2 images to reconstruct snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows in mountainous areas with complex topography however in addition to surface elevation many other factors will affect the accumulation and ablation of snow cover such as surface energy balance windward leeward position and slope aspect which all cause the strong spatial heterogeneity of snow cover tong et al 2009 therefore unstable snow cover areas are introduced into the snowl algorithm to correct the initial extraction results of snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows in mountains the improved snowl is divided into two steps first by comparing the elevation values of clouds and cloud shadows the pixels higher than the average snow line elevation are regarded as snow cover and the initial snow cover distribution under clouds and cloud shadows is obtained and the second step is to calculate days with snow cover based on the initial snow cover distribution for many years and determine the unstable snow cover areas below the threshold of days with snow cover li and mi 1983 defined the pixels with less than 60 days with snow cover in one year as the unstable snow cover areas in this study considering the five day revisit period of sentinel 2 22 days were used as the threshold to obtain the unstable snow cover area finally the snow cover pixels in the unstable snow cover areas are removed from the preliminarily extracted snow cover pixels under clouds and cloud shadows 3 3 verification datasets of snow cover extracted from gf 2 gf 2 images were selected to verify the snow cover extraction accuracy based on sentinel 2 thus requiring snow cover extraction based on gf 2 for the preparation of an accuracy verification dataset since gf 2 has three visible light bands and one near infrared band and lacks a swir1 band 1 6 um it is impossible to extract snow cover by constructing an ndsi at present there is little research on snow cover extraction methods based on gf 2 jiang et al 2019 proposed a snow cover identification method for zy 3 images where the pixels with reflectance in the near infrared band greater than 0 74 and an ndvi less than 0 were determined as snow cover which can be applied to gf 2 however experiments have found that this method underestimates the snow cover in the shadows of mountainous areas and cannot identify the snow cover with high reflectivity in high altitude areas therefore this study uses three visible light bands to detect snow cover in gf 2 images since snow cover shows bright and white characteristics in all visible light bands compared with other land covers when the average value of three visible light bands is greater than 0 21 snow cover can be effectively detected as shown in formula 10 10 m ea n v i s ρ red ρ green ρ blue 3 0 21 3 4 accuracy assessment method in this study the snow cover extracted from gf 2 satellite was used as the true value pixel to evaluate the effect of sentinel 2 snow cover extraction based on the confusion matrix or error matrix shown in table 3 five accuracy evaluation indexes are defined namely omission error l multi measurement error m overall accuracy o mapping accuracy s and user accuracy u their corresponding calculation formulas are shown as follows 11 l b b a 100 12 m c c d 100 13 o a d a b c d 100 14 s a a b 100 o r d d c 100 15 u a a c 100 o r d d b 100 4 results 4 1 cloudless snow cover detection and accuracy evaluation clear sky snow cover extraction based on sentinle 2 images is the basis of snow cover reconstruction under clouds and cloud shadows this study uses gf 2 data at e100 8 n37 9 on 23 march 2020 to detect snow cover to verify sen2cor s ability to detect snow cover in sentinel 2 data where the sentinel 2 data is from the same day with a track number of 47spc as shown in fig 3 compared with the gf 2 image and its snow cover the snow cover from the sentinel 2 image has very similar spatial distribution characteristics and the accuracy evaluation results are shown in table 4 the overall accuracy rate is 87 98 indicating that sen2cor can correctly classify 87 98 of the pixels in the image the user accuracy of snow pixels is 74 38 which means that when sen2cor detects snow pixels in the sentinel 2 image the probability that the same location in the gf 2 image is also a snow pixel is 74 38 the mapping accuracy is 76 40 indicating that the probability that sen2cor can correctly classify sentinel 2 images as snow pixels is 76 40 the calculation shows that the kappa coefficient is 0 67 illustrating that the snow cover detected by sen2cor and the snow cover detected by the gf 2 data are highly consistent in spatial distribution in addition the snow cover area sca is an important indicator for accuracy evaluation in the area shown in fig 3 the sca on march 23 2020 extracted from sentinel 2 is 99 78 km2 while that extracted from gf 2 is 97 13 km2 the ratio of the sca extracted from two satellite images was 102 72 indicating that sen2cor is used to detect the snow cover in sentinel 2 data with high accuracy 4 2 cloud and cloud shadow detection effects in order to evaluate the detection results of clouds with different thicknesses and their shadows on different types of land cover two cloud covered images were selected from 8 may 2019 and 4 november 2019 to avoid misjudging the dark land cover as a cloud shadow it is generally necessary to compare the results with the dynamic world class a 10 m near real time nrt land use land cover lulc dataset provided by gee the original sentinel 2 image in fig 4 a shows that the land surface is covered by scattered thick clouds and the surface objects in the gaps of the clouds are snow cover with similar spectral characteristics to the clouds on may 8 2019 the cloud detection results in fig 4 b show that the fmask algorithm has a strong ability to detect thick clouds and can separate clouds and snow cover well the surface objects in the original image in fig 4 d are covered by thin clouds on november 4 2019 the terrain of the area is flat and its surface is covered with a single surface and no snow cover as the thin cloud has strong radiation transmittance the cloud pixel contains more ground object information which makes it difficult to detect and more thin cloud pixels are missed in general the fmask algorithm is more accurate for detecting thick clouds and their shadows in sentinel 2 images and there are omissions when detecting thin cloud pixels however due to the high reflection characteristics of snow cover some thin clouds and their shadows do not affect the detection of snow cover 4 3 improved snowl algorithm results and accuracy evaluation in order to evaluate the extraction accuracy of snow cover under clouds the clear sky gf 2 image e100 3 n38 1 one day apart from the date of the sentinel 2 data was selected for comparison as shown in fig 5 c using the cloud and cloud shadow obtained from sentinel 2 as a mask the snow cover on the gf 2 cloudless image was extracted with this boundary and used to verify the snow cover reconstruction accuracy of the cloud and the cloud shadow comparing the spatial distribution of clear sky snow in the image and during this period no snowfall occurred and almost no snow melted the sentinel 2 image is shown in false color fig 5 d and there is a small amount of cloud cover over the snow area on march 21 2020 comparing the gf 2 snow map on march 23 2020 fig 5 b the cloud free snow map obtained by the original snowl algorithm and the improved snowl algorithm fig 5 e and g it can be seen that in the cloud free snow map obtained by the original snowl algorithm there is an overestimation phenomenon in the snow cover in the mountainous areas in addition the cloudless snow map obtained by the improved snowl algorithm is more like the gf 2 snow cover map and contains more mountainous details as shown in table 5 this study uses the error matrix to quantitatively analyze the superiority of the improved snowl algorithm in extracting snow cover under clouds the multi measurement error of the original snowl algorithm is 46 38 which is the main thing that affects the overall accuracy by combining the unstable snow cover area in the study area to improve the snowl algorithm the multi measurement error is reduced to 9 22 and the overall accuracy is improved from 66 42 to 84 26 among them a total of 131 days of clear sky images from november 2016 to march 2021 were selected for snow cover detection and superimposed to obtain the days with snow cover thus extract the unstable snow area however the omission error has increased from 5 38 for the original algorithm to 25 68 which shows that the improved snowl algorithm is relatively conservative it is well known that the aspect and elevation are important factors affecting snow cover distribution in mountainous areas therefore it is necessary to further analyze the accuracy of the improved snowl snow extraction algorithm from aspect and elevation based on table 5 to facilitate the analysis the aspect is divided into five categories flat surface shady slope semi shady slope sunny slope and semi sunny slope shown as in table 6 it can be seen that the snow cover extraction accuracy in flat surface and shady slope is the highest and their user accuracy mapping accuracy and overall accuracy are all above 79 followed by semi shady slope the sunny slope has the worst snow recognition accuracy which may be due to the fact that it is located in the unstable snow cover area and the snow ablation changes rapidly while the gf 2 image used for accuracy validation was obtained after two days as shown in table 7 the terrain was roughly divided into 6 elevation zones according to the 200 m elevation difference interval and the snow extraction accuracy of each elevation zone was obtained based on the improved snowl algorithm with the increase of elevation the mapping accuracy increases linearly and the user accuracy also increases with increasing elevation but is slightly decreased in the last elevation zone similarly the reason for the poor accuracy of snow cover extraction in the low elevation zones melted rapidly for snow cover may be related to the time difference of satellite data acquisition between gf 2 and sentinel 2 4 4 spatiotemporal variation characteristics of snow cover distribution the snow cover ratio scr is the ratio of snow cover in a designated area to the total area in order to reflect the changes in the snow cover rate of the babao river basin a hydrological year 1 september to 30 august of the following year is used as a unit to divide 4 november 2016 to 11 march 2021 and to analyze the changing trend of scr over the past five years among them september november is defined as autumn december february is defined as winter march may is defined as spring and june august is defined as summer formula 12 is used to calculate the snow cover rate 16 scr s snow s all 100 where s snow is the area covered by snow and s all represents the entire area of the babao river basin the change in the scr in the babao river basin over the past five years is shown in fig 6 a total of 158 days of images could be obtained for snow cover of which 27 days of images are due to cloud cover using an improved snowl algorithm providing approximately 17 of the images in this time series study there are obvious differences in the snow cover rate between the hydrological years of the babao river basin due to the limitation of the sentinrl 2 temporal resolution 10 days at that time and the influence of cloud cover the number of available images from november 2016 to august 2017 was small since the second hydrological year the number of available images has increased significantly due to the supplementation of sentinrl 2b satellite images which is beneficial for time series snow cover change analysis comparing the fluctuation trend of scr in various hydrological years it can be seen that the fluctuation degree of scr has increased year by year during the three hydrological years from 2017 to 2020 and there are different periods of concentrated snowfall in each hydrological year the snow cover in the hydrological year from september 2017 to august 2018 was generally less and the large scale snow cover in the basin mainly occurred in spring after entering the summer the snow melted rapidly and no snowfall occurred the distribution of snow cover from september 2018 to august 2019 was similar to that of the previous hydrological year snowfall mainly occurred in winter and spring in this hydrological year and the snow coverage and snowfall frequency increased compared with the previous hydrological year from september 2019 to august of the following year 13 of the 40 days images used the improved snowl algorithm to reconstruct their clouds and snow under cloud shadows compared with the same period in previous years the hydrological year has abundant snowfall and the date of large scale snow cover is earlier from october 2019 to march of the following year the scr exceeded 50 with large fluctuations fig 7 describes in detail the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of snow cover changes in this hydrological year and variation of snow cover area has a large fluctuation to further analyze the reasons for the rapid change in snow cover we obtained the daily average air temperature changes of the basin from the era5 land dataset in gee as shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the change trend of snow area is consistent with the daily average air temperature at the same time the improved snowl method can reconstruct snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows with high accuracy which can provide basic data for monitoring snow cover changes 4 5 spatial distribution characteristics of days with snow cover within a hydrological year the study area can be divided into stable snow area and unstable snow area according to the length of snow cover time with 60 days as the threshold li et al 1983 this study uses 158 days of images to analyze the spatial distribution of days with snow cover in the babao river basin over the past five years considering that the time resolution of sentinel 2 data is 5 days this study uses 22 days as the threshold to obtain the unstable snow area from the perspective of the spatial distribution of days with snow cover in the babao river basin fig 9 the unstable snow cover areas in the basin are mainly light blue and are mainly distributed in the valley areas of the babao river basin accounting for 49 82 of the basin area with an average altitude of 3396 m the area with more than 79 days with snow cover accounts for 13 06 of the basin area with an average elevation of 4034 m these areas are distributed in the northernmost and southeastern parts of the basin indicating that they are covered with snow for at least half a year each year 5 discussion 5 1 compare gf 2 data snow detection methods currently there are few related studies on snow cover detection based on gf 2 data jiang et al 2019 combined the near infrared band and the normalized difference vegetable index ndvi and proposed a decision tree based snow extraction method experiments have found that this method underestimates the snow in the shadows of the mountain fig 10 e and cannot identify the snow with high reflectivity in high altitude areas fig 10 b therefore this study needs to solve the issues of using gf 2 data to detect snow cover the babao river basin has complex terrain and large areas of snow cover on the surface fig 10 the average value of the visible light band meanvis is used to extract the snow and the scatter plot tool in envi 5 3 is used to select the snow critical point experiments show that in this study area when meanvis is greater than 0 21 the snow in the image can be effectively extracted comparing the two methods it is found that meanvis has a higher accuracy in extracting snow in this area at the same time the underestimation of snow detection in the shadow areas of mountains has also been greatly improved fig 10 b and c and this method can also accurately extract snow in high altitude areas fig 10 e and f 5 2 the impact of improvements on the snowl algorithm the original snowl algorithm combines dem data to calculate the expected snow line and redefines the cloud pixels above the snow line height as snow pixels however due to the influence of terrain wind solar radiation and other factors the speed of snow melting in some areas has been accelerated and the number of snowfall days in these areas has been reduced this study uses all clear sky images of the babao river basin to calculate and remove unstable snow areas in the study area to improve the accuracy of the snowl algorithm due to the strong spatial heterogeneity of snow distribution in mountainous areas it is inevitable that errors will occur if a unified unstable snow cover area is used in the study area to eliminate factors that affect the snowmelt speed therefore in follow up research we will consider using the dynamic unstable snow area to adapt to the snow distribution in different periods and further improve the accuracy of the snowl algorithm when there are fewer clear sky snow pixels in the image its average elevation has greater uncertainty which will further affect the accuracy of snow extraction under clouds therefore in practical applications an image with a large number of clear sky and snow pixels should be selected as much as possible to ensure the accuracy of snow reconstruction 5 3 insufficient accuracy validation the gf 2 data used for accuracy evaluation must not only have a high spatial resolution but it must also avoid the impact of cloud cover and its date must be close to the date of the sentinel 2 data therefore it is difficult to obtain gf 2 verification data that meets the verification conditions unmanned aerial vehicles uavs are not affected by clouds when acquiring ground information and can be used to verify the accuracy of snow reconstruction in subsequent studies 6 conclusions snow cover is an important input parameter for climate and hydrological models in mountainous and seasonal snow covered regions and it has become one of the most important components of climate change research while remote sensing monitoring has also become an important means of snow cover research however clouds will inevitably have an impact on the process of optical remote sensing to detect surface information this study improved the snowl algorithm to make it suitable for sentinel 2 images with a high spatial resolution the improved snowl algorithm is based on the original snowl algorithm and combines the unstable snow area in the study area to eliminate the influence of terrain wind solar radiation and other factors on the spatial distribution of snow cover based on the improved snowl algorithm the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of snow distribution in the babao river basin over the past five years are analyzed in the 158 days of images the improved snowl algorithm provided approximately 17 of the data the scr temporal and spatial variation research shows that there are significant differences in snow cover in different hydrological years in the babao river basin the time period of concentrated snowfall varies in different hydrological years at the same time the start date of snow cover has been advancing year by year analyzing the spatial distribution of snow days in the babao river basin it is found that approximately half of the areas in the basin are unstable snow areas these areas are mainly distributed in valley areas and the areas over 3977 m above sea level are covered by snow for at least half

2106,leaf litter alters the distribution of rainfall and thus affect evapotranspiration and soil water storage sws especially in areas with deep soil layers few studies have characterized the hydrological responses to leaf litter density in afforested ecosystems ten runoff plots of five litter masses 0 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 8 kg m2 referred to as 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively were established in a pinus tabuliformis plantation to investigate the compound effects of litter density and rainfall on runoff generation throughfall infiltration and water conservation in the rainy season of 2020 2021 the runoff coefficient ɑ was 0 0 80 mm mm during rainfall events with the exception of litter density runoff generation was further affected by wind speed and rainfall intensity especially during small rainfall events in general the runoff yield r was 51 8 63 8 and 83 9 lower in 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively than in bare soil higher litter density and greater throughfall p promoted the infiltration of p to deeper soil layers and the wetting depth of 1 8lm increased from the 0 20 cm soil layer during small rainfalls to the 0 50 cm soil layer during large rainfall events in 2021 moreover thick litter had greater capacity in throughfall interception i partially contributed to the negative values of sws during small rainfall events and rainless periods a total of 0 8 7 of p was consumed in i and 26 4 33 1 38 5 and 40 2 of p contributed to sws in 0lm 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively with the exception of the r p of 1 2lm which was a little higher than that of 1 8lm the water conservation capacity of 1 2lm was similar to that of 1 8lm this study may enhance our understanding of the eco hydrological function of litter and will aid the sustainable and ecological management of plantations in chinese loess plateau keywords hydrological processes litter density soil water storage pinus tabuliformis plantation chinese loess plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction afforestation programs have been widely implemented in chinese loess plateau clp since the 1990s to alleviate severe soil erosion and this has led to increases in vegetation coverage and stabilized local ecosystems feng et al 2016 jia and shao 2013 zhang et al 2018 however countless plants has increased water consumption decreased river streamflow and promoted deep soil desiccation han et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 the leaves that fall every year cover the forest floor and play a critical role in regulating forest ecohydrology fekete et al 2016 seitz et al 2015 walsh and voigt 1977 most studies have focused on examining the effects of revegetation on plant water consumption chen et al 2007a feng et al 2005 runoff generation gu et al 2020 hartanto et al 2003 and soil erosion and rainfall partitioning crockford and richardson 2000 deng et al 2012 yang et al 2019 however few studies have examined the eco hydrological function of litter in forest runoff generation is hindered by layered litter before raindrops reach the soil some precipitation is partially absorbed by litter and the litter interception is positively correlated with precipitation ma et al 2014 the litter water holding capacity varies among litter types zhou et al 2018 and li et al 2020 showed that needle leaves have greater ability to intercept precipitation and broadleaf litter retains more water than coniferous litter the litter water retention capacity and its effects on the rainfall runoff process are affected by the amount and intensity of precipitation bai et al 2021 li et al 2013 lu et al 2019 sato et al 2004 fallen deciduous leaves form a dense litter layer on the forest floor that hinders surface runoff and protects the soil surface from being stroked by raindrops the runoff yield r significantly decreases as leaf litter mass increases jourgholami et al 2022 li et al 2014 liu et al 2017b demonstrated that a half of surface runoff was reduced by litter covered plots than bare soil on tropical mountain slopes moreover runoff generation is strongly affected by the shape and structure of litter kim et al 2014 and du et al 2019 proved that broad leaf litter generates greater lateral flow within the litter layer than needle leaf litter however wang et al 2020 showed that needle leaf litter enhances soil loss under a slope gradient of 10 and rainfall intensity of 40 mm h the effects of litter density on rainfall interception and runoff generation require further examination especially for the coniferous plantations under natural conditions litter cover enhances the infiltration of rainfall into the soil huang et al 2013 found that the wetting front in treatments with vegetation cover reached soil depths greater than 35 cm however the wetting front only reached a soil depth of 25 cm in bare soil under the same amount of precipitation the infiltration of rainfall was enhanced by litter cover through its protective effects on the surface soil and the difference in soil water storage capacity between bare soil and soil with litter cover was significant wang et al 2020 cui et al 2022 further demonstrated that needle leaf litter may hinder the infiltration of rainfall at the beginning of the rainy season because of its water repellent property though the soil water storage sws is promoted by litter cover throughout the rainy season moreover litter cover depresses the interaction between the atmosphere and soil surface which weakens soil evaporation e and promotes the storage of soil water chen et al 2007b kittredge 1954 ogeâe and brunet 2002 magliano et al 2017 showed that litter cover is more effective than the forest canopy in reducing e in dry chaco rangelands argentina however dense litter hampers the growth of seedlings and limits increases in the soil water conservation capacity liu et al 2017a ruprecht et al 2010 removable litter can be easily altered in forests additional studies are needed to identify optimal densities of litter for soil and water conservation and ecological forest management pinus tabuliformis has been widely planted in clp after the implementation of the grain for green project and litter exudates have mediated the growth of shrubs and grasses understory the litter density has reached 0 93 kg m2 and a depth of more than 3 cm in p tabuliformis plantations litter plays an important role in hydrological processes in clp walsh and voigt 1977 zhu et al 2020 exploring the ecohydrological functions of litter in plantations is important for understanding the effects of afforestation on regional water cycles moreover litter is often removed by the local people and burned as fuel and litter could be regard as a regulatory factor to manage forest hydrology the degree to which litter density affects local runoff and soil water storage remains unclear studies of litter density could provide insights that aid sustainable forest management in this study rainfall events the amount of surface runoff and throughfall infiltration and variation in soil water were monitored in 10 runoff plots with different litter masses in a p tabuliformis plantation in 2020 2021 the main objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the compound effect of litter mass and rainfall properties on runoff generation and throughfall infiltration and 2 quantify the role of litter in water conservation in p tabuliformis plantations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the caijiachuan catchment on the loess plateau in 2020 2021 110 40 110 48 e 36 14 36 18 n which is a part of the national ecosystem research network of china p tabuliformis has been widely planted in this area for soil and water conservation since the 1990 s the experimental area experiences a semiarid continental climate with a mean annual precipitation of approximately 500 mm according to data from 1985 to 2021 more than half of the annual precipitation falls between july and september the annual potential evapotranspiration is approximately 1723 9 mm and the mean annual temperature is 10 0 c the soil is mainly classified as an alfisol according to the usda classification system the average bulk density and saturated soil gravity moisture of the 2 m soil layer are 1 25 g cm3 and 0 44 g g respectively the groundwater table is below the soil layer 30 m soil depth 2 2 experimental setting and data collection 2 2 1 experimental design ten runoff plots 1 5 1 5 m2 were built along slopes between rows in a p tabuliformis plantation on a loess hill fig 1 and the slope aspect of all plots was the same 315 according to measurements with a compass five litter mass treatments were performed two repetitions per treatment following cui et al 2022 specifically 0 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 8 kg m2 litter mass treatments were denoted as 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively in our study fig 1 the 1 2lm treatment corresponds to the current litter density in the p tabuliformis plantation all plots were established in july 2020 with the exception of the 0 9lm runoff plots which were established in may 2021 six points were randomly selected in each runoff plot and a ruler and compass were used to measure the thickness of litter and the gradient of runoff plots respectively basic information on the runoff plots is provided in fig 1 the original litter was removed from the plot surface until the soil was exposed the topsoil in each plot was leveled and smoothed to create a uniform surface the litter of p tabuliformis was collected from a nearby forest dried and evenly spread on the corresponding runoff plots and the space between repetitions according to the density gradient fig 1 b c and d there was approximately 45 60 cm between the repetitions of each treatment the runoff plots were surrounded by four whole pieces of asbestos tiles 160 cm 30 cm which were buried 15 cm deep below the soil surface to prevent lateral leakage holes were drilled in the asbestos tiles at the bottom and lowest points of each plot the runoff from the plot to the bucket volume was 0 06 m3 was guided by a steel wire hose glass cement was used to seal the joints to prevent water leakage and the surface runoff of each plot was measured using a measuring cup with 1 ml accuracy after rainfall events in total 21 rainfall events with surface runoff were monitored during our experiment we also tested the water holding capacity of litter using the immersion method in the laboratory cui et al 2022 and four replications were performed we found that 1 6 g of water could be held by 1 g of litter no more than 0 96 1 44 1 92 and 2 88 mm of throughfall may be hold in the 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm treatments respectively without considering the litter property evaporation rainfall intensity and wind furthermore ma et al 2014 proved that the amount of litter interception i 0 686 precipitation 0 591 for 1 2lm we assumed that when the precipitation of the rainfall event was greater than 1 8 3 5 5 7 and 11 3 mm the corresponding throughfall was 1 6 3 0 5 0 and 9 8 mm respectively in our study fig s1 the maximum litter interception capacity of 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm would be reached and stabilized during rainfall events respectively if the precipitation was less than the four thresholds litter interception was calculated according to litter density values 2 2 2 meteorological measurements during the experiment air temperature ta wind speed ws relative humidity rh and solar radiation ra were obtained using an automatic weather station hobo usa below the hill which was 1 5 km away from the experimental plots two self recording rain gauges rg3 m hobo were used to measure the rainfall and throughfall beginning on 14th july 2019 and these were located in an open place and in the plantation understory respectively both were near the runoff plots the monitoring results indicated that throughfall accounted for 87 0 of rainfall fig s1 and table r1 and ma et al 2014 also showed that the canopy intercepted 13 5 of gross rainfall stemflow was not considered because the runoff plots were set between two rows this coupled with the even arranged of trees of similar size effectively eliminated the spatial variability in canopy interception we defined throughfall p as the net precipitation that reached the plots 2 2 3 surface runoff runoff depth was used to estimate the surface runoff r of runoff plots under rainfall events which was calculated as follows 1 r 1 1000 v 1 5 1 5 cos φ where v indicates the amount of surface runoff collected in the bucket after rainfall events ml φ indicates the slope gradient of runoff plots and r indicates the runoff depth of the corresponding runoff plots mm the runoff coefficient ɑ was calculated as follows 2 α r p where α reflects the effect of geological characteristics and soil properties on runoff generation and p indicates throughfall mm 2 2 4 soil moisture and soil water storage the oven drying method at 105 for 24 h was used to estimate the soil gravity water content swc in 2020 soil samples were collected form depths of 0 100 cm at 10 cm intervals using an auger and 10 soil samples were collected from each plot before and after rainfall events similarly 15 soil samples 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm 40 50 cm 50 60 cm 60 70 cm 70 80 cm 80 90 cm 90 100 cm 100 120 cm 120 140 cm 140 160 cm 160 180 cm 180 200 cm were collected in the space between runoff plot repetitions in 2021 a total of 800 and 975 soil samples were collected in 2020 and 2021 respectively the variation degree in swc was calculated by taking the difference between the latter sws and the former sws and then dividing by the former sws soil water storage sws during a specific time was calculated as follows 3 sws 10 δ θ i d i h ρ where sws indicates the layer cumulated soil water in the 0 100 cm soil layers in 2020 and in the 0 200 cm soil layers in 2021 mm θ i represents the gravimetric soil moisture in the soil layer d i indicates the soil bulk density g cm3 h represents the thickness of the corresponding soil layer 10 cm or 20 cm ρ is the density of water 1 g cm3 and i indicates the number of soil layers which was 10 in 2020 and 15 in 2021 the sws before and after the rainfall event δsws was used to calculate the throughfall infiltration furthermore the water balance equation was used to calculate the water consumption as follows 4 δ s w s p r e t i d where e indicates soil evaporation mm t indicates plant transpiration or plant water consumption mm i indicates litter interception mm and d indicates deep percolation mm 2 3 analytical method a pearson correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between rainfall properties and surface runoff and the threshold for statistical significance was p 0 05 in addition to determine the relationships between surface runoff soil water and environmental factors ordination techniques with a linear response model or a unimodal response model were applied using canoco for windows 5 0 whether a linear or unimodal model should be used was determined using detrended correspondence analysis dca sample data should be used in dca if the largest gradient length is less than 3 0 linear response model redundancy analysis rda was employed to characterize the relationships between sample data and environmental factors if the largest gradient value was larger than 4 0 the unimodal canonical correspondence analysis cca model was applied the largest gradient length of the surface runoff variables r and ɑ was 0 3 given that the response data comprised only one variable only the linear model was applicable thus rda was used to identify the environmental factors that best describe surface runoff to perform the rda two matrixes an environmental factor matrix and a surface runoff matrix were obtained six environmental factors were considered including throughfall p in mm litter mass lm in kg m2 wind speed at 10 m high ws in m s maximum rainfall intensity in 30 mins i30 in mm h maximum rainfall intensity in 60 mins i60 in mm h mean rainfall intensity during the rainfall event imean in mm h and swc in 0 10 cm soil layer swc in g g the forward selection procedure was used to eliminate redundant factors and the monte carlo test was applied to determine whether the relationship between the selected environmental factors and the surface runoff was significant 3 results 3 1 runoff generation and litter interception on rainfall events based on the amount of throughfall rainfall events were classified into three classes in our study small p 10 mm medium 10 p 50 mm and large p 50 mm rainfall events table 1 the highest r was observed in 0lm at most occasions and i increased with the increment of litter density the mean value of r was 0 43 0 33 0 30 and 0 17 mm and the mean value of ɑ was 0 07 0 05 0 05 and 0 03 mm mm in 0lm 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm under small rainfall events respectively moreover the mean value of i was 0 96 1 85 and 2 77 mm in 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively with the exception of the rainfall event in 2020 08 23 2020 08 24 the value of ɑ was 0 0 23 0 01 0 11 and 0 01 0 14 mm mm in 0lm 0 9lm and 1 8lm under medium rainfall events respectively under large rainfall events in 2020 2021 the value of ɑ was 0 11 0 36 0 07 0 27 0 02 0 28 and 0 02 0 06 mm mm in 0lm 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively the relationship between p and ɑ is further shown in fig s2 in addition the i was the same during medium and large rainfall events the r varied among rainfall events for example the r was lower in 2021 08 19 than in 2020 08 12 2020 08 14 although the p was 2 05 times higher in the former than in the latter the ɑ was 0 80 mm mm for 0lm in 2020 08 23 2020 08 24 which was 10 times higher than the value of ɑ in the other treatments while the value of ɑ for the five treatments in 2021 08 30 2021 08 31 was 0 05 0 14 mm mm with similar p 3 2 throughfall infiltration on rainfall events to clarify the compound effect of litter density and rainfall events on throughfall infiltration in 0 200 cm soil layers three rainfall events in 2021 with medium values of ɑ were selected which included a small rainfall event 2021 08 19 p 8 2 mm a medium rainfall event 2021 08 30 2021 08 31 p 26 2 mm and a large rainfall event 2021 06 14 p 69 2 mm as shown in fig 2 a b and c respectively after the small rainfall event the swc of 1 8lm increased the most in the 0 20 cm soil layer with values of 121 61 in the 0 10 cm soil layer and 94 09 in the 10 20 cm soil layer fig 2 a although the swc in deeper soil layers ranged from 3 26 to 9 43 the swc of the other treatments was less variable before and after the small rainfall event throughout the 0 200 cm soil layer the greatest swc increases were observed in 0 20 cm soil layers under the medium rainfall event with the mean values were 130 80 110 47 126 19 81 85 and 113 99 for 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively moreover the swc increased by more than 10 in the 0 20 0 30 0 30 0 30 and 0 50 cm soil layers for 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm fig 2 b respectively this pattern was also observed under the large rainfall events the swc of the 0 40 0 30 0 30 0 40 and 0 50 cm soil layers in 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm increased by more than 10 after rainfall fig 2 c respectively the swc in 0 50 cm soil layers increased by 19 91 32 55 and 46 32 in 0lm 0 6lm and 1 2lm respectively and the values were 11 71 14 58 and 24 53 in 0 100 cm soil layers respectively the mean swc in 0 200 cm soil layer of 0lm 0 9lm and 1 8lm was respectively increased by 4 4 3 7 and 20 3 in the small rainfall event 16 1 18 5 and 29 3 in the medium rainfall event and 8 2 8 3 and 16 8 in the large rainfall event 3 3 soil water storage during the rainy season because less p infiltrated into soil deeper than 0 100 cm the sws in 0 100 cm soil layers in 2020 2021 is shown in fig 3 the sws varied among rainfall events and it was generally the same at the beginning of the experimental period fig 3 a with mean values of 113 05 2 88 mm in 0 100 cm soil layers in 2020 08 04 the sws of 0lm 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm in 2020 08 22 was 96 14 128 95 141 65 and 139 17 higher than that in 2020 08 04 respectively the rainfall frequency was high during this period and the p value was 242 40 mm the sws in 2020 10 04 was increased by 68 88 mm in 0lm 94 44 mm in 0 6lm 88 30 mm in 1 2lm and 97 69 mm in 1 8lm than that in 2020 08 04 the sws was 129 00 5 44 mm in the five treatments in 2021 06 13 the sws in 0lm 0 9lm and 1 8lm was increased by 11 4 10 0 and 26 0 in 2021 06 13 2021 06 20 p 69 2 mm and the values were 9 8 16 6 and 29 6 in 2021 06 20 2021 07 16 p 20 6 mm respectively totally the sws was 28 3 17 9 20 3 54 0 and 50 9 higher in 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm in 2021 09 07 than in 2021 06 13 respectively high p values generally promote increases in sws and the δsws is also affected by litter mass for example the sws was 7 2 9 8 and 0 1 higher in the 0 100 cm soil layer in 0lm 0 6lm and 1 8lm in the medium rainfall event in 2021 07 16 2021 07 24 and the values were 23 24 68 01 and 44 97 in 2020 08 14 2020 08 20 respectively 3 4 throughfall partitioning according to water balance equation eq 4 the variation in the components of throughfall consumption is shown in fig 4 in this study continuous daily rainfall was regarded as one individual rainfall event in calculations of litter interception because the infiltration depth was less than 100 cm even under the large rainfall event fig 2 the sws for the 0 100 cm soil layer was calculated both in 2020 and 2021 the i increased with an increase of litter density and the value of i p was negatively correlated with p the relationship between δsws and litter mass was not clear in small and medium rainfall events and δsws and e t were positively and negatively correlated with litter mass in the large rainfall event fig 4 c respectively the amount of r generally decreased with the increases in litter mass in 2020 while r was high in 0 6lm and 1 2lm in 2021 the ratio of r to p was 21 8 for 0lm 8 0 for 0 6lm and 2 8 for 1 2lm in 2020 08 04 2020 08 22 fig 4 d which was a period with intense rainfall events and high throughfall the scarce throughfall caused a decrease in sws in 2020 08 22 2020 10 03 fig 4 e and 129 2 192 5 212 4 and 175 9 of p was consumed in e t in 0lm 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively similarly 86 4 100 8 and 97 4 of p was consumed in e t for 0lm 0 9lm and 1 8lm in 2021 06 13 2021 07 16 respectively and the value of δsws p was 0 6 12 0 and 17 0 respectively the value of δsws p was 26 2 in 0lm and 20 2 in 1 2lm in 2021 07 16 2021 08 12 and the value of δsws p was 51 7 in 0lm and 90 6 in 1 8lm in 2021 08 12 2021 09 07 totally the i p was 0 8 2 and 0 14 6 in 2020 and 2021 respectively the r p and δsws p were 25 5 and 23 4 in 0lm 7 4 and 32 1 in 0 6lm and 2 4 and 33 3 in 1 8lm in 2020 08 04 2020 10 03 respectively a total of 16 9 11 5 12 8 32 0 and 33 2 of p was stored in 0 100 cm soil layers in 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm in 2021 06 13 2021 09 07 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effects of litter mass on the runoff infiltration pattern vegetation litter plays an important role in runoff generation and throughfall infiltration which is an underestimated variable in forest hydrological processes walsh and voigt 1977 generally the r significantly decreases as leaf litter density increases regardless of the litter type boeken and orenstein 2001 jourgholami et al 2022 liu et al 2017b li et al 2014 found that the average runoff yield for the runoff plots with p tabuliformis litter was 31 3 lower than that for bare soil in this study the mean ɑ was 0 17 0 11 0 10 and 0 05 in 0lm 0 6lm 1 2 lm and 1 8lm in the rainy season of 2020 2021 respectively this was consistent with the findings of gomyo and kuraji 2016 and jourgholami et al 2022 showing that litter plays a significant role in hindering surface runoff leaf litter cover promotes the roughness of the soil surface absorbs the stroke from raindrops and results in decreased surface runoff and soil erosion however the ɑ in 0 6lm and 1 2lm was 25 4 and 46 2 higher than that in 0lm in 2021 respectively and r was promoted occasionally by increases in litter in the small medium and large rainfall events table 1 to clarify the relationship between rainfall properties and litter mass the rda was conducted based on the data in 2021 the results of the forward selection of environmental factors that affected runoff generation are shown in fig 5 ws was the first factor that was negatively correlated with ɑ in the five treatments and it explained 10 6 21 8 4 7 16 4 and 9 8 of ɑ in 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively generally higher rainfall intensity i30 i60 and imean promoted runoff generation in all treatments especially in 0 6lm p 0 05 p and swc in 0 10 cm soil layer contributed little to ɑ among this the swc in 0 10 cm soil layer contributed less than 10 to ɑ in treatments with litter cover the runoff yield is the result of the compound effect of many factors including meteorological factors rainfall property wind speed and wind direction plant density canopy closure and the roughness of the soil surface vegetation and litter in our study high litter density inhibited runoff generation table 1 the inhabitation of surface runoff was highest in 1 2lm fig s2 and the mean ɑ in 1 2lm was decreased by 10 0 than that in 1 8lm in 2020 wang et al 2020 and van stan et al 2017 also proved that lateral flow was generated more frequently in runoff plots with thick needle leaf litter as a result of the larger gaps and thin strip morphology of needle leaves compared to broad leaf litter needle leaf litter is more effective in hindering lateral flow under rainfall intensities of 50 mm h kim et al 2014 sato et al 2004 bochet et al 2006 further showed that litter cover reinforced the effect of canopy cover in controlling splash erosion at the plant scale especially for intense rainfall events moreover the relationship between ɑ and litter mass differed in 2020 and 2021 and this might partially stem from the greater ws which increased the nonuniformity of the throughfall distribution in the rainy season 2021 fig s3 furthermore litter promoted throughfall infiltration by litter water retention and further protected soil from sealing in this study the soil surface swc was highest in 1 8lm in the small rainfall event and the soil depth of the wetting front generally decreased with a decrease of litter density in the medium and large rainfall events fig 2 on the one hand litter cover collects throughfall and prolongs the time that rainfall is retained on the soil surface on the other hand the decomposed litter increases soil porosity and enhances continuous infiltration badu et al 2022 litt et al 2020 liu et al 2019 furthermore consistent with cui et al 2022 we found that the greatest infiltration depth was no more than 80 cm in 2020 even under the large rainfall and continuous rainfall events wang et al 2013 also showed that the wetting front of an artificial plantation was less than 60 cm six days after rainfall in clp suggesting that the swc measurement depth of 0 100 cm is sufficient for characterizing rainfall infiltration processes in loess areas 4 2 throughfall consumption and forest management litter promoted rainfall infiltration inhibited soil evaporation and enhanced soil water storage compared with bare soil litter cover alters the micro meteorological conditions of the soil surface and reduces evaporation rates cui et al 2022 magliano et al 2017 wilson et al 2000 the evaporation rate generally decreases with an increase in litter density in our study the swc in 0 20 cm soil layer decreased 32 8 in 0lm 29 8 in 0 6lm and 26 9 in 1 8lm during rainless days in 2020 08 22 2020 09 14 a total of 23 4 30 1 and 33 3 of p in 2020 08 04 2020 10 03 and 16 9 32 0 and 33 2 of p in 2021 06 13 2021 09 07 was stored in 0 100 soil layers in 0lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively from the perspective of sws in 0 100 cm soil layers the relationship between p and δsws is shown in fig 6 litter cover promotes more throughfall infiltration and storage in the soil wang et al 2020 with the exception of 0 9lm there was a significant linear increase in δsws p with litter density in both rainfall events and the rainy seasons the correlation coefficient between p and δsws in the rainy season was smaller than that in the rainfall events which was caused by the increased proportion of e t p in the long term calculations fig 4 the swc in rainfall events greater than 100 mm was not observed in 2021 and meteorological variables had greater effects during the small and medium rainfall events which contributed in part to the underestimation of δsws in 0 9lm the δsws of 0 6lm and 0 9lm during rainfall events was similar fig 4 thus 0 9lm was not considered in the following discussion generally the sws was 52 3 45 8 and 25 4 higher in 1 8lm 1 2lm and 0 6lm respectively than in 0lm in 2020 2021 fig 6 b we also found that δsws was not positively correlated with litter mass fig 4 a b e and f this might stem from the weakening of the hydrological effect of litter and soil moisture dynamics were more affected by meteorological variables and the distribution of plant roots tonin et al 2017 xiong et al 2008 especially during small rainfall events and rainless periods moreover more throughfall is retained by impermeable p tabuliformis litter during small rainfall events du et al 2019 as the i increased with an increase in litter density table 1 which resulted in less infiltration and decreased δsws cui et al 2022 possible reasons for this phenomenon require further exploration overall the r p and i p were 0 199 and 0 0 096 and 0 032 0 072 and 0 059 and 0 032 and 0 087 in 0lm 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm in 2020 2021 the calculation method was similar to that applied in fig 6 b respectively the d could be neglected because little throughfall infiltrated to soil layers deeper than 100 cm fig 2 thus 53 7 54 1 48 4 and 47 9 of p were consumed in e t in 0lm 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm treatments in the rainy season of 2020 2021 respectively yearly accumulated litter alters soil surface microclimate reduces runoff and soil loss enhances soil organic matter and surface soil moisture and increases the number of species and annual plant biomass production boeken and orenstein 2001 fekete et al 2016 jia et al 2018 liu et al 2019 we found that increased litter mass enhanced i and sws and weakened the water consumption in r and e t however some findings indicated that thick litter promoted surface runoff and inhibited seed germination which was not conducive to the construction of understory vegetation communities eckstein and donath 2005 liu et al 2017a wang et al 2020 in p tabuliformis plantations the understory has less vegetation because the litter and root exudates of p tabuliformis depress seed germination berg and ekbohm 1991 combining with thick litter and high plantation density p tabuliformis plantations play a critical role in regional water management and soil conservation in our study the r p was 63 8 and 83 9 lower in 1 2lm and 1 8lm than in 0lm in the rainy season of 2020 2021 respectively and the values of sws p and e t p in 1 2lm and 1 8lm were similar moreover the actual litter mass of the p tabuliformis plantation was 1 2 kg m2 in our study area cui et al 2022 and the litter production and decomposition rate were approximately 0 3 kg m2 yr and 20 30 wang et al 2019 respectively the litter mass of the p tabuliformis plantation has recently been observed to fluctuate around 1 2 kg m2 the 1 2lm treatment was superior to the 1 8lm treatment in terms of ecohydrological benefits because the former allows more precipitation to enter the river while storing precipitation which helps alleviate decreases in streamflow and water shortage in clp therefore no human interference with the current litter density can not only labor saving but also enhances the ecohydrological function of litter the current amount of litter would be a reasonable density for promoting the sustainable and ecological development of forest our field experiment was conducted under natural conditions in clp more detailed information was not collected due to the limited instruments for example the time to runoff generation and the variation in r and δsws with time additional studies are needed to clarify the effect of litter density on soil properties and biochemistry nevertheless the results of our study provide new insights into the physical mechanism by which litter regulates hillslope hydrology these findings enhance our understanding of the ecohydrological function of litter and will aid water and forest management in clp 5 conclusions the role of vegetation litter in regional hydrological processes is often underestimated in clp a field experiment with different litter densities was conducted in a p tabuliformis plantation under natural rainfall we investigated the compound effect of rainfall properties and litter mass on throughfall infiltration runoff generation and δsws on rainfall events and the main rainy season in 2020 2021 we found that the infiltration depth and amount were enhanced when litter mass and precipitation were high and the infiltration depth of rainfall was no more than 80 cm in 2020 2021 the r and ɑ decreased as litter mass increased in the rainy season and the throughfall runoff pattern was also affected by meteorological variables e g ws and rainfall properties e g rainfall intensity in each rainfall event and the ɑ might be enhanced by thick needle leaf litter under intense rainfall events furthermore thick litter may prevent throughfall infiltration by throughfall interception this was responsible for the negative values of δsws during small rainfall events and rainless periods δsws p increased linearly with litter mass in the rainy season and the values of δsws p were 0 264 in 0lm 0 331 in 0 6lm 0 385 in 1 2lm and 0 402 in 1 8lm runoff generation was most strongly inhibited in 1 8lm treatment more rainfall entered streamflow in 1 2lm treatment and the water conservation capacity of 1 2lm was similar to that of 1 8lm the current litter density could provide a well ecohydrological function in regional water and forest management credit

2106,leaf litter alters the distribution of rainfall and thus affect evapotranspiration and soil water storage sws especially in areas with deep soil layers few studies have characterized the hydrological responses to leaf litter density in afforested ecosystems ten runoff plots of five litter masses 0 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 8 kg m2 referred to as 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively were established in a pinus tabuliformis plantation to investigate the compound effects of litter density and rainfall on runoff generation throughfall infiltration and water conservation in the rainy season of 2020 2021 the runoff coefficient ɑ was 0 0 80 mm mm during rainfall events with the exception of litter density runoff generation was further affected by wind speed and rainfall intensity especially during small rainfall events in general the runoff yield r was 51 8 63 8 and 83 9 lower in 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively than in bare soil higher litter density and greater throughfall p promoted the infiltration of p to deeper soil layers and the wetting depth of 1 8lm increased from the 0 20 cm soil layer during small rainfalls to the 0 50 cm soil layer during large rainfall events in 2021 moreover thick litter had greater capacity in throughfall interception i partially contributed to the negative values of sws during small rainfall events and rainless periods a total of 0 8 7 of p was consumed in i and 26 4 33 1 38 5 and 40 2 of p contributed to sws in 0lm 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively with the exception of the r p of 1 2lm which was a little higher than that of 1 8lm the water conservation capacity of 1 2lm was similar to that of 1 8lm this study may enhance our understanding of the eco hydrological function of litter and will aid the sustainable and ecological management of plantations in chinese loess plateau keywords hydrological processes litter density soil water storage pinus tabuliformis plantation chinese loess plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction afforestation programs have been widely implemented in chinese loess plateau clp since the 1990s to alleviate severe soil erosion and this has led to increases in vegetation coverage and stabilized local ecosystems feng et al 2016 jia and shao 2013 zhang et al 2018 however countless plants has increased water consumption decreased river streamflow and promoted deep soil desiccation han et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 the leaves that fall every year cover the forest floor and play a critical role in regulating forest ecohydrology fekete et al 2016 seitz et al 2015 walsh and voigt 1977 most studies have focused on examining the effects of revegetation on plant water consumption chen et al 2007a feng et al 2005 runoff generation gu et al 2020 hartanto et al 2003 and soil erosion and rainfall partitioning crockford and richardson 2000 deng et al 2012 yang et al 2019 however few studies have examined the eco hydrological function of litter in forest runoff generation is hindered by layered litter before raindrops reach the soil some precipitation is partially absorbed by litter and the litter interception is positively correlated with precipitation ma et al 2014 the litter water holding capacity varies among litter types zhou et al 2018 and li et al 2020 showed that needle leaves have greater ability to intercept precipitation and broadleaf litter retains more water than coniferous litter the litter water retention capacity and its effects on the rainfall runoff process are affected by the amount and intensity of precipitation bai et al 2021 li et al 2013 lu et al 2019 sato et al 2004 fallen deciduous leaves form a dense litter layer on the forest floor that hinders surface runoff and protects the soil surface from being stroked by raindrops the runoff yield r significantly decreases as leaf litter mass increases jourgholami et al 2022 li et al 2014 liu et al 2017b demonstrated that a half of surface runoff was reduced by litter covered plots than bare soil on tropical mountain slopes moreover runoff generation is strongly affected by the shape and structure of litter kim et al 2014 and du et al 2019 proved that broad leaf litter generates greater lateral flow within the litter layer than needle leaf litter however wang et al 2020 showed that needle leaf litter enhances soil loss under a slope gradient of 10 and rainfall intensity of 40 mm h the effects of litter density on rainfall interception and runoff generation require further examination especially for the coniferous plantations under natural conditions litter cover enhances the infiltration of rainfall into the soil huang et al 2013 found that the wetting front in treatments with vegetation cover reached soil depths greater than 35 cm however the wetting front only reached a soil depth of 25 cm in bare soil under the same amount of precipitation the infiltration of rainfall was enhanced by litter cover through its protective effects on the surface soil and the difference in soil water storage capacity between bare soil and soil with litter cover was significant wang et al 2020 cui et al 2022 further demonstrated that needle leaf litter may hinder the infiltration of rainfall at the beginning of the rainy season because of its water repellent property though the soil water storage sws is promoted by litter cover throughout the rainy season moreover litter cover depresses the interaction between the atmosphere and soil surface which weakens soil evaporation e and promotes the storage of soil water chen et al 2007b kittredge 1954 ogeâe and brunet 2002 magliano et al 2017 showed that litter cover is more effective than the forest canopy in reducing e in dry chaco rangelands argentina however dense litter hampers the growth of seedlings and limits increases in the soil water conservation capacity liu et al 2017a ruprecht et al 2010 removable litter can be easily altered in forests additional studies are needed to identify optimal densities of litter for soil and water conservation and ecological forest management pinus tabuliformis has been widely planted in clp after the implementation of the grain for green project and litter exudates have mediated the growth of shrubs and grasses understory the litter density has reached 0 93 kg m2 and a depth of more than 3 cm in p tabuliformis plantations litter plays an important role in hydrological processes in clp walsh and voigt 1977 zhu et al 2020 exploring the ecohydrological functions of litter in plantations is important for understanding the effects of afforestation on regional water cycles moreover litter is often removed by the local people and burned as fuel and litter could be regard as a regulatory factor to manage forest hydrology the degree to which litter density affects local runoff and soil water storage remains unclear studies of litter density could provide insights that aid sustainable forest management in this study rainfall events the amount of surface runoff and throughfall infiltration and variation in soil water were monitored in 10 runoff plots with different litter masses in a p tabuliformis plantation in 2020 2021 the main objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the compound effect of litter mass and rainfall properties on runoff generation and throughfall infiltration and 2 quantify the role of litter in water conservation in p tabuliformis plantations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the caijiachuan catchment on the loess plateau in 2020 2021 110 40 110 48 e 36 14 36 18 n which is a part of the national ecosystem research network of china p tabuliformis has been widely planted in this area for soil and water conservation since the 1990 s the experimental area experiences a semiarid continental climate with a mean annual precipitation of approximately 500 mm according to data from 1985 to 2021 more than half of the annual precipitation falls between july and september the annual potential evapotranspiration is approximately 1723 9 mm and the mean annual temperature is 10 0 c the soil is mainly classified as an alfisol according to the usda classification system the average bulk density and saturated soil gravity moisture of the 2 m soil layer are 1 25 g cm3 and 0 44 g g respectively the groundwater table is below the soil layer 30 m soil depth 2 2 experimental setting and data collection 2 2 1 experimental design ten runoff plots 1 5 1 5 m2 were built along slopes between rows in a p tabuliformis plantation on a loess hill fig 1 and the slope aspect of all plots was the same 315 according to measurements with a compass five litter mass treatments were performed two repetitions per treatment following cui et al 2022 specifically 0 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 8 kg m2 litter mass treatments were denoted as 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively in our study fig 1 the 1 2lm treatment corresponds to the current litter density in the p tabuliformis plantation all plots were established in july 2020 with the exception of the 0 9lm runoff plots which were established in may 2021 six points were randomly selected in each runoff plot and a ruler and compass were used to measure the thickness of litter and the gradient of runoff plots respectively basic information on the runoff plots is provided in fig 1 the original litter was removed from the plot surface until the soil was exposed the topsoil in each plot was leveled and smoothed to create a uniform surface the litter of p tabuliformis was collected from a nearby forest dried and evenly spread on the corresponding runoff plots and the space between repetitions according to the density gradient fig 1 b c and d there was approximately 45 60 cm between the repetitions of each treatment the runoff plots were surrounded by four whole pieces of asbestos tiles 160 cm 30 cm which were buried 15 cm deep below the soil surface to prevent lateral leakage holes were drilled in the asbestos tiles at the bottom and lowest points of each plot the runoff from the plot to the bucket volume was 0 06 m3 was guided by a steel wire hose glass cement was used to seal the joints to prevent water leakage and the surface runoff of each plot was measured using a measuring cup with 1 ml accuracy after rainfall events in total 21 rainfall events with surface runoff were monitored during our experiment we also tested the water holding capacity of litter using the immersion method in the laboratory cui et al 2022 and four replications were performed we found that 1 6 g of water could be held by 1 g of litter no more than 0 96 1 44 1 92 and 2 88 mm of throughfall may be hold in the 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm treatments respectively without considering the litter property evaporation rainfall intensity and wind furthermore ma et al 2014 proved that the amount of litter interception i 0 686 precipitation 0 591 for 1 2lm we assumed that when the precipitation of the rainfall event was greater than 1 8 3 5 5 7 and 11 3 mm the corresponding throughfall was 1 6 3 0 5 0 and 9 8 mm respectively in our study fig s1 the maximum litter interception capacity of 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm would be reached and stabilized during rainfall events respectively if the precipitation was less than the four thresholds litter interception was calculated according to litter density values 2 2 2 meteorological measurements during the experiment air temperature ta wind speed ws relative humidity rh and solar radiation ra were obtained using an automatic weather station hobo usa below the hill which was 1 5 km away from the experimental plots two self recording rain gauges rg3 m hobo were used to measure the rainfall and throughfall beginning on 14th july 2019 and these were located in an open place and in the plantation understory respectively both were near the runoff plots the monitoring results indicated that throughfall accounted for 87 0 of rainfall fig s1 and table r1 and ma et al 2014 also showed that the canopy intercepted 13 5 of gross rainfall stemflow was not considered because the runoff plots were set between two rows this coupled with the even arranged of trees of similar size effectively eliminated the spatial variability in canopy interception we defined throughfall p as the net precipitation that reached the plots 2 2 3 surface runoff runoff depth was used to estimate the surface runoff r of runoff plots under rainfall events which was calculated as follows 1 r 1 1000 v 1 5 1 5 cos φ where v indicates the amount of surface runoff collected in the bucket after rainfall events ml φ indicates the slope gradient of runoff plots and r indicates the runoff depth of the corresponding runoff plots mm the runoff coefficient ɑ was calculated as follows 2 α r p where α reflects the effect of geological characteristics and soil properties on runoff generation and p indicates throughfall mm 2 2 4 soil moisture and soil water storage the oven drying method at 105 for 24 h was used to estimate the soil gravity water content swc in 2020 soil samples were collected form depths of 0 100 cm at 10 cm intervals using an auger and 10 soil samples were collected from each plot before and after rainfall events similarly 15 soil samples 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm 40 50 cm 50 60 cm 60 70 cm 70 80 cm 80 90 cm 90 100 cm 100 120 cm 120 140 cm 140 160 cm 160 180 cm 180 200 cm were collected in the space between runoff plot repetitions in 2021 a total of 800 and 975 soil samples were collected in 2020 and 2021 respectively the variation degree in swc was calculated by taking the difference between the latter sws and the former sws and then dividing by the former sws soil water storage sws during a specific time was calculated as follows 3 sws 10 δ θ i d i h ρ where sws indicates the layer cumulated soil water in the 0 100 cm soil layers in 2020 and in the 0 200 cm soil layers in 2021 mm θ i represents the gravimetric soil moisture in the soil layer d i indicates the soil bulk density g cm3 h represents the thickness of the corresponding soil layer 10 cm or 20 cm ρ is the density of water 1 g cm3 and i indicates the number of soil layers which was 10 in 2020 and 15 in 2021 the sws before and after the rainfall event δsws was used to calculate the throughfall infiltration furthermore the water balance equation was used to calculate the water consumption as follows 4 δ s w s p r e t i d where e indicates soil evaporation mm t indicates plant transpiration or plant water consumption mm i indicates litter interception mm and d indicates deep percolation mm 2 3 analytical method a pearson correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between rainfall properties and surface runoff and the threshold for statistical significance was p 0 05 in addition to determine the relationships between surface runoff soil water and environmental factors ordination techniques with a linear response model or a unimodal response model were applied using canoco for windows 5 0 whether a linear or unimodal model should be used was determined using detrended correspondence analysis dca sample data should be used in dca if the largest gradient length is less than 3 0 linear response model redundancy analysis rda was employed to characterize the relationships between sample data and environmental factors if the largest gradient value was larger than 4 0 the unimodal canonical correspondence analysis cca model was applied the largest gradient length of the surface runoff variables r and ɑ was 0 3 given that the response data comprised only one variable only the linear model was applicable thus rda was used to identify the environmental factors that best describe surface runoff to perform the rda two matrixes an environmental factor matrix and a surface runoff matrix were obtained six environmental factors were considered including throughfall p in mm litter mass lm in kg m2 wind speed at 10 m high ws in m s maximum rainfall intensity in 30 mins i30 in mm h maximum rainfall intensity in 60 mins i60 in mm h mean rainfall intensity during the rainfall event imean in mm h and swc in 0 10 cm soil layer swc in g g the forward selection procedure was used to eliminate redundant factors and the monte carlo test was applied to determine whether the relationship between the selected environmental factors and the surface runoff was significant 3 results 3 1 runoff generation and litter interception on rainfall events based on the amount of throughfall rainfall events were classified into three classes in our study small p 10 mm medium 10 p 50 mm and large p 50 mm rainfall events table 1 the highest r was observed in 0lm at most occasions and i increased with the increment of litter density the mean value of r was 0 43 0 33 0 30 and 0 17 mm and the mean value of ɑ was 0 07 0 05 0 05 and 0 03 mm mm in 0lm 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm under small rainfall events respectively moreover the mean value of i was 0 96 1 85 and 2 77 mm in 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively with the exception of the rainfall event in 2020 08 23 2020 08 24 the value of ɑ was 0 0 23 0 01 0 11 and 0 01 0 14 mm mm in 0lm 0 9lm and 1 8lm under medium rainfall events respectively under large rainfall events in 2020 2021 the value of ɑ was 0 11 0 36 0 07 0 27 0 02 0 28 and 0 02 0 06 mm mm in 0lm 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively the relationship between p and ɑ is further shown in fig s2 in addition the i was the same during medium and large rainfall events the r varied among rainfall events for example the r was lower in 2021 08 19 than in 2020 08 12 2020 08 14 although the p was 2 05 times higher in the former than in the latter the ɑ was 0 80 mm mm for 0lm in 2020 08 23 2020 08 24 which was 10 times higher than the value of ɑ in the other treatments while the value of ɑ for the five treatments in 2021 08 30 2021 08 31 was 0 05 0 14 mm mm with similar p 3 2 throughfall infiltration on rainfall events to clarify the compound effect of litter density and rainfall events on throughfall infiltration in 0 200 cm soil layers three rainfall events in 2021 with medium values of ɑ were selected which included a small rainfall event 2021 08 19 p 8 2 mm a medium rainfall event 2021 08 30 2021 08 31 p 26 2 mm and a large rainfall event 2021 06 14 p 69 2 mm as shown in fig 2 a b and c respectively after the small rainfall event the swc of 1 8lm increased the most in the 0 20 cm soil layer with values of 121 61 in the 0 10 cm soil layer and 94 09 in the 10 20 cm soil layer fig 2 a although the swc in deeper soil layers ranged from 3 26 to 9 43 the swc of the other treatments was less variable before and after the small rainfall event throughout the 0 200 cm soil layer the greatest swc increases were observed in 0 20 cm soil layers under the medium rainfall event with the mean values were 130 80 110 47 126 19 81 85 and 113 99 for 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively moreover the swc increased by more than 10 in the 0 20 0 30 0 30 0 30 and 0 50 cm soil layers for 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm fig 2 b respectively this pattern was also observed under the large rainfall events the swc of the 0 40 0 30 0 30 0 40 and 0 50 cm soil layers in 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm increased by more than 10 after rainfall fig 2 c respectively the swc in 0 50 cm soil layers increased by 19 91 32 55 and 46 32 in 0lm 0 6lm and 1 2lm respectively and the values were 11 71 14 58 and 24 53 in 0 100 cm soil layers respectively the mean swc in 0 200 cm soil layer of 0lm 0 9lm and 1 8lm was respectively increased by 4 4 3 7 and 20 3 in the small rainfall event 16 1 18 5 and 29 3 in the medium rainfall event and 8 2 8 3 and 16 8 in the large rainfall event 3 3 soil water storage during the rainy season because less p infiltrated into soil deeper than 0 100 cm the sws in 0 100 cm soil layers in 2020 2021 is shown in fig 3 the sws varied among rainfall events and it was generally the same at the beginning of the experimental period fig 3 a with mean values of 113 05 2 88 mm in 0 100 cm soil layers in 2020 08 04 the sws of 0lm 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm in 2020 08 22 was 96 14 128 95 141 65 and 139 17 higher than that in 2020 08 04 respectively the rainfall frequency was high during this period and the p value was 242 40 mm the sws in 2020 10 04 was increased by 68 88 mm in 0lm 94 44 mm in 0 6lm 88 30 mm in 1 2lm and 97 69 mm in 1 8lm than that in 2020 08 04 the sws was 129 00 5 44 mm in the five treatments in 2021 06 13 the sws in 0lm 0 9lm and 1 8lm was increased by 11 4 10 0 and 26 0 in 2021 06 13 2021 06 20 p 69 2 mm and the values were 9 8 16 6 and 29 6 in 2021 06 20 2021 07 16 p 20 6 mm respectively totally the sws was 28 3 17 9 20 3 54 0 and 50 9 higher in 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm in 2021 09 07 than in 2021 06 13 respectively high p values generally promote increases in sws and the δsws is also affected by litter mass for example the sws was 7 2 9 8 and 0 1 higher in the 0 100 cm soil layer in 0lm 0 6lm and 1 8lm in the medium rainfall event in 2021 07 16 2021 07 24 and the values were 23 24 68 01 and 44 97 in 2020 08 14 2020 08 20 respectively 3 4 throughfall partitioning according to water balance equation eq 4 the variation in the components of throughfall consumption is shown in fig 4 in this study continuous daily rainfall was regarded as one individual rainfall event in calculations of litter interception because the infiltration depth was less than 100 cm even under the large rainfall event fig 2 the sws for the 0 100 cm soil layer was calculated both in 2020 and 2021 the i increased with an increase of litter density and the value of i p was negatively correlated with p the relationship between δsws and litter mass was not clear in small and medium rainfall events and δsws and e t were positively and negatively correlated with litter mass in the large rainfall event fig 4 c respectively the amount of r generally decreased with the increases in litter mass in 2020 while r was high in 0 6lm and 1 2lm in 2021 the ratio of r to p was 21 8 for 0lm 8 0 for 0 6lm and 2 8 for 1 2lm in 2020 08 04 2020 08 22 fig 4 d which was a period with intense rainfall events and high throughfall the scarce throughfall caused a decrease in sws in 2020 08 22 2020 10 03 fig 4 e and 129 2 192 5 212 4 and 175 9 of p was consumed in e t in 0lm 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively similarly 86 4 100 8 and 97 4 of p was consumed in e t for 0lm 0 9lm and 1 8lm in 2021 06 13 2021 07 16 respectively and the value of δsws p was 0 6 12 0 and 17 0 respectively the value of δsws p was 26 2 in 0lm and 20 2 in 1 2lm in 2021 07 16 2021 08 12 and the value of δsws p was 51 7 in 0lm and 90 6 in 1 8lm in 2021 08 12 2021 09 07 totally the i p was 0 8 2 and 0 14 6 in 2020 and 2021 respectively the r p and δsws p were 25 5 and 23 4 in 0lm 7 4 and 32 1 in 0 6lm and 2 4 and 33 3 in 1 8lm in 2020 08 04 2020 10 03 respectively a total of 16 9 11 5 12 8 32 0 and 33 2 of p was stored in 0 100 cm soil layers in 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm in 2021 06 13 2021 09 07 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effects of litter mass on the runoff infiltration pattern vegetation litter plays an important role in runoff generation and throughfall infiltration which is an underestimated variable in forest hydrological processes walsh and voigt 1977 generally the r significantly decreases as leaf litter density increases regardless of the litter type boeken and orenstein 2001 jourgholami et al 2022 liu et al 2017b li et al 2014 found that the average runoff yield for the runoff plots with p tabuliformis litter was 31 3 lower than that for bare soil in this study the mean ɑ was 0 17 0 11 0 10 and 0 05 in 0lm 0 6lm 1 2 lm and 1 8lm in the rainy season of 2020 2021 respectively this was consistent with the findings of gomyo and kuraji 2016 and jourgholami et al 2022 showing that litter plays a significant role in hindering surface runoff leaf litter cover promotes the roughness of the soil surface absorbs the stroke from raindrops and results in decreased surface runoff and soil erosion however the ɑ in 0 6lm and 1 2lm was 25 4 and 46 2 higher than that in 0lm in 2021 respectively and r was promoted occasionally by increases in litter in the small medium and large rainfall events table 1 to clarify the relationship between rainfall properties and litter mass the rda was conducted based on the data in 2021 the results of the forward selection of environmental factors that affected runoff generation are shown in fig 5 ws was the first factor that was negatively correlated with ɑ in the five treatments and it explained 10 6 21 8 4 7 16 4 and 9 8 of ɑ in 0lm 0 6lm 0 9lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively generally higher rainfall intensity i30 i60 and imean promoted runoff generation in all treatments especially in 0 6lm p 0 05 p and swc in 0 10 cm soil layer contributed little to ɑ among this the swc in 0 10 cm soil layer contributed less than 10 to ɑ in treatments with litter cover the runoff yield is the result of the compound effect of many factors including meteorological factors rainfall property wind speed and wind direction plant density canopy closure and the roughness of the soil surface vegetation and litter in our study high litter density inhibited runoff generation table 1 the inhabitation of surface runoff was highest in 1 2lm fig s2 and the mean ɑ in 1 2lm was decreased by 10 0 than that in 1 8lm in 2020 wang et al 2020 and van stan et al 2017 also proved that lateral flow was generated more frequently in runoff plots with thick needle leaf litter as a result of the larger gaps and thin strip morphology of needle leaves compared to broad leaf litter needle leaf litter is more effective in hindering lateral flow under rainfall intensities of 50 mm h kim et al 2014 sato et al 2004 bochet et al 2006 further showed that litter cover reinforced the effect of canopy cover in controlling splash erosion at the plant scale especially for intense rainfall events moreover the relationship between ɑ and litter mass differed in 2020 and 2021 and this might partially stem from the greater ws which increased the nonuniformity of the throughfall distribution in the rainy season 2021 fig s3 furthermore litter promoted throughfall infiltration by litter water retention and further protected soil from sealing in this study the soil surface swc was highest in 1 8lm in the small rainfall event and the soil depth of the wetting front generally decreased with a decrease of litter density in the medium and large rainfall events fig 2 on the one hand litter cover collects throughfall and prolongs the time that rainfall is retained on the soil surface on the other hand the decomposed litter increases soil porosity and enhances continuous infiltration badu et al 2022 litt et al 2020 liu et al 2019 furthermore consistent with cui et al 2022 we found that the greatest infiltration depth was no more than 80 cm in 2020 even under the large rainfall and continuous rainfall events wang et al 2013 also showed that the wetting front of an artificial plantation was less than 60 cm six days after rainfall in clp suggesting that the swc measurement depth of 0 100 cm is sufficient for characterizing rainfall infiltration processes in loess areas 4 2 throughfall consumption and forest management litter promoted rainfall infiltration inhibited soil evaporation and enhanced soil water storage compared with bare soil litter cover alters the micro meteorological conditions of the soil surface and reduces evaporation rates cui et al 2022 magliano et al 2017 wilson et al 2000 the evaporation rate generally decreases with an increase in litter density in our study the swc in 0 20 cm soil layer decreased 32 8 in 0lm 29 8 in 0 6lm and 26 9 in 1 8lm during rainless days in 2020 08 22 2020 09 14 a total of 23 4 30 1 and 33 3 of p in 2020 08 04 2020 10 03 and 16 9 32 0 and 33 2 of p in 2021 06 13 2021 09 07 was stored in 0 100 soil layers in 0lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm respectively from the perspective of sws in 0 100 cm soil layers the relationship between p and δsws is shown in fig 6 litter cover promotes more throughfall infiltration and storage in the soil wang et al 2020 with the exception of 0 9lm there was a significant linear increase in δsws p with litter density in both rainfall events and the rainy seasons the correlation coefficient between p and δsws in the rainy season was smaller than that in the rainfall events which was caused by the increased proportion of e t p in the long term calculations fig 4 the swc in rainfall events greater than 100 mm was not observed in 2021 and meteorological variables had greater effects during the small and medium rainfall events which contributed in part to the underestimation of δsws in 0 9lm the δsws of 0 6lm and 0 9lm during rainfall events was similar fig 4 thus 0 9lm was not considered in the following discussion generally the sws was 52 3 45 8 and 25 4 higher in 1 8lm 1 2lm and 0 6lm respectively than in 0lm in 2020 2021 fig 6 b we also found that δsws was not positively correlated with litter mass fig 4 a b e and f this might stem from the weakening of the hydrological effect of litter and soil moisture dynamics were more affected by meteorological variables and the distribution of plant roots tonin et al 2017 xiong et al 2008 especially during small rainfall events and rainless periods moreover more throughfall is retained by impermeable p tabuliformis litter during small rainfall events du et al 2019 as the i increased with an increase in litter density table 1 which resulted in less infiltration and decreased δsws cui et al 2022 possible reasons for this phenomenon require further exploration overall the r p and i p were 0 199 and 0 0 096 and 0 032 0 072 and 0 059 and 0 032 and 0 087 in 0lm 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm in 2020 2021 the calculation method was similar to that applied in fig 6 b respectively the d could be neglected because little throughfall infiltrated to soil layers deeper than 100 cm fig 2 thus 53 7 54 1 48 4 and 47 9 of p were consumed in e t in 0lm 0 6lm 1 2lm and 1 8lm treatments in the rainy season of 2020 2021 respectively yearly accumulated litter alters soil surface microclimate reduces runoff and soil loss enhances soil organic matter and surface soil moisture and increases the number of species and annual plant biomass production boeken and orenstein 2001 fekete et al 2016 jia et al 2018 liu et al 2019 we found that increased litter mass enhanced i and sws and weakened the water consumption in r and e t however some findings indicated that thick litter promoted surface runoff and inhibited seed germination which was not conducive to the construction of understory vegetation communities eckstein and donath 2005 liu et al 2017a wang et al 2020 in p tabuliformis plantations the understory has less vegetation because the litter and root exudates of p tabuliformis depress seed germination berg and ekbohm 1991 combining with thick litter and high plantation density p tabuliformis plantations play a critical role in regional water management and soil conservation in our study the r p was 63 8 and 83 9 lower in 1 2lm and 1 8lm than in 0lm in the rainy season of 2020 2021 respectively and the values of sws p and e t p in 1 2lm and 1 8lm were similar moreover the actual litter mass of the p tabuliformis plantation was 1 2 kg m2 in our study area cui et al 2022 and the litter production and decomposition rate were approximately 0 3 kg m2 yr and 20 30 wang et al 2019 respectively the litter mass of the p tabuliformis plantation has recently been observed to fluctuate around 1 2 kg m2 the 1 2lm treatment was superior to the 1 8lm treatment in terms of ecohydrological benefits because the former allows more precipitation to enter the river while storing precipitation which helps alleviate decreases in streamflow and water shortage in clp therefore no human interference with the current litter density can not only labor saving but also enhances the ecohydrological function of litter the current amount of litter would be a reasonable density for promoting the sustainable and ecological development of forest our field experiment was conducted under natural conditions in clp more detailed information was not collected due to the limited instruments for example the time to runoff generation and the variation in r and δsws with time additional studies are needed to clarify the effect of litter density on soil properties and biochemistry nevertheless the results of our study provide new insights into the physical mechanism by which litter regulates hillslope hydrology these findings enhance our understanding of the ecohydrological function of litter and will aid water and forest management in clp 5 conclusions the role of vegetation litter in regional hydrological processes is often underestimated in clp a field experiment with different litter densities was conducted in a p tabuliformis plantation under natural rainfall we investigated the compound effect of rainfall properties and litter mass on throughfall infiltration runoff generation and δsws on rainfall events and the main rainy season in 2020 2021 we found that the infiltration depth and amount were enhanced when litter mass and precipitation were high and the infiltration depth of rainfall was no more than 80 cm in 2020 2021 the r and ɑ decreased as litter mass increased in the rainy season and the throughfall runoff pattern was also affected by meteorological variables e g ws and rainfall properties e g rainfall intensity in each rainfall event and the ɑ might be enhanced by thick needle leaf litter under intense rainfall events furthermore thick litter may prevent throughfall infiltration by throughfall interception this was responsible for the negative values of δsws during small rainfall events and rainless periods δsws p increased linearly with litter mass in the rainy season and the values of δsws p were 0 264 in 0lm 0 331 in 0 6lm 0 385 in 1 2lm and 0 402 in 1 8lm runoff generation was most strongly inhibited in 1 8lm treatment more rainfall entered streamflow in 1 2lm treatment and the water conservation capacity of 1 2lm was similar to that of 1 8lm the current litter density could provide a well ecohydrological function in regional water and forest management credit

2107,brazilian neoproterozoic carbonate rocks dating from about 740 590 million years ago contain the oldest karst structured terrains on earth resulting in groundwater flow pathways in highly heterogeneous and anisotropic conduit networks unlike paleozoic and mesozoic rocks in neoproterozoic karst systems groundwater circulates and stores practically through dissolution features characterized as tertiary porosity as the rock s primary porosity is recrystallized considered negligible however studies using hydrodispersive equilibrium and non equilibrium models to estimate flow and transport parameters to base the hydrodynamic behavior of these areas are not common this paper proposes this by a set of techniques involving dye tracer tests and the analysis of breakthrough tracer curves btcs in a highly karstified neoproterozoic terrain for this three karst springsheds in the east west and south areas of the são miguel river watershed in alto são francisco karst region brazil were choose and studied with dye tracer tests using rhodamine wt and uranine during dry and wet seasons associated with regional local hydro geological structural geomorphological and speleological data the results identified spatial and seasonal variations of water flow and transport parameters recharge and discharge zones and water dynamic and speleogenetic evolutions btcs models showed the karst systems are very dynamic with seasonal variations and heterogeneities bypass loops and stagnant zones control the variation of flow and transport parameters the hydrodispersive parameters mean flow velocity and longitudinal dispersion coefficient and coefficients of non equilibrium models partition β and mass transfer ω show a direct dependence on hydrogeological and speleogenetic contexts furthermore the comparison with other karst systems around the world showed that neoproterozoic karst has a more stable hydrodynamic behavior under hydrological conditions

complex conduit networks or cave systems tertiary porosity where groundwater can be transmitted and stored because surface drainages are generally poor due to sinking streams rivers city supplies are partially or totally dependent on groundwater worthington and ford 2009 moreover meteoric and surface waters can recharge the aquifer via sinkholes or cave entrances in a turbulent and rapid flow way

dynamically change over time due to cave roof collapses sediment filled passages water table fluctuations or overflow springs during high flow conditions the karst aquifer s high degrees of spatiotemporal parameters variations of water flow and transport processes such as hydraulic conductivity discharge flow velocity or dispersion coefficient make the understanding of water circulation

breakthrough curve btc method information about karst network and cave system flow and transport processes can be obtained hauns et al 2001 birk et al 2005 goldscheider 2008 morales et al 2010 dewaide

models can be simulated to achieve better adjustments of most curves providing minimal residual concentrations barberá et al 2017 these models are applied to solve the one dimensional advection dispersion equation bear 1979 and to obtain hydrodispersive parameters the equilibrium or advection dispersion model ad is based on a homogeneous medium and steady state flux not applicable for certain complexities from karst systems the two region nonequilibrium model 2rne considers the existence and interaction between two water fluid regions mobile and immobile which can be caused by sinuosity pools and sediment accumulation in conduits among others field and pinsky 2000 hauns et al 2001 morales et al 2010 other nonequilibrium models consider the interaction of matrix fracture storativity with water flow such as dade field and leij 2012 om made tinet et al 2019 and otis runkel 1998 dewaide et al 2016 models another karst heterogeneity is the multichannel conduits that separate the flow in several paths multiflow which is analyzed by multi dispersion models mdm maloszewski et al 1992 or multi double porosity and two region nonequilibrium model mdp 2rne bodin 2020 the são miguel river watershed southwest of the state of minas gerais brazil is an important and unique neoproterozoic dynamic karst region due to its geological and speleological relevance however detailed studies to understand the types of recharges underground circulation velocities or to identify quantify the various types of flow are still scarce hydrodispersive models to obtain water flow and transport parameters in brazilian neoproterozoic karst terrains in which the water is transmitted and stored mainly in tertiary porosity as the primary porosity is recrystallized is not common whereas most studies are developed in paleozoic and mesozoic limestones in the world the novelty of this paper is the first study of the hydrodynamic behavior of a neoproterozoic highly karstified area for this three brazilian karst systems in the são miguel river watershed were studied by carrying out fluorescent dye tracer tests during dry and rainy seasons high and low flow conditions and btcs were simulated using the equilibrium and nonequilibrium ad 2rne and mdp 2rne hydrodispersive models to obtain water flow and transport parameters regional local hydro geological structural geomorphological and speleological data were also combined with the models for hydrogeological conceptual models thus spatial and seasonal variations of water flow and transport parameters recharge discharge zones and water dynamic and speleogenetic evolutions were identified 2 site description the study area comprises three karst systems named east e 31 km2 west w 25 km2 and south s 13 km2 within the são miguel river watershed 520 km2 southwest of the state of minas gerais brazil fig 1 the area is at the alto são francisco karst region where several karst features such as sinkholes sink streams caves poljes and underground drainages are common saadi et al 1998 pizarro et al 2001 santos 2002 see 2012 timo 2014 2022 martins and rodrigues 2016 the region is known for its limestone mining and agricultural pasture activities having as the main cities pains and arcos fig 1 geologically the region is in the southwest of the são francisco basin in the são francisco craton where the archean basement and bambuí group s neoproterozoic sequences outcrop alkmim and martins neto 2001 ribeiro et al 2007 the basement is represented by granitoids and gneisses occurring in the eastern the samburá formation composed of metaconglomerates and pelites outcrop in the southwest region the predominant rocks in watershed are the pelitic carbonatic rocks of the sete lagoas formation divided into two members pedro leopoldo base impure limestones with intercalations of pelites and siltstones in the north and northeast and lagoa santa upper pure limestones and dolomites with stromatolitic facies and intraformational breccia in central east west and south portions meyer 2018 vernooy 2019 the cenozoic sediments are constituted of gravel sandy and muddy alluvial deposits occurring along the são miguel river and its tributaries and in topographically lower regions of the watershed félix and freitas júnior 2000 the watershed is over the boundary with the brasília belt to the west where a thrust fault system of brasiliano age is occurred resulting in compressive deformations of the formations where n60 70w sinistral transcurrent faults doresópólis pains cut the entire basin these faults define two distinct deformation zones folded limestones western region and sub horizontal limestones eastern region some authors propose that these structures were reactivated in the cenozoic resulting in hosts and grabens that later influenced the evolution of karstification in the region muzzi magalhães 1989 saadi et al 1998 valeriano 2019 the climate is humid subtropical with the dry

and actual evapotranspiration of 834 mm lucon et al 2020 hydrologically the são miguel river flows northwards along 53 km with meander morphology before flowing into the main são francisco river in the southeast region there is a predominance of underground flow due to the high karstification of the lagoa santa member s limestones in southwestern a dendritic drainage pattern is noted due to siliciclastic rocks from the samburá formation that is a non karstic terrain dias and velásques 2002 haddad 2007 lucon et al 2020 the well developed karst geomorphology and speleology are noted by

structural lineaments and fractures of nw se ns we directions where the structural framework has a significant influence on local hydrodynamics ferrari et al 2018 lucon et al 2020 the other types of aquifers fractured and porous media are associated with rocks from the basement and cenozoic sediments respectively having lower productivity and secondary importance compared to the karst aquifer 3 materials and methods this research was carried out in three stages 1 database analysis 2 fieldworks and 3 data processing for a better understanding of the flow and transport processes several methods were used and integrated detailed below 3 1 geological structural geomorphological and speleological investigations regional geological data were collected from maps by ribeiro et al 2007 piumhi sheet sf23 v bii 1 100 000 scale muzzi magalhães 1989 and félix and freitas júnior 2000 1 50 000 scale the identification of structural lineaments and karst geomorphological features were made from digital terrain models and analysis of regional images from the alos palsar satellite 12 5 m resolution and local images of drone mavicpro 2 model 15 cm resolution then fieldwork was made for data validations in addition the following data were considered detailing of the drone high resolution topography using arcgis 10 5 and autocad 2021 software georeferencing of cave entrances based on data from the national center for research and conservation of caves cecav and the brazilian society of speleology sbe as well as complementary data on vadose conduits mapped of caves by guano and agster groups pains speleogroup epa 1996 and excursionist and speleological society see 2012 see 2020 in addition mappings of groundwater conduits in some areas were carried out by the espeleomergulho brazil group all the data helped in the choices and delimitations of the three representative neoproterozoic karst systems e w s and the definition of the injection and sampling points of the dye tracer tests all data contributed to the generation of all maps used in the paper and the hydrogeological sections of the e w and s systems 3 2 dye tracer tests in september 2020 dry season and april 2021 rainy season dye tracer tests dirac pulse injections ender et al 2018 were carried out in each season four underground flow routes four injection points ip and six sampling points sp in active and accessible caves sinkholes and springs were identified resulting in three karst systems fig 2 the dye tracers used were sodium fluorescein uranine cas no 518 47 8 and rhodamine wt cas no 37299 86 8 both tracers have distinct ranges of emission and electromagnetic spectrum and the field fluorimeter has channels that identify each of these tracers separately therefore there is no interference when mixing these two types of tracer dyes in the east system 200 g of rhodamine wt were injected into the lagoa do retiro cave ip1 and 300 g of uranine into the narigudo cave ip2 the monitoring of the tracers was carried out inside the mastodonte cave sp1 and in timburé spring sp2 in this system two sections were defined 1 section a a route ip1 sp1 and 2 section b b route ip2 sp1 in the west system 300 g of uranine were injected into the mina sinkhole ip3 being monitored in the socrates spring sp3 inside the eden cave sp4 and in the angolinha spring sp5 this route was considered as section c c in the south system 300 g of uranine were injected into the múcio sinkhole ip4 and monitored in the múcio spring sp6 the section d d fig 2 the volume of injected tracers and monitoring points were the same in both climate seasons and tracer monitoring was made by using three field fluorometers albillia ggun fl30 models 1650 1920 1921 schnegg 2002 calibrated before each injection with a time step between measurements of 15 min before each test using the field fluorometers the fluorescence background concentrations of each karst system were recorded for 24 h to correct possible tracer concentration values the summary of injection and sampling information is shown in table 1 and fig 2 discharge measurements were made in the minimum and maximum flow conditions of the systems using a current meter model usgs type aa price rickly hydrological co where the accuracy of flow measurements is 5 herschy 2002 according to marques et al publishing who studied the same karst systems discharge rates tend to be constant not exhibiting strong fluctuations except after rain events as there were no precipitation throughout the duration of the tests the discharges were assumed constant

benischke 2021 factors such as retardation and adsorption were not considered as uranine and rhodamine wt have low rates of adsorption and degradation mull et al 1988 benischke et al 2007 the

or parallel channel which divide the flow multi flow after the input but meet again in the output of the system assuming there is no mass exchange between channels bodin 2020 in this study 4 channels were adopted because it provided the best btc fits and the fewest errors during the modeling analysis due to the complexity of the model there is no analytical solution so the use of the pest software is needed to calculate partial derivatives using finite difference models doherty 2019 only this model uses numerical solutions for parameter estimates to complement the analysis of the seasonal

fig 3 which share the same sampling points sp1 and sp2 fig 2 discharges between dry and rainy seasons varied in sp1 from 360 m3 h to 1 065 m3 h and in sp2 from 425 m3 h to 1 488 m3 h respectively fig 3 in section a a the red rhodamine wt route ip1 sp1 fig 2 had tracer mass recovery r varying between dry and rain from 69 to 98 with decreases in mean transit time tm from 69 h to 30 h in time of first detection t1 from 49 h to 20 h and at peak times tp from 56 h to 25 h however it showed a slight increase in peak concentration cp from 30 6 µg l to 39 4 µg l compared with route ip1 sp1 the following ip1 sp2 route showed similar values of r 65 to 97 also with a decrease between dry and rain in values of tm 116 h to 47 h t1 84 h to 39 h tp 105 h to 45 h and the also increase in cp 13 2 µg l to 17 9 µg l fig 3 in section b b the green uranine route ip2 sp1 fig 2 had tracer mass recovery r ranged from 91 to 99 with tm decreasing from 59 h to 31 h t1 from 40 h to 20 h tp from 49 h to 24 h but unlike section a a cp decreases from 57 1 µg l to 38 3 µg l in the following route ip2 sp2 r varied from 66 to 83 maintaining the decreasing trend in tm values from 107 h to 51 h t1 from 74 h to 36 h tp from 99 h to 43 h and cp from 20 3 µg l to 14 4 µg l fig 3 in general with the increase in discharge during the rainy season tracer mass recoveries were greater and transit first arrival and peak times were shorter in both sections however peak concentrations had an opposite behavior increasing in a a and decreasing in the b b 4 1 2 west system in the west system six btcs were obtained between seasons for section c c s three sampling points sp3 sp4 sp5 uranine route fig 2 in sp3 discharge varied from 569 m3 h to 834 m3 h in sp4 from 587 m3 h to 911 m3 h and in sp5 from 594 m3 h to 1 084 m3 h fig 3 the route ip3 sp3 presented a variation of r from 56 to 68 with decreases in tm from 75 h to 52 h t1 from 42 h to 19 h tp from 61 h to 30 h and cp from 10 1 µg l to 7 7 µg l route ip3 sp4 had r ranging from 68 to 93 maintaining the decreasing trend in tm from 118 h to 73 h t1 from 82 h to 39 h tp from 106 h to 53 h and cp from 10 3 µg l to 8 9 µg l in ip3 sp5 r ranged from 48 to 79 with decreases in tm from 140 h to 91 h t1 from 106 h to 50 h tp from 169 h to 25 h but a slight increase in cp from 13 2 µg l to 17 9 µg l fig 3 comparing all routes an increase in tracer mass recoveries and a decrease in mean transit times time of first detection and peak times and peak concentration coupled with an increase in discharges during the rainy season can be seen however it is a noteworthy fact that the tracer mass recovery is greater downstream in sp4 eden cave and in sp5 angolinha spring and lower upstream in sp3 socrates spring both in dry and in rainy seasons fig 3 being explained in the discussion item 4 1 3 south system in the south system two btcs were obtained for the only green uranine route ip4 sp6 route of the section d d fig 2 where the discharge varies from 97 m3 h to 370 m3 h between the dry and rain seasons fig 3 the tracer mass recovery r variation between seasons was practically the same 42 to 43 regarding the values related to the time parameters the decreasing trends observed in systems e and w were maintained with tm from 104 h to 32 h t1 from 62 h to 14 h tp from 89 h to 22 h and cp from 39 6 µg l to 20 6 µg l fig 3 in general with the increase in discharge during the rainy season there were a decrease in values of mean transit times time of first detection and peak concentration times however there was almost no seasonal variation in tracer mass recovery 4 1 4 comparing karst systems regarding the discharge seasonal variabilities the e system presented the highest values followed by the s system and the w system with the smallest variations however regarding the seasonal variations of btcs the s system had the greatest variations followed by the e system and the w system with the smallest variations in all systems the tracer mass recovery is always greater in the rainy season except in the s system where the recovery was practically constant all karst systems have breakthrough curves in general characterized by tailing effects the e system tending to have a more positive asymmetry of the peak concentration while the w system displaying smoother and wider shapes with longer tails the s system shows the more irregular shape with secondary concentration multi peaks more pronounced during the rainy season which is the system with the greater discrepancy in btc patterns between seasons compared to the others fig 3 as expected discharge variations during dry and rainy seasons directly affect flow and transport parameters however this influence is noted differently in each karst system 4 2 groundwater flow and transport models 4 2 1 east system both in sections a a and b b in dry and rainy seasons the three models ad 2rne mdp 2rne presented in general coefficients of determination r2 and modified nash sutcliffe efficiencies ej 1 with high linear statistical adjustments calculated values versus observed values of btc where ad models presented r2 0 95 and ej 1 0 69 while 2rne and mdp 2rne models obtained r2 0 99 and ej 1 0 89 mdp 2rne model as btcs exhibited only one concentration peak the model adopted only one analysis channel table 2 and fig 4 regarding the hydrodispersive parameters that is mean flow velocity vm and longitudinal dispersion coefficient dl the three models indicate a general increase in these parameters following a significant increase in mean maximum velocities between dry 77 27 m h and rainy 175 54 m h seasons ad model shows mean vm ranging from 60 21 m h to 133 98 m h and dl from 894 m2 h to 2 092 m2 h for 2rne model the vm ranging from 55 87 m h to 125 98 m h and dl from 516 m2 h to 811 m2 h mdp 2rne model 1 channel indicated a variation in vm from 61 51 m h to 139 34 m h and dl from 573 m2 h to 926 m2 h table 2 the partition β and mass transfer ω coefficients mean respectively the proportion of mobile fluid region and interaction exchange between the two fluid regions mobile and immobile and were calculated only in nonequilibrium 2rne and mdp 2rne models in general when there are high discharge conditions the β values increase in routes of section a a and decrease in routes of section b b the ω values increase in both sections but more significantly in section a a with the increasing discharge table 2 and fig 4 4 2 2 west system during the seasons the section c c presented r2 0 86 and ej 1 0 62 running ad models while 2rne models obtained r2 0 98 and ej 1 0 89 and models mdp 2rne r2 0 99 and ej 1 0 98 the mdp 2rne model presented a better fit of btc compared to 2rne model although indicating higher uncertainties in this system btcs exhibited more than one concentration peak and for a better model a 4 channels mdp 2rne model was adopted the hydrodispersive parameters vm and dl had a progressive increase along the tracer path followed by an increase in average maximum velocities between dry 35 15 m h and rainy 70 18 m h seasons the ad model shows mean vm ranging from 25 40 m h to 43 27 m h while dl from 678 m2 h to 4 734 m2 h for 2rne model the vm ranging from 23 55 m h to 37 40 m h and dl from 115 m2 h to 622 m2 h mdp 2rne model 4 channels showed variation in vm from 25 02 m h to 41 79 m h and dl from 110 m2 h to 1 039 m2 h table 3 the β and ω coefficients in both routes of the section c c decreased significantly at high discharge rates however when compared spatially a progressive increase of β and ω is noted along the routes both in dry and rainy seasons table 3 and fig 5 4 2 3 south system during the seasons the section d d presented r2 0 89 and ej 1 0 68 applying ad model while 2rne obtained r2 0 99 and ej 1 0 91 and mdp 2rne showed r2 0 97 and ej 1 0 86 mdp 2rne model presented a better btc fit compared to the others as in the west system the south system has btcs exhibiting more than one concentration peak and therefore a 4 channels mdp 2rne model was also adopted the vm and dl showed increasing discharge conditions followed by increasing mean maximum velocities between dry 12 30 m h and rainy 56 13 m h seasons ad model shows vm ranging from 8 29 m h to 34 49 m h and dl varying from 64 m2 h to 582 m2 h for 2rne the vm mean values range from 7 33 m h to 22 02 m h and dl from 19 m2 h to 310 m2 h mdp 2rne 4 channels presented higher uncertainties in which vm varied from 45 00 m h to 29 96 m h and dl from 404 m2 h to 133 m2 h the β and ω coefficients significantly decreased under high discharge conditions table 3 and fig 5 4 2 4 comparing karst systems the nonequilibrium models 2rne and mdp 2rne fit better for estimating the parameters of the three systems although the 2rne model presents lower uncertainties the east system showed the highest mean values of β and the smallest one for ω thus there is a higher proportion of mobile fluid regions which have a lower interaction with immobile fluid regions on the other hand the west and south systems have lower mean values of β and higher mean values of ω which means there is a slightly smaller proportion of mobile fluid regions and higher interaction with immobile fluid regions 5 discussion 5 1 karst hydrogeological conceptual model 5 1 1 east system the absence of surface drainage associated with the presence of several epiphreatic and phreatic caves with perennial groundwater flow in addition to several sinkholes and cave entrances indicates the east system is the most karstified area in the são miguel river watershed confirmed by menegasse et al 2002 pereira et al 2019 and lucon et al 2020 the high karstification can be explained by the large difference in altitude between recharge and discharge zones resulting in high values of hydraulic gradients contributing to the increase in the process of dissolution and denudation of the karst relief fig 6 these terrain slopes may relate to regional structural configurations resulting in a basement structured by hosts and grabens pointed out by santos 2002 most cave entrances are between 730 and 850 m altitudes characterized by speleothems formed by chemical precipitation from dripping water and by the absence of underground drainage indicating these caves are in the vadose zone of the aquifer corroborating the hypothesis that some of the caves were formed during the first stage of karst evolution saadi et al 1998 santos 2002 the caves lagoas do retiro narigudo mastodonte and loca feia are in the aquifer s epiphreatic and phreatic zones and constitute a set of caves that represent the second and current stage of karst evolution with totally phreatic levels reactivated during high discharge rates saadi et al 1998 santos 2002 the retiro lake and other lakes pointed at section a a fig 6 exert a hydraulic control of the recharge water level and hence control the speleogenesis of this system palmer 2007 this control mechanism is also found in other karst regions of brazil such as the karst region of lagoa santa auler 1995 furthermore autogenic recharge occurs via sinkholes cave entrances and epikarst areas where subvertical fractures and regional nw trending left lateral strike slip systems control the directions of active conduits and groundwater flow confirmed by dye tracers this system is in the undeformed rocks proposed by muzzi magalhães 1989 confirmed in fieldwork by the presence of lagoa santa member s limestone and dolomite with sub horizontal bedding planes the overall timburé spring divided by main and secondary springs both perennial constitutes the system s main discharge zone being the region s underflow this spring is close to the right bank of the são miguel river of lower elevations between 695 and 700 m the limestone rocks are folded with nw dip indicating this system s discharge is influenced by structural and hydraulic controls the btc patterns featured by just one concentration peak and long tailing effect indicate that most of the flow is transmitted in the main conduit with the presence of some underground pools field and pinsky 2000 these pools are probably formed due to the sinuosity and sediment deposition along the conduits confirmed in epiphreatic and phreatic caves the increase in discharge between sp1 and sp2 fig 3 indicates that there is are distributary channel s that contribute significantly to the increase in discharge inflow on the other hand the loss of tracer in some part between ip1 sp1 in section b b indicates leakage to another spring outflow noted during the dry season fig 3 and table 2 this hypothesis is supported by indirect confirmations via stable isotopes and hydrochemistry of hydraulic interconnection in a spring close to pains lucon et al 2020 furthermore as the system routes are all underground the possibility of tracer degradation via exposure and adsorption is not considered there is also tracer loss between sp1 sp2 common to sections a a and b b fig 3 table 2 although this loss may be related to the redistribution in the timburé s secondary spring the high mass recovery rates in the rainy season table 2 can be explained by the saturation of the discontinuities that intersect the main conduit possibly fracture planes secondary conduits this saturation helps to avoid tracer losses as the internal hydrostatic pressure within the conduit is higher the recovery decreases in the dry season as the discontinuities are not fully saturated leading to redirections of the tracer and subsequent losses it is noteworthy to mention that the primary porosity of the system is nearly negligible with a value of only 3 peñaranda 2016 as a result there is minimal loss of tracer to the matrix this general characteristic is also applicable to other systems regarding the flow and transport parameters the increase in mean flow velocities and longitudinal dispersion coefficients in sections a a and b b are related to the significant increase in rainfall values fig 6 this system proves to be the most dynamic one with more rapid variations and responses during dry and rainy seasons probably related to the high degrees of karstification and high recharge rate conditions 5 1 2 west system the main characteristic of this system is the presence of karst windows along the flowpath allowing the ground water to be flow along the surface until it disappears again at the final sinkhole in section c c the presence of at least three of these is observed represented upstream by the mina window upstream the sócrates window in the middle and the angolinha window downstream fig 7 these findings were also noted by freitas 2009 and ferrari et al 2018 authors who studied the same system these karst windows are probably related to the local structural geology conditioning them to anticlines synclines folded systems goldscheider 2005 because of it the flow is orthogonal to fold axes in addition to subvertical fractures faults allowing the formation of phreatic conducts with multiple loops ford and williams 2007 letting the water to flow in surface stretches and then return to underground enlarged bedding planes the nw se structural lineaments are related both to fold axes and to nw trending left lateral strike slip systems muzzi magalhães 1989 where n s lineaments related to posterior normal faults cut the overall structures saadi 1991 fig 7 it is possible to affirm that this system s structural framework is the most complex and folded than the other systems furthermore this system is within the deformed limestone and dolomite zone proposed by muzzi magalhães 1989 confirmed by field mapping and corroborating freitas 2009 in the western portion of the system the recharge is diffuse allogenic through soil and epikarst forming smaller springs giving origin to the mina stream in the central portion where c c section is located the recharge is autogenic represented both by captures of the mina stream sinking stream at the ip3 point and occasionally by sinkholes and cave entrances with infiltration being via subvertical fractures faults until reaching the saturated zones of the aquifer fig 7 the saae spring being the main discharge of the system is close to the left bank of the são miguel river characterized by upward flow probably caused by the loops it is worth noting that this spring is an important water catchment point used for public supply to pains the btc patterns presenting multiple concentration peaks indicate the presence of anastomosed conduits bypass dividing the flow into more than one direction multi flow to meet again before the system outlet according to palmer 2007 anastomosed cave patterns are common when recharge is done through sinkholes or sinking streams furthermore associated with the multipeak pattern there is the long tailing effect indicating the existence of some underground pools and lakes field and pinsky 2000 this hypothesis is supported by the analysis of btcs where at the point sp3 downstream a less tracer mass recovery occurred compared to the point sp4 upstream fig 3 indicating a tracer deviation before sp3 and after recovery in sp4 both in dry and rainy seasons furthermore there is a small increase in discharge between some stretches of the c c section indicating the existence of distributary channel s that contribute to the increase in flow but with losses of the tracer along the way through other springs or even by the degradation and adsorption in soils when the tracer is exposed to the surface in some karst windows an indication for this hypothesis is the fact that the greatest losses occur in the dry season due to longer transit times and contact with dry soils promoting adsorption and exposure to sunlight resulting in possible degradation regarding the flow and transport parameters there is a progressive increase in mean flow velocities and a longitudinal dispersion along the way fig 7 due to the greater distance between the injection point ip3 and the sampling point sp5 in addition there is an increase in these parameters during the rain which may be related to the increase in discharge indicating that the system is hydrodynamically more stable in relation to the others 5 1 3 south system in this system there was difficulty in obtaining speleological data in addition it presents the smallest distances compared to the other sections and routes however the structural data indicate the framework is related to nw trending left lateral strike slip systems in addition to sets of n s and ne sw conjugate fractures based on fieldwork and photointerpretation this system is in a transition zone between folded and horizontalized limestones corroborating muzzi magalhães 1989 recharge is mainly autogenic via sinkholes with concentrated infiltration via subvertical fractures faults the main discharge is the múcio spring giving origin to the barra stream constituting the most upstream spring of the são miguel river watershed the main hydrodynamic feature of the system is the differences between the btc patterns during dry and rainy seasons fig 3 the curves also showed several concentration peaks multipeak and long tailing effects that indicate the presence of bypass and two flow regions as in the western system however this discrepancy in the curve may still indicate an influence of interaction with storage particularly in fractures or the presence of large immobile fluid regions or underground lakes dewaide et al 2018 in addition the latter is explained by the low mass tracer recovery due to the high interaction with stagnant zones developed in storage fractures 5 2 hydrodispersive models and hydrodynamic behavior of karstic systems the types and mechanisms of recharge and discharge reflect in the formation of karstification and patterns in the development of the network of conduits caves in all systems the recharge is influenced by watershed hydraulic control however in the e system there is also a hydraulic control palmer 2007 added by the retiro lake where the springs are perennial of the base level type underflow with ascending flow furthermore the action of the underground flow itself generates the speleogenesis and at the same time its hydraulic properties are influenced by karstification in a process of self organization of the karst network worthington and ford 2009 the heterogeneities of the systems structural and stratigraphic allow a greater presence of formation of stagnant flow zones and anastomosed conduits bypass and loops that control the flow rate and dispersion fig 8 the geological structural hydrogeological and speleological contexts influence both route and hydraulic conditions of the flow this influence is noted in btcs and in flow and transport parameters which are also influenced by climatological and hydrological variations between dry and rainy seasons these variations are quite different between the systems with a greater variation in the east system compared to the others fig 8 the adm model did not consider all the karst complexities since there is a simplification and hence the uncertainties of the estimated parameters were greater the 2rne model toride et al 1993 considers the existence of immobile and mobile fluid regions and their interaction between them which is common in karst and observed in all systems neither the adm and 2rne models consider the possibility of more than one concentration peak in btcs caused by bypass and or pools by the tracer pathways on the other hand the mdp 2rne model bodin 2020 considers these complexities and combinations of heterogeneities proving to be the most efficient for the w and s systems although it presents more uncertainties mainly in the β and ω parameters when compared to the 2rne model the tracer mass recovery levels were higher during the rainy season in all three systems with two explanations being raised due to the rise of the water table and consequently the increase of hydraulic pressure in the conduits resulting in faster water flow to discharge zones and due to climatological seasonal variabilities which modify the limits of the sprinsheds receiving more recharge rates from other areas or reactivating their own conduits goldscheider 2005 hydrodynamically the e system showed the highest mean values and the highest seasonal differences between vm and dl parameters figs 4 and 5 tables 2 and 3 this can also be seen in fig 8 where by the relation between reynolds and peclet numbers variations in flow conditions show that the east system tends to be in more turbulent conditions compared to other systems with increasing flows 5 3 comparing flow and transport parameters of neoproterozoic study area to paleozoic mesozoic karst systems the criterion adopted was to compare studies of tracers that considered the equilibrium adm and non equilibrium 2rne models in different flow conditions the studies by morales et al 2010 and aydin et al 2014 used only the adm model the parameters of mean flow velocity vm and dispersivity d calculated the ratio between dl and vm were chosen as comparison attributes as they represent the advection and dispersion of the flow the relationship between d and vm indicates a significant difference between karst systems associated with paleozoic mesozoic and neoproterozoic carbonate rocks fig 9 and table 4 in mesozoic karst systems of europe associated with carbonates from the cretaceous and jurassic morales et al 2010 barberá et al 2017 goeppert et al 2020 there is a trend towards higher values of d and lower vm purple crux blue diamond and orange circle in fig 9 in asia in a karst system related to paleozoic carboniferous permian limestones ender et al 2018 and jurassic aydin et al 2014 there is a trend of lower values of d and higher values of vm green square and pink circle in fig 9 in the case of this paper yellow triangle in fig 9 neoproterozoic karst system has lower values of d and vm when compared to the other systems in addition to showing a smaller dispersion of these parameters thus in the highly karstified neoproterozoic systems the observed hydrodispersive patterns such as two nonequilibrium regions bypass multiflow and the combination of the then are also noted in the paleozoic mesozoic karst systems this demonstrates that these models can be applied in different types of geological and hydrological contexts comparing with more recent carbonate rocks from paleozoic to mesozoic indicates that flow and transport parameters of the neoproterozoic karst system are more hydrodynamically stable with smaller variations of these parameters under different flow conditions an explanation for this behavior is because they are older terrains and therefore had more time for speleogenetic evolution that result in a well established karst network the distances of the routes are reasonably similar at the scale of hydrological basins that is they would not be a determining factor for the comparison of parameters however factors such as hydraulic gradient conduit sinuosities porosity flow matrix interaction and climatic conditions should be considered they have a great influence on the variation of these parameters as the comparisons are being made in systems in different regions of the world a similarity observed in both studies was the long tailing effect in btcs in the case of recent karsts this pattern may be associated with interaction with the matrix primary porosity while in neoproterozoic karst there is no such interaction with the matrix due to its low porosity and permeability and the long tailing effect can be explained by the interaction with underground lakes and more fractured regions water within secondary porosity therefore the non equilibrium models 2rne and mdp 2rne were the best that represented the systems in this paper 4 channels were considered as they provided the best btc adjustments with smaller errors it is important to emphasize that the number of channels adopted in the model cannot necessarily represent the real number of channels in the flowpath but it is the best mathematical solution for a complex question without real field information thus for a better generalization it is important to have more real field data 6 conclusions on a regional scale the são miguel river watershed has different geological structural hydrogeological and speleogenetic contexts two distinct regions are recognized one less folded represented by sub horizontal bedding plane limestones east system and the other one constituted of more folded and faulted limestones west and south systems on a local scale the east system proved to be the simplest and the west and south systems the most heterogenic and anisotropic being this complexity related to degrees of fracturing and tectonic deformations where the action of water and speleogenesis enable the formation of anastomosed conduits bypass loops lakes and underground pools these heterogeneities directly reflect on the geometric patterns of the breakthrough tracer curves btc and in flow and transport parameters bypass causes multiflows by modifying btc patterns due to several concentration peaks the combination of pools and bypass in the same system increases the interaction between mobile and immobile fluid regions noted in the west system in general the nonequilibrium and multiflow models 2rne and mdp 2rne have the best fits in the tracer restitution curves considering the complexities and heterogeneities of the systems the karst systems of the são miguel basin proved to be quite dynamic considering seasonal variations especially the east system the hydrodispersive parameters mean flow velocity vm and longitudinal dispersion coefficient dl increase with the increase in discharges during the rainy season parameters of non equilibrium models partition β and mass transfer ω behave in different ways between the systems showing a direct dependence on hydrogeological and speleogenetic contexts the differences between the paleozoic mesozoic and neoproterozoic karst systems show that both have a direct influence on factors such as hydraulic gradient conduit sinuosity porosity flow matrix interaction and hydrological conditions however the variation of flow and transport parameters indicate that the neoproterozoic karst system tends to be more hydrodynamically stable due to its well established karst network the spatial and temporal details of flow and transport parameters are fundamental to understanding the hydrodynamics of complex karst systems the knowledge of variations in transit times and mean flow velocities serve as decision making tools in case of potential aquifer contaminations in addition to contributing to the local groundwater management in karst areas as is the case in the city of pains brazil credit

2107,brazilian neoproterozoic carbonate rocks dating from about 740 590 million years ago contain the oldest karst structured terrains on earth resulting in groundwater flow pathways in highly heterogeneous and anisotropic conduit networks unlike paleozoic and mesozoic rocks in neoproterozoic karst systems groundwater circulates and stores practically through dissolution features characterized as tertiary porosity as the rock s primary porosity is recrystallized considered negligible however studies using hydrodispersive equilibrium and non equilibrium models to estimate flow and transport parameters to base the hydrodynamic behavior of these areas are not common this paper proposes this by a set of techniques involving dye tracer tests and the analysis of breakthrough tracer curves btcs in a highly karstified neoproterozoic terrain for this three karst springsheds in the east west and south areas of the são miguel river watershed in alto são francisco karst region brazil were choose and studied with dye tracer tests using rhodamine wt and uranine during dry and wet seasons associated with regional local hydro geological structural geomorphological and speleological data the results identified spatial and seasonal variations of water flow and transport parameters recharge and discharge zones and water dynamic and speleogenetic evolutions btcs models showed the karst systems are very dynamic with seasonal variations and heterogeneities bypass loops and stagnant zones control the variation of flow and transport parameters the hydrodispersive parameters mean flow velocity and longitudinal dispersion coefficient and coefficients of non equilibrium models partition β and mass transfer ω show a direct dependence on hydrogeological and speleogenetic contexts furthermore the comparison with other karst systems around the world showed that neoproterozoic karst has a more stable hydrodynamic behavior under hydrological conditions

reservoirs in which 16 of the world s population lives under these resources goldscheider et al 2020 in south america about 5 are karst regions in mountain areas andes mountain range chen et al 2017

spatiotemporal parameters variations of water flow and transport processes such as hydraulic conductivity discharge flow velocity or dispersion coefficient make the understanding of water circulation difficult requiring specific techniques and method integration bakalowicz 2005 ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 in the case of brazilian neoproterozoic karst areas e g groups bambuí una açungui it is common rocks where karstification processes took place enlarging bedding planes intersected with subvertical fractures however the brasiliano cycle almeida 1977 featured by a series of orogenies faulted and bended these rocks due to stresses coming from different levels of deformation magnitude alkmim and martins neto 2001 the result is the rock s primary porosity being recrystallized and becoming much smaller 3 peñaranda 2016 with a very low matrix permeability 10 16 10 15 m2 and the secondary porosity filled mostly by calcite or quartz galvão et al 2015 hydrogeologically unlike paleozoic and mesozoic rocks budd and vacher 2004 lancia et al 2018 abdullah 2021 most groundwater circulates and stores only through tertiary porosity features galvão et al 2015 fluorescent dye tracers synthetic organic substances with fluorescence properties normally absent in natural waters safe for human health and highly detectable are widely used in karst hydrogeology being an excellent tool in understanding karst systems sodium fluorescein uranine and rhodamine wt are the main conservative tracers used for quantitative analysis smart 2005 palmer 2007 benischke et al 2007 leibundgut et al 2009 benischke 2021 the qualitative approach can determine springshed boundaries and subsurface hydraulic connections delineate spring s catchment areas validate maps of groundwater vulnerability to contamination and understand surface water groundwater relationships the quantitative approach is based on solute transport principles and by applying the breakthrough curve btc method information about karst network and cave system flow and transport processes can be obtained hauns et al 2001 birk et al 2005 goldscheider 2008 morales et al 2010 dewaide

models can be simulated to achieve better adjustments of most curves providing minimal residual concentrations barberá et al 2017 these models are applied to solve the one dimensional advection dispersion equation bear 1979 and to obtain hydrodispersive parameters the equilibrium or advection dispersion model ad is based on a homogeneous medium and steady state flux not applicable for certain complexities from karst systems the two region nonequilibrium model 2rne considers the existence and interaction between two water fluid regions mobile and immobile which can be caused by sinuosity pools and sediment accumulation in conduits among others field and pinsky 2000 hauns et al 2001 morales et al 2010 other nonequilibrium models consider the interaction of matrix fracture storativity with water flow such as dade field and leij 2012 om made tinet et al 2019 and otis runkel 1998 dewaide et al 2016 models another karst heterogeneity is the multichannel conduits that

the são miguel river watershed southwest of the state of minas gerais brazil is an important and unique neoproterozoic dynamic karst region due to its geological and speleological relevance however detailed studies to understand the types of recharges underground circulation velocities or to identify quantify the various types of flow are still scarce hydrodispersive models to obtain water flow and transport parameters in brazilian neoproterozoic karst terrains in which the water is transmitted and stored mainly in tertiary porosity as the primary porosity is recrystallized is not common whereas most studies are developed in paleozoic and mesozoic limestones in the world the novelty of this paper is the first study of the hydrodynamic behavior of a neoproterozoic highly karstified area for this three brazilian karst systems in the são miguel river watershed were studied by carrying out fluorescent dye tracer tests during dry and rainy seasons high and low flow conditions and btcs were simulated using the equilibrium and nonequilibrium ad 2rne and mdp 2rne hydrodispersive models to obtain water flow and transport parameters regional local hydro geological structural geomorphological and speleological data were also combined with the models for hydrogeological conceptual models thus spatial and seasonal variations of water flow and transport parameters recharge discharge zones and water dynamic and speleogenetic evolutions were identified 2 site description the study area comprises three karst systems named east e 31 km2 west w 25 km2 and south s 13 km2 within the são miguel river watershed 520 km2 southwest of the state of minas gerais brazil fig 1 the area is at the alto são francisco karst region where several karst features such as sinkholes sink streams caves poljes and underground drainages are common saadi et al 1998 pizarro et al 2001 santos 2002 see 2012 timo 2014 2022 martins and rodrigues 2016 the region is known for its limestone mining and agricultural pasture activities having as the main cities pains and arcos fig 1 geologically the region is in the southwest of the são francisco basin in the são francisco craton where the archean basement and bambuí group s neoproterozoic sequences outcrop alkmim and martins neto 2001 ribeiro et al 2007 the basement is represented by granitoids and gneisses occurring in the eastern the samburá formation composed of metaconglomerates and pelites outcrop in the southwest region the predominant rocks in watershed are the pelitic carbonatic rocks of the sete lagoas formation divided into two members pedro leopoldo base impure limestones with intercalations of pelites and siltstones in the north and northeast and lagoa santa upper pure limestones and dolomites with stromatolitic facies and intraformational breccia in central east west and south portions meyer 2018 vernooy 2019 the cenozoic sediments are constituted of gravel sandy and muddy alluvial deposits occurring along the são miguel river and its tributaries and in topographically lower regions of the watershed félix and freitas júnior 2000 the watershed is over the boundary with the brasília belt to the west where a thrust fault system of brasiliano age is occurred resulting in compressive deformations of the formations where n60 70w sinistral transcurrent faults doresópólis pains cut the entire basin these faults define two distinct deformation zones folded limestones western region and sub horizontal limestones eastern region some authors propose that these structures were reactivated in the cenozoic resulting in hosts and grabens that later influenced the evolution of karstification in the region muzzi magalhães 1989 saadi et al 1998 valeriano 2019 the climate is humid subtropical with the dry season between may and august and the rainy season between september and march the mean annual temperature is 20 9 c with mean annual precipitation of 1 325 mm potential evapotranspiration of 937 mm and actual evapotranspiration of 834 mm lucon et al 2020 hydrologically the são miguel river flows northwards along 53 km with meander morphology before flowing into the main são francisco river in the southeast region there is a predominance of underground flow due to the high karstification of the lagoa santa member s limestones in southwestern a dendritic drainage pattern is noted due to siliciclastic rocks from the samburá formation that is a non karstic terrain dias and velásques 2002 haddad 2007 lucon et al 2020 the well developed karst geomorphology and speleology are noted by caves with high degree of karstification in low topographic paleolevels and in recent cenozoic sedimentary deposits in endokarst and exokarst santos 2002 currently 6 354 cave entrances are registered in the são miguel river watershed mostly over the lagoa santa member s limestones highlighting the most important caves éden mastodonte loca feia narigudo and lagoa do retiro teixeira and dias 2003 ribeiro and vilela 2009 carvalho et al 2015 pires and rudnitzki 2019 sbe 2020 cecav 2020 hydrogeologically the sete lagoas formation acts as a groundwater reservoir constituting the main aquifer in the region covering 80 of the watershed area the carbonates were highly karstified resulting in complex conduit networks and cave systems in which the water is transmitted and stored dias and velásques 2002 the autogenic recharge occurs through sinkholes sink streams and cave entrances in the southeast while the allogenic recharge occurs through the samburá formation and cenozoic sediments lucon et al 2020 karst springs are the main form of aquifer discharge and feed the tributaries of the são miguel river the são miguel watershed and the aquifer have great importance in water supply mainly to the cities of pains and arcos that use it for human consumption mining industrial and agricultural activities menegasse et al 2002 the main groundwater flow directions are conditioned to structural lineaments and fractures of nw se ns we directions where the structural framework has a significant influence on local hydrodynamics ferrari et al 2018 lucon et al 2020 the other types of aquifers fractured and porous media are associated with rocks from the basement and cenozoic sediments respectively having lower productivity and secondary importance compared to the karst aquifer 3 materials and methods this research was carried out in three stages 1 database analysis 2 fieldworks and 3 data processing for a better understanding of the flow and transport processes several methods were used and integrated detailed below 3 1 geological structural geomorphological and speleological investigations regional geological data were collected from maps by ribeiro et al 2007 piumhi sheet sf23 v bii 1 100 000 scale muzzi magalhães 1989 and félix and freitas júnior 2000 1 50 000 scale the identification of structural lineaments and karst geomorphological features were made from digital terrain models and analysis of regional images from the alos palsar satellite 12 5 m resolution and local images of drone mavicpro 2 model 15 cm resolution then fieldwork was made for data validations in addition the following data were considered detailing of the drone high resolution topography using arcgis 10 5 and autocad 2021 software georeferencing of cave entrances based on data from the national center for research and conservation of caves cecav and the brazilian society of speleology sbe as well as complementary data on vadose conduits mapped of caves by guano and agster groups pains speleogroup epa 1996 and excursionist and speleological society see 2012 see 2020 in addition mappings of groundwater conduits in some areas were carried out by the espeleomergulho brazil group all the data helped in the choices and delimitations of the three representative neoproterozoic karst systems e w s and the definition of the injection and sampling points of the dye tracer tests all data contributed to the generation of all maps used in the paper and the hydrogeological sections of the e w and s systems 3 2 dye tracer tests in september 2020 dry season and april 2021 rainy season dye tracer tests dirac pulse injections ender et al 2018 were carried out in each season four underground flow routes four injection points ip and six sampling points sp in active and accessible caves sinkholes and springs were identified resulting in three karst systems fig 2 the dye tracers used were sodium fluorescein uranine cas no 518 47 8 and rhodamine wt cas no 37299 86 8 both tracers have distinct ranges of emission and electromagnetic spectrum and the field fluorimeter has channels that identify each of these tracers separately therefore there is no interference when mixing these two types of tracer dyes in the east system 200 g of rhodamine wt were injected into the lagoa do retiro cave ip1 and 300 g of uranine into the narigudo cave ip2 the monitoring of the tracers was carried out inside the mastodonte cave sp1 and in timburé spring sp2 in this system two sections were defined 1 section a a route ip1 sp1 and 2 section b b route ip2 sp1 in the west system 300 g of uranine were injected into the mina sinkhole ip3 being monitored in the socrates spring sp3 inside the eden cave sp4 and in the angolinha spring sp5 this route was considered as section c c in the south system 300 g of uranine were injected into the múcio sinkhole ip4 and monitored in the múcio spring sp6 the section d d fig 2 the volume of injected tracers and monitoring points were the same in both climate seasons and tracer monitoring was made by using three field fluorometers albillia ggun fl30 models 1650 1920 1921 schnegg 2002 calibrated before each injection with a time step between measurements of 15 min before each test using the field fluorometers the fluorescence background concentrations of each karst system were recorded for 24 h to correct possible tracer concentration values the summary of injection and sampling information is shown in table 1 and fig 2 discharge measurements were made in the minimum and maximum flow conditions of the systems using a current meter model usgs type aa price rickly hydrological co where the accuracy of flow measurements is 5 herschy 2002 according to marques et al publishing who studied the same karst systems discharge rates tend to be constant not exhibiting strong fluctuations except after rain events as there were no precipitation throughout the duration of the tests the discharges were assumed constant

time when half of the recovered tracer mass has passed the sampling point tr 2 tracer mass recovery r eq 1 and mean transit time tm eq 2 were estimated the maximum flow velocity vmax was calculated based on the time of the first detection to obtain the mean flow velocity and longitudinal dispersion coefficient analytical models were made as these parameters are the ones with the greatest

benischke 2021 factors such as retardation and adsorption were not considered as uranine and rhodamine wt have low rates of adsorption and degradation mull et al 1988 benischke et al 2007 the advection dispersion equation bear 1979 eq 3 can be solved using analytical solutions within models that consider different initial and boundary conditions leibundgut et al 2009 benischke 2021 3 c t d

nonequilibrium 2rne and multi double porosity with two region nonequilibrium mdp 2rne the inverse modeling process was used which consists of varying these parameters until the modeled curve fits the observed curve benischke et al 2007 the cxtfit toride et al 1995 and mfit bodin 2020 softwares were used where the accuracies were evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 and by the modified nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 ender et al 2018 barberá et al 2017 the ad model is an analytical solution of eq 3 which considers pulse injection dirac input of tracer homogeneous and semi infinite medium and mass flow detection kreft and zuber 1978 parker and van genuchten 1984 the 2rne model considers the presence of mobile and immobile fluid regions as the first order process in which there is an interaction between them represented by the coefficient ω the coefficient β indicates the proportion of the mobile fluid region in relation to the total in a range 0 β 1

coefficient dimensionless ω mass transfer coefficient dimensionless the mdp 2rne model in addition to considering the two flow regions mobile and immobile allows the existence of more than one pathway or parallel channel which divide the flow multi flow after the input but meet again in the output of the system assuming there is no mass exchange between channels bodin 2020 in this study 4 channels were adopted because it provided the best btc fits and the fewest errors during the modeling analysis due to the complexity of the model there is no analytical solution so the use of the pest software is needed to calculate partial derivatives using finite difference models doherty 2019 only this model uses numerical solutions for parameter estimates to complement the analysis of the seasonal behavior of the resistance to flow and the influence of the longitudinal dispersion the reynolds and peclet numbers were calculated considering vm and dl of the 2rne model according to eqs 5 and 6 5

c c and 772 m section d d 4 results 4 1 breakthrough curve parameters 4 1 1 east system in the east system eight graphics of breakthrough tracer curve btc were obtained for the sections a a and b b fig 3 which share the same sampling points sp1 and sp2 fig 2 discharges between dry and rainy seasons varied in sp1 from 360 m3 h to 1 065 m3 h and in sp2 from 425 m3 h to 1 488 m3 h respectively fig 3 in section a a the red rhodamine wt route ip1 sp1 fig 2 had tracer mass recovery r varying between dry and rain from 69 to 98 with decreases in mean transit time tm from 69 h to 30 h in time of first detection t1 from 49 h to 20 h and at peak times tp from 56 h to 25 h however it showed a slight increase in peak concentration cp from 30 6 µg l to 39 4 µg l compared with route ip1 sp1 the following ip1 sp2 route showed similar values of r 65 to 97 also with a decrease between dry and rain in values of tm 116 h to 47 h t1 84 h to 39 h tp 105 h to 45 h and the also increase in cp 13 2 µg l to 17 9 µg l fig 3 in section b b the green uranine route ip2 sp1 fig 2 had tracer mass recovery r ranged from 91 to 99 with tm decreasing from 59 h to 31 h t1 from 40 h to 20 h tp from 49 h to 24 h but unlike section a a cp decreases from 57 1 µg l to 38 3 µg l in the following route ip2 sp2 r varied from 66 to 83 maintaining the decreasing trend in tm values from 107 h to 51 h t1 from 74 h to 36 h tp from 99 h to 43 h and cp from 20 3 µg l to 14 4 µg l fig 3 in general with the increase in discharge during the rainy season tracer mass recoveries were greater and transit first arrival and peak times were shorter in both sections however peak concentrations had an opposite behavior increasing in a a and decreasing in the b b 4 1 2 west system in the west system six btcs were obtained between seasons for section c c s three sampling points sp3 sp4 sp5 uranine route fig 2 in sp3 discharge varied from 569 m3 h to 834 m3 h in sp4 from 587 m3 h to 911 m3 h and in sp5 from 594 m3 h to 1 084 m3 h fig 3 the route ip3 sp3 presented a variation of r from 56 to 68 with decreases in tm from 75 h to 52 h t1 from 42 h to 19 h tp from 61 h to 30 h and cp from 10 1 µg l to 7 7 µg l route ip3 sp4 had r ranging from 68 to 93 maintaining the decreasing trend in tm from 118 h to 73 h t1 from 82 h to 39 h tp from 106 h to 53 h and cp from 10 3 µg l to 8 9 µg l in ip3 sp5 r ranged from 48 to 79 with decreases in tm from 140 h to 91 h t1 from 106 h to 50 h tp from 169 h to 25 h but a slight increase in cp from 13 2 µg l to 17 9 µg l fig 3 comparing all routes an increase in tracer mass recoveries and a decrease in mean transit times time of first detection and peak times and peak concentration coupled with an increase in discharges during the rainy season can be seen however it is a noteworthy fact that the tracer mass recovery is greater downstream in sp4 eden cave and in sp5 angolinha spring and lower upstream in sp3 socrates spring both in dry and in rainy seasons fig 3 being explained in the discussion item 4 1 3 south system in the south system two btcs were obtained for the only green uranine route ip4 sp6 route of the section d d fig 2 where the discharge varies from 97 m3 h to 370 m3 h between the dry and rain seasons fig 3 the tracer mass recovery r variation between seasons was practically the same 42 to 43 regarding the values related to the time parameters the decreasing trends observed in systems e and w were maintained with tm from 104 h to 32 h t1 from 62 h to 14 h tp from 89 h to 22 h and cp from 39 6 µg l to 20 6 µg l fig 3 in general with the increase in discharge during the rainy season there were a decrease in values of mean transit times time of first detection and peak concentration times however there was almost no seasonal variation in tracer mass recovery 4 1 4 comparing karst systems regarding the discharge seasonal variabilities the e system presented the highest values followed by the s system and the w system with the smallest variations however regarding the seasonal variations of btcs the s system had the greatest variations followed by the e system and the w system with the smallest variations in all systems the tracer mass recovery is always greater in the rainy season except in the s system where the recovery was practically constant all karst systems have breakthrough curves in general characterized by tailing effects the e system tending to have a more positive asymmetry of the peak concentration while the w system displaying smoother and wider shapes with longer tails the s system shows the more irregular shape with secondary concentration multi peaks more pronounced during the rainy season which is the system with the greater discrepancy in btc patterns between seasons compared to the others fig 3 as expected discharge variations during dry and rainy seasons directly affect flow and transport parameters however this influence is noted differently in each karst system 4 2 groundwater flow and transport models 4 2 1 east system both in sections a a and b b in dry and rainy seasons the three models ad 2rne mdp 2rne presented in general coefficients of determination r2 and modified nash sutcliffe efficiencies ej 1 with high linear statistical adjustments calculated values versus observed values of btc where ad models presented r2 0 95 and ej 1 0 69 while 2rne and mdp 2rne models obtained r2 0 99 and ej 1 0 89 mdp 2rne model as btcs exhibited only one concentration peak the model adopted only one analysis channel table 2 and fig 4 regarding the hydrodispersive parameters that is mean flow velocity vm and longitudinal dispersion coefficient dl the three models indicate a general increase in these parameters following a significant increase in mean maximum velocities between dry 77 27 m h and rainy 175 54 m h seasons ad model shows mean vm ranging from 60 21 m h to 133 98 m h and dl from 894 m2 h to 2 092 m2 h for 2rne model the vm ranging from 55 87 m h to 125 98 m h and dl from 516 m2 h to 811 m2 h mdp 2rne model 1 channel indicated a variation in vm from 61 51 m h to 139 34 m h and dl from 573 m2 h to 926 m2 h table 2 the partition β and mass transfer ω coefficients mean respectively the proportion of mobile fluid region and interaction exchange between the two fluid regions mobile and immobile and were calculated only in nonequilibrium 2rne and mdp 2rne models in general when there are high discharge conditions the β values increase in routes of section a a and decrease in routes of section b b the ω values increase in both sections but more significantly in section a a with the increasing discharge table 2 and fig 4 4 2 2 west system during the seasons the section c c presented r2 0 86 and ej 1 0 62 running ad models while 2rne models obtained r2 0 98 and ej 1 0 89 and models mdp 2rne r2 0 99 and ej 1 0 98 the mdp 2rne model presented a better fit of btc compared to 2rne model although indicating higher uncertainties in this system btcs exhibited more than one concentration peak and for a better model a 4 channels mdp 2rne model was adopted the hydrodispersive parameters vm and dl had a progressive increase along the tracer path followed by an increase in average maximum velocities between dry 35 15 m h and rainy 70 18 m h seasons the ad model shows mean vm ranging from 25 40 m h to 43 27 m h while dl from 678 m2 h to 4 734 m2 h for 2rne model the vm ranging from 23 55 m h to 37 40 m h and dl from 115 m2 h to 622 m2 h mdp 2rne model 4 channels showed variation in vm from 25 02 m h to 41 79 m h and dl from 110 m2 h to 1 039 m2 h table 3 the β and ω coefficients in both routes of the section c c decreased significantly at high discharge rates however when compared spatially a progressive increase of β and ω is noted along the routes both in dry and rainy seasons table 3 and fig 5 4 2 3 south system during the seasons the section d d presented r2 0 89 and ej 1 0 68 applying ad model while 2rne obtained r2 0 99 and ej 1 0 91 and mdp 2rne showed r2 0 97 and ej 1 0 86 mdp 2rne model presented a better btc fit compared to the others as in the west system the south system has btcs exhibiting more than one concentration peak and therefore a 4 channels mdp 2rne model was also adopted the vm and dl showed increasing discharge conditions followed by increasing mean maximum velocities between dry 12 30 m h and rainy 56 13 m h seasons ad model shows vm ranging from 8 29 m h to 34 49 m h and dl varying from 64 m2 h to 582 m2 h for 2rne the vm mean values range from 7 33 m h to 22 02 m h and dl from 19 m2 h to 310 m2 h mdp 2rne 4 channels presented higher uncertainties in which vm varied from 45 00 m h to 29 96 m h and dl from 404 m2 h to 133 m2 h the β and ω coefficients significantly decreased under high discharge conditions table 3 and fig 5 4 2 4 comparing karst systems the nonequilibrium models 2rne and mdp 2rne fit better for estimating the parameters of the three systems although the 2rne model presents lower uncertainties the east system showed the highest mean values of β and the smallest one for ω thus there is a higher proportion of mobile fluid regions which have a lower interaction with immobile fluid regions on the other hand the west and south systems have lower mean values of β and higher mean values of ω which means there is a slightly smaller proportion of mobile fluid regions and higher interaction with immobile fluid regions 5 discussion 5 1 karst hydrogeological conceptual model 5 1 1 east system the absence of surface drainage associated with the presence of several epiphreatic and phreatic caves with perennial groundwater flow in addition to several sinkholes and cave entrances indicates the east system is the most karstified area in the são miguel river watershed confirmed by menegasse et al 2002 pereira et al 2019 and lucon et al 2020 the high karstification can be explained by the large difference in altitude between recharge and discharge zones resulting in high values of hydraulic gradients contributing to the increase in the process of dissolution and denudation of the karst relief fig 6 these terrain slopes may relate to regional structural configurations resulting in a basement structured by hosts and grabens pointed out by santos 2002 most cave entrances are between 730 and 850 m altitudes characterized by speleothems formed by chemical precipitation from dripping water and by the absence of underground drainage indicating these caves are in the vadose zone of the aquifer corroborating the hypothesis that some of the caves were formed during the first stage of karst evolution saadi et al 1998 santos 2002 the caves lagoas do retiro narigudo mastodonte and loca feia are in the aquifer s epiphreatic and phreatic zones and constitute a set of caves that represent the second and current stage of karst evolution with totally phreatic levels reactivated during high discharge rates saadi et al 1998 santos 2002 the retiro lake and other lakes pointed at section a a fig 6 exert a hydraulic control of the recharge water level and hence control the speleogenesis of this system palmer 2007 this control mechanism is also found in other karst regions of brazil such as the karst region of lagoa santa auler 1995 furthermore autogenic recharge occurs via sinkholes cave entrances and epikarst areas where subvertical fractures and regional nw trending left lateral strike slip systems control the directions of active conduits and groundwater flow confirmed by dye tracers this system is in the undeformed rocks proposed by muzzi magalhães 1989 confirmed in fieldwork by the presence of lagoa santa member s limestone and dolomite with sub horizontal bedding planes the overall timburé spring divided by main and secondary springs both perennial constitutes the system s main discharge zone being the region s underflow this spring is close to the right bank of the são miguel river of lower elevations between 695 and 700 m the limestone rocks are folded with nw dip indicating this system s discharge is influenced by structural and hydraulic controls the btc patterns featured by just one concentration peak and long tailing effect indicate that most of the flow is transmitted in the main conduit with the presence of some underground pools field and pinsky 2000 these pools are probably formed due to the sinuosity and sediment deposition along the conduits confirmed in epiphreatic and phreatic caves the increase in discharge between sp1 and sp2 fig 3 indicates that there is are distributary channel s that contribute significantly to the increase in discharge inflow on the other hand the loss of tracer in some part between ip1 sp1 in section b b indicates leakage to another spring outflow noted during the dry season fig 3 and table 2 this hypothesis is supported by indirect confirmations via stable isotopes and hydrochemistry of hydraulic interconnection in a spring close to pains lucon et al 2020 furthermore as the system routes are all underground the possibility of tracer degradation via exposure and adsorption is not considered there is also tracer loss between sp1 sp2 common to sections a a and b b fig 3 table 2 although this loss may be related to the redistribution in the timburé s secondary spring the high mass recovery rates in the rainy season table 2 can be explained by the saturation of the discontinuities that intersect the main conduit possibly fracture planes secondary conduits this saturation helps to avoid tracer losses as the internal hydrostatic pressure within the conduit is higher the recovery decreases in the dry season as the discontinuities are not fully saturated leading to redirections of the tracer and subsequent losses it is noteworthy to mention that the primary porosity of the system is nearly negligible with a value of only 3 peñaranda 2016 as a result there is minimal loss of tracer to the matrix this general characteristic is also applicable to other systems regarding the flow and transport parameters the increase in mean flow velocities and longitudinal dispersion coefficients in sections a a and b b are related to the significant increase in rainfall values fig 6 this system proves to be the most dynamic one with more rapid variations and responses during dry and rainy seasons probably related to the high degrees of karstification and high recharge rate conditions 5 1 2 west system the main characteristic of this system is the presence of karst windows along the flowpath allowing the ground water to be flow along the surface until it disappears again at the final sinkhole in section c c the presence of at least three of these is observed represented upstream by the mina window upstream the sócrates window in the middle and the angolinha window downstream fig 7 these findings were also noted by freitas 2009 and ferrari et al 2018 authors who studied the same system these karst windows are probably related to the local structural geology conditioning them to anticlines synclines folded systems goldscheider 2005 because of it the flow is orthogonal to fold axes in addition to subvertical fractures faults allowing the formation of phreatic conducts with multiple loops ford and williams 2007 letting the water to flow in surface stretches and then return to underground enlarged bedding planes the nw se structural lineaments are related both to fold axes and to nw trending left lateral strike slip systems muzzi magalhães 1989 where n s lineaments related to posterior normal faults cut the overall structures saadi 1991 fig 7 it is possible to affirm that this system s structural framework is the most complex and folded than the other systems furthermore this system is within the deformed limestone and dolomite zone proposed by muzzi magalhães 1989 confirmed by field mapping and corroborating freitas 2009 in the western portion of the system the recharge is diffuse allogenic through soil and epikarst forming smaller springs giving origin to the mina stream in the central portion where c c section is located the recharge is autogenic represented both by captures of the mina stream sinking stream at the ip3 point and occasionally by sinkholes and cave entrances with infiltration being via subvertical fractures faults until reaching the saturated zones of the aquifer fig 7 the saae spring being the main discharge of the system is close to the left bank of the são miguel river characterized by upward flow probably caused by the loops it is worth noting that this spring is an important water catchment point used for public supply to pains the btc patterns presenting multiple concentration peaks indicate the presence of anastomosed conduits bypass dividing the flow into more than one direction multi flow to meet again before the system outlet according to palmer 2007 anastomosed cave patterns are common when recharge is done through sinkholes or sinking streams furthermore associated with the multipeak pattern there is the long tailing effect indicating the existence of some underground pools and lakes field and pinsky 2000 this hypothesis is supported by the analysis of btcs where at the point sp3 downstream a less tracer mass recovery occurred compared to the point sp4 upstream fig 3 indicating a tracer deviation before sp3 and after recovery in sp4 both in dry and rainy seasons furthermore there is a small increase in discharge between some stretches of the c c section indicating the existence of distributary channel s that contribute to the increase in flow but with losses of the tracer along the way through other springs or even by the degradation and adsorption in soils when the tracer is exposed to the surface in some karst windows an indication for this hypothesis is the fact that the greatest losses occur in the dry season due to longer transit times and contact with dry soils promoting adsorption and exposure to sunlight resulting in possible degradation regarding the flow and transport parameters there is a progressive increase in mean flow velocities and a longitudinal dispersion along the way fig 7 due to the greater distance between the injection point ip3 and the sampling point sp5 in addition there is an increase in these parameters during the rain which may be related to the increase in discharge indicating that the system is hydrodynamically more stable in relation to the others 5 1 3 south system in this system there was difficulty in obtaining speleological data in addition it presents the smallest distances compared to the other sections and routes however the structural data indicate the framework is related to nw trending left lateral strike slip systems in addition to sets of n s and ne sw conjugate fractures based on fieldwork and photointerpretation this system is in a transition zone between folded and horizontalized limestones corroborating muzzi magalhães 1989 recharge is mainly autogenic via sinkholes with concentrated infiltration via subvertical fractures faults the main discharge is the múcio spring giving origin to the barra stream constituting the most upstream spring of the são miguel river watershed the main hydrodynamic feature of the system is the differences between the btc patterns during dry and rainy seasons fig 3 the curves also showed several concentration peaks multipeak and long tailing effects that indicate the presence of bypass and two flow regions as in the western system however this discrepancy in the curve may still indicate an influence of interaction with storage particularly in fractures or the presence of large immobile fluid regions or underground lakes dewaide et al 2018 in addition the latter is explained by the low mass tracer recovery due to the high interaction with stagnant zones developed in storage fractures 5 2 hydrodispersive models and hydrodynamic behavior of karstic systems the types and mechanisms of recharge and discharge reflect in the formation of karstification and patterns in the development of the network of conduits caves in all systems the recharge is influenced by watershed hydraulic control however in the e system there is also a hydraulic control palmer 2007 added by the retiro lake where the springs are perennial of the base level type underflow with ascending flow furthermore the action of the underground flow itself generates the speleogenesis and at the same time its hydraulic properties are influenced by karstification in a process of self organization of the karst network worthington and ford 2009 the heterogeneities of the systems structural and stratigraphic allow a greater presence of formation of stagnant flow zones and anastomosed conduits bypass and loops that control the flow rate and dispersion fig 8 the geological structural hydrogeological and speleological contexts influence both route and hydraulic conditions of the flow this influence is noted in btcs and in flow and transport parameters which are also influenced by climatological and hydrological variations between dry and rainy seasons these variations are quite different between the systems with a greater variation in the east system compared to the others fig 8 the adm model did not consider all the karst complexities since there is a simplification and hence the uncertainties of the estimated parameters were greater the 2rne model toride et al 1993 considers the existence of immobile and mobile fluid regions and their interaction between them which is common in karst and observed in all systems neither the adm and 2rne models consider the possibility of more than one concentration peak in btcs caused by bypass and or pools by the tracer pathways on the other hand the mdp 2rne model bodin 2020 considers these complexities and combinations of heterogeneities proving to be the most efficient for the w and s systems although it presents more uncertainties mainly in the β and ω parameters when compared to the 2rne model the tracer mass recovery levels were higher during the rainy season in all three systems with two explanations being raised due to the rise of the water table and consequently the increase of hydraulic pressure in the conduits resulting in faster water flow to discharge zones and due to climatological seasonal variabilities which modify the limits of the sprinsheds receiving more recharge rates from other areas or reactivating their own conduits goldscheider 2005 hydrodynamically the e system showed the highest mean values and the highest seasonal differences between vm and dl parameters figs 4 and 5 tables 2 and 3 this can also be seen in fig 8 where by the relation between reynolds and peclet numbers variations in flow conditions show that the east system tends to be in more turbulent conditions compared to other systems with increasing flows 5 3 comparing flow and transport parameters of neoproterozoic study area to paleozoic mesozoic karst systems the criterion adopted was to compare studies of tracers that considered the equilibrium adm and non equilibrium 2rne models in different flow conditions the studies by morales et al 2010 and aydin et al 2014 used only the adm model the parameters of mean flow velocity vm and dispersivity d calculated the ratio between dl and vm were chosen as comparison attributes as they represent the advection and dispersion of the flow the relationship between d and vm indicates a significant difference between karst systems associated with paleozoic mesozoic and neoproterozoic carbonate rocks fig 9 and table 4 in mesozoic karst systems of europe associated with carbonates from the cretaceous and jurassic morales et al 2010 barberá et al 2017 goeppert et al 2020 there is a trend towards higher values of d and lower vm purple crux blue diamond and orange circle in fig 9 in asia in a karst system related to paleozoic carboniferous permian limestones ender et al 2018 and jurassic aydin et al 2014 there is a trend of lower values of d and higher values of vm green square and pink circle in fig 9 in the case of this paper yellow triangle in fig 9 neoproterozoic karst system has lower values of d and vm when compared to the other systems in addition to showing a smaller dispersion of these parameters thus in the highly karstified neoproterozoic systems the observed hydrodispersive patterns such as two nonequilibrium regions bypass multiflow and the combination of the then are also noted in the paleozoic mesozoic karst systems this demonstrates that these models can be applied in different types of geological and hydrological contexts comparing with more recent carbonate rocks from paleozoic to mesozoic indicates that flow and transport parameters of the neoproterozoic karst system are more hydrodynamically stable with smaller variations of these parameters under different flow conditions an explanation for this behavior is because they are older terrains and therefore had more time for speleogenetic evolution that result in a well established karst network the distances of the routes are reasonably similar at the scale of hydrological basins that is they would not be a determining factor for the comparison of parameters however factors such as hydraulic gradient conduit sinuosities porosity flow matrix interaction and climatic conditions should be considered they have a great influence on the variation of these parameters as the comparisons are being made in systems in different regions of the world a similarity observed in both studies was the long tailing effect in btcs in the case of recent karsts this pattern may be associated with interaction with the matrix primary porosity while in neoproterozoic karst there is no such interaction with the matrix due to its low porosity and permeability and the long tailing effect can be explained by the interaction with underground lakes and more fractured regions water within secondary porosity therefore the non equilibrium models 2rne and mdp 2rne were the best that represented the systems in this paper 4 channels were considered as they provided the best btc adjustments with smaller errors it is important to emphasize that the number of channels adopted in the model cannot necessarily represent the real number of channels in the flowpath but it is the best mathematical solution for a complex question without real field information thus for a better generalization it is important to have more real field data 6 conclusions on a regional scale the são miguel river watershed has different geological structural hydrogeological and speleogenetic contexts two distinct regions are recognized one less folded represented by sub horizontal bedding plane limestones east system and the other one constituted of more folded and faulted limestones west and south systems on a local scale the east system proved to be the simplest and the west and south systems the most heterogenic and anisotropic being this complexity related to degrees of fracturing and tectonic deformations where the action of water and speleogenesis enable the formation of anastomosed conduits bypass loops lakes and underground pools these heterogeneities directly reflect on the geometric patterns of the breakthrough tracer curves btc and in flow and transport parameters bypass causes multiflows by modifying btc patterns due to several concentration peaks the combination of pools and bypass in the same system increases the interaction between mobile and immobile fluid regions noted in the west system in general the nonequilibrium and multiflow models 2rne and mdp 2rne have the best fits in the tracer restitution curves considering the complexities and heterogeneities of the systems the karst systems of the são miguel basin proved to be quite dynamic considering seasonal variations especially the east system the hydrodispersive parameters mean flow velocity vm and longitudinal dispersion coefficient dl increase with the increase in discharges during the rainy season parameters of non equilibrium models partition β and mass transfer ω behave in different ways between the systems showing a direct dependence on hydrogeological and speleogenetic contexts the differences between the paleozoic mesozoic and neoproterozoic karst systems show that both have a direct influence on factors such as hydraulic gradient conduit sinuosity porosity flow matrix interaction and hydrological conditions however the variation of flow and transport parameters indicate that the neoproterozoic karst system tends to be more hydrodynamically stable due to its well established karst network the spatial and temporal details of flow and transport parameters are fundamental to understanding the hydrodynamics of complex karst systems the knowledge of variations in transit times and mean flow velocities serve as decision making tools in case of potential aquifer contaminations in addition to contributing to the local groundwater management in karst areas as is the case in the city of pains brazil credit

2108,riverbed sediments are an important zone and interface for the interaction of surface water and groundwater hence biochemical processes in the riverbed sediments are critical to maintain the ecology of the system and water quality riverbed sediment scouring can substantially alter the hydrodynamic conditions of river water infiltration and redox conditions at the surface groundwater interface which in turn affects the biochemical processes currently in depth understanding of the distribution characteristics of the microbial community structure in riverbed sediments especially their response to riverbed scouring is lacking this study revealed the temporal and spatial changes in redox indicators in the liaohe riverbed sediment and discussed the response of the microbial community to the influence of riverbed scouring the results showed that during the investigation period september to november 2020 the riverbed sediments in the river reach were generally in a state of scouring in the low water stage and the scour depth was 4 9 cm the redox zone in the nearshore area moved up by 5 5 23 cm and moved down by 0 1 10 cm in the intermediate transition area and the center of riverbed and the maximum overlapping depth of the redox zone could reach 50 cm the relative abundance of dominant bacteria species had a good correlation with the intensity of geochemical reactions decreasing in low water levels close to the center of the riverbed which further indicated the weakening of the reduction rate influenced by riverbed scouring the species of denitrifying bacteria in the surface layer increased multiple dominant bacteria of iron manganese and sulfate often coexist in deep riverbed sediments and were slightly different in the low water level the results provide a better understanding of the chemical composition of the pore water in the riverbed sediments which are of great significance for maintaining the ecological safety of river water keywords bank filtration riverbed sediment scouring microbes biogeochemistry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bank infiltration is an important process of surface water groundwater interaction various studies have shown that a series of geochemical reactions that occur between river water and groundwater can control the removal of toxic and harmful substances such as heavy metals organic pollutants and escherichia coli and other viruses from the river findlay et al 1993 harvey et al 2012 jacob et al 2015 jones and mulholland 2000 trásyb et al 2018 however these studies have shown that microorganisms participate in most of the reactions abdelrady et al 2020 bai et al 2014 bastida et al 2018 epelde et al 2010 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2012 including organic matter oxidation and iron manganese oxide reduction lovley 1991 corstjens et al 1992 lloyd 2003 tebo et al 2004 rong et al 2020 owings et al 2021 moreover it has also been reported that microorganisms respond well to these reactions during river water infiltration boano et al 2014 gandy et al 2007 park et al 2009 yi et al 2021 zuo et al 2021 riverbed sediments are the first zone of river water infiltration as they have the largest river water groundwater temperature chemical and biological gradient the microbial geochemical reactions occurring in the riverbed sediments are extremely active therefore this interface is critical for the removal and release of toxic and harmful substances during infiltration danczak et al 2016 sophocleous 2002 influenced by changes in the river hydrodynamic conditions and riverbed basement undulation the sediments undergo continuous scouring and silting changes in the composition structure and thickness of riverbed sediments will not only affect the hydrodynamic conditions of river water infiltration and nutrient flux but also affect the benthic ecosystem i e algae bacteria and the metabolic process driven by these organisms fischer et al 2003 ruiz gonzález et al 2015 schwendel et al 2010 stock and ward 1989 zlatanovic et al 2017 consequently the biogeochemical processes in the riverbed sediments become more complex garcía armisen et al 2014 which increases the difficulty of conducting biogeochemical research in the river water infiltration zone nogaro et al 2008 ulrich et al 2015 in turn the spatial variability of physicochemical properties also influences the microbial diversity and community structure yang et al 2020 existing studies have recognized that changes in the composition structure and sediment thickness caused by river scouring and silting may affect the environmental properties of the riverbed and the accompanying hydrogeochemical processes grabowski et al 2012 burdige and komada 2020 previous studies have mainly focused on changes in riverbed permeability datry et al 2015 maier et al 2022 pholkern et al 2015 preziosi ribero et al 2020 wooster et al 2008 and assessed the environmental status according to dynamic physicochemical changes islam et al 2015 xu et al 2017 zhao et al 2008 however in the process of river water infiltration the dominant functional microbial communities and microbial activities are different in different geochemical reaction zones along the direction of groundwater flow park et al 2009 therefore it is of great significance to find out the characteristics of the composition structure and activity of microbial communities in different geochemical zones under the influence of riverbed scouring and silting and to capture the co evolution relationship between microbial metabolism and function and environmental conditions on this basis the coupling mechanism between the hydrodynamic process of river infiltration and the biogeochemical process caused by riverbed scouring and silting also needs further study the huangjia area in shenyang is a typical riverside water source area existing studies have mainly discussed the redox zoning characteristics at different locations of the river section wang et al 2020 the dynamic changes of microorganisms in the riverbed sediments under the influence of riverbed scouring and silting can provide basic data support for clarifying the migration and transformation laws of pollutants in the water environment however in depth understanding of the spatial distribution of microbial community abundance structure and dominant bacterial species in riverbed sediments and their response to riverbed scouring in the study area are still lacking this study evaluated the riverbed sediment within 100 m of the left bank of the liaohe river combined with microelectrode technology diffusive gradients in a thin film dgt technique for in situ sampling and 16s rrna and polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification the primary objective was to explore the rule of redox zoning change under the influence of riverbed scouring and silting and analyze the response of microbial community structure and composition in riverbed sediment to riverbed scouring process additionally we explored the correlation between microbial community characteristics and environmental indicators to obtain a better understanding of the dynamic interaction between surface water and groundwater and the degradation reaction mechanism of pollutants between river and aquifer 2 materias and methods 2 1 study area the study area was situated in the huangjia water source zone northern shenyang china approximately 40 km away from shenyang city fig 1 the liaohe river flows from northeast to southwest and the wells are primarily distributed on the low floodplain of the south bank the river recharges groundwater all the year round and the groundwater flows from the river to the direction of the pumping wells the reach in the study area belongs to the qinghekou shifosi section with a length of 3 9 km and an average river width of 200 m bai et al 2020 2 2 characteristics of the riverbed sedimentary structure the riverbed sediments exhibit substantial spatial heterogeneity from the right bank to the left the river flow rate gradually decreased and the slope of the riverbed slowed down resulting in the diameter of the lithological particles of the riverbed sediments gradually decreased and the gray black silt layer on the riverbed became thicker a part of the silt layer on the surface of the riverbed on the right bank of the river was washed and the coarse sand particles carried from the upstream were deposited on the top of the silt layer forming a localized sedimentary structure of coarse and fine particles with sedimentary rhythm which reflects the scouring and silting cycle of multiple incoming water processes fig s1 2 3 meteorology hydrology and sediment concentration the temporal variation of precipitation in the study area is uneven throughout the year it is mainly concentrated between june and september during which period the precipitation is approximately 67 26 168 13 mm accounting for 72 34 of the annual precipitation river water infiltration and artificial exploitation are the main recharge and discharge ways of groundwater in the study area and the river water infiltrates to recharge the groundwater all the year the tieling hydrological station is located 27 km upstream of the study area the flood period mostly occurs between july and september the average runoff from 2014 to 2020 was 1 978 billion m3 of which the average flow in 2020 can reach 95 3 m3 s and the maximum flow can reach 810 m3 s floods come and go rapidly with a violent rise and fall in water levels accompanied by flood and sediment peaks when the flow is greater than 100 m3 s the sand content begins to increase considerably and the amount of sand transported from june to september can account for 90 04 of the sand transported in the whole year fig s2 2 4 quality characteristics of sediment pore water the ph value of riverbed sediment overlying water in the study area ranged 7 63 7 96 the ph value of sediment pore water was basically stable between 6 80 and 8 00 and decreased with the increase of depth affected by riverbed scouring the ph value in the pore water of the riverbed sediment in the lithological thinning zone of the weak scouring area decreased while the ph value in the pore water of the riverbed sediment in the lithological coarsening zone of the medium scouring area and the strong scouring area increased the total iron manganese and nitrate nitrogen contents were 0 00 15 30 0 01 6 26 and 0 11 4 68 mg l respectively according to the groundwater quality standard gb t148482017 the iron and manganese contents exceeded the class iii standard limits 0 3 mg l for iron and 0 1 mg l for manganese altogether the total iron and manganese contents were approximately 51 and 63 times that of the standard limits respectively which are closely related to the original geological environment 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling in order to analyze the response characteristics of biogeochemical reaction in the river infiltration zone under the influence of riverbed scouring the study selected a riverbed monitoring section along the groundwater monitoring wells and the extension of the center of the groundwater level depression cone fig 1 six representative riverbed sediment sampling points a f were evenly arranged within 100 m from the left bank of the liaohe river fig 2 the undisturbed riverbed sediment samples within the range of 0 5 1 2 m were collected by sdi vc mini shallow water sediment sampling rig made in u s a during september high level and november low level 2020 the siphon drainage method was used to collect the overlying water of the riverbed sediments and the samples were divided into three sections under anaerobic conditions 15 20 and 20 cm first unisense microelectrode technology was used to measure the dissolved oxygen do concentration at different depths of riverbed sediment pore water in a mm resolution then from the sediment samples 20 0 g of each section surface layer were collected using a sterilized medicine spoon for microbiological test and stored in a refrigerator at 20 c following thin film gradient diffusion dgt and high resolution pore water sampling rhizon technology were used to collect in situ riverbed sediment pore water samples among which zro at dgt was used to fix no3 zro chelex agi dgt was used to fix fe ii and mn ii and rhizon pore water sampler was used for dissolved organic carbon and so4 2 test 3 2 analytical methods 3 2 1 redox indicator analysis

plasma mass spectrometer icp ms detection limit of mn2 is 0 1 μg l and inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry icp aes detection limit of as is 0 1 μg l were used to determine the concentrations of hydrochemical components respectively in addition the bettersize 2000 laser was used to analyze the particle size distribution of the riverbed sediments and the total organic carbon analyzer test accuracy of the total organic carbon is 2 and the kjeldahl method test accuracy of the total nitrogen is 2 were used to determine the carbon and nitrogen contents in the sediments 3 2 2 16s rrna analysis the microbial community structure in the riverbed sediments was analyzed by 16s rrna combined with the pcr results and high throughput sequencing after the sediment was naturally

shanghai china 4 results 4 1 lithological structure characteristics of riverbed sediments the liaohe riverbed sediments in the study area are mainly sandy silt sz and silt z with silty sands zs and mud m at individual depths the vertical distribution of lithology at each monitoring point is relatively consistent in the high water level while the lithological changes of the riverbed sediments during the low water level period are more significant fig s3 as shown in table 1 the lithological composition of the riverbed sediments presents obvious spatial and seasonal changes points a and b are closer to the riverbank where the cutting depth the depth of riverbed is small and the diameter of the lithological particles is relatively coarse compared with the high water level the lithology of the surface riverbed sediments in the low water level become finer points c and d are far away from the left bank of the liaohe river where the cutting depth is relatively large affected by modern river sedimentation the lithology of the riverbed sediments becomes finer compared with the high water level the lithology of the surface riverbed sediments in the low water level become coarser the water depth cutting depth and hydrodynamic strength of the river at point e and f are greater than that at other points and the sediment particles in the riverbed become coarser at the low water level as a result and according to the change in the surface lithological grain diameter of the riverbed sediments during high and low water level periods it is divided into lithologic thinning zone in the nearshore area a and b lithologic coarsening zone in the intermediate transitional area c and d and lithologic coarsening zone in the center of the riverbed e and f 4 2 changes of redox sensitivity indicators in riverbed sediments in different lithological zones 4 2 1 do as shown in fig 3 the do concentration in the pore water of the riverbed sediment gradually decreased with the increase in depth the surface layer top 5 mm is where aerobic respiration primarily occurs compared with the high water level the do content in the surface layer of the sediments at each monitoring point in the low water level was considerably reduced within the lithologic thinning zone in the nearshore area represented by points a and b the do penetration depths in the high water level were 5 5 and 30 mm respectively which were significantly higher than the corresponding do penetration depths of 2 and 2 mm in the low water level within the lithologic coarsening zone in the intermediate transitional area represented by points c and d the do penetration depths in the high water level were 3 2 and 3 8 mm respectively while the corresponding do penetration depths in the low water level were 2 8 and 5 mm respectively lastly within the lithologic coarsening zone in the center of riverbed represented by points e and f the do penetration depths in the high water level were 4 5 and 3 5 mm respectively while the corresponding do penetration depths in the low water level were 2 5 and 7 0 mm 4 2 2 water chemistry indicator 4 2 2 1 lithologic thinning zone in nearshore area a b as shown in fig 4 the maximum depth of no3 n decrease in pore water in the low water level was significantly lower than that in the high water level the depths at which no3 n concentration decreased to 0 2 mg l during the high and low water level at point a were 7 and 1 5 cm respectively the no3 n concentration at point b in the high water level gradually increased from 0 4364 mg l at 1 mm depth to 3 68 mg l at 20 mm depth primarily due to nitrification after the do was gradually consumed the no3 n concentration gradually decreased with depth to below 0 2 mg l at 16 cm where the low water level dropped below 0 2 mg l at the 1 5 cm position at point a the mn2 concentration peaked at 8 and 6 cm during the high and low water levels while the fe2 concentration peaked at 26 and 19 cm respectively the concentration of mn2 at the high and low water levels of point b reached a peak at 19 and 10 cm respectively while the fe2 concentration reached the peak at 25 and 20 cm the mn2 concentration peaked earlier than the fe2 concentration and there was a certain degree of overlap between the iron manganese reduction zone during the high and low water levels at point a so4 2 concentration began to decrease at 18 and 6 cm respectively correspondingly at point b so4 2 concentration began to decrease at 28 and 26 cm for high and low water level respectively there was a high degree of overlap between the sulfate and iron manganese reduction zones and compared with the high water level an shallower so4 2 reduction location in the low water level was observed 4 2 2 2 lithologic coarsening zone in intermediate transitional area c d as shown in fig 5 at point c the maximum depth range of no3 n concentration decrease during high and low water levels was 1 6 cm and 1 7 cm respectively and at point d it was 2 5 cm and 3 0 cm respectively the depths when the no3 n concentration decreased during the high and low water levels were similar at point c the mn2 concentration peaked at 27 and 32 cm during the high and low water levels while the fe2 concentration peaked at 36 and 47 cm respectively the concentration of mn2 at the high and low water levels of point d reached the peak at 28 and 47 cm respectively the fe2 concentration peaked at 39 and 47 cm for high and low water levels respectively during the high and low water levels at point c sulfate concentrations began to decrease at 4 and 10 cm respectively sulfate concentration in the high and low water level at point d began to decrease at 8 and 15 cm respectively 4 2 2 3 lithologic coarsening zone in the center of riverbed e f at point e and f the no3 n concentration in the high water level showed a downward trend in the 0 3 5 cm and 0 7 cm depth range and a considerable decrease in the 0 4 cm and 0 20 cm depth range in the low water level the concentration of mn2 at the high and low water levels of point e reached the peak at 27 and 30 cm the fe2 concentration reached the peak at 37 and 48 cm the mn2 and fe2 concentration of point f reached a peak at 29 and 47 cm during the low water level respectively sulfate concentrations in the high and low water level at point e began to decrease at 4 and 12 cm respectively while so4 2 concentration began to decrease at 54 cm at point f during the low water level in the high water level only 12 cm of riverbed sediment samples at point f were obtained hence the iron manganese and sulfate reduction zones were not reached fig 6 4 3 microbial response characteristics in the different lithological zones it can be seen from the horizontal columnar distribution of the dominant microbial genera associated with n fe mn s and c in the riverbed sediments fig 7 the total number of microbial communities in the riverbed sediments showed a vertical upward trend considering the sampling point a in the low water level as example the relative abundance of main microorganisms in the surface layer was 16 03 which gradually increased to 26 25 at 35 cm the number of microbial communities on the cross section increased from the nearshore area toward the center of the riverbed the relative abundance at the nearshore area intermediate transition area and the center of the riverbed during the low water level were 21 99 23 04 and 23 75 on average respectively among them in the near shore area due to the thinning of lithological grains of the surface riverbed sediments in the low water level the number of dominant microbial communities increased from 17 35 and 20 57 to 19 97 and 21 82 respectively in the intermediate transition area points c and d and the central area of the riverbed points e and f the surface lithological grains of the riverbed sediments were coarsened during the low water level and the number of dominant microbial communities decreased from 17 20 19 15 22 78 and 18 62 to 16 77 16 56 19 41 and 15 02 respectively the dominant bacteria in the sediments of the riverbed during high water level primarily included flavobacterium clostridium thiobacillus geobacter pseudomonas and novosphingobium the communities with a relative abundance 1 during the low water level mainly included pseudomonas rhizobiales thiobacillus desulfuromonas clostridium sulfuricurvum and sphingomonas in addition various diatoms were found in the riverbed sediments during the low water level especially in the surface layer of the riverbed sediments which further indicated that there were a certain number of aquatic plants in the liaohe river and that the river water had risk of eutrophication 5 discussion 5 1 variation in riverbed sediment lithology law under the influence of riverbed scouring and silting as shown in fig s4 a the river flow rate had strong temporal and spatial changes with the increase in the distance from the left bank of the liaohe river the flow rate gradually increased reflecting the gradual rise in hydrodynamic intensity from the nearshore area to the center of the riverbed the water velocity at point f could reach 1 14 m s in the high water level which considerably dropped during low water levels contrarily point a was stagnant throughout the year fig s4 b shows the dynamics of the flow and sediment concentration of the hydrological station near the study section between september and november 2020 the maximum sediment concentration in september reached 1 17 kg m3 while in november it was not detectable the sediment concentration showed the same dynamic change law as the flow rate with increasing river velocity due to which the carrying capacity of sediment increased resulting in more serious riverbed silting the temporal and spatial changes of river hydrodynamic intensity and sediment concentration in the cross section of the riverbed led to different degrees of scouring or silting of the sediments which caused spatial differences in the lithology of riverbed sediments as shown in fig s5 and table 2 sand silt and clay represent bed load components progressively suspended and uniformly suspended components respectively the sand index and silt index of the sample table 3 can reflect the dynamic environment of sediment formation and the intensity of disturbance sand index percentage of sand sum of silt and clay percentage silt index percentage of silt percentage of clay the sand index during the high water level period at points a and b were 0 10 and 0 45 respectively the sand index in the low water level period was considerably lower at 0 06 and 0 35 for points a and b respectively indicating a weak hydrodynamic effect in the nearshore zone compared with the high water level period the lithology of the surface riverbed sediments at points a and b showed a refinement trend compared with the high water level the sand index and silt index of points c f in the low water level had an increasing trend and with the increase of the distance from the river bank the sand index and silt index were higher indicating that the hydrodynamic conditions of the river and the intensity of disturbance to sediments increased during the low water level and the hydrodynamic conditions of the center of the riverbed were stronger than that of the river bank although the variation trend of riverbed sediment particle size with depth at each point was nearly the same in the high and low water level there were significant differences in the depth positions where the average particle size of riverbed sediment changed significantly at different water levels reflecting the impact of riverbed scouring for example according to fig s5 at the point 80 m away from the left bank of the liaohe river point d the depth with the average grain size of 206 5 μm was 40 cm below the riverbed in the high water level and 32 cm below the riverbed in the low water level combined with the hydrodynamic conditions of the river the lithological composition and structural change characteristics of the riverbed sediments and the sediment disturbance intensity relative to the high water level period from the nearshore area to the center of the riverbed the riverbed in the low water level period gradually transitioned from a silting to an scouring state where the scouring depths at point b c d and e could reach 4 6 6 and 8 cm respectively fig s5 5 2 dynamic change characteristics of redox indicators under the influence of riverbed scouring and silting at present there is no unified classification standard and zoning threshold for redox zoning in groundwater in the process of river water infiltration kedziorek et al 2008 champ et al 1979 petrunic et al 2005 kuehn and mueller 2000 massmann et al 2008 according to the temporal and spatial variation of the concentration of redox components in the riverbed sediment pore water during the river water infiltration process in the study area the redox zoning thresholds for river water infiltration in this study were shown in table 3 as shown in fig 8 during river water infiltration the sequential oxidation reduction reaction occurred under the mediation of microorganisms forming a sequential o2 no3 mn iv fe iii and so4 2 reduction zone from top to bottom within a depth of 70 cm of riverbed sediments previous studies have shown that based on the difference in gibbs free energy the electron acceptor undergoes redox in sequence petrunic et al 2005 kuehn and mueller 2000 however due to the seasonal changes of hydrodynamic conditions and the complex variability of riverbed sediment lithology this study found highly overlapped no3 mn iv fe iii and so4 2 reduction zones at some depths as shown in table 3 during high and low water levels the maximum overlap depth of no3 and mn iv reduction zones can reach 8 and 2 cm that of mn iv and fe iii reduction zones can reach 46 and 49 cm and that of fe iii and so4 2 reduction zones can reach 48 cm and 50 cm respectively redox zoning exhibits both spatial and temporal variation as shown in fig 8 and table 4 compared with the high water level period during the low water level period at 10 m point a and 20 m point b away from the river bank due to the weakening of the hydrodynamic conditions of the river the surface lithological particles of the riverbed sediment become finer the retention time of river water in riverbed sediments increases with the redox indicators reacting effectively resulting in a upward shift of the oxidation reduction zone the no3 mn iv fe iii and so4 2 reduction zones moved up 5 5 12 5 15 20 9 11 and 22 23 cm respectively and the range of each reduction zone became narrower as the distance from the river bank increased the riverbed scouring intensity increased and the surface lithological particles of the riverbed sediment became coarser which led to an increase in the intensity of river water infiltration shortened the time for the water to infiltrate through the riverbed sediment resulting in a downward shift of the oxidation reduction zone the no3 mn iv fe iii and so4 2 reduction zones moved down 0 1 1 3 5 5 10 and 5 10 cm respectively and the range of each reduction zone became wider riverbed scouring silting caused changes in redox zoning which led to variations in the change gradient of redox indicators the generation gradient of mn2 and fe2 or the attenuation gradient of do no3 and so4 2 can be calculated by dividing the peak concentration or the stable concentration by the relevant depth therefore as shown in fig 8 at 10 m point a and 20 m point b away from the river bank relative to the high water level the surface riverbed sediments showed a refinement trend and the river retention time prolonged leading to the increasing of attenuation gradient of do no3 and so4 2 and mn2 and fe2 generation gradient as the distance from the river bank increased the riverbed scouring intensity became greater the penetration depth of dissolved oxygen increased and the denitrification was delayed resulting in a prolonged iron manganese reduction reaction and delayed sulfate reduction 5 3 community comparison and relationships between community structure and environmental factors during river water infiltration the evolution of the chemical composition is inseparable from the community structure and function of microorganisms according to redundancy analysis rda fig s6 a and b the microbial composition of the surface layer of the riverbed is closely related to the concentration of no3 and so4 2 while the microbial composition of the deep layer samples is closely related to the concentration of fe2 mn2 nh4 soc and tn reflecting that the surface layer is primarily characterized by nitrate reduction while the deep layer is mainly characterized by iron manganese and sulfate reduction the sample points in the high water level were relatively scattered and the projection shown by the arrow was farther from the origin indicating that the microbial community structure had a greater impact on related environmental factors in addition there was a strong positive correlation between the fe2 and mn2 concentration further verifying the overlap between the iron manganese reduction zones as shown in fig s6 c and d the dominant bacteria has a direct correlation with no3 fe2 mn2 and so4 2 in the pore water and the functions and activities of dominant bacteria shows evidence of co evolution with the hydrochemical environment which is characteristic of a redox zoning although many microorganisms can participate in the oxidation reduction cycle of fe mn n and s elements they may not drive a single reaction reflecting the diversity of microbial functions in riverbed sediments 5 4 response of dominant microbial species to the hydrochemical evolution as shown in fig 9 and table 5 the spatial distribution of dominant bacteria in the riverbed sediment was in good agreement with the redox zoning due to riverbed scouring there were differences among dominant bacterial species at different depths during the high water level the surface layer of the riverbed sediment was dominated by pseudomonas lutibacter and rhodobacter which can participate in denitrification and iron manganese reduction during the low water level most of the riverbed of the liaohe river was eroded the do reduction zone and no3 reduction zone had moved down leading to the increase in denitrifying bacteria and the dominance of pseudomonas thauera and rhodobacter in the riverbed sediment which can be widely involved in no3 reduction some diatoms were found in the surface riverbed sediments during the low water period hence there were abundant rhizobiales on the surface of the riverbed sediments the riverbed sediments at depths of 15 and 35 cm were primarily dominated by iron and manganese and sulfate reducing bacteria the dominant bacteria in the high water level include geobacter clostridium pseudomonas desulfobulbus desulfuromonas arenimonas and bacillus the dominant bacterial in the low water level were mainly changed from geobacter to lutibacter and thiobacillus and other dominant bacterial remained unchanged due to the high overlap between the mn iv fe iii and sulfate reduction zones a variety of iron manganese and sulfate dominant bacteria often co existed in deep riverbed sediments which supported the water chemistry analysis results 5 5 microbes involved in biogeochemical cycles 5 5 1 nitrate reducing bacteria as shown in fig 10 during the low water level period the total relative abundance of denitrifying microorganisms in the nearshore area shows an increasing trend which relates to the denitrification intensity whereas the decrease in the intermediate transition area and center of the riverbed reflects on the decrease in intensity of denitrification due to scouring the change in the relative abundance of the microbial communities during the high and low water level periods further confirms the results of changes in the intensity of denitrification from the nearshore area to the center of the riverbed as discussed in section 5 2 5 5 2 iron and manganese reducing bacteria as shown in fig 11 the relative abundance of iron and manganese functional microorganisms in the high water level increased from the nearshore area toward the center of riverbed the nearshore area was dominated by lutibacter and thiobacillus whereas clostridium gradually dominated near the center of riverbed and the relative abundance of microorganisms increased the relative abundance of iron and manganese functional microorganisms in the low water level increased from the center of riverbed to the nearshore area nearshore area was dominated by lutibacter and arenimonas near the center of riverbed the dominant bacteria gradually transitioned to clostridium from the high to the low water level from the silting of the riverbed in the nearshore area to the scouring of the riverbed in the center of riverbed the microbial abundance of iron manganese reduction function decreased with the increase in the distance from the liaohe river which further verified that the iron manganese reduction gradient in the nearshore area increased while the iron manganese reduction gradient in the intermediate transition area and the center of riverbed decreased as discussed in section 5 2 5 5 3 sulfate reducing bacteria as shown in fig 12 the vertical relative abundance of sulfate reducing microorganisms initially increases and then decreases with the increase in depth which is closely related to the changes in sulfate concentration in the riverbed sediments see section 4 2 2 for related analysis reflecting the initial sulfate reducing increase and then decreases vertically the horizontal relative abundance of sulfate reducing microorganisms decreases from the intermediate transition to the nearshore area and toward the center of riverbed which was consistent with the intensity of sulfate reduction recorded as shown in fig 8 in the nearshore area the relative abundance of sulfate reducing microorganisms in the low water level was higher than that in the high water level reflecting the increase in the intensity of sulfate reduction in the intermediate transition area and the center of riverbed due to riverbed scouring the relative abundance of sulfate reducing microorganisms decreased and was consistent with the decrease in sulfate reduction rate in the low water level as discussed in section 5 2 6 conclusions this study combined the microelectrode technology dgt in situ sampling technology 16s rrna sequencing and pcr amplification technology to reveal the changing law of redox indicator in the riverbed sediment pore water under the influence of riverbed scouring as well as the microbial response characteristics the research mainly draws the following important conclusions during the investigation period september to november 2020 the riverbed sediments in the river reach were generally in a state of scouring in the low water stage and the scour depth was 4 9 cm the scouring and silting of the riverbed significantly affects the redox zoning in the process of river water infiltration the redox zone in the nearshore area moved up by 5 5 23 cm and moved down by 0 1 10 cm in the intermediate transition area and the central of riverbed the no3 mn iv fe iii and sulfate reduction zones were highly overlapped and the maximum overlapping depth of the redox zone could reach 50 cm the functions and activities of dominant bacteria in the riverbed sediment responded to the redox zoning and can actively participate in the redox cycle of iron manganese arsenic nitrogen and surfur elements influenced by riverbed scouring there were certain differences in dominant bacteria at different depths of the riverbed and the number of microbial communities in intermediate transition zone and the center of riverbed during the low water level decreased during high and low water levels the relative abundance of denitrifying and iron manganese and sulfate reducing microorganisms in riverbed sediments can indicate the intensity of these processes while dominant bacteria species and population diversity had a correlation with the hydrodynamic conditions and lithological characteristics due to the ambiguity and uncertainty of existing hydrochemical methods combining the distribution of dominant bacteria in different depths of the riverbed sediments can more accurately and effectively reveal the biogeochemical effects of riverbed sediments in the process of river water infiltration characterizing the composition of the microbial community and its response to redox processes can improve our understanding of the biotransformation mechanism of pollutants during river water infiltration in the future combining more periods of riverbed scouring silting process analysis and riverbed sediment microbial biomass changes can enrich our research results credit authorship contribution statement jing bai conceptualization

2108,riverbed sediments are an important zone and interface for the interaction of surface water and groundwater hence biochemical processes in the riverbed sediments are critical to maintain the ecology of the system and water quality riverbed sediment scouring can substantially alter the hydrodynamic conditions of river water infiltration and redox conditions at the surface groundwater interface which in turn affects the biochemical processes currently in depth understanding of the distribution characteristics of the microbial community structure in riverbed sediments especially their response to riverbed scouring is lacking this study revealed the temporal and spatial changes in redox indicators in the liaohe riverbed sediment and discussed the response of the microbial community to the influence of riverbed scouring the results showed that during the investigation period september to november 2020 the riverbed sediments in the river reach were generally in a state of scouring in the low water stage and the scour depth was 4 9 cm the redox zone in the nearshore area moved up by 5 5 23 cm and moved down by 0 1 10 cm in the intermediate transition area and the center of riverbed and the maximum overlapping depth of the redox zone could reach 50 cm the relative abundance of dominant bacteria species had a good correlation with the intensity of geochemical reactions decreasing in low water levels close to the center of the riverbed which further indicated the weakening of the reduction rate influenced by riverbed scouring the species of denitrifying bacteria in the surface layer increased multiple dominant bacteria of iron manganese and sulfate often coexist in deep riverbed sediments and were slightly different in the low water level the results provide a better understanding of the chemical composition of the pore water in the riverbed sediments which are of great significance for maintaining the ecological safety of river water keywords bank filtration riverbed sediment scouring microbes biogeochemistry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bank infiltration is an important process of surface water groundwater interaction various studies have shown that a series of geochemical reactions that occur between river water and groundwater can control the removal of toxic and harmful substances such as heavy metals organic pollutants and escherichia coli and other viruses from the river findlay et al 1993 harvey et al 2012 jacob et al 2015 jones and mulholland 2000 trásyb et al 2018 however these studies have shown that microorganisms participate in most of the reactions abdelrady et al 2020 bai et al 2014 bastida et al 2018 epelde et al 2010 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2012 including organic matter oxidation and iron manganese oxide reduction lovley 1991 corstjens et al 1992 lloyd 2003 tebo et al 2004 rong et al 2020 owings et al 2021 moreover it has also been reported that microorganisms respond well to these reactions during river water infiltration boano et al 2014 gandy et al 2007 park et al 2009 yi et al 2021 zuo et al 2021 riverbed sediments are the first zone of river water infiltration as they have the largest river water groundwater temperature chemical and biological gradient the microbial geochemical reactions occurring in the riverbed sediments are extremely active therefore this interface is critical for the removal and release of toxic and harmful substances during infiltration danczak et al 2016 sophocleous 2002 influenced by changes in the river hydrodynamic conditions and riverbed basement undulation the sediments undergo continuous scouring and silting changes in the composition structure and thickness of riverbed sediments will not only affect the hydrodynamic conditions of river water infiltration and nutrient flux but also affect the benthic ecosystem i e algae bacteria and the metabolic process driven by these organisms fischer et al 2003 ruiz gonzález et al 2015 schwendel et al 2010 stock and ward 1989 zlatanovic et al 2017 consequently the biogeochemical processes in the riverbed sediments become more complex garcía armisen et al 2014 which increases the difficulty of conducting biogeochemical research in the river water infiltration zone nogaro et al 2008 ulrich et al 2015 in turn the spatial variability of physicochemical properties also influences the microbial diversity and community structure yang et al 2020 existing studies have recognized that changes in the composition structure and sediment thickness caused by river scouring and silting may affect the environmental properties of the riverbed and the accompanying hydrogeochemical processes grabowski et al 2012 burdige and komada 2020 previous studies have mainly focused on changes in riverbed permeability datry et al 2015 maier et al 2022 pholkern et al 2015 preziosi ribero et al 2020 wooster et al 2008 and assessed the environmental status according to dynamic physicochemical changes islam et al 2015 xu et al 2017 zhao et al 2008 however in the process of river water infiltration the dominant functional microbial communities and microbial activities are different in different geochemical reaction zones along the direction of groundwater flow park et al 2009 therefore it is of great significance to find out the characteristics of the composition structure and activity of microbial communities in different geochemical zones under the influence of riverbed scouring and silting and to capture the co evolution relationship between microbial metabolism and function and environmental conditions on this basis the coupling mechanism between the hydrodynamic process of river infiltration and the biogeochemical process caused by riverbed scouring and silting also needs further study the huangjia area in shenyang is a typical riverside water source area existing studies have mainly discussed the redox zoning characteristics at different locations of the river section wang et al 2020 the dynamic changes of microorganisms in the riverbed sediments under the influence of riverbed scouring and silting can provide basic data support for clarifying the migration and transformation laws of pollutants in the water environment however in depth understanding of the spatial distribution of microbial community abundance structure and dominant bacterial species in riverbed sediments and their response to riverbed scouring in the study area are still lacking this study evaluated the riverbed sediment within 100 m of the left bank of the liaohe river combined with microelectrode technology diffusive gradients in a thin film dgt technique for in situ sampling and 16s rrna and polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification the primary objective was to explore the rule of redox zoning change under the influence of riverbed scouring and silting and analyze the response of microbial community structure and composition in riverbed sediment to riverbed scouring process additionally we explored the correlation between microbial community characteristics and environmental indicators to obtain a better understanding of the dynamic interaction between surface water and groundwater and the degradation reaction mechanism of pollutants between river and aquifer 2 materias and methods 2 1 study area the study area was situated in the huangjia water source zone northern shenyang china approximately 40 km away from shenyang city fig 1 the liaohe river flows from northeast to southwest and the wells are primarily distributed on the low floodplain of the south bank the river recharges groundwater all the year round and the groundwater flows from the river to the direction of the pumping wells the reach in the study area belongs to the qinghekou shifosi section with a length of 3 9 km and an average river width of 200 m bai et al 2020 2 2 characteristics of the riverbed sedimentary structure the riverbed sediments exhibit substantial spatial heterogeneity from the right bank to the left the river flow rate gradually decreased and the slope of the riverbed slowed down resulting in the diameter of the lithological particles of the riverbed sediments gradually decreased and the gray black silt layer on the riverbed became thicker a part of the silt layer on the surface of the riverbed on the right bank of the river was washed and the coarse sand particles carried from the upstream were deposited on the top of the silt layer forming a localized sedimentary structure of coarse and fine particles with sedimentary rhythm which reflects the scouring and silting cycle of multiple incoming water processes fig s1 2 3 meteorology hydrology and sediment concentration the temporal variation of precipitation in the study area is uneven throughout the year it is mainly concentrated between june and september during which period the precipitation is approximately 67 26 168 13 mm accounting for 72 34 of the annual precipitation river water infiltration and artificial exploitation are the main recharge and discharge ways of groundwater in the study area and the river water infiltrates to recharge the groundwater all the year the tieling hydrological station is located 27 km upstream of the study area the flood period mostly occurs between july and september the average runoff from 2014 to 2020 was 1 978 billion m3 of which the average flow in 2020 can reach 95 3 m3 s and the maximum flow can reach 810 m3 s floods come and go rapidly with a violent rise and fall in water levels accompanied by flood and sediment peaks when the flow is greater than 100 m3 s the sand content begins to increase considerably and the amount of sand transported from june to september can account for 90 04 of the sand transported in the whole year fig s2 2 4 quality characteristics of sediment pore water the ph value of riverbed sediment overlying water in the study area ranged 7 63 7 96 the ph value of sediment pore water was basically stable between 6 80 and 8 00 and decreased with the increase of depth affected by riverbed scouring the ph value in the pore water of the riverbed sediment in the lithological thinning zone of the weak scouring area decreased while the ph value in the pore water of the riverbed sediment in the lithological coarsening zone of the medium scouring area and the strong scouring area increased the total iron manganese and nitrate nitrogen contents were 0 00 15 30 0 01 6 26 and 0 11 4 68 mg l respectively according to the groundwater quality standard gb t148482017 the iron and manganese contents exceeded the class iii standard limits 0 3 mg l for iron and 0 1 mg l for manganese altogether the total iron and manganese contents were approximately 51 and 63 times that of the standard limits respectively which are closely related to the original geological environment 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling in order to analyze the response characteristics of biogeochemical reaction in the river infiltration zone under the influence of riverbed scouring the study selected a riverbed monitoring section along the groundwater monitoring wells and the extension of the center of the groundwater level depression cone fig 1 six representative riverbed sediment sampling points a f were evenly arranged within 100 m from the left bank of the liaohe river fig 2 the undisturbed riverbed sediment samples within the range of 0 5 1 2 m were collected by sdi vc mini shallow water sediment sampling rig made in u s a during september high level and november low level 2020 the siphon drainage method was used to collect the overlying water of the riverbed sediments and the samples were divided into three sections under anaerobic conditions 15 20 and 20 cm first unisense microelectrode technology was used to measure the dissolved oxygen do concentration at different depths of riverbed sediment pore water in a mm resolution then from the sediment samples 20 0 g of each section surface layer were collected using a sterilized medicine spoon for microbiological test and stored in a refrigerator at 20 c following thin film gradient diffusion dgt and high resolution pore water sampling rhizon technology were used to collect in situ riverbed sediment pore water samples among which zro at dgt was used to fix no3 zro chelex agi dgt was used to fix fe ii and mn ii and rhizon pore water sampler was used for dissolved organic carbon and so4 2 test 3 2 analytical methods 3 2 1 redox indicator analysis

analyzer test accuracy of the total organic carbon is 2 and the kjeldahl method test accuracy of the total nitrogen is 2 were used to determine the carbon and nitrogen contents in the sediments 3 2 2

shanghai china 4 results 4 1 lithological structure characteristics of riverbed sediments the liaohe riverbed sediments in the study area are mainly sandy silt sz and silt z with silty sands zs and mud m at individual depths the vertical distribution of lithology at each monitoring point is relatively consistent in the high water level while the lithological changes of the riverbed sediments during the low water level period are more significant fig s3 as shown in table 1 the lithological composition of the riverbed sediments presents obvious spatial and seasonal changes points a and b are closer to the riverbank where the cutting depth the depth of riverbed is small and the diameter of the lithological particles is relatively coarse compared with the high water level the lithology of the surface riverbed sediments in the low water level become finer points c and d are far away from the left bank of the liaohe river where the cutting depth is relatively large affected by modern river sedimentation the lithology of the riverbed sediments becomes finer compared with the high water level the lithology of the surface riverbed sediments in the low water level become coarser the water depth cutting depth and hydrodynamic strength of the river at point e and f are greater than that at other points and the sediment particles in the riverbed become coarser at the low water level as a result and according to the change in the surface lithological grain diameter of the riverbed sediments during high and low water level periods it is divided into lithologic thinning zone in the nearshore area a and b lithologic coarsening zone in the intermediate transitional area c and d and lithologic coarsening zone in the center of the riverbed e and f 4 2 changes of redox sensitivity indicators in riverbed sediments in different lithological zones 4 2 1 do as shown in fig 3 the do concentration in the pore water of the riverbed sediment gradually decreased with the increase in depth the surface layer top 5 mm is where aerobic respiration primarily occurs compared with the high water level the do content in the surface layer of the sediments at each monitoring point in the low water level was considerably reduced within the lithologic thinning zone in the nearshore area represented by points a and b the do penetration depths in the high water level were 5 5 and 30 mm respectively which were significantly higher than the corresponding do penetration depths of 2 and 2 mm in the low water level within the lithologic coarsening zone in the intermediate transitional area represented by points c and d the do penetration depths in the high water level were 3 2 and 3 8 mm respectively while the corresponding do penetration depths in the low water level were 2 8 and 5 mm respectively lastly within the lithologic coarsening zone in the center of riverbed represented by points e and f the do penetration depths in the high water level were 4 5 and 3 5 mm respectively while the corresponding do penetration depths in the low water level were 2 5 and 7 0 mm 4 2 2 water chemistry indicator 4 2 2 1 lithologic thinning zone in nearshore area a b as shown in fig 4 the maximum depth of no3 n decrease in pore water in the low water level was significantly lower than that in the high water level the depths at which no3 n concentration decreased to 0 2 mg l during the high and low water level at point a were 7 and 1 5 cm respectively the no3 n concentration at point b in the high water level gradually increased from 0 4364 mg l at 1 mm depth to 3 68 mg l at 20 mm depth primarily due to nitrification after the do was gradually consumed the no3 n concentration gradually decreased with depth to below 0 2 mg l at 16 cm where the low water level dropped below 0 2 mg l at the 1 5 cm position at point a the mn2 concentration peaked at 8 and 6 cm during the high and low water levels while the fe2 concentration peaked at 26 and 19 cm respectively the concentration of mn2 at the high and low water levels of point b reached a peak at 19 and 10 cm respectively while the fe2 concentration reached the peak at 25 and 20 cm the mn2 concentration peaked earlier than the fe2 concentration and there was a certain degree of overlap between the iron manganese reduction zone during the high and low water levels at point a so4 2 concentration began to decrease at 18 and 6 cm respectively correspondingly at point b so4 2 concentration began to decrease at 28 and 26 cm for high and low water level respectively there was a high degree of overlap between the sulfate and iron manganese reduction zones and compared with the high water level an shallower so4 2 reduction location in the low water level was observed 4 2 2 2 lithologic coarsening zone in intermediate transitional area c d as shown in fig 5 at point c the maximum depth range of no3 n concentration decrease during high and low water levels was 1 6 cm and 1 7 cm respectively and at point d it was 2 5 cm and 3 0 cm respectively the depths when the no3 n concentration decreased during the high and low water levels were similar at point c the mn2 concentration peaked at 27 and 32 cm during the high and low water levels while the fe2 concentration peaked at 36 and 47 cm respectively the concentration of mn2 at the high and low water levels of point d reached the peak at 28 and 47 cm respectively the fe2 concentration peaked at 39 and 47 cm for high and low water levels respectively during the high and low water levels at point c sulfate concentrations began to decrease at 4 and 10 cm respectively sulfate concentration in the high and low water level at point d began to decrease at 8 and 15 cm respectively 4 2 2 3 lithologic coarsening zone in the center of riverbed e f at point e and f the no3 n concentration in the high water level showed a downward trend in the 0 3 5 cm and 0 7 cm depth range and a considerable decrease in the 0 4 cm and 0 20 cm depth range in the low water level the concentration of mn2 at the high and low water levels of point e reached the peak at 27 and 30 cm the fe2 concentration reached the peak at 37 and 48 cm the mn2 and fe2 concentration of point f reached a peak at 29 and 47 cm during the low water level respectively sulfate concentrations in the high and low water level at point e began to decrease at 4 and 12 cm respectively while so4 2 concentration began to decrease at 54 cm at point f during the low water level in the high water level only 12 cm of riverbed sediment samples at point f were obtained hence the iron manganese and sulfate reduction zones were not reached fig 6 4 3 microbial response characteristics in the different lithological zones it can be seen from the horizontal columnar distribution of the dominant microbial genera associated with n fe mn s and c in the riverbed sediments fig 7 the total number of microbial communities in the riverbed sediments showed a vertical upward trend considering the sampling point a in the low water level as example the relative abundance of main microorganisms in the surface layer was 16 03 which gradually increased to 26 25 at 35 cm the number of microbial communities on the cross section increased from the nearshore area toward the center of the riverbed the relative abundance at the nearshore area intermediate transition area and the center of the riverbed during the low water level were 21 99 23 04 and 23 75 on average respectively among them in the near shore area due to the thinning of lithological grains of the surface riverbed sediments in the low water level the number of dominant microbial communities increased from 17 35 and 20 57 to 19 97 and 21 82 respectively in the intermediate transition area points c and d and the central area of the riverbed points e and f the surface lithological grains of the riverbed sediments were coarsened during the low water level and the number of dominant microbial communities decreased from 17 20 19 15 22 78 and 18 62 to 16 77 16 56 19 41 and 15 02 respectively the dominant bacteria in the sediments of the riverbed during high water level primarily included flavobacterium clostridium thiobacillus geobacter pseudomonas and novosphingobium the communities with a relative abundance 1 during the low water level mainly included pseudomonas rhizobiales thiobacillus desulfuromonas clostridium sulfuricurvum and sphingomonas in addition various diatoms were found in the riverbed sediments during the low water level especially in the surface layer of the riverbed sediments which further indicated that there were a certain number of aquatic plants in the liaohe river and that the river water had risk of eutrophication 5 discussion 5 1 variation in riverbed sediment lithology law under the influence of riverbed scouring and silting as shown in fig s4 a the river flow rate had strong temporal and spatial changes with the increase in the distance from the left bank of the liaohe river the flow rate gradually increased reflecting the gradual rise in hydrodynamic intensity from the nearshore area to the center of the riverbed the water velocity at point f could reach 1 14 m s in the high water level which considerably dropped during low water levels contrarily point a was stagnant throughout the year fig s4 b shows the dynamics of the flow and sediment concentration of the hydrological station near the study section between september and november 2020 the maximum sediment concentration in september reached 1 17 kg m3 while in november it was not detectable the sediment concentration showed the same dynamic change law as the flow rate with increasing river velocity due to which the carrying capacity of sediment increased resulting in more serious riverbed silting the temporal and spatial changes of river hydrodynamic intensity and sediment concentration in the cross section of the riverbed led to different degrees of scouring or silting of the sediments which caused spatial differences in the lithology of riverbed sediments as shown in fig s5 and table 2 sand silt and clay represent bed load components progressively suspended and uniformly suspended components respectively the sand index and silt index of the sample table 3 can reflect the dynamic environment of sediment formation and the intensity of disturbance sand index percentage of sand sum of silt and clay percentage silt index percentage of silt percentage of clay the sand index during the high water level period at points a and b were 0 10 and 0 45 respectively the sand index in the low water level period was considerably lower at 0 06 and 0 35 for points a and b respectively indicating a weak hydrodynamic effect in the nearshore zone compared with the high water level period the lithology of the surface riverbed sediments at points a and b showed a refinement trend compared with the high water level the sand index and silt index of points c f in the low water level had an increasing trend and with the increase of the distance from the river bank the sand index and silt index were higher indicating that the hydrodynamic conditions of the river and the intensity of disturbance to sediments increased during the low water level and the hydrodynamic conditions of the center of the riverbed were stronger than that of the river bank although the variation trend of riverbed sediment particle size with depth at each point was nearly the same in the high and low water level there were significant differences in the depth positions where the average particle size of riverbed sediment changed significantly at different water levels reflecting the impact of riverbed scouring for example according to fig s5 at the point 80 m away from the left bank of the liaohe river point d the depth with the average grain size of 206 5 μm was 40 cm below the riverbed in the high water level and 32 cm below the riverbed in the low water level combined with the hydrodynamic conditions of the river the lithological composition and structural change characteristics of the riverbed sediments and the sediment disturbance intensity relative to the high water level period from the nearshore area to the center of the riverbed the riverbed in the low water level period gradually transitioned from a silting to an scouring state where the scouring depths at point b c d and e could reach 4 6 6 and 8 cm respectively fig s5 5 2 dynamic change characteristics of redox indicators under the influence of riverbed scouring and silting at present there is no unified classification standard and zoning threshold for redox zoning in groundwater in the process of river water infiltration kedziorek et al 2008 champ et al 1979 petrunic et al 2005 kuehn and mueller 2000 massmann et al 2008 according to the temporal and spatial variation of the concentration of redox components in the riverbed sediment pore water during the river water infiltration process in the study area the redox zoning thresholds for river water infiltration in this study were shown in table 3 as shown in fig 8 during river water infiltration the sequential oxidation reduction reaction occurred under the mediation of microorganisms forming a sequential o2 no3 mn iv fe iii and so4 2 reduction zone from top to bottom within a depth of 70 cm of riverbed sediments previous studies have shown that based on the difference in gibbs free energy the electron acceptor undergoes redox in sequence petrunic et al 2005 kuehn and mueller 2000 however due to the seasonal changes of hydrodynamic conditions and the complex variability of riverbed sediment lithology this study found highly overlapped no3 mn iv fe iii and so4 2 reduction zones at some depths as shown in table 3 during high and low water levels the maximum overlap depth of no3 and mn iv reduction zones can reach 8 and 2 cm that of mn iv and fe iii reduction zones can reach 46 and 49 cm and that of fe iii and so4 2 reduction zones can reach 48 cm and 50 cm respectively redox zoning exhibits both spatial and temporal variation as shown in fig 8 and table 4 compared with the high water level period during the low water level period at 10 m point a and 20 m point b away from the river bank due to the weakening of the hydrodynamic conditions of the river the surface lithological particles of the riverbed sediment become finer the retention time of river water in riverbed sediments increases with the redox indicators reacting effectively resulting in a upward shift of the oxidation reduction zone the no3 mn iv fe iii and so4 2 reduction zones moved up 5 5 12 5 15 20 9 11 and 22 23 cm respectively and the range of each reduction zone became narrower as the distance from the river bank increased the riverbed scouring intensity increased and the surface lithological particles of the riverbed sediment became coarser which led to an increase in the intensity of river water infiltration shortened the time for the water to infiltrate through the riverbed sediment resulting in a downward shift of the oxidation reduction zone the no3 mn iv fe iii and so4 2 reduction zones moved down 0 1 1 3 5 5 10 and 5 10 cm respectively and the range of each reduction zone became wider riverbed scouring silting caused changes in redox zoning which led to variations in the change gradient of redox indicators the generation gradient of mn2 and fe2 or the attenuation gradient of do no3 and so4 2 can be calculated by dividing the peak concentration or the stable concentration by the relevant depth therefore as shown in fig 8 at 10 m point a and 20 m point b away from the river bank relative to the high water level the surface riverbed sediments showed a refinement trend and the river retention time prolonged leading to the increasing of attenuation gradient of do no3 and so4 2 and mn2 and fe2 generation gradient as the distance from the river bank increased the riverbed scouring intensity became greater the penetration depth of dissolved oxygen increased and the denitrification was delayed resulting in a prolonged iron manganese reduction reaction and delayed sulfate reduction 5 3 community comparison and relationships between community structure and environmental factors during river water infiltration the evolution of the chemical composition is inseparable from the community structure and function of microorganisms according to redundancy analysis rda fig s6 a and b the microbial composition of the surface layer of the riverbed is closely related to the concentration of no3 and so4 2 while the microbial composition of the deep layer samples is closely related to the concentration of fe2 mn2 nh4 soc and tn reflecting that the surface layer is primarily characterized by nitrate reduction while the deep layer is mainly characterized by iron manganese and sulfate reduction the sample points in the high water level were relatively scattered and the projection shown by the arrow was farther from the origin indicating that the microbial community structure had a greater impact on related environmental factors in addition there was a strong positive correlation between the fe2 and mn2 concentration further verifying the overlap between the iron manganese reduction zones as shown in fig s6 c and d the dominant bacteria has a direct correlation with no3 fe2 mn2 and so4 2 in the pore water and the functions and activities of dominant bacteria shows evidence of co evolution with the hydrochemical environment which is characteristic of a redox zoning although many microorganisms can participate in the oxidation reduction cycle of fe mn n and s elements they may not drive a single reaction reflecting the diversity of microbial functions in riverbed sediments 5 4 response of dominant microbial species to the hydrochemical evolution as shown in fig 9 and table 5 the spatial distribution of dominant bacteria in the riverbed sediment was in good agreement with the redox zoning due to riverbed scouring there were differences among dominant bacterial species at different depths during the high water level the surface layer of the riverbed sediment was dominated by pseudomonas lutibacter and rhodobacter which can participate in denitrification and iron manganese reduction during the low water level most of the riverbed of the liaohe river was eroded the do reduction zone and no3 reduction zone had moved down leading to the increase in denitrifying bacteria and the dominance of pseudomonas thauera and rhodobacter in the riverbed sediment which can be widely involved in no3 reduction some diatoms were found in the surface riverbed sediments during the low water period hence there were abundant rhizobiales on the surface of the riverbed sediments the riverbed sediments at depths of 15 and 35 cm were primarily dominated by iron and manganese and sulfate reducing bacteria the dominant bacteria in the high water level include geobacter clostridium pseudomonas desulfobulbus desulfuromonas arenimonas and bacillus the dominant bacterial in the low water level were mainly changed from geobacter to lutibacter and thiobacillus and other dominant bacterial remained unchanged due to the high overlap between the mn iv fe iii and sulfate reduction zones a variety of iron manganese and sulfate dominant bacteria often co existed in deep riverbed sediments which supported the water chemistry analysis results 5 5 microbes involved in biogeochemical cycles 5 5 1 nitrate reducing bacteria as shown in fig 10 during the low water level period the total relative abundance of denitrifying microorganisms in the nearshore area shows an increasing trend which relates to the denitrification intensity whereas the decrease in the intermediate transition area and center of the riverbed reflects on the decrease in intensity of denitrification due to scouring the change in the relative abundance of the microbial communities during the high and low water level periods further confirms the results of changes in the intensity of denitrification from the nearshore area to the center of the riverbed as discussed in section 5 2 5 5 2 iron and manganese reducing bacteria as shown in fig 11 the relative abundance of iron and manganese functional microorganisms in the high water level increased from the nearshore area toward the center of riverbed the nearshore area was dominated by lutibacter and thiobacillus whereas clostridium gradually dominated near the center of riverbed and the relative abundance of microorganisms increased the relative abundance of iron and manganese functional microorganisms in the low water level increased from the center of riverbed to the nearshore area nearshore area was dominated by lutibacter and arenimonas near the center of riverbed the dominant bacteria gradually transitioned to clostridium from the high to the low water level from the silting of the riverbed in the nearshore area to the scouring of the riverbed in the center of riverbed the microbial abundance of iron manganese reduction function decreased with the increase in the distance from the liaohe river which further verified that the iron manganese reduction gradient in the nearshore area increased while the iron manganese reduction gradient in the intermediate transition area and the center of riverbed decreased as discussed in section 5 2 5 5 3 sulfate reducing bacteria as shown in fig 12 the vertical relative abundance of sulfate reducing microorganisms initially increases and then decreases with the increase in depth which is closely related to the changes in sulfate concentration in the riverbed sediments see section 4 2 2 for related analysis reflecting the initial sulfate reducing increase and then decreases vertically the horizontal relative abundance of sulfate reducing microorganisms decreases from the intermediate transition to the nearshore area and toward the center of riverbed which was consistent with the intensity of sulfate reduction recorded as shown in fig 8 in the nearshore area the relative abundance of sulfate reducing microorganisms in the low water level was higher than that in the high water level reflecting the increase in the intensity of sulfate reduction in the intermediate transition area and the center of riverbed due to riverbed scouring the relative abundance of sulfate reducing microorganisms decreased and was consistent with the decrease in sulfate reduction rate in the low water level as discussed in section 5 2 6 conclusions this study combined the microelectrode technology dgt in situ sampling technology 16s rrna sequencing and pcr amplification technology to reveal the changing law of redox indicator in the riverbed sediment pore water under the influence of riverbed scouring as well as the microbial response characteristics the research mainly draws the following important conclusions during the investigation period september to november 2020 the riverbed sediments in the river reach were generally in a state of scouring in the low water stage and the scour depth was 4 9 cm the scouring and silting of the riverbed significantly affects the redox zoning in the process of river water infiltration the redox zone in the nearshore area moved up by 5 5 23 cm and moved down by 0 1 10 cm in the intermediate transition area and the central of riverbed the no3 mn iv fe iii and sulfate reduction zones were highly overlapped and the maximum overlapping depth of the redox zone could reach 50 cm the functions and activities of dominant bacteria in the riverbed sediment responded to the redox zoning and can actively participate in the redox cycle of iron manganese arsenic nitrogen and surfur elements influenced by riverbed scouring there were certain differences in dominant bacteria at different depths of the riverbed and the number of microbial communities in intermediate transition zone and the center of riverbed during the low water level decreased during high and low water levels the relative abundance of denitrifying and iron manganese and sulfate reducing microorganisms in riverbed sediments can indicate the intensity of these processes while dominant bacteria species and population diversity had a correlation with the hydrodynamic conditions and lithological characteristics due to the ambiguity and uncertainty of existing hydrochemical methods combining the distribution of dominant bacteria in different depths of the riverbed sediments can more accurately and effectively reveal the biogeochemical effects of riverbed sediments in the process of river water infiltration characterizing the composition of the microbial community and its response to redox processes can improve our understanding of the biotransformation mechanism of pollutants during river water infiltration in the future combining more periods of riverbed scouring silting process analysis and riverbed sediment microbial biomass changes can enrich our research results credit authorship contribution statement jing bai conceptualization

2109,runoff changes are critical to the sustainable water resource in the lancang mekong river basin lmrb changes in the lmrb s runoff over the past decades are unclear because of inadequate streamflow observations the advancement of global hydrological models ghms has facilitated the understanding of runoff change worldwide however it is required to evaluate the performance of ghms in simulating historical runoff change in the lmrb before assessing the runoff changes this study aims to conduct a multi model analysis of temporal spatial changes in runoff in the lmrb for 1971 2010 using ten ghms from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip and evaluate the corresponding uncertainties among models results show that the model ensemble mean has the best performance than the individuals when compared with the reference data based on the model ensemble mean large spatial heterogeneity of runoff is found in the lmrb with an overall slightly positive trend 8 03 besides the models perform better in estimating the trends of high flow than low flow as to the trend of runoff in the wet and dry seasons about 32 70 of the basin became drier wetter in the dry wet season meanwhile 17 of the basin has experienced a trend of drier dry seasons and wetter wet seasons overall our results highlight the uncertainty of the runoff changes in the lmrb in the low flow simulation particularly requiring more attention in future model improvement the complex change patterns of the runoff suggest the importance of accurate runoff observations and projections for better water management keywords high flow isimip low flow multi model uncertainty data availability all the data used in this work are available at the the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip https www isimip org 1 introduction surface runoff constitutes a significant component of the available water resources strongly associated with regional socio economic development wu et al 2017 the non public available streamflow data for most land areas hampers the investigation of runoff changes asadieh et al 2016 global hydrological models ghms development has advanced rapidly over the past decades which simulates satisfactory land surface hydrologic dynamics of continental scale river basins and provides runoff at the grid level gosling and arnell 2011 employing the hydrological models makes the investigation of spatiotemporal changes to runoff possible it further improves our understanding of regional hydrological cycle changes which could support water resource management protection and sustainable use shan et al 2021 despite the significant advancement of ghms the available hydrological simulation outputs are of discrepancies because they are simulated by unique hydrological models which have different representations of hydrological processes sood and smakhtin 2015 in addition different climate forcing inputs could also bring discrepancies in the simulations hattermann et al 2018 intercomparisons of the simulations from the ghms are thus needed before further evaluating the hydrological analysis model inter comparison projects like the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip warszawski et al 2014 have made it possible to evaluate the ghms simulations and apply the outputs in global impact studies thereby providing frameworks for consistent assessments of the terrestrial water cycle giuntoli et al 2015 some studies have investigated the runoff trends using multi model approaches hoang et al 2016 thompson et al 2013 milly et al 2005 showed that an ensemble of 12 climate models exhibits qualitative and statistically significant skill in simulating observed regional patterns of twentieth century multidecadal changes in streamflow stahl et al 2012 tested whether the white space on maps of observed runoff trends in europe could be filled using estimates of an ensemble of eight ghms they showed that the ensemble mean overall provided the best representation of trends in the observations najafi and moradkhani 2015 analyzed the extreme runoff by the multi model ensemble of eight regional climate models and found that the merged signal generally outperforms the best individual signal marx et al 2017 investigated how the hydrological low flows were affected under different levels of future global warming in rivers using a multi model ensemble of 45 hydrological simulations and they concluded that climate change studies focusing on river low flows should employ large multi model ensembles to provide a comprehensive analysis of model uncertainty as one of asia s largest transboundary river basins the lancang mekong river basin lmrb fig 1 plays a vital role in economic development in southeast asia liu et al 2021 the fishery agriculture and hydropower sectors along the river are highly dependent on this commonly shared water resource yun et al 2020 recent studies have shown increased magnitudes and frequencies of floods and droughts in the lmrb in the past decades hoang et al 2016 lyon et al 2017 which will be further intensified under future climate change eastham et al 2008 hoang et al 2016 lauri et al 2012 västilä et al 2010 however previous multi model studies in the lmrb mainly focused on changes in future runoff including drought and floods under the projected impact of climate change hasson et al 2016 hoang et al 2019 lauri et al 2012 a multi model analysis of historical changes in runoff in the lmrb has not been conducted the study of historical runoff regime changes would provide useful information regarding the temporal and spatial evolution of runoff in response to climate change bawden et al 2015 therefore an assessment of historical changes in the runoff regime of the lmrb is necessary to provide valuable information on water availability for subsequent management although chen et al 2021 have evaluated the performance of isimip models in simulating lancang mekong river discharges it has shown a systematic underestimation at low percentiles of discharge due to the models routing scheme therefore to further explore the performance and associated uncertainties of isimip models in simulating lmrb runoff the temporal spatial runoff regime changes in the lmrb during 1971 2010 were comprehensively investigated our key objectives include the following 1 to assess the runoff regime changes concerning different hydrological indicators using multi model simulations 2 to estimate the associated uncertainties among models in addition to the spatial characteristics of runoff regime changes 3 to identify hot spots of runoff change in the lmrb although traditional uncertainty analyses have been conducted in a rather narrow sense by considering contributions based on certain metrics such as the coefficient of variation phi hoang et al 2016 multiple metrics have rarely been quantified thus our study quantifies the uncertainties in runoff trend detection using three different metrics and the results provide a better understanding of the model performances in addition a deeper understanding of the past runoff regime characteristic changes and uncertainties relating to multi model approaches can also assist in improving projections of future hydrological regime changes in the lmrb 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials in this study the simulated daily runoff data from ten state of the art ghms clm4 dbh h08 lpjml matsiro mpi hm pcr globwb vic watergap2 and ways are used to analyze changes in the runoff regime within the lmrb during 1971 2010 all the selected models were used in the second phase of the isimip isimip2a warszawski et al 2014 all models were driven by the same climate forcing global soil wetness project phase 3 data hereafter abbreviated as gswp3 using a spatial resolution of 0 5 from 1 january 1971 to 31 december 2010 on a continuous run on the daily scale the gswp3 dataset was generated based on the 20th century reanalysis project and has been widely used in several studies conducting hydrological simulations masaki et al 2017 tangdamrongsub et al 2018 veldkamp et al 2017 the watergap and ways models were calibrated prior to the hydrological simulation alcamo et al 2003 mao and liu 2019 the other eight models were not calibrated specifically for the isimip2a simulations and their default model parameters were therefore used in the runoff simulations none of the selected models have considered the effects of water management and other human activities on the water system though many of them shared similar structures and parameterizations all models were treated as independent for example some were similar concerning their fundamental approach to simulating evapotranspiration representing water exchanges in soil across the basin and modeling snow melting the primary differences in the models concerning simulating land surface hydrological processes are presented in table 1 detailed descriptions of the models applied in this work are provided by references associated with each model cited in the table the international satellite land surface climatology project initiative ii university of new hampshire global runoff data centre islscp ii unh grdc hereafter referred to as unh grdc composite monthly runoff data are available at a spatial resolution of 0 5 for 1986 1995 which represents the composite runoff data based on the water balance model runoff estimates and assimilates of observed discharge at gauge stations the spatial characteristics of the water balance are preserved but constrained by the records observed at stations fekete et al 2011 the unh grdc data also represents a standard dataset used in the isimip2a for model validation warszawski et al 2014 therefore the unh grdc was employed as reference data to evaluate the performances of model simulations in the study area 2 2 methods a framework for multi model analyses is compiled to investigate the runoff regime changes in the lmrb when considering both spatiotemporal characteristics and uncertainties which are outlined in fig 2 and detailed in the following sections 1 evaluate the model performance in replicating the temporal and spatial patterns of the reference runoff data using seven commonly used metrics 2 conduct trend detection for six hydrological indicators first at the basin scale and then grid scale to demonstrate the temporal and spatial patterns of runoff regime changes in the lmrb for 1971 2010 3 quantify the uncertainties in runoff trend detection for each hydrological indicator using three metrics to explore confidence in the trend signal for runoff at different magnitudes over the study period 4 analyze runoff regime changes in the dry november may and wet june october seasons the regions where runoff increased in the wet season and decreased in the dry season were highlighted 2 2 1 metrics used in model performance evaluation before investigating runoff regime changes the models applied in this study are evaluated against the reference runoff data performances of the models are first assessed using a monthly runoff time series simulation and their abilities to replicate runoff at different return periods were evaluated their performances are further evaluated using a set of transferrable benchmarks generally different metrics can assess individual characteristics of a simulated time series burgan and aksoy 2022 in this study seven metrics are applied to enable a comprehensive comparison six of these metrics i e the relative bias normalized root mean square difference rmsd correlation coefficient normalized standard deviation nsd centered rmsd and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are applied to assess the relative performance of individual models in replicating the temporal patterns of reference runoff data their results are presented in three types of diagrams the target diagram the radar diagram and the taylor diagram at the same time the spatial efficiency metric spaef is adopted for spatial pattern comparison of the simulated and reference runoff data which was originally proposed by demirel et al 2013 the expressions of each metric are presented in table 2 and detailed evaluation criteria are also remarked in the table 2 2 2 hydrological indicators for runoff change seven hydrological indicators are employed to investigate the changes in the runoff regime within the lmrb for 1971 2010 table 3 mean annual runoff mar annual 7 day minima runoff min7 and the annual 7 day maxima runoff max7 are used to appraise the runoff regime changes relating to extreme events danneberg 2012 the 95th percentile runoff q95 and the 5th percentile runoff q5 are applied to assess the low value and high value of runoff changes in the basin respectively runoff in the wet season rwet and runoff in the dry season rdry are used to assess the overall runoff changes on an annual scale and during the wet and dry seasons respectively the hydrological indicators are calculated from the simulated daily runoff during the study period furthermore to facilitate a comparison between the runoff changes identified by different models the relative change trend in this study is expressed as the percentage change over the study period relative to the mean of the variable for each time series 4 cr k n x 100 where cr represents the change ratio k mm year is the estimated slope n is the number of years in the study period and x is the mean of the analyzed variable a non parametric estimation method using sen s slope estimator is applied to each hydrological indicator to detect trends in runoff gilbert 1987 sen 1968 as it estimates the trend of a time series based on the slope of the kendall theil robust line theil 1992 sen s slope estimator is robust to outliers and has been widely used in studies to describe trend magnitudes in climate and hydrological variables stahl et al 2012 in addition mann kendall s gilbert 1987 kendall 1948 mann 1945 test at the significance level of 95 is also conducted to determine statistically significant trends in the long term time series 2 2 3 metrics for quantifying uncertainty among models uncertainties relating to the multi model analysis of changes in the runoff trend detection are quantified by using the coefficient of variation c v signal to noise ratio snr and the number of models that agreed on the same trend of the model ensemble mean c v is computed for the change trend in hydrological indicators estimated by the models demonstrating the extent of variability in model estimates in relation to the mean a higher c v indicates higher uncertainties and lower consistency between model estimates of runoff trend detection and vice versa snr is computed as the ratio between the external and internal variance for multi model runoff simulations providing the signal to noise levels by relating the ensemble s variance to that of the individual members schellekens et al 2017 smaller snr values represent higher uncertainties and lower consistency between model simulations of runoff an snr value below 1 indicates that the inter model variability is larger than the ensemble mean variability implying a low inter model agreement for the runoff simulation the number of models agreeing on the same trend of the model ensemble mean is then determined to reveal consistencies between the trend signs of the models 3 results 3 1 evaluation of model performance performances of the ten selected models in simulating monthly runoff time series are evaluated against the reference data unh grdc runoff data from 1986 to 1995 fig 3 a results show that all models could replicate the observed monthly runoff time series and the seasonal runoff cycles and the multi model ensemble mean agrees well with the reference data the probability of exceedance of the model simulations was also investigated to assess the models performances in simulating runoff at different return periods fig 3b model simulated runoff is skewed differently at different magnitudes and the models performed better in estimating the high flow than the low flow again the model ensemble mean resembles the exceedance probability well and provides a good match with the unh grdc runoff data indicating the high performance of the model ensemble mean of runoff at different magnitudes fig 4 displays the ten selected models performance simulating monthly runoff time series the relative bias between the reference data and model simulations is less than 10 except for three models dhb h08 and matsiro the relative bias is slightly higher but still below the threshold of 35 in these three models fig 4a the model ensemble mean exhibits the best relative bias score 2 and the third highest score in the normalized rmsd indicating a generally good runoff simulation of the basin the pcr globwb clm4 and the model ensemble mean exhibit better runoff simulation performances with smaller normalized rmsd values in comparison the performances of the dbh and h08 models are less favorable due to the relatively larger normalized rmsd most tested models demonstrate nses larger than 0 7 indicating good and highly accurate performances when reproducing the runoff time series however three models h08 dbh and lpjm demonstrate low nses fig 4b the model ensemble mean achieves the best performance with an nse value of 0 90 followed by ways 0 88 pcr globwb 0 88 and clm4 0 87 the taylor diagram depicts a comprehensive model matching skill between simulated runoff and the reference runoff data fig 4c all models are found to have correlation coefficients higher than 0 8 half of the models and the model ensemble mean have correlation coefficients greater than 0 9 exhibiting strong runoff simulation performances in this respect models with relatively high correlations typically have low normalized rmsd fig 4c a normalized standard deviation larger than one implies a somewhat higher variation in a model s simulated time series than the reference data at the same time values lower than one indicate that the time series has a weaker amplitude although the model simulations of clm4 pcr globwb and matsiro demonstrate stronger relationships with unh grdc runoff data than the model ensemble mean the model ensemble mean provides a better replication of the variations within the runoff time series with the normalized standard deviation lying nearest to the green contour marked ref the results of the spatial performance evaluation are shown in fig 5 compared with the reference runoff data the model ensemble mean shows the best performance of high correlation coefficient of variation and histogram overlap most areas present high positive values with a mean spaef value of 0 53 in addition most tested models demonstrate spaef larger than 0 4 indicating high spatial similarity with unh grdc runoff reference data among the models lpjml and ways have the best performance while clm4 matsiro and watergap2 demonstrate relatively low spaef primarily located at the lower basin overall the above model evaluations reveal that the model ensemble mean outperforms the individual models for replicating monthly time series seasonal cycles and runoff at different return periods furthermore the model ensemble mean is capable of modeling variability in the runoff time series and shows the best spatial correlation with the unh grdc runoff reference data therefore the model ensemble mean is used to analyze runoff regime changes in the lmrb and then the model associated uncertainties are quantified based on the ten model simulations in the following sections 3 2 overall runoff regime changes on the basin scale the mar changes from the ten ghms for 1971 2010 are depicted in fig 6 a the spread of the mar simulations from the ten models indicates uncertainties in the model simulations however they show similar variabilities over the years based on the model ensemble mean the annual mar in the lmrb shows high interannual variability with an average annual value of 655 mm yr over the study period the ensemble mean mar was of low value in 1977 498 78 mm yr and 1998 509 86 mm yr while it was of high value in 1978 792 02 mm yr and 2000 867 15 mm yr overall the mar slightly increased by 52 61 mm 8 03 p greater than 0 05 from 1971 to 2010 fig 6b depicts the estimated changes in the seven hydrological indicators from the ten ghms for the lmrb in 1971 2010 based on the multi model simulation all hydrological indicators demonstrate increasing change trends for the lmrb except for min7 and q95 indicators models also show relatively high agreements for change trend detections of mar max7 q5 and rwet indicators the highest model agreement is observed for the mar trend detection with the smallest spread range among the model estimates in contrast large uncertainties in model estimates are observed for change trend detections of low runoff values min7 and q95 and rdry the rdry in particular ranged from 7 58 to 34 91 overall the model ensemble mean based estimates indicate that runoff in the lmrb had insignificantly increased during 1971 2010 in terms of low flows high flows mar and runoff in both dry and wet seasons the change in the high flow including mar 8 14 max7 8 46 and q5 8 03 all exhibit insignificant increasing trends the modeled low flow min7 and q95 has the lowest increasing ratio of the 2 23 and 1 67 respectively runoff during the dry season shows the most significant increase 17 74 p 0 05 while runoff during the wet season increases slightly approximately 6 24 p 0 05 3 3 spatial patterns in runoff changes and uncertainties fig 7 illustrates the spatial patterns of change trends based on the model ensemble mean of mar low flow min7 and q95 and high flow max7 and q5 during 1971 2010 the spatial distribution of trend in mar fig 7a is characterized by a prominent gradient from the upper and lower basin to the middle basin with a strong increasing trend in the upper and lower basin that contradicts a predominantly decreasing trend in the middle basin and within a small region of the lower basin the trends in high flow fig 7c e exhibit broadly similar patterns to the trends in mar with significant positive trends in the lower basin the trends in low flow fig 7b d have more prominent negative trends evident in the middle and lower basins but with lower local variability which are slightly different from those of other hydrological indicators in addition the models demonstrate a general consistent trend detection for mar max7 and q5 at most of the region all the models show similar trends of the model ensemble mean both positive and negative however there are more noticeable inconsistencies between the model estimates of min7 and q95 and the disagreement among models is widespread across the upper and lower basin overall the model simulations of runoff show a significant difference in spatial distribution with better and more consistent performance in mar and high runoff max7 and q5 than the low runoff min7 and q95 fig 8 depicts the uncertainties associated with the model trend detection to evaluate the model consistency among the models further as all models are driven by the same climate forcings the uncertainties are only related to differences between the model structures and parameters the uncertainty analysis of mar indicates high agreements for estimating trend magnitudes across the basin where the cv is lower than 50 for most regions fig 8a grid cells with relatively high disagreement are sparsely distributed in the upper most middle and lower most areas the models are strongly consistent when detecting the trend signal fig 7a in either positive or negative regions fig 8k for most areas all models demonstrate the same change trend signal of the model ensemble mean indicating the high performance of models in estimating the runoff although high consistency is observed in estimating the mar trend signal and magnitude the snr results also show that some regions upper basin and the western part of the lower basin have more significant inter model variability than the ensemble mean indicating a large spread in the runoff simulation among models fig 8f uncertainties in high flow q5 and max7 are found to have generally similar patterns with the mar in terms of cv and model agreements with the trend signal even though the local variability differed slightly fig 8c e there are large differences in the snr between mar and high flow fig 8h j max7 demonstrates a high inter model agreement in the runoff simulation across the entire basin except for a small region in the upper and lower basin in contrast q5 generally demonstrates a low inter model agreement within the lmrb and only a few middle and lower basin areas exhibit lower uncertainties however the low flow q95 and min7 clearly shows different patterns compared to mar and high flow for all the agreement metrics fig 8b d g i l n there were large disagreements in the runoff simulations between the models over the entire basin with the cv value larger than 200 and the snr value lower than 1 in addition the number of models that are consistent with the trend in the model ensemble mean is less at low flow than at high flow fig 8l n overall mar max7 and q5 exhibit high consistency and low uncertainties between the models indicating that the model estimates of the annual runoff and high flow changes are more accurate however min7 and q95 express relatively low consistency and high uncertainties among the models 3 4 runoff changes in dry and wet seasons strongly influenced by the indian monsoon and the east asian monsoon the lmrb has distinct dry and wet seasons pokhrel et al 2018a therefore the runoff change trend is also investigated in the lmrb for the dry and wet seasons the model ensemble mean shows that runoff has increased by 6 04 in the wet season and 16 6 in the dry season the runoff change trend detection of individual models is depicted in fig 9 all models demonstrate increasing runoff trends in dry and wet seasons but with different magnitudes the runoff trends simulated by the models ranged from 3 to 9 83 in the wet season and 7 58 to 34 91 in the dry season among the ten models only pcr globwb demonstrates a significant increasing trend in the dry season which is insignificant for other models additionally the estimated monthly average runoff varied from 70 85 mm month to 132 22 mm month in the wet season between 13 49 mm month and 40 22 mm month in the dry season spatially the runoff changes in the wet and dry seasons demonstrate similar patterns throughout the basin except for some small areas in the middle and lower basin fig 10 a b in the dry season fig 10b the areas in the middle basin that demonstrate a decreasing trend are considerably more prominent than in the wet season and the magnitude of the trend is also relatively higher in the center of the lower basin increasing runoff trends are observed in the dry season fig 10b and opposite decreasing trends are observed in the wet season fig 10a the increasing trend in the dry season is significant in larger areas than in the wet season the results also show high model consistency for the trend signal in both dry and wet seasons as shown by the grid cells with the box the lmrb has experienced droughts and floods in recent decades pokhrel et al 2018b the increases and decreases in runoff in the wet and dry seasons respectively enhance the wet and dry conditions in the region fig 10c highlights the areas with different change patterns identified by investigating the spatial characteristics of runoff changes in the dry and wet seasons in general 30 of the area within the basin becomes drier in the dry season red and yellow pixels in fig 10c on the other hand about 70 of the area becomes wetter in the wet season green and blue pixels in fig 10c 17 of the region yellow pixels in fig 10c suffers from both situations and becomes drier in the dry seasons and wetter in the wet seasons furthermore some areas exhibited decreased runoff in the wet season and increased runoff in the dry season green pixels in fig 10c 4 discussion this study examines the runoff changes in the lmrb for 1971 2010 using ten hydrological models from the isimip different indicators are applied to provide a deeper analysis of the historical runoff regime change and uncertainties relating to the multi model simulations overall model evaluations show that all models could replicate the temporal and spatial variability of the reference runoff well figs 2 4 regarding temporal variability ways pcr globwb and clm4 have the best performance among the models figs 3 4 for spatial variability lpjml and ways are the best with high correlation coefficient of variation and histogram overlap with the reference data fig 5 as the same climate forcings drive all models these varied performances can be related to the differences between the model structures and parameters i e snowmelt scheme evapotranspiration scheme number of soil layers etc chen et al 2021 gudmundsson et al 2012 however the uncertainty in climate forcing should not be neglected which introduced uncertainty in the simulation outputs biemans et al 2009 furthermore the low spatial performance in the areas close to the estuary may be sourced from the missing effects of interactions between sea and river which could significantly influence the hydrological processes chen et al 2021 pokhrel et al 2018 generally there is lower variability among the models for mean and high flow than low flow fig 8 suggesting higher uncertainty when simulating trends under dry conditions these results are consistent with zaherpour et al beck et al 2017 who evaluated extreme runoff simulations by six hydrological models in most basins worldwide including the lmrb such uncertainty may be attributed to low flow being more sensitive to model structure and parameters than other uncertainty sources chen et al 2021 zaherpour et al 2018 our results also reveal that the model ensemble mean outperforms the individual models for replicating the reference runoff data at both temporal and spatial scales figs 3 5 similar results are found in previous model evaluations e g chen et al 2021 gudmundsson et al 2012 which may be due to the reduced uncertainties of the different model structures and parameterizations when averaging the model outputs reichler and kim 2008 regarding the trend of runoff in the lmrb over the study period the runoff trend is not significant on the basin scale still it is significant in many areas suggesting a highly spatially heterogenous runoff change across the lmrb although there is an insignificant positive trend in mar of 8 03 on a basin scale fig 6a large areas in the middle basin have demonstrated negative trends of the mean high and low flow fig 7 this agrees with the study of lu and siew 2014 who found that the observed discharge in the station of luang prabang located in the middle stream has decreased since 1960 in addition the center of the lower basin is another hotspot area with negative runoff trends such area with pronounced decreasing runoff trends was rarely reported in studies before wang et al 2020 who investigated the possible reasons for changes in inundation within the tonle sap lake they found that the significant decrease in the lake area since 2000 is mainly due to decreased precipitation in the middle basin this area is consistent with the hotspot region identified in our study fig 7 the sophisticated map of four different change situations in the basin fig 10c is crucial for enabling accurate water management practices in the lmrb approximately 70 of the region within the basin experiences increased runoff during the wet season mainly in the upper and lower basin in the middle basin the amount of runoff has declined in the dry season thereby may push more local water stress particularly for irrigation for agriculture lu et al 2014 however the basin with an increased runoff trend in the dry season can provide irrigation to crops and reduce the intrusion of mekong delta seawater in the basin particularly in the dry season ziv et al 2012 our study also reveals that runoff in approximately 15 of the basin has increased in the dry season but declined in the wet season in such regions their water stress during dry periods and flood risk during wet periods may be alleviated the tonle sap lake located in this area is evident to experience reduced increased water surface in the wet dry season which may have critical implications for the local fishery that is sensitive to the water level of tonle sap lake chen et al 2021 wang et al 2020 it is also important to note that 17 of the basin domain has become wetter in the wet season and drier in the dry season which may increase local water management pressures requiring attention for water crises there are limitations to this study first the trends derived by models are forced by only one single dataset implying that the uncertainties associated with the input were not investigated moreover this study is conducted using the period 1971 2010 and it is acknowledged that any trend calculation depends strongly on the selection period as highlighted in many previous studies thus further work is required to investigate whether the relatively short period selected 40 years in this study is representative of variability in the long term furthermore the current study focuses only on the change trends of historical runoff a more comprehensive study that considers both human activities and climate change would thus be more beneficial for identifying the causes of changes in the runoff regime 5 conclusion this study applies a multi model framework to investigate historical temporal spatial runoff regime changes in the lmrb during 1971 2010 for the first time and the spatial characteristics and uncertainties are also analyzed the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 all ten models from isimip2a can replicate the temporal and spatial patterns of the reference data but with different performances the model ensemble mean outperforms the individual models for replicating the reference runoff data at both temporal and spatial scales 2 the models better simulate the annual runoff and high flow changes than the low flow with higher consistencies and lower uncertainties of the annual runoff and high flow between the models 3 the annual runoff in the lmrb shows an insignificantly positive trend 8 03 during 1971 2010 with a higher increase of high flow max7 8 46 and q5 8 03 than low flow min7 2 23 and q95 1 67 4 the runoff trend is spatially heterogeneous across the lmrb the trends in high flow exhibit broadly similar spatial patterns to the annual runoff with significantly increasing trends in the lower basin on the other hand the low flow shows prominent decreasing trends in the middle and lower basins 5 considering the different runoff trends in the dry and wet seasons about 32 70 of the basin became drier wetter in the dry wet season meanwhile 17 of the basin experienced the dry season getting drier and the wet season getting wetter which may increase local water management pressures overall the novelty of this study lies in the compilation of detailed analysis of temporal spatial changes in the mean high and low flows and the identification of the corresponding uncertainties such a thorough investigation of runoff regime changes provides crucial information for water resource management and risk mitigation in the lmrb however uncertainty analyses further suggest that attention should be paid when interpreting the results when cross model consistency is low therefore subsequent studies focusing on runoff should also consider areas with relatively large uncertainties credit authorship contribution statement

2109,runoff changes are critical to the sustainable water resource in the lancang mekong river basin lmrb changes in the lmrb s runoff over the past decades are unclear because of inadequate streamflow observations the advancement of global hydrological models ghms has facilitated the understanding of runoff change worldwide however it is required to evaluate the performance of ghms in simulating historical runoff change in the lmrb before assessing the runoff changes this study aims to conduct a multi model analysis of temporal spatial changes in runoff in the lmrb for 1971 2010 using ten ghms from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip and evaluate the corresponding uncertainties among models results show that the model ensemble mean has the best performance than the individuals when compared with the reference data based on the model ensemble mean large spatial heterogeneity of runoff is found in the lmrb with an overall slightly positive trend 8 03 besides the models perform better in estimating the trends of high flow than low flow as to the trend of runoff in the wet and dry seasons about 32 70 of the basin became drier wetter in the dry wet season meanwhile 17 of the basin has experienced a trend of drier dry seasons and wetter wet seasons overall our results highlight the uncertainty of the runoff changes in the lmrb in the low flow simulation particularly requiring more attention in future model improvement the complex change patterns of the runoff suggest the importance of accurate runoff observations and projections for better water management keywords high flow isimip low flow multi model uncertainty data availability all the data used in this work are available at the the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip https www isimip org 1 introduction surface runoff constitutes a significant component of the available water resources strongly associated with regional socio economic development wu et al 2017 the non public available streamflow data for most land areas hampers the investigation of runoff changes asadieh et al 2016 global hydrological models ghms development has advanced rapidly over the past decades which simulates satisfactory land surface hydrologic dynamics of continental scale river basins and provides runoff at the grid level gosling and arnell 2011 employing the hydrological models makes the investigation of spatiotemporal changes to runoff possible it further improves our understanding of regional hydrological cycle changes which could support water resource management protection and sustainable use shan et al 2021 despite the significant advancement of ghms the available hydrological simulation outputs are of discrepancies because they are simulated by unique hydrological models which have different representations of hydrological processes sood and smakhtin 2015 in addition different climate forcing inputs could also bring discrepancies in the simulations hattermann et al 2018 intercomparisons of the simulations from the ghms are thus needed before further evaluating the hydrological analysis model inter comparison projects like the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip warszawski et al 2014 have made it possible to evaluate the ghms simulations and apply the outputs in global impact studies thereby providing frameworks for consistent assessments of the terrestrial water cycle giuntoli et al 2015 some studies have investigated the runoff trends using multi model approaches hoang et al 2016 thompson et al 2013 milly et al 2005 showed that an ensemble of 12 climate models exhibits qualitative and statistically significant skill in simulating observed regional patterns of twentieth century multidecadal changes in streamflow stahl et al 2012 tested whether the white space on maps of observed runoff trends in europe could be filled using estimates of an ensemble of eight ghms they showed that the ensemble mean overall provided the best representation of trends in the observations najafi and moradkhani 2015 analyzed the extreme runoff by the multi model ensemble of eight regional climate models and found that the merged signal generally outperforms the best individual signal marx et al 2017 investigated how the hydrological low flows were affected under different levels of future global warming in rivers using a multi model ensemble of 45 hydrological simulations and they concluded that climate change studies focusing on river low flows should employ large multi model ensembles to provide a comprehensive analysis of model uncertainty as one of asia s largest transboundary river basins the lancang mekong river basin lmrb fig 1 plays a vital role in economic development in southeast asia liu et al 2021 the fishery agriculture and hydropower sectors along the river are highly dependent on this commonly shared water resource yun et al 2020 recent studies have shown increased magnitudes and frequencies of floods and droughts in the lmrb in the past decades hoang et al 2016 lyon et al 2017 which will be further intensified under future climate change eastham et al 2008 hoang et al 2016 lauri et al 2012 västilä et al 2010 however previous multi model studies in the lmrb mainly focused on changes in future runoff including drought and floods under the projected impact of climate change hasson et al 2016 hoang et al 2019 lauri et al 2012 a multi model analysis of historical changes in runoff in the lmrb has not been conducted the study of historical runoff regime changes would provide useful information regarding the temporal and spatial evolution of runoff in response to climate change bawden et al 2015 therefore an assessment of historical changes in the runoff regime of the lmrb is necessary to provide valuable information on water availability for subsequent management although chen et al 2021 have evaluated the performance of isimip models in simulating lancang mekong river discharges it has shown a systematic underestimation at low percentiles of discharge due to the models routing scheme therefore to further explore the performance and associated uncertainties of isimip models in simulating lmrb runoff the temporal spatial runoff regime changes in the lmrb during 1971 2010 were comprehensively investigated our key objectives include the following 1 to assess the runoff regime changes concerning different hydrological indicators using multi model simulations 2 to estimate the associated uncertainties among models in addition to the spatial characteristics of runoff regime changes 3 to identify hot spots of runoff change in the lmrb although traditional uncertainty analyses have been conducted in a rather narrow sense by considering contributions based on certain metrics such as the coefficient of variation phi hoang et al 2016 multiple metrics have rarely been quantified thus our study quantifies the uncertainties in runoff trend detection using three different metrics and the results provide a better understanding of the model performances in addition a deeper understanding of the past runoff regime characteristic changes and uncertainties relating to multi model approaches can also assist in improving projections of future hydrological regime changes in the lmrb 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials in this study the simulated daily runoff data from ten state of the art ghms clm4 dbh h08 lpjml matsiro mpi hm pcr globwb vic watergap2 and ways are used to analyze changes in the runoff regime within the lmrb during 1971 2010 all the selected models were used in the second phase of the isimip isimip2a warszawski et al 2014 all models were driven by the same climate forcing global soil wetness project phase 3 data hereafter abbreviated as gswp3 using a spatial resolution of 0 5 from 1 january 1971 to 31 december 2010 on a continuous run on the daily scale the gswp3 dataset was generated based on the 20th century reanalysis project and has been widely used in several studies conducting hydrological simulations masaki et al 2017 tangdamrongsub et al 2018 veldkamp et al 2017 the watergap and ways models were calibrated prior to the hydrological simulation alcamo et al 2003 mao and liu 2019 the other eight models were not calibrated specifically for the isimip2a simulations and their default model parameters were therefore used in the runoff simulations none of the selected models have considered the effects of water management and other human activities on the water system though many of them shared similar structures and parameterizations all models were treated as independent for example some were similar concerning their fundamental approach to simulating evapotranspiration representing water exchanges in soil across the basin and modeling snow melting the primary differences in the models concerning simulating land surface hydrological processes are presented in table 1 detailed descriptions of the models applied in this work are provided by references associated with each model cited in the table the international satellite land surface climatology project initiative ii university of new hampshire global runoff data centre islscp ii unh grdc hereafter referred to as unh grdc composite monthly runoff data are available at a spatial resolution of 0 5 for 1986 1995 which represents the composite runoff data based on the water balance model runoff estimates and assimilates of observed discharge at gauge stations the spatial characteristics of the water balance are preserved but constrained by the records observed at stations fekete et al 2011 the unh grdc data also represents a standard dataset used in the isimip2a for model validation warszawski et al 2014 therefore the unh grdc was employed as reference data to evaluate the performances of model simulations in the study area 2 2 methods a framework for multi model analyses is compiled to investigate the runoff regime changes in the lmrb when considering both spatiotemporal characteristics and uncertainties which are outlined in fig 2 and detailed in the following sections 1 evaluate the model performance in replicating the temporal and spatial patterns of the reference runoff data using seven commonly used metrics 2 conduct trend detection for six hydrological indicators first at the basin scale and then grid scale to demonstrate the temporal and spatial patterns of runoff regime changes in the lmrb for 1971 2010 3 quantify the uncertainties in runoff trend detection for each hydrological indicator using three metrics to explore confidence in the trend signal for runoff at different magnitudes over the study period 4 analyze runoff regime changes in the dry november may and wet june october seasons the regions where runoff increased in the wet season and decreased in the dry season were highlighted 2 2 1 metrics used in model performance evaluation before investigating runoff regime changes the models applied in this study are evaluated against the reference runoff data performances of the models are first assessed using a monthly runoff time series simulation and their abilities to replicate runoff at different return periods were evaluated their performances are further evaluated using a set of transferrable benchmarks generally different metrics can assess individual characteristics of a simulated time series burgan and aksoy 2022 in this study seven metrics are applied to enable a comprehensive comparison six of these metrics i e the relative bias normalized root mean square difference rmsd correlation coefficient normalized standard deviation nsd centered rmsd and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are applied to assess the relative performance of individual models in replicating the temporal patterns of reference runoff data their results are presented in three types of diagrams the target diagram the radar diagram and the taylor diagram at the same time the spatial efficiency metric spaef is adopted for spatial pattern comparison of the simulated and reference runoff data which was originally proposed by demirel et al 2013 the expressions of each metric are presented in table 2 and detailed evaluation criteria are also remarked in the table 2 2 2 hydrological indicators for runoff change seven hydrological indicators are employed to investigate the changes in the runoff regime within the lmrb for 1971 2010 table 3 mean annual runoff mar annual 7 day minima runoff min7 and the annual 7 day maxima runoff max7 are used to appraise the runoff regime changes relating to extreme events danneberg 2012 the 95th percentile runoff q95 and the 5th percentile runoff q5 are applied to assess the low value and high value of runoff changes in the basin respectively runoff in the wet season rwet and runoff in the dry season rdry are used to assess the overall runoff changes on an annual scale and during the wet and dry seasons respectively the hydrological indicators are calculated from the simulated daily runoff during the study period furthermore to facilitate a comparison between the runoff changes identified by different models the relative change trend in this study is expressed as the percentage change over the study period relative to the mean of the variable for each time series 4 cr k n x 100 where cr represents the change ratio k mm year is the estimated slope n is the number of years in the study period and x is the mean of the analyzed variable a non parametric estimation method using sen s slope estimator is applied to each hydrological indicator to detect trends in runoff gilbert 1987 sen 1968 as it estimates the trend of a time series based on the slope of the kendall theil robust line theil 1992 sen s slope estimator is robust to outliers and has been widely used in studies to describe trend magnitudes in climate and hydrological variables stahl et al 2012 in addition mann kendall s gilbert 1987 kendall 1948 mann 1945 test at the significance level of 95 is also conducted to determine statistically significant trends in the long term time series 2 2 3 metrics for quantifying uncertainty among models uncertainties relating to the multi model analysis of changes in the runoff trend detection are quantified by using the coefficient of variation c v signal to noise ratio snr and the number of models that agreed on the same trend of the model ensemble mean c v is computed for the change trend in hydrological indicators estimated by the models demonstrating the extent of variability in model estimates in relation to the mean a higher c v indicates higher uncertainties and lower consistency between model estimates of runoff trend detection and vice versa snr is computed as the ratio between the external and internal variance for multi model runoff simulations providing the signal to noise levels by relating the ensemble s variance to that of the individual members schellekens et al 2017 smaller snr values represent higher uncertainties and lower consistency between model simulations of runoff an snr value below 1 indicates that the inter model variability is larger than the ensemble mean variability implying a low inter model agreement for the runoff simulation the number of models agreeing on the same trend of the model ensemble mean is then determined to reveal consistencies between the trend signs of the models 3 results 3 1 evaluation of model performance performances of the ten selected models in simulating monthly runoff time series are evaluated against the reference data unh grdc runoff data from 1986 to 1995 fig 3 a results show that all models could replicate the observed monthly runoff time series and the seasonal runoff cycles and the multi model ensemble mean agrees well with the reference data the probability of exceedance of the model simulations was also investigated to assess the models performances in simulating runoff at different return periods fig 3b model simulated runoff is skewed differently at different magnitudes and the models performed better in estimating the high flow than the low flow again the model ensemble mean resembles the exceedance probability well and provides a good match with the unh grdc runoff data indicating the high performance of the model ensemble mean of runoff at different magnitudes fig 4 displays the ten selected models performance simulating monthly runoff time series the relative bias between the reference data and model simulations is less than 10 except for three models dhb h08 and matsiro the relative bias is slightly higher but still below the threshold of 35 in these three models fig 4a the model ensemble mean exhibits the best relative bias score 2 and the third highest score in the normalized rmsd indicating a generally good runoff simulation of the basin the pcr globwb clm4 and the model ensemble mean exhibit better runoff simulation performances with smaller normalized rmsd values in comparison the performances of the dbh and h08 models are less favorable due to the relatively larger normalized rmsd most tested models demonstrate nses larger than 0 7 indicating good and highly accurate performances when reproducing the runoff time series however three models h08 dbh and lpjm demonstrate low nses fig 4b the model ensemble mean achieves the best performance with an nse value of 0 90 followed by ways 0 88 pcr globwb 0 88 and clm4 0 87 the taylor diagram depicts a comprehensive model matching skill between simulated runoff and the reference runoff data fig 4c all models are found to have correlation coefficients higher than 0 8 half of the models and the model ensemble mean have correlation coefficients greater than 0 9 exhibiting strong runoff simulation performances in this respect models with relatively high correlations typically have low normalized rmsd fig 4c a normalized standard deviation larger than one implies a somewhat higher variation in a model s simulated time series than the reference data at the same time values lower than one indicate that the time series has a weaker amplitude although the model simulations of clm4 pcr globwb and matsiro demonstrate stronger relationships with unh grdc runoff data than the model ensemble mean the model ensemble mean provides a better replication of the variations within the runoff time series with the normalized standard deviation lying nearest to the green contour marked ref the results of the spatial performance evaluation are shown in fig 5 compared with the reference runoff data the model ensemble mean shows the best performance of high correlation coefficient of variation and histogram overlap most areas present high positive values with a mean spaef value of 0 53 in addition most tested models demonstrate spaef larger than 0 4 indicating high spatial similarity with unh grdc runoff reference data among the models lpjml and ways have the best performance while clm4 matsiro and watergap2 demonstrate relatively low spaef primarily located at the lower basin overall the above model evaluations reveal that the model ensemble mean outperforms the individual models for replicating monthly time series seasonal cycles and runoff at different return periods furthermore the model ensemble mean is capable of modeling variability in the runoff time series and shows the best spatial correlation with the unh grdc runoff reference data therefore the model ensemble mean is used to analyze runoff regime changes in the lmrb and then the model associated uncertainties are quantified based on the ten model simulations in the following sections 3 2 overall runoff regime changes on the basin scale the mar changes from the ten ghms for 1971 2010 are depicted in fig 6 a the spread of the mar simulations from the ten models indicates uncertainties in the model simulations however they show similar variabilities over the years based on the model ensemble mean the annual mar in the lmrb shows high interannual variability with an average annual value of 655 mm yr over the study period the ensemble mean mar was of low value in 1977 498 78 mm yr and 1998 509 86 mm yr while it was of high value in 1978 792 02 mm yr and 2000 867 15 mm yr overall the mar slightly increased by 52 61 mm 8 03 p greater than 0 05 from 1971 to 2010 fig 6b depicts the estimated changes in the seven hydrological indicators from the ten ghms for the lmrb in 1971 2010 based on the multi model simulation all hydrological indicators demonstrate increasing change trends for the lmrb except for min7 and q95 indicators models also show relatively high agreements for change trend detections of mar max7 q5 and rwet indicators the highest model agreement is observed for the mar trend detection with the smallest spread range among the model estimates in contrast large uncertainties in model estimates are observed for change trend detections of low runoff values min7 and q95 and rdry the rdry in particular ranged from 7 58 to 34 91 overall the model ensemble mean based estimates indicate that runoff in the lmrb had insignificantly increased during 1971 2010 in terms of low flows high flows mar and runoff in both dry and wet seasons the change in the high flow including mar 8 14 max7 8 46 and q5 8 03 all exhibit insignificant increasing trends the modeled low flow min7 and q95 has the lowest increasing ratio of the 2 23 and 1 67 respectively runoff during the dry season shows the most significant increase 17 74 p 0 05 while runoff during the wet season increases slightly approximately 6 24 p 0 05 3 3 spatial patterns in runoff changes and uncertainties fig 7 illustrates the spatial patterns of change trends based on the model ensemble mean of mar low flow min7 and q95 and high flow max7 and q5 during 1971 2010 the spatial distribution of trend in mar fig 7a is characterized by a prominent gradient from the upper and lower basin to the middle basin with a strong increasing trend in the upper and lower basin that contradicts a predominantly decreasing trend in the middle basin and within a small region of the lower basin the trends in high flow fig 7c e exhibit broadly similar patterns to the trends in mar with significant positive trends in the lower basin the trends in low flow fig 7b d have more prominent negative trends evident in the middle and lower basins but with lower local variability which are slightly different from those of other hydrological indicators in addition the models demonstrate a general consistent trend detection for mar max7 and q5 at most of the region all the models show similar trends of the model ensemble mean both positive and negative however there are more noticeable inconsistencies between the model estimates of min7 and q95 and the disagreement among models is widespread across the upper and lower basin overall the model simulations of runoff show a significant difference in spatial distribution with better and more consistent performance in mar and high runoff max7 and q5 than the low runoff min7 and q95 fig 8 depicts the uncertainties associated with the model trend detection to evaluate the model consistency among the models further as all models are driven by the same climate forcings the uncertainties are only related to differences between the model structures and parameters the uncertainty analysis of mar indicates high agreements for estimating trend magnitudes across the basin where the cv is lower than 50 for most regions fig 8a grid cells with relatively high disagreement are sparsely distributed in the upper most middle and lower most areas the models are strongly consistent when detecting the trend signal fig 7a in either positive or negative regions fig 8k for most areas all models demonstrate the same change trend signal of the model ensemble mean indicating the high performance of models in estimating the runoff although high consistency is observed in estimating the mar trend signal and magnitude the snr results also show that some regions upper basin and the western part of the lower basin have more significant inter model variability than the ensemble mean indicating a large spread in the runoff simulation among models fig 8f uncertainties in high flow q5 and max7 are found to have generally similar patterns with the mar in terms of cv and model agreements with the trend signal even though the local variability differed slightly fig 8c e there are large differences in the snr between mar and high flow fig 8h j max7 demonstrates a high inter model agreement in the runoff simulation across the entire basin except for a small region in the upper and lower basin in contrast q5 generally demonstrates a low inter model agreement within the lmrb and only a few middle and lower basin areas exhibit lower uncertainties however the low flow q95 and min7 clearly shows different patterns compared to mar and high flow for all the agreement metrics fig 8b d g i l n there were large disagreements in the runoff simulations between the models over the entire basin with the cv value larger than 200 and the snr value lower than 1 in addition the number of models that are consistent with the trend in the model ensemble mean is less at low flow than at high flow fig 8l n overall mar max7 and q5 exhibit high consistency and low uncertainties between the models indicating that the model estimates of the annual runoff and high flow changes are more accurate however min7 and q95 express relatively low consistency and high uncertainties among the models 3 4 runoff changes in dry and wet seasons strongly influenced by the indian monsoon and the east asian monsoon the lmrb has distinct dry and wet seasons pokhrel et al 2018a therefore the runoff change trend is also investigated in the lmrb for the dry and wet seasons the model ensemble mean shows that runoff has increased by 6 04 in the wet season and 16 6 in the dry season the runoff change trend detection of individual models is depicted in fig 9 all models demonstrate increasing runoff trends in dry and wet seasons but with different magnitudes the runoff trends simulated by the models ranged from 3 to 9 83 in the wet season and 7 58 to 34 91 in the dry season among the ten models only pcr globwb demonstrates a significant increasing trend in the dry season which is insignificant for other models additionally the estimated monthly average runoff varied from 70 85 mm month to 132 22 mm month in the wet season between 13 49 mm month and 40 22 mm month in the dry season spatially the runoff changes in the wet and dry seasons demonstrate similar patterns throughout the basin except for some small areas in the middle and lower basin fig 10 a b in the dry season fig 10b the areas in the middle basin that demonstrate a decreasing trend are considerably more prominent than in the wet season and the magnitude of the trend is also relatively higher in the center of the lower basin increasing runoff trends are observed in the dry season fig 10b and opposite decreasing trends are observed in the wet season fig 10a the increasing trend in the dry season is significant in larger areas than in the wet season the results also show high model consistency for the trend signal in both dry and wet seasons as shown by the grid cells with the box the lmrb has experienced droughts and floods in recent decades pokhrel et al 2018b the increases and decreases in runoff in the wet and dry seasons respectively enhance the wet and dry conditions in the region fig 10c highlights the areas with different change patterns identified by investigating the spatial characteristics of runoff changes in the dry and wet seasons in general 30 of the area within the basin becomes drier in the dry season red and yellow pixels in fig 10c on the other hand about 70 of the area becomes wetter in the wet season green and blue pixels in fig 10c 17 of the region yellow pixels in fig 10c suffers from both situations and becomes drier in the dry seasons and wetter in the wet seasons furthermore some areas exhibited decreased runoff in the wet season and increased runoff in the dry season green pixels in fig 10c 4 discussion this study examines the runoff changes in the lmrb for 1971 2010 using ten hydrological models from the isimip different indicators are applied to provide a deeper analysis of the historical runoff regime change and uncertainties relating to the multi model simulations overall model evaluations show that all models could replicate the temporal and spatial variability of the reference runoff well figs 2 4 regarding temporal variability ways pcr globwb and clm4 have the best performance among the models figs 3 4 for spatial variability lpjml and ways are the best with high correlation coefficient of variation and histogram overlap with the reference data fig 5 as the same climate forcings drive all models these varied performances can be related to the differences between the model structures and parameters i e snowmelt scheme evapotranspiration scheme number of soil layers etc chen et al 2021 gudmundsson et al 2012 however the uncertainty in climate forcing should not be neglected which introduced uncertainty in the simulation outputs biemans et al 2009 furthermore the low spatial performance in the areas close to the estuary may be sourced from the missing effects of interactions between sea and river which could significantly influence the hydrological processes chen et al 2021 pokhrel et al 2018 generally there is lower variability among the models for mean and high flow than low flow fig 8 suggesting higher uncertainty when simulating trends under dry conditions these results are consistent with zaherpour et al beck et al 2017 who evaluated extreme runoff simulations by six hydrological models in most basins worldwide including the lmrb such uncertainty may be attributed to low flow being more sensitive to model structure and parameters than other uncertainty sources chen et al 2021 zaherpour et al 2018 our results also reveal that the model ensemble mean outperforms the individual models for replicating the reference runoff data at both temporal and spatial scales figs 3 5 similar results are found in previous model evaluations e g chen et al 2021 gudmundsson et al 2012 which may be due to the reduced uncertainties of the different model structures and parameterizations when averaging the model outputs reichler and kim 2008 regarding the trend of runoff in the lmrb over the study period the runoff trend is not significant on the basin scale still it is significant in many areas suggesting a highly spatially heterogenous runoff change across the lmrb although there is an insignificant positive trend in mar of 8 03 on a basin scale fig 6a large areas in the middle basin have demonstrated negative trends of the mean high and low flow fig 7 this agrees with the study of lu and siew 2014 who found that the observed discharge in the station of luang prabang located in the middle stream has decreased since 1960 in addition the center of the lower basin is another hotspot area with negative runoff trends such area with pronounced decreasing runoff trends was rarely reported in studies before wang et al 2020 who investigated the possible reasons for changes in inundation within the tonle sap lake they found that the significant decrease in the lake area since 2000 is mainly due to decreased precipitation in the middle basin this area is consistent with the hotspot region identified in our study fig 7 the sophisticated map of four different change situations in the basin fig 10c is crucial for enabling accurate water management practices in the lmrb approximately 70 of the region within the basin experiences increased runoff during the wet season mainly in the upper and lower basin in the middle basin the amount of runoff has declined in the dry season thereby may push more local water stress particularly for irrigation for agriculture lu et al 2014 however the basin with an increased runoff trend in the dry season can provide irrigation to crops and reduce the intrusion of mekong delta seawater in the basin particularly in the dry season ziv et al 2012 our study also reveals that runoff in approximately 15 of the basin has increased in the dry season but declined in the wet season in such regions their water stress during dry periods and flood risk during wet periods may be alleviated the tonle sap lake located in this area is evident to experience reduced increased water surface in the wet dry season which may have critical implications for the local fishery that is sensitive to the water level of tonle sap lake chen et al 2021 wang et al 2020 it is also important to note that 17 of the basin domain has become wetter in the wet season and drier in the dry season which may increase local water management pressures requiring attention for water crises there are limitations to this study first the trends derived by models are forced by only one single dataset implying that the uncertainties associated with the input were not investigated moreover this study is conducted using the period 1971 2010 and it is acknowledged that any trend calculation depends strongly on the selection period as highlighted in many previous studies thus further work is required to investigate whether the relatively short period selected 40 years in this study is representative of variability in the long term furthermore the current study focuses only on the change trends of historical runoff a more comprehensive study that considers both human activities and climate change would thus be more beneficial for identifying the causes of changes in the runoff regime 5 conclusion this study applies a multi model framework to investigate historical temporal spatial runoff regime changes in the lmrb during 1971 2010 for the first time and the spatial characteristics and uncertainties are also analyzed the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 all ten models from isimip2a can replicate the temporal and spatial patterns of the reference data but with different performances the model ensemble mean outperforms the individual models for replicating the reference runoff data at both temporal and spatial scales 2 the models better simulate the annual runoff and high flow changes than the low flow with higher consistencies and lower uncertainties of the annual runoff and high flow between the models 3 the annual runoff in the lmrb shows an insignificantly positive trend 8 03 during 1971 2010 with a higher increase of high flow max7 8 46 and q5 8 03 than low flow min7 2 23 and q95 1 67 4 the runoff trend is spatially heterogeneous across the lmrb the trends in high flow exhibit broadly similar spatial patterns to the annual runoff with significantly increasing trends in the lower basin on the other hand the low flow shows prominent decreasing trends in the middle and lower basins 5 considering the different runoff trends in the dry and wet seasons about 32 70 of the basin became drier wetter in the dry wet season meanwhile 17 of the basin experienced the dry season getting drier and the wet season getting wetter which may increase local water management pressures overall the novelty of this study lies in the compilation of detailed analysis of temporal spatial changes in the mean high and low flows and the identification of the corresponding uncertainties such a thorough investigation of runoff regime changes provides crucial information for water resource management and risk mitigation in the lmrb however uncertainty analyses further suggest that attention should be paid when interpreting the results when cross model consistency is low therefore subsequent studies focusing on runoff should also consider areas with relatively large uncertainties credit authorship contribution statement
