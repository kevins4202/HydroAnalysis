7280,rainfall or snow melted water recharge easily saturates loose top soils with a less permeable underlayer such as cultivated soil slope and partially thawed top soil layer and thus may influence the velocity of water flow this study suggested a methodology and device system to supply water from the bottom soil layer at the different locations of slopes water seeps into and saturates the soil when the water level is controlled at the same height of the soil surface the structures and functions of the device the components and the operational principles are described in detail a series of laboratory experiments were conducted under slope gradients of 5 10 15 and 20 and flow rates of 2 4 and 8 l min 1 to measure the water flow velocities over eroding and non eroded loess soil slopes under saturated conditions by using electrolyte tracing results showed that flow velocities on saturated slopes were 17 to 88 greater than those on non saturated slopes flow velocity increased rapidly under high flow rates and slope gradients saturation conditions were suitable in maintaining smooth rill geomorphology and causing fast water flow the saturated soil slope had a lubricant effect on the soil surface to reduce the frictional force resulting in high flow velocity the flow velocities of eroding rills under different slope gradients and flow rates were approximately 14 to 33 lower than those of non eroded rills on saturated loess slopes compared with that on a saturated loess slope the eroding rill on a non saturated loess slope can produce headcuts to reduce the flow velocity this study helps understand the hydrodynamics of soil erosion and sediment transportation of saturated soil slopes keywords flow velocity saturated loess slope non saturated loess slope method electrolyte tracing 1 introduction saturated and non saturated soils greatly differ in terms of hydrology soil erosion and sediment transportation after soil saturation soil erodibility changes cause serious soil erosion several specific situations can lead to soil saturation for example some types of diversified land uses change the soil physical properties at different layers and topographies to allow water to flow down the hillslopes at the soil surface and over the hardpan layer warkentin 1971 horn et al 2000 boizard et al 2002 ana et al 2010 in particular plough pan with lowered permeability compared with that of the cultivated layer is formed to accumulate infiltrated water along the slope the phenomenon saturates the cultivated layer wilkinson and aina 1976 ankeny et al 1990 1995 freese et al 1993 potter et al 1995 mohanty et al 1996 vervoort et al 2001 martínez et al 2008 in high altitude mountainous regions and high latitude regions with seasonal snow and ice coverage the underlying frozen soil also contributes to the saturation of the top soil layer emmanuel et al 2008 in addition some soil types such as entisols exhibit a c layer development characteristics among which c layer is the parent material horizon with weak permeability this kind of soil can easily become saturated when situated at low or foot slope and under strong storm events under these three circumstances the subsoils have low infiltration and reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity logsdon et al 1992 liebig et al 1993 arvidsson 2001 although the causes of these three typical circumstances are different the unique factor is that the top soil layer easily becomes saturated and consequently affects the hydrodynamics of water flow however most researches only focused on the changes in the physical properties of soil ana et al 2010 martínez et al 2008 vervoort et al 2001 among the many factors affecting water flow velocity is an important parameter that is related to slope gradient flow discharge topography and surface conditions zhang et al 2010 lei et al 2005 foster et al 1992 flow velocity is consistently included in the studies of overland flow and transportation of eroded sediments rahma et al 2013 lei et al 2010 flow velocity also plays a significant role in soil erosion models in these related models flow velocity has been used to deduce other hydraulic parameters such as reynolds number and manning s coefficient ban et al 2016 the water erosion prediction program wepp model is a popular process based soil erosion model nearing et al 1989 however no detailed flow velocity parameter is available to support the wepp model when the soil is saturated and affected by concentrated flow therefore the flow velocity of saturated soil needs to be studied to improve this part of wepp model many scientists have applied numerous methods to measure the surface or peak flow velocity most existing measurement methods often involve tracers made of different materials such as dyes of various colors abrahams et al 1986 zhang et al 2010 salts electrolytes ban et al 2016 ban et al 2017 dong et al 2014 lei et al 2005 planchon et al 2005 magnetic materials ventura et al 2001 heat pulses angermann et al 2012 natural water isotopes berman et al 2009 radioisotopes gardner and dunn 1964 and floating objects tauro et al 2010 2012b other methods have also been practiced to measure the flow velocity for example tauro et al 2012a used a novel fluorescent particle tracing and conducted image analysis to measure the flow velocity however this method cannot be used to measure flow velocity on a large scale joão de lima and abrantes 2014 used the tracers of heat and dye to measure the shallow flow velocity and compared the results with those of traditional dye tracing the findings showed that the tracers of heat and dye were suitable to measure flow velocities of both overland and rill muste et al 2014 used large scale particle image velocimetry to measure the flow velocity of shallow water however this method requires expensive device for measurement and is not convenient for field work among the many tracing methods dye tracing and salt tracing are the cheapest and easiest to use in addition dye tracers of various colors have long been used to measure shallow overland and rill flow velocities however results are not accurate due to dye diffusion the proportional coefficients vary with different flow regimes foster et al 1992 luk and merz 1992 ban et al 2016 therefore dye tracing is unsteady and inaccurately measures flow velocity salt tracing is always used to measure flow velocity for instance lei et al 2005 2010 suggested the use of electrolyte tracing to measure the flow velocity of shallow water this method could obtain accurate measurements by detecting the transport of electrolytes in the flow as they pass a sensor at a known distance and using these data to measure the water flow velocities of different underlying surface states rahma et al 2013 used electrolyte tracing to measure water flow velocities under two conditions wheat straw mulch and bare soil the results showed that the flow velocity of bare soil was 23 higher than that under wheat straw mulch under the designed hydraulic conditions the electrolyte tracing method was used by ban et al 2016 2017 to measure water flow velocity along frozen thawed soil surfaces and along the slopes of different stone contents flow velocity is an essential flow hydraulic characteristic to calculate soil detachment transport and flow resistance variables studies on its accurate measurement will provide insights into the physical based modeling of soil erosion although many studies have been conducted about flow velocity on loess slope few people paid attention to saturated loess slope topsoil saturation is a frequent phenomenon and an important process of special soil slope the study of saturated topsoil erosion mechanism is important to understand the soil erosion mechanism on the slope as an essential parameter of soil erosion flow velocity on saturated loess slope need to be investigated this study aims to 1 present a method to sustain saturated soil slope 2 measure the flow velocities of concentrated flow in erosion and non erosion rills on saturated slope under different slope gradients and flow rates and 3 quantify the effects of saturation and erosion on flow velocities 2 experimental device used to create saturated soil slope 2 1 soil flume the experiments were conducted by using a flume of 8 0 m long and 1 2 m wide built on a platform 8 m long and 3 m wide as shown in fig 1 the flume was separated to form eight rills 8 0 m long 10 cm wide and 35 cm deep with steel sheets on the left and right outer sides of the eight rills two 20 cm wide strips one on each side were used to set up the water supply devices that saturated the soil profile the gaps between the steel sheets and the platform were sealed with 5 cm thick clay soil materials at the rill bottom and compacted to a bulk density of no 1 5 g cm 3 to separate the rills and platform 2 2 soil saturation unit the eight rills were divided into eight segments with equal lengths of 1 m inside each of these 1 m long segments a water supply tubing of 1 cm in diameter was horizontally placed right above the 3 cm thick clay soil layer thus passing all the eight rills the horizontal tube was used to seep water into and saturate the experimental soil the tube was located about 10 cm from the top end of each 1 m long segment fig 2 three seepage holes of 2 mm in diameter with an interval distance of 20 mm were drilled on the tube for every 10 cm rill width when installed these holes were faced to the upper slope direction and were used to supply water into the experimental soil materials at the bottom of the soil layer the tubes were wrapped with textile fiber clothing to prevent the seepage holes from being blocked by soil particles directly downstream of each seepage tube additional clay soil materials were packed at the rill bottom to an additional thickness of approximately 2 cm a bulk density of no 1 5 g cm 3 and a length of approximately 0 9 m the upper 10 cm segment was filled with coarse sands to a depth of approximately 2 cm to cover the seepage tube the section filled with sand was used to upward seep the water to the soil materials used for the experiments after installing the seepage tubes geotextiles with good permeability were used in each trench to protect the sand layer from being blocked by soil particles each of the eight segments in each of the eight trenches was treated in the same way experimental soil materials were filled into the rills to a depth of 20 cm through natural settlement the eight horizontal seepage tubes were positioned at the same level being connected to eight vertical tubes the length of these vertical tubes was equal to the depth of the experimental soil to allow the water level to reach the soil surface adjustable valves were installed on these vertical tubes to control the supplied water flow additional tubes were positioned vertically and used as a water supply tube to deliver water flow to the seepage tubes the upper ends of all the eight supply tubes were connected to a water delivery tube fig 3 which was horizontally positioned and parallel to the bottom of the flume at approximately the same height with the surface of the experimental soil the end of the water delivery tube was sealed an overflow hole was drilled on the upper side of the water delivery tube after the last water supply tube the water delivery tube diverted the water flow to each of the water supply tubes from the water source 2 3 work principle of saturating soil at the beginning of the experiment all valves on the supply tubes were opened the supplied water flowed from the delivery tubes to the seepage tubes through the vertical supply tubes the supplied flow rate was maintained at a level to ensure that the water did not completely fill the delivery tube that is the water flow in the system was not under pressurized condition this step could also be attained using the overflow hole at the time of water flow in the water delivery tube reaching the inlet of the first water supply tube the water flowed into the water supply tube to completely fill the first seepage tube and subsequently the water supply tube the generated pressure in the water supply tube drove the water to flow into the sand layer through the holes on the seepage tube with the water level increasing in the supply tube when the water in the sand layer reached the topsoil the water began to flow into the soil layer under the combined actions of the water pressure inside the water supply tube and the suction of soil materials fig 4 when the supplied water flow inside the water delivery tube was greater than the infiltration flow rate of the soil on top of the sand layer the water overflowed the first supply tube and started providing water for the next water supply tube downslope afterward the water successively flowed into the next supply tube to provide water for the soil along the whole slope fig 4 illustrates the possible distribution of water level in the soil profile along the slope and the principle of ensuring saturation status of the soil profile along the soil slope when the soil flume was set at a certain slope gradient the water from the sand layer at the upper part of each segment started to infiltrate the bottom soil layer the infiltrated water flowed in the soil profile upward to the soil surface and downward along the slope to saturate the experimental soil materials the water level in the experimental soil materials can reach the same height as the top of the water supply tube when the water flow in the soil profile reached the soil surface the water can outflow the soil surface if the water pressure is higher than the surface the rate of outflow if any can be extremely slow due to the slow movement of water flow in the soil profile and the extremely low pressure difference the hydraulic pressure could be higher in the experimental soil materials than in the soil surface along the slope because the surface elevation of the experimental soil materials decreased along the slope the outflow of water reduced the water energy and pressure to some extent the next water supply tube connected to the next seepage tube was linked to the atmosphere to ensure that the supplied water pressure was positioned at the soil surface and controlled by the water pressure inside the supply tube fig 4 for the experimental device the water supply tubes have two functions supply water to seepage tubes and control the water level of each interval at the level of soil surface when the soil slope was constantly supplied with water flow the water would partially and slowly outflow the soil surface if the slow leakage of water appeared on the entire soil slope then the soil slope was fully saturated 2 4 demonstrational experiments for soil saturation before measuring the flow velocity on the saturated soil slope three soil types were used to indicate the saturation status the three soil types used in the experiments were silt loamy soil clay soil and sandy soil the soil textures are listed in table 1 the three soil types were filled into three flumes one in each rill the soil flumes were saturated using the procedures presented in the previous sections after saturating the soils 12 standard corers of 100 cm3 volume were used to collect soil samples from each of the three soils and subsequently measure soil bulk density soil porosity and soil water content which are used to estimate the soil saturation level soil samples were collected at distances of 2 4 and 6 m from either ends of the flume four samples were taken at each location and were oven dried for 48 h before the measurements the experimental results are listed in table 2 in table 2 the measured water content of clay soil was higher than the soil porosity this means the soil was over saturated the reason may be that the soil body or soil particles expanded under the action of saturation due to high content of clay particles this could have caused the soil bulk density to decrease and the water content to increase after saturation according to the measurement results listed in table 2 the soil slopes of the three soil types reached saturation conditions the overall errors of saturation were 5 considering the measurement errors in soil particle densities soil water content and soil sampling with corers this device can be used to saturate the soil slopes with diverse soil compositions and for various soil types the interval length between water supply units may be different for different soils further research must be conducted to further understand these situations 3 materials and methods the soil materials used to measure the flow velocity over saturated soil slopes were collected from ansai research station of soil and water conservation on the loess plateau located 109 19 23 e and 36 51 30 n the soil materials for the experiments were air dried and passed through a 4 mm sieve based on laboratory measurements the soil contained 23 80 sand 64 57 silt and 11 63 clay particles as shown in table 1 the experimental runs along eroding and non eroded rills involved four slope gradients of 5 10 15 and 20 and three flow rates of 2 4 and 8 l min 1 with three replicates a water tank was used to supply water flow in the experimental flumes at constant and designed flow rates tap water was pumped onto the upper end of the rill at the previously calibrated flow rate an additional short flume was used to accelerate the water flow to a velocity similar to that at the downstream of the rill a gauze sheet was used at the initial 0 2 m of the rill to avoid the rill being directly scoured by the water flow the flow velocity measurement system comprised of a computer a data logger nine sensors and a solute injector lei et al 2005 specially designed software was installed on the computer for measurement control computation of velocity and data management the specially designed data logger was used as an interface unit to interpret computer commands and control the unit of pulse signal input the digitalization of the measured continuous signal of the sensors the logging of local data and the data transfer to the computer the sensors could detect the electric conductivity of the water flow the solute injector device was used to inject the electrolyte solution into the water flow as a velocity measurement tracer the solute injector was set up in the water distributor at a distance of 10 cm from the upper end of the flume nine electrolyte sensors connected to the data logger were inserted into the soil along the flume at distances of 10 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 and 800 cm from the solute injector to measure the solute transport processes flow velocities were calculated at these positions the steps in measuring flow velocity and the theory of the flow velocity measurement system were introduced by lei et al 2005 the non eroded rill referred to the status in which the rill did not experience water flow scouring when the velocity was measured for the first time the rill just started to develop because it only experienced erosion for the first time however an eroding rill refers to the slope with a fully developed rill an eroding rill had steady rill unchanged geomorphology and lower flow velocity than a non eroded rill according to dong et al 2015 the pulse boundary solution can accurately estimate flow velocity when the distance reaches a certain value dong et al 2015 indicated that accurate flow velocity could be obtained at a distance for the water flow to cover in 3 s lei et al 2013 shi et al 2012 a rill length of 3 m can meet this requirement therefore only the computed flow velocities at a distance of 3 m from the injector were used for discussion the velocity measurement system is given in fig 1 4 results 4 1 water flow velocity along eroding rills on saturated loess slope the flow velocity along eroding rills on saturated loess slopes are shown in table 3 the flow velocity significantly increased with the increase in slope gradient from 5 to 15 p 0 05 from 15 to 20 the increase in flow velocity gradually leveled off in addition the flow velocity significantly increased with the increase in flow rate p 0 05 table 3 also presents the average flow velocity from the fourth to the ninth sensors along eroding rills on saturated loess slopes table 3 indicates that both the slope gradient and the flow rate affected the flow velocity in addition the average velocities under different slope gradients and flow rates ranged from 0 244 m s 1 to 0 686 m s 1 as shown in table 4 the variance values were low and ranged from 0 0001 m s 1 to 0 009 m s 1 results also showed slight fluctuations in flow velocities as measured by the sensors at locations between 3 m and 8 m nonlinear multivariable equation was applied to quantitatively analyze the relative effects of slope gradient flow rate and their interactions on flow velocity along eroding rills on saturated loess slopes the model used was as follows 1 u a 0 a 1 s a 2 q a 3 sq a 4 s 2 a 5 q 2 where u is the average flow velocity m s 1 s is the sine value of slope gradient q is unit width discharge m2 s 1 and a0 a1 a2 a5 are regression coefficients the regression model included regression coefficients a0 a1 a2 a5 however the magnitudes of slope gradient and flow rate values greatly differed therefore the unit of flow rate was altered from m3 s 1 m 1 to l s 1 m 1 during regression the data of average flow velocities in different cases were used to fit into eq 1 with stepwise regression method to obtain the effects of important factors on flow velocity as follows 2 u 1 0 174 0 601 s 0 044 q 0 542 sq the r2 of eq 2 is 0 94 equation 2 clearly illustrates that both slope gradient and unit width flow rate affected the flow velocity of the eroding rill the flow velocity of the eroding rill when partially differentiated with respect to slope gradient and flow rate produces the following relationships 3 u 1 s 0 601 0 542 q 4 u 1 q 0 044 0 542 s equation 3 is always greater than zero to indicate that the flow velocity of the eroding rill of saturated soil slopes consistently increased with slope gradient and accelerated with flow rate equation 4 is also greater than zero to indicate that the flow velocity of the eroding rill increased positively with flow rate and accelerated with slope gradient equation 4 indicates that even when the slope gradient is gentle the flow velocity of the eroding rill still increased with flow rate moreover the increase in flow velocity of the eroding rill was proportional to the slope gradient in accordance with the constant terms of eqs 3 and 4 the flow velocities proportionately increased by approximately 60 with slope gradients and increased by 4 with flow rates this response indicated that the effect of slope gradient was greater than that of flow rate but the interaction term indicated that the increase in flow velocity accelerated with increasing flow rate and slope gradient 4 2 water flow velocity along non eroded rill on saturated loess slope the flow velocities of non eroded rill on saturated loess and the average velocity under different slope gradients and flow rates are listed in table 4 the flow velocity increased significantly with the increase in slope gradient p 0 05 in addition the flow velocity significantly increased with the increase in flow rate from 2 l min 1 to 4 l min 1 p 0 05 this trend gradually leveled off from 4 l min 1 to 8 l min 1 table 4 displays the average flow velocity from the fourth to the ninth sensors of non eroded rills on saturated loess slopes and indicates that both the slope gradient and the flow rate affected the flow velocity the average velocities under different slope gradients and flow rates ranged from 0 337 m s 1 to 0 882 m s 1 as shown in table 4 all the variance values were low and ranged from 0 0001 m s 1 to 0 002 m s 1 which indicated the slight fluctuations in the flow velocities of non eroded rill as measured by the sensors located at distances between 3 m and 8 m equation 1 was applied to quantify the effects of both slope gradient and flow rate and their interaction on flow velocity of non eroded rill on saturated loess slope the data of average flow velocities in different cases were used to fit into eq 1 with stepwise regression method to obtain the effects of important factor flow velocity as follows 5 u 2 0 336 0 751 sq 1 683 s 2 the r2 of eq 5 is 0 97 equation 5 clearly illustrates that both slope gradient and unit width flow rate affected the flow velocity of non eroded rill the flow velocity of non eroded rill when partially differentiated with respect to slope gradient and flow rate produces the following relationships 6 u 2 s 0 751 q 3 366 s 7 u 2 q 0 751 s equation 6 is always greater than zero to indicate that the flow velocities of non eroded rill of saturated soil slopes consistently increase with slope gradient and accelerated with flow rate equation 6 indicates that even when the slope is gentle the flow velocities of non eroded rills still increased with flow rate equation 6 indicates that with the increase in slope gradient flow velocity rapidly increased with slope gradient and flow rate moreover eq 7 indicates that increase in flow velocity with respect to increase in flow rate of non eroded rill was proportional to the slope gradient as given by eqs 6 and 7 this response indicated that the effect of slope gradient was greater than that of flow rate however the interaction term indicated that the flow velocity of the non eroded rill increased faster with flow rate and slope gradient than that of the eroding rill 4 3 comparison of velocities of non eroded and eroding rill on saturated loess slope according to tables 3 and 4 the flow velocities of non eroded rill were consistently higher than those of the eroding rill on the saturated loess slope under a given slope gradient and flow rate for comparison purposes the flow velocities of non eroded and eroding rills were fitted in fig 5 the flow velocities of non eroded rills are 33 14 24 and 27 higher than those of the eroding rills under different hydraulic conditions with the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 98 to 0 99 these results indicated that the flow velocities of non eroded rills and eroding rills were similar under different gradients and flow rates given the systematic error of experiments the flow velocities remained unchanged on eroding and non eroded rills on saturated loess slope the reason is that the rill morphology basically maintained the same along eroding rill and non eroded rill owing to the saturation effects the head cuts were not formed to inhibit the decrease in flow velocity 4 4 comparison of flow velocities on saturated and non saturated loess slopes flow velocity was significantly affected by soil surface condition slope gradient flow rate and all their interactions the flow velocities of eroding rills on non saturated loess slopes were reported by ban et al 2017 the flow velocities of eroding rills on non saturated loess slopes are fitted with those of eroding and non eroded rills on saturated loess slopes in fig 6 a and b as shown in fig 6a the flow velocities of eroding rills on saturated loess slopes were 27 45 50 and 17 higher than those of eroding rills on non saturated loess slopes with r2 of 0 98 to 0 99 this indicated that the flow velocities significantly increased after the loess slopes were saturated p 0 05 as shown in fig 6b the flow velocities of non eroded rills on the saturated loess slopes were 70 66 88 and 52 higher than those of eroding rills on non saturated loess slopes with r2 of 0 98 to 0 99 these results are important in studying the differences of soil erosion and sediment transport capacity between saturated soil slope and non saturated soil slope at first the loess soil was adequately saturated to have a lubricant effect on the soil surface afterward the water reduced the frictional force or resistance to water flow secondly the loess soil eroded the rill bed of non saturated slope to produce headcuts along the rill rill morphology with head cuts produced localized waterfalls thus reducing the flow velocity however saturated loess slope was eroded to form no notable head cuts as shown in fig 7 therefore the flow velocities of saturated loess slope were greater than those of non saturated loess slope the differences in frictional force and erosional behaviors of the saturated and non saturated slope surfaces may contribute greatly to this behavior under the combination of two factors the flow velocities of saturated loess slope were higher than those of non saturated loess slope especially in non eroded rill 5 discussion research on water flow over saturated slopes is limited instead intensive attentions have been paid to landslide including soil creep slumping debris flow and rockfall mandal and maiti 2015 limited attentions were paid to the effects of seepage from saturated slope on soil erosion and related hydrodynamics huang and laflen 1996 the main problem was the difficulty to conduct simulation studies stolte et al 1990 made a laboratory experiment study to investigate the impact of seepage on erosion to find that the seepage condition increased erosion of a sandy soil but did not increase erosion of the loamy soil they mainly focused on the impacts of soil saturation or seepage flow on erosion little attention was paid to hydrodynamics aspects such as flow velocity the mechanism of the effects of soil saturation on increase in flow velocity could be the least understood part of hillslope hydrologic aspect the reasons for increases in water flow velocity over saturated slope could be reasoned in the following paragraphs after soil saturation soil pores at the soil surface are filled full of water the water flow over a saturated slope has much chances to get direct contacts with outflowing seepage water this reduces the chance for water flow to get in touch directly with soil particles so that the frictional resistance of saturated soil surface to water flow is expected to be much reduced lowered frictional impacts are favorite to produce higher flow velocity over saturated soil slope saturated soil slopes are eroded quiet differently from that of a non saturated slope unlike a non saturated slope saturated soil slope produces much smoother eroding rill channels without notable headcuts energy dissipation of headcuts dramatically reduce water flow energy to cause slowdown of water flow velocity smoother rill geomorphology of a rill formed on a saturated soil slope can promote faster water flow it is rational to believe that after saturation soil strength is much reduced and the shear strength of the soil body should be much reduced the energy consumption of erosion over saturated soil slope is also reduced in comparison with that over non saturated soil slope under this condition more soil could be eroded and more sediments can be transported energy consumption during soil detachment and sediment transportation in turn reduces the flow velocity of an eroding rill to a lower level than that of a non eroded rill after saturation of the soil profile soil aggregates are likely expanded and broken down to single grained sediment particles soil no longer remains its structure but becomes muddy after saturation with low soil strength and or sheer strength which makes the soil more erodible than before this also promotes water flow velocity the floating force produced by the saturation condition counterbalances the gravitational component of the soil particles energy consumed by soil detachment is more likely reduced also the boundary friction is reduced in the process of sediment transport all the above causes contribute to the reduction of energy required for soil erosion to leave more energy for increasing flow velocity 6 conclusions a methodology was suggested to create reliable saturated soil slopes the device components and their functioning principals were described in detail three soil types were used to demonstrate the mechanism of soil slope saturation a series of laboratory experiments was conducted to measure water flow velocity on eroding and non eroded loess soil slopes under four slope gradients of 5 10 15 and 20 and three flow rates of 2 4 and 8 l min 1 the flow velocity was measured at 9 locations at different distances from the solute injection position using the electrolyte tracing method results showed that the flow velocities of eroding rill and non eroded rill of the saturated loess slope increased with the slope gradient and flow rate the influence of slope gradient was greater than that of flow rate the flow velocities of non eroded rills were 14 to 33 higher than those of eroding rills under different slope gradients and flow rates no significant difference was observed between the flow velocities on the saturated loess slope the flow velocities on saturated loess slopes were 17 to 88 greater than those on non saturated loess slope the saturated loess slope may have reduced the frictional force and headcuts to increase flow velocity this study is important in understanding the hydrodynamics of soil erosion and sediment transportation on saturated loess slopes acknowledgement this work was

7280,rainfall or snow melted water recharge easily saturates loose top soils with a less permeable underlayer such as cultivated soil slope and partially thawed top soil layer and thus may influence the velocity of water flow this study suggested a methodology and device system to supply water from the bottom soil layer at the different locations of slopes water seeps into and saturates the soil when the water level is controlled at the same height of the soil surface the structures and functions of the device the components and the operational principles are described in detail a series of laboratory experiments were conducted under slope gradients of 5 10 15 and 20 and flow rates of 2 4 and 8 l min 1 to measure the water flow velocities over eroding and non eroded loess soil slopes under saturated conditions by using electrolyte tracing results showed that flow velocities on saturated slopes were 17 to 88 greater than those on non saturated slopes flow velocity increased rapidly under high flow rates and slope gradients saturation conditions were suitable in maintaining smooth rill geomorphology and causing fast water flow the saturated soil slope had a lubricant effect on the soil surface to reduce the frictional force resulting in high flow velocity the flow velocities of eroding rills under different slope gradients and flow rates were approximately 14 to 33 lower than those of non eroded rills on saturated loess slopes compared with that on a saturated loess slope the eroding rill on a non saturated loess slope can produce headcuts to reduce the flow velocity this study helps understand the hydrodynamics of soil erosion and sediment transportation of saturated soil slopes keywords flow velocity saturated loess slope non saturated loess slope method electrolyte tracing 1 introduction saturated and non saturated soils greatly differ in terms of hydrology soil erosion and sediment transportation after soil saturation soil erodibility changes cause serious soil erosion several specific situations can lead to soil saturation for example some types of diversified land uses change the soil physical properties at different layers and topographies to allow water to flow down the hillslopes at the soil surface and over the hardpan layer warkentin 1971 horn et al 2000 boizard et al 2002 ana et al 2010 in particular plough pan with lowered permeability compared with that of the cultivated layer is formed to accumulate infiltrated water along the slope the phenomenon saturates the cultivated layer wilkinson and aina 1976 ankeny et al 1990 1995 freese et al 1993 potter et al 1995 mohanty et al 1996 vervoort et al 2001 martínez et al 2008 in high altitude mountainous regions and high latitude regions with seasonal snow and ice coverage the underlying frozen soil also contributes to the saturation of the top soil layer emmanuel et al 2008 in addition some soil types such as entisols exhibit a c layer development characteristics among which c layer is the parent material horizon with weak permeability this kind of soil can easily become saturated when situated at low or foot slope and under strong storm events under these three circumstances the subsoils have low infiltration and reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity logsdon et al 1992 liebig et al 1993 arvidsson 2001 although the causes of these three typical circumstances are different the unique factor is that the top soil layer easily becomes saturated and consequently affects the hydrodynamics of water flow however most researches only focused on the changes in the physical properties of soil ana et al 2010 martínez et al 2008 vervoort et al 2001 among the many factors affecting water flow velocity is an important parameter that is related to slope gradient flow discharge topography and surface conditions zhang et al 2010 lei et al 2005 foster et al 1992 flow velocity is consistently included in the studies of overland flow and transportation of eroded sediments rahma et al 2013 lei et al 2010 flow velocity also plays a significant role in soil erosion models in these related models flow velocity has been used to deduce other hydraulic parameters such as reynolds number and manning s coefficient ban et al 2016 the water erosion prediction program wepp model is a popular process based soil erosion model nearing et al 1989 however no detailed flow velocity parameter is available to support the wepp model when the soil is saturated and affected by concentrated flow therefore the flow velocity of saturated soil needs to be studied to improve this part of wepp model many scientists have applied numerous methods to measure the surface or peak flow velocity most existing measurement methods often involve tracers made of different materials such as dyes of various colors abrahams et al 1986 zhang et al 2010 salts electrolytes ban et al 2016 ban et al 2017 dong et al 2014 lei et al 2005 planchon et al 2005 magnetic materials ventura et al 2001 heat pulses angermann et al 2012 natural water isotopes berman et al 2009 radioisotopes gardner and dunn 1964 and floating objects tauro et al 2010 2012b other methods have also been practiced to measure the flow velocity for example tauro et al 2012a used a novel fluorescent particle tracing and conducted image analysis to measure the flow velocity however this method cannot be used to measure flow velocity on a large scale joão de lima and abrantes 2014 used the tracers of heat and dye to measure the shallow flow velocity and compared the results with those of traditional dye tracing the findings showed that the tracers of heat and dye were suitable to measure flow velocities of both overland and rill muste et al 2014 used large scale particle image velocimetry to measure the flow velocity of shallow water however this method requires expensive device for measurement and is not convenient for field work among the many tracing methods dye tracing and salt tracing are the cheapest and easiest to use in addition dye tracers of various colors have long been used to measure shallow overland and rill flow velocities however results are not accurate due to dye diffusion the proportional coefficients vary with different flow regimes foster et al 1992 luk and merz 1992 ban et al 2016 therefore dye tracing is unsteady and inaccurately measures flow velocity salt tracing is always used to measure flow velocity for instance lei et al 2005 2010 suggested the use of electrolyte tracing to measure the flow velocity of shallow water this method could obtain accurate measurements by detecting the transport of electrolytes in the flow as they pass a sensor at a known distance and using these data to measure the water flow velocities of different underlying surface states rahma et al 2013 used electrolyte tracing to measure water flow velocities under two conditions wheat straw mulch and bare soil the results showed that the flow velocity of bare soil was 23 higher than that under wheat straw mulch under the designed hydraulic conditions the electrolyte tracing method was used by ban et al 2016 2017 to measure water flow velocity along frozen thawed soil surfaces and along the slopes of different stone contents flow velocity is an essential flow hydraulic characteristic to calculate soil detachment transport and flow resistance variables studies on its accurate measurement will provide insights into the physical based modeling of soil erosion although many studies have been conducted about flow velocity on loess slope few people paid attention to saturated loess slope topsoil saturation is a frequent phenomenon and an important process of special soil slope the study of saturated topsoil erosion mechanism is important to understand the soil erosion mechanism on the slope as an essential parameter of soil erosion flow velocity on saturated loess slope need to be investigated this study aims to 1 present a method to sustain saturated soil slope 2 measure the flow velocities of concentrated flow in erosion and non erosion rills on saturated slope under different slope gradients and flow rates and 3 quantify the effects of saturation and erosion on flow velocities 2 experimental device used to create saturated soil slope 2 1 soil flume the experiments were conducted by using a flume of 8 0 m long and 1 2 m wide built on a platform 8 m long and 3 m wide as shown in fig 1 the flume was separated to form eight rills 8 0 m long 10 cm wide and 35 cm deep with steel sheets on the left and right outer sides of the eight rills two 20 cm wide strips one on each side were used to set up the water supply devices that saturated the soil profile the gaps between the steel sheets and the platform were sealed with 5 cm thick clay soil materials at the rill bottom and compacted to a bulk density of no 1 5 g cm 3 to separate the rills and platform 2 2 soil saturation unit the eight rills were divided into eight segments with equal lengths of 1 m inside each of these 1 m long segments a water supply tubing of 1 cm in diameter was horizontally placed right above the 3 cm thick clay soil layer thus passing all the eight rills the horizontal tube was used to seep water into and saturate the experimental soil the tube was located about 10 cm from the top end of each 1 m long segment fig 2 three seepage holes of 2 mm in diameter with an interval distance of 20 mm were drilled on the tube for every 10 cm rill width when installed these holes were faced to the upper slope direction and were used to supply water into the experimental soil materials at the bottom of the soil layer the tubes were wrapped with textile fiber clothing to prevent the seepage holes from being blocked by soil particles directly downstream of each seepage tube additional clay soil materials were packed at the rill bottom to an additional thickness of approximately 2 cm a bulk density of no 1 5 g cm 3 and a length of approximately 0 9 m the upper 10 cm segment was filled with coarse sands to a depth of approximately 2 cm to cover the seepage tube the section filled with sand was used to upward seep the water to the soil materials used for the experiments after installing the seepage tubes geotextiles with good permeability were used in each trench to protect the sand layer from being blocked by soil particles each of the eight segments in each of the eight trenches was treated in the same way experimental soil materials were filled into the rills to a depth of 20 cm through natural settlement the eight horizontal seepage tubes were positioned at the same level being connected to eight vertical tubes the length of these vertical tubes was equal to the depth of the experimental soil to allow the water level to reach the soil surface adjustable valves were installed on these vertical tubes to control the supplied water flow additional tubes were positioned vertically and used as a water supply tube to deliver water flow to the seepage tubes the upper ends of all the eight supply tubes were connected to a water delivery tube fig 3 which was horizontally positioned and parallel to the bottom of the flume at approximately the same height with the surface of the experimental soil the end of the water delivery tube was sealed an overflow hole was drilled on the upper side of the water delivery tube after the last water supply tube the water delivery tube diverted the water flow to each of the water supply tubes from the water source 2 3 work principle of saturating soil at the beginning of the experiment all valves on the supply tubes were opened the supplied water flowed from the delivery tubes to the seepage tubes through the vertical supply tubes the supplied flow rate was maintained at a level to ensure that the water did not completely fill the delivery tube that is the water flow in the system was not under pressurized condition this step could also be attained using the overflow hole at the time of water flow in the water delivery tube reaching the inlet of the first water supply tube the water flowed into the water supply tube to completely fill the first seepage tube and subsequently the water supply tube the generated pressure in the water supply tube drove the water to flow into the sand layer through the holes on the seepage tube with the water level increasing in the supply tube when the water in the sand layer reached the topsoil the water began to flow into the soil layer under the combined actions of the water pressure inside the water supply tube and the suction of soil materials fig 4 when the supplied water flow inside the water delivery tube was greater than the infiltration flow rate of the soil on top of the sand layer the water overflowed the first supply tube and started providing water for the next water supply tube downslope afterward the water successively flowed into the next supply tube to provide water for the soil along the whole slope fig 4 illustrates the possible distribution of water level in the soil profile along the slope and the principle of ensuring saturation status of the soil profile along the soil slope when the soil flume was set at a certain slope gradient the water from the sand layer at the upper part of each segment started to infiltrate the bottom soil layer the infiltrated water flowed in the soil profile upward to the soil surface and downward along the slope to saturate the experimental soil materials the water level in the experimental soil materials can reach the same height as the top of the water supply tube when the water flow in the soil profile reached the soil surface the water can outflow the soil surface if the water pressure is higher than the surface the rate of outflow if any can be extremely slow due to the slow movement of water flow in the soil profile and the extremely low pressure difference the hydraulic pressure could be higher in the experimental soil materials than in the soil surface along the slope because the surface elevation of the experimental soil materials decreased along the slope the outflow of water reduced the water energy and pressure to some extent the next water supply tube connected to the next seepage tube was linked to the atmosphere to ensure that the supplied water pressure was positioned at the soil surface and controlled by the water pressure inside the supply tube fig 4 for the experimental device the water supply tubes have two functions supply water to seepage tubes and control the water level of each interval at the level of soil surface when the soil slope was constantly supplied with water flow the water would partially and slowly outflow the soil surface if the slow leakage of water appeared on the entire soil slope then the soil slope was fully saturated 2 4 demonstrational experiments for soil saturation before measuring the flow velocity on the saturated soil slope three soil types were used to indicate the saturation status the three soil types used in the experiments were silt loamy soil clay soil and sandy soil the soil textures are listed in table 1 the three soil types were filled into three flumes one in each rill the soil flumes were saturated using the procedures presented in the previous sections after saturating the soils 12 standard corers of 100 cm3 volume were used to collect soil samples from each of the three soils and subsequently measure soil bulk density soil porosity and soil water content which are used to estimate the soil saturation level soil samples were collected at distances of 2 4 and 6 m from either ends of the flume four samples were taken at each location and were oven dried for 48 h before the measurements the experimental results are listed in table 2 in table 2 the measured water content of clay soil was higher than the soil porosity this means the soil was over saturated the reason may be that the soil body or soil particles expanded under the action of saturation due to high content of clay particles this could have caused the soil bulk density to decrease and the water content to increase after saturation according to the measurement results listed in table 2 the soil slopes of the three soil types reached saturation conditions the overall errors of saturation were 5 considering the measurement errors in soil particle densities soil water content and soil sampling with corers this device can be used to saturate the soil slopes with diverse soil compositions and for various soil types the interval length between water supply units may be different for different soils further research must be conducted to further understand these situations 3 materials and methods the soil materials used to measure the flow velocity over saturated soil slopes were collected from ansai research station of soil and water conservation on the loess plateau located 109 19 23 e and 36 51 30 n the soil materials for the experiments were air dried and passed through a 4 mm sieve based on laboratory measurements the soil contained 23 80 sand 64 57 silt and 11 63 clay particles as shown in table 1 the experimental runs along eroding and non eroded rills involved four slope gradients of 5 10 15 and 20 and three flow rates of 2 4 and 8 l min 1 with three replicates a water tank was used to supply water flow in the experimental flumes at constant and designed flow rates tap water was pumped onto the upper end of the rill at the previously calibrated flow rate an additional short flume was used to accelerate the water flow to a velocity similar to that at the downstream of the rill a gauze sheet was used at the initial 0 2 m of the rill to avoid the rill being directly scoured by the water flow the flow velocity measurement system comprised of a computer a data logger nine sensors and a solute injector lei et al 2005 specially designed software was installed on the computer for measurement control computation of velocity and data management the specially designed data logger was used as an interface unit to interpret computer commands and control the unit of pulse signal input the digitalization of the measured continuous signal of the sensors the logging of local data and the data transfer to the computer the sensors could detect the electric conductivity of the water flow the solute injector device was used to inject the electrolyte solution into the water flow as a velocity measurement tracer the solute injector was set up in the water distributor at a distance of 10 cm from the upper end of the flume nine electrolyte sensors connected to the data logger were inserted into the soil along the flume at distances of 10 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 and 800 cm from the solute injector to measure the solute transport processes flow velocities were calculated at these positions the steps in measuring flow velocity and the theory of the flow velocity measurement system were introduced by lei et al 2005 the non eroded rill referred to the status in which the rill did not experience water flow scouring when the velocity was measured for the first time the rill just started to develop because it only experienced erosion for the first time however an eroding rill refers to the slope with a fully developed rill an eroding rill had steady rill unchanged geomorphology and lower flow velocity than a non eroded rill according to dong et al 2015 the pulse boundary solution can accurately estimate flow velocity when the distance reaches a certain value dong et al 2015 indicated that accurate flow velocity could be obtained at a distance for the water flow to cover in 3 s lei et al 2013 shi et al 2012 a rill length of 3 m can meet this requirement therefore only the computed flow velocities at a distance of 3 m from the injector were used for discussion the velocity measurement system is given in fig 1 4 results 4 1 water flow velocity along eroding rills on saturated loess slope the flow velocity along eroding rills on saturated loess slopes are shown in table 3 the flow velocity significantly increased with the increase in slope gradient from 5 to 15 p 0 05 from 15 to 20 the increase in flow velocity gradually leveled off in addition the flow velocity significantly increased with the increase in flow rate p 0 05 table 3 also presents the average flow velocity from the fourth to the ninth sensors along eroding rills on saturated loess slopes table 3 indicates that both the slope gradient and the flow rate affected the flow velocity in addition the average velocities under different slope gradients and flow rates ranged from 0 244 m s 1 to 0 686 m s 1 as shown in table 4 the variance values were low and ranged from 0 0001 m s 1 to 0 009 m s 1 results also showed slight fluctuations in flow velocities as measured by the sensors at locations between 3 m and 8 m nonlinear multivariable equation was applied to quantitatively analyze the relative effects of slope gradient flow rate and their interactions on flow velocity along eroding rills on saturated loess slopes the model used was as follows 1 u a 0 a 1 s a 2 q a 3 sq a 4 s 2 a 5 q 2 where u is the average flow velocity m s 1 s is the sine value of slope gradient q is unit width discharge m2 s 1 and a0 a1 a2 a5 are regression coefficients the regression model included regression coefficients a0 a1 a2 a5 however the magnitudes of slope gradient and flow rate values greatly differed therefore the unit of flow rate was altered from m3 s 1 m 1 to l s 1 m 1 during regression the data of average flow velocities in different cases were used to fit into eq 1 with stepwise regression method to obtain the effects of important factors on flow velocity as follows 2 u 1 0 174 0 601 s 0 044 q 0 542 sq the r2 of eq 2 is 0 94 equation 2 clearly illustrates that both slope gradient and unit width flow rate affected the flow velocity of the eroding rill the flow velocity of the eroding rill when partially differentiated with respect to slope gradient and flow rate produces the following relationships 3 u 1 s 0 601 0 542 q 4 u 1 q 0 044 0 542 s equation 3 is always greater than zero to indicate that the flow velocity of the eroding rill of saturated soil slopes consistently increased with slope gradient and accelerated with flow rate equation 4 is also greater than zero to indicate that the flow velocity of the eroding rill increased positively with flow rate and accelerated with slope gradient equation 4 indicates that even when the slope gradient is gentle the flow velocity of the eroding rill still increased with flow rate moreover the increase in flow velocity of the eroding rill was proportional to the slope gradient in accordance with the constant terms of eqs 3 and 4 the flow velocities proportionately increased by approximately 60 with slope gradients and increased by 4 with flow rates this response indicated that the effect of slope gradient was greater than that of flow rate but the interaction term indicated that the increase in flow velocity accelerated with increasing flow rate and slope gradient 4 2 water flow velocity along non eroded rill on saturated loess slope the flow velocities of non eroded rill on saturated loess and the average velocity under different slope gradients and flow rates are listed in table 4 the flow velocity increased significantly with the increase in slope gradient p 0 05 in addition the flow velocity significantly increased with the increase in flow rate from 2 l min 1 to 4 l min 1 p 0 05 this trend gradually leveled off from 4 l min 1 to 8 l min 1 table 4 displays the average flow velocity from the fourth to the ninth sensors of non eroded rills on saturated loess slopes and indicates that both the slope gradient and the flow rate affected the flow velocity the average velocities under different slope gradients and flow rates ranged from 0 337 m s 1 to 0 882 m s 1 as shown in table 4 all the variance values were low and ranged from 0 0001 m s 1 to 0 002 m s 1 which indicated the slight fluctuations in the flow velocities of non eroded rill as measured by the sensors located at distances between 3 m and 8 m equation 1 was applied to quantify the effects of both slope gradient and flow rate and their interaction on flow velocity of non eroded rill on saturated loess slope the data of average flow velocities in different cases were used to fit into eq 1 with stepwise regression method to obtain the effects of important factor flow velocity as follows 5 u 2 0 336 0 751 sq 1 683 s 2 the r2 of eq 5 is 0 97 equation 5 clearly illustrates that both slope gradient and unit width flow rate affected the flow velocity of non eroded rill the flow velocity of non eroded rill when partially differentiated with respect to slope gradient and flow rate produces the following relationships 6 u 2 s 0 751 q 3 366 s 7 u 2 q 0 751 s equation 6 is always greater than zero to indicate that the flow velocities of non eroded rill of saturated soil slopes consistently increase with slope gradient and accelerated with flow rate equation 6 indicates that even when the slope is gentle the flow velocities of non eroded rills still increased with flow rate equation 6 indicates that with the increase in slope gradient flow velocity rapidly increased with slope gradient and flow rate moreover eq 7 indicates that increase in flow velocity with respect to increase in flow rate of non eroded rill was proportional to the slope gradient as given by eqs 6 and 7 this response indicated that the effect of slope gradient was greater than that of flow rate however the interaction term indicated that the flow velocity of the non eroded rill increased faster with flow rate and slope gradient than that of the eroding rill 4 3 comparison of velocities of non eroded and eroding rill on saturated loess slope according to tables 3 and 4 the flow velocities of non eroded rill were consistently higher than those of the eroding rill on the saturated loess slope under a given slope gradient and flow rate for comparison purposes the flow velocities of non eroded and eroding rills were fitted in fig 5 the flow velocities of non eroded rills are 33 14 24 and 27 higher than those of the eroding rills under different hydraulic conditions with the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 98 to 0 99 these results indicated that the flow velocities of non eroded rills and eroding rills were similar under different gradients and flow rates given the systematic error of experiments the flow velocities remained unchanged on eroding and non eroded rills on saturated loess slope the reason is that the rill morphology basically maintained the same along eroding rill and non eroded rill owing to the saturation effects the head cuts were not formed to inhibit the decrease in flow velocity 4 4 comparison of flow velocities on saturated and non saturated loess slopes flow velocity was significantly affected by soil surface condition slope gradient flow rate and all their interactions the flow velocities of eroding rills on non saturated loess slopes were reported by ban et al 2017 the flow velocities of eroding rills on non saturated loess slopes are fitted with those of eroding and non eroded rills on saturated loess slopes in fig 6 a and b as shown in fig 6a the flow velocities of eroding rills on saturated loess slopes were 27 45 50 and 17 higher than those of eroding rills on non saturated loess slopes with r2 of 0 98 to 0 99 this indicated that the flow velocities significantly increased after the loess slopes were saturated p 0 05 as shown in fig 6b the flow velocities of non eroded rills on the saturated loess slopes were 70 66 88 and 52 higher than those of eroding rills on non saturated loess slopes with r2 of 0 98 to 0 99 these results are important in studying the differences of soil erosion and sediment transport capacity between saturated soil slope and non saturated soil slope at first the loess soil was adequately saturated to have a lubricant effect on the soil surface afterward the water reduced the frictional force or resistance to water flow secondly the loess soil eroded the rill bed of non saturated slope to produce headcuts along the rill rill morphology with head cuts produced localized waterfalls thus reducing the flow velocity however saturated loess slope was eroded to form no notable head cuts as shown in fig 7 therefore the flow velocities of saturated loess slope were greater than those of non saturated loess slope the differences in frictional force and erosional behaviors of the saturated and non saturated slope surfaces may contribute greatly to this behavior under the combination of two factors the flow velocities of saturated loess slope were higher than those of non saturated loess slope especially in non eroded rill 5 discussion research on water flow over saturated slopes is limited instead intensive attentions have been paid to landslide including soil creep slumping debris flow and rockfall mandal and maiti 2015 limited attentions were paid to the effects of seepage from saturated slope on soil erosion and related hydrodynamics huang and laflen 1996 the main problem was the difficulty to conduct simulation studies stolte et al 1990 made a laboratory experiment study to investigate the impact of seepage on erosion to find that the seepage condition increased erosion of a sandy soil but did not increase erosion of the loamy soil they mainly focused on the impacts of soil saturation or seepage flow on erosion little attention was paid to hydrodynamics aspects such as flow velocity the mechanism of the effects of soil saturation on increase in flow velocity could be the least understood part of hillslope hydrologic aspect the reasons for increases in water flow velocity over saturated slope could be reasoned in the following paragraphs after soil saturation soil pores at the soil surface are filled full of water the water flow over a saturated slope has much chances to get direct contacts with outflowing seepage water this reduces the chance for water flow to get in touch directly with soil particles so that the frictional resistance of saturated soil surface to water flow is expected to be much reduced lowered frictional impacts are favorite to produce higher flow velocity over saturated soil slope saturated soil slopes are eroded quiet differently from that of a non saturated slope unlike a non saturated slope saturated soil slope produces much smoother eroding rill channels without notable headcuts energy dissipation of headcuts dramatically reduce water flow energy to cause slowdown of water flow velocity smoother rill geomorphology of a rill formed on a saturated soil slope can promote faster water flow it is rational to believe that after saturation soil strength is much reduced and the shear strength of the soil body should be much reduced the energy consumption of erosion over saturated soil slope is also reduced in comparison with that over non saturated soil slope under this condition more soil could be eroded and more sediments can be transported energy consumption during soil detachment and sediment transportation in turn reduces the flow velocity of an eroding rill to a lower level than that of a non eroded rill after saturation of the soil profile soil aggregates are likely expanded and broken down to single grained sediment particles soil no longer remains its structure but becomes muddy after saturation with low soil strength and or sheer strength which makes the soil more erodible than before this also promotes water flow velocity the floating force produced by the saturation condition counterbalances the gravitational component of the soil particles energy consumed by soil detachment is more likely reduced also the boundary friction is reduced in the process of sediment transport all the above causes contribute to the reduction of energy required for soil erosion to leave more energy for increasing flow velocity 6 conclusions a methodology was suggested to create reliable saturated soil slopes the device components and their functioning principals were described in detail three soil types were used to demonstrate the mechanism of soil slope saturation a series of laboratory experiments was conducted to measure water flow velocity on eroding and non eroded loess soil slopes under four slope gradients of 5 10 15 and 20 and three flow rates of 2 4 and 8 l min 1 the flow velocity was measured at 9 locations at different distances from the solute injection position using the electrolyte tracing method results showed that the flow velocities of eroding rill and non eroded rill of the saturated loess slope increased with the slope gradient and flow rate the influence of slope gradient was greater than that of flow rate the flow velocities of non eroded rills were 14 to 33 higher than those of eroding rills under different slope gradients and flow rates no significant difference was observed between the flow velocities on the saturated loess slope the flow velocities on saturated loess slopes were 17 to 88 greater than those on non saturated loess slope the saturated loess slope may have reduced the frictional force and headcuts to increase flow velocity this study is important in understanding the hydrodynamics of soil erosion and sediment transportation on saturated loess slopes acknowledgement this work was

7281,in data scarce basins such as the nile river basin nrb in africa constraints related to data availability quality and access often complicate attempts to estimate runoff sensitivity using conventional methods in this paper we show that by integrating the concept of the aridity index ai derived from the budyko curve and climate elasticity we can obtain the first order response of the runoff sensitivity using minimal data input and modeling expertise or experience the concept of runoff elasticity relies on the fact that the energy available for evapotranspiration plays a major role in determining whether the precipitation received within a drainage basin generates runoff the approach does not account for human impacts on runoff modification and or diversions by making use of freely available gauge corrected satellite data for precipitation temperature runoff and potential evapotranspiration we derived the sensitivity indicator β to determine the runoff response to changes in precipitation and temperature for four climatic zones in the nrb namely tropical subtropical semiarid and arid zones the proposed sensitivity indicator can be partitioned into different elasticity components i e precipitation ε p potential evapotranspiration ε et p temperature ε t and the total elasticity ε tot these elasticities allow robust quantification of the runoff response to the potential changes in precipitation and temperature with a high degree of accuracy results indicate that the tropical zone is energy constrained with low sensitivity β 1 0 implying that input precipitation exceeds the amounts that can be evaporated given the available energy the subtropical zone is subdivided into two distinct regions the lowland machar and sudd marshes and the highland area blue nile basin where each area has a unique sensitivity the lowland area has high sensitivity β 1 0 the subtropical highland zone moves between energy limited to water limited conditions during periods of wet and dry spells with varying sensitivity the semiarid and arid zones are water limited with high sensitivity β 1 0 the calculated runoff elasticities show that a 10 decrease in precipitation leads to a decrease in runoff of between 19 in the tropical zone and 30 in the arid zones on the other hand a 10 precipitation increase leads to a runoff increase of 14 in the tropical zone and 22 in the arid zone the estimated runoff changes are consistent with the result obtained using other methods thus the elasticity approach combines data parsimony and analytical simplicity to produce results that are practically useful for most purposes while facilitating communication with stakeholders with different levels of scientific knowledge more research is needed to extend the application of the method to incorporate the effects of human activities and land use change keywords climate change nile river basin runoff elasticity water resources 1 introduction the nile river basin nrb is characterized by extreme hydroclimatic variability over space and time conway 2005 camberlin 2009 elshamy et al 2009a unep 2013 complicated hydro politics governed by numerous agreements and pacts swain 2011 martens 2011 ibrahim 2011 and rapid population and environmental changes mohamed and loulseged 2008 williams 2009 climate change will almost certainly complicate these dynamics for example labat et al 2004 calculated that a 1 c mean annual temperature increase would negatively impact runoff response throughout africa s major river basins in the nile basin specifically mean annual temperature is expected to rise by between 2 0 c and 4 0 c 0 28 c by mid century fig 1 ipcc 2014 fick and hijmans 2017 with respect to precipitation p climate models disagree on the direction of future precipitation change elshamy et al 2009b with estimates ranging from 12 to 24 the combination of above changes may alter existing tenuous systems for managing the hydroclimatic variability within the basin and disrupt best practices based on history and current knowledge such risk has prompted numerous modeling efforts with varying degrees of complexity to predict how different sectors are likely to respond to diverse types of perturbations and human activities beyene et al 2009 elshamy et al 2009a oestigaard 2010 setegn et al 2011 taye et al 2011 nis 2012 dile et al 2013 dessie et al 2014 hasan et al 2015 ideally basin scale hydrologic models offer the most comprehensive and reliable means of capturing the hydroclimatic response to changes within a basin gudmundsson et al 2012 in practice however the outputs of any modeling exercise are only as good as the completeness quality and spatiotemporal representativeness of available input data where the necessary data are lacking as is the case in the nrb even the most sophisticated models often produce equivocal results that are difficult to interpret and may not justify the expense of efforts and resources as an alternative sensitivity analysis or elasticity of one variable e g runoff r to concurrent changes in other variables e g precipitation and temperature have been shown to produce results useful for many applications the runoff elasticity to precipitation change ε p is defined as the proportional change in mean annual runoff divided by the proportional change in mean annual precipitation schaake 1990 chiew et al 2006 in other words ε p is a measure of the degree to which runoff is sensitive or responds to changes in precipitation under natural conditions low values of ε p imply that relatively large changes in precipitation produce relatively small responses in surface runoff conversely large values of ε p imply that relatively small changes in precipitation produce relatively large responses in surface runoff for instance an elasticity of 2 0 indicates that a 1 0 change in precipitation results in a 2 0 change in streamflow while a 10 change in precipitation results in a 20 change in the runoff a major advantage of the sensitivity or elasticity approach is the parsimony of data requirement for example to estimate ε p one requires only observations on the q p t relationship as well as expected future change in p t furthermore the method can be implemented even with limited or no modeling experience finally the results are in a form that is easily understood by stakeholders with different levels of scientific knowledge see schaake 1990 making it a useful communication tool on the other hand this simplification comes at a cost as a general rule significant natural changes such as extreme hydroclimatic variability or anthropogenic activities such as land use modification or surface water diversion and storage which alter the runoff precipitation temperature relationship also affect the ε p estimates this limitation is not unique to this method and implies that estimates of ε p need to be updated periodically to account for the dynamic nature of the runoff precipitation temperature relationship even so the method has been shown to produce results that are of an order of accuracy comparable to many models and sufficient for most practical applications dooge et al 1999 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 chiew 2006 chiew et al 2006 harman et al 2011 yang and yang 2011 for example in the blue nile basin bnb conway and hulme 1996 showed that a 10 precipitation increase would yield 25 30 change in surface runoff conway and hulme 1996 similarly in the niger river basin of west africa grijsen et al 2013 calculated the runoff elasticity to be about 2 5 meaning that a 10 change in precipitation produces a 25 change in runoff consistent with the results obtained using mike hydro basin water resources allocation model for the niger basin in this study we estimate the runoff elasticity for the entire nrb as well as for each bio climatic zone within the basin using a newly introduced sensitivity indicator β this research contributes to expanding the range of applications of the global hydrological datasets to study the hydrology of a complex basin such as the nile using gauge corrected grids especially where in situ data are inaccessible can help to address major hydrological challenges and better manage the water resources the study approach also represents a simple but rapid efficient and reliable methodology for estimating basin wide sensitivity using a single indicator β that can be derived using minimal data input notably β can be easily partitioned into different elasticities including elasticity to precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration to understand the runoff responses the results are intuitive to understand and easy to communicate with stakeholders the results also add to the growing literature on efforts to examine how changes in temperature and precipitation could affect runoff and thus the water balance over the nrb and other data scarce regions the rest of the

framework the concept of runoff elasticity relies on the fact that the energy available for evapotranspiration plays a major role in determining whether the precipitation received within a drainage basin generates runoff creed et al 2014 the concept builds upon the work of budyko 1974 who developed two indices i e the evaporative index ei and the aridity index ai defined as 1 ei et a p 2 ai et p p where p is precipitation and et a et p are as defined previously when et p p i e ai 1 0 the basin generates runoff because available energy is insufficient for evaporating all incident precipitation and the basin is described as energy limited conversely when et p p i e ai 1 0 the energy available for evapotranspiration exceeds available precipitation water becomes a limiting factor and the basin produces no runoff fig 3 budyko s curve shows the expected runoff response for any basin based on the relationships among p et a and et p these relationships have been utilized in various studies as a reference for the water balance condition in a basin or catchment arora 2002 di baldassarre et al 2011 creed et al 2014 van der velde et al 2014 according to arora 2002 the change in surface runoff δ q can be expressed as a function of the change in precipitation δ p minus δ et p the change in etp 3 δ q q δ p p 1 β δ et p et p β where the coefficient β is the sensitivity index the value of which is proportional to the aridity index arora 2002 generally β is estimated for a given climate zone by calculating the runoff coefficient rc using the evaporative index as 4 rc q p 1 et a p 1 ei following grijsen et al 2013 the coefficient β can be estimated as 5 β 2 3 rc rc 2 when β is large a given change in either precipitation or et p produces disproportionate changes in surface runoff further β is largest at the point where rc is lowest see fig 4 from eq 3 ε p the surface runoff elasticity to precipitation can be expressed as follows 6 ε p δ q q δ p p 1 β similarly ε et p the surface runoff elasticity to et p can be expressed as 7 ε et p δ q q δ et p et p β and ε t the surface runoff elasticity to temperature can be calculated according to grijsen et al 2013 as 8 ε t δ q q

partitioned into different elasticity components i e precipitation temperature and potential et thus once the sensitivity indicator is determined we can derive different elasticity values fig 5 schematically illustrates the analytic framework first we developed the budyko curve for the basin from which we calculated the aridity and evaporative indices second the change rate under the budyko space the coefficient β was determined from eq 5 which was then used to calculate ε p ε et p and ε t third eq 9 was developed to calculate ε tot 3 results and discussion 3 1 budyko curve analysis fig 6 shows the budyko curve for the nrb based on data from 1960 to 2015 consistent with the basin s known physical and climatological dynamics the tropical and subtropical highlands areas map generally into the energy limited conditions during periods of anomalously extreme dry spells the highland region becomes water constrained and maps under the water limited region in the budyko space the subtropical lowlands are considered water limited zones with high evapotranspiration potentials the lowland zone receives significant amounts of surface water and possesses expansive swamps and marshes i e the sudd represented by the data points that plot above the water limits both the semiarid and arid zones map into the water limited space but for entirely different reasons the semiarid zone characterized by high rates of evapotranspiration loses substantial quantities of water to the atmosphere the arid zone is absolutely a water limited zone due to both limited water input low precipitation and high temperatures which act to increase et p on average the nrb as a whole is water limited because more than half its area falls into semiarid or arid zones with limited water yields it can be concluded that in the absence of any change in et p surface runoff amounts are largely driven by changes in precipitation conversely in the absence of changes in precipitation the variation in surface runoff is mainly governed by δ et p as in the semiarid and arid zones according to eq 9 the ε tot reflects the combined effects of the changes in precipitation potential et and temperature on surface runoff generally ε tot 0 5 during wet periods and ε tot 0 5 during dry periods as total elasticity increases runoff generation also increases the zones with ε tot close to or greater than 1 0 are prominent water source areas table 2 shows the illustrative elasticity estimates across the nrb during two periods of extreme conditions section 3 2 below explores these dynamics in greater detail 3 2 sensitivity and elasticity analysis as explained previously the sensitivity index β is inversely proportional to the surface runoff coefficient rc see fig 4 thus the tropical zone is characterized by low sensitivity β 1 0 and high runoff potential rc 0 40 the subtropical lowland zone is highly sensitive zone β 1 0 while the subtropical highland area fluctuates between the water and energy limits with varying sensitivities the semiarid and arid zones are very sensitive β 1 0 and show very low runoff rc 0 10 it is worth noting that β changes over time it is lower during wet periods and higher during dry spells similar to its change spatially from areas of water surfeit such as the tropics to the water deficit arid zone fig 7 similarly β also changes periodically in response drought and wet regimes across the basin based on the β indicator the runoff elasticities ε p ε et p ε t and ε tot were calculated as shown in eqs 6 10 11 and 12 to understand the implications of these calculations table 2 summaries the average elasticities as well as the elasticities during extreme conditions for each climate zone and the entire basin for instance the elasticity analysis shows an average ε p of 1 59 2 26 2 06 2 46 and 2 65 respectively for the tropical subtropical lowland subtropical highlands semiarid and arid zones the calculated ε p was used to determine the runoff changes by rearranging eq 7 as follows 13 δ q q ε p δ p p using the above relation the relative change in runoff to the precipitation change can be obtained as shown in fig 8 a according to this relation a 10 precipitation increase leads to a runoff increase of 12 in the tropical zone and 18 in the arid zone on the other hand a 10 precipitation decrease results in a 10 runoff loss in the tropical region and 28 in the arid zone similarly we can estimate relative changes in runoff to et p and temperature as well as their combined effects ε tot by rearranging each corresponding equation table 2 as an example of a practical application we use eq 4 to produce runoff estimates over the basin the resulting runoff change is computed and compared with the runoff changes using the available gauge corrected runoff grids of the global runoff data center grdc runoff data from 2002 to 2012 fig 9 the simulated runoff explains over 80 r2 0 83 of the variation in the observed runoff in the same way future changes can be assessed using the calculated elasticity values and projected precipitation and temperature changes for example utilizing the extreme ends of gcm projected changes in precipitation and temperature table 3 provides the corresponding runoff change for each climate zone and the entire nile basin for 2050 similar runoff estimates can be obtained readily for any desired level of precipitation and temperature changes the estimated runoff changes in table 3 compare favorably with those obtained using other methods for example based on the analysis of precipitation and temperature records in bnb conway 2005 estimated that a 10 increase in precipitation will lead to 30 increase in runoff similarly using analysis of the gcms siam and eltahir 2017 projected a 15 increase in the runoff over the bnb by 2050 siam and eltahir 2017 over the entire nile basin schaake 1990 and chiew et al 2006 independently obtained a runoff elasticity of 2 5 corresponding to an expected 25 runoff increase it is important to note that due to non linearity in the runoff precipitation temperature relationship negative changes of comparable magnitude do not always produce similar responses that is 10 decline in precipitation does not automatically imply a 25 reduction in runoff studies of runoff sensitivity analysis have also been carried out at basin scale for several major african river systems including blue nile basin bnb niger congo and okavango river basins gleick 1991 chiew et al 2006 elshamy et al 2009b hasan and elshamy 2011 gebrekristos 2015 hence despite the analytical simplicity and parsimonious parameters the elasticity approach produces future runoff estimates comparable to those obtained from more computationally intensive and data demanding modeling methods we posit therefore that the elasticity approach can be used as a first estimate or in applications where high level accuracy is neither necessary nor feasible to produce practically useful results and to identify the scope for furthermore complex analysis fig 10 presents the results of the estimated runoff changes according to the calculated elasticities of ε p and ε t for current and future precipitation and temperature over the nrb clearly the estimated runoff changes are driven by projected precipitation and temperature changes see fig 1 further the spatial patterns of the runoff response to precipitation and temperature are consistent with the distribution of regions of water and energy limits we recognize that in practice precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration changes interact in complex ways that may result in runoff changes that are different from the arithmetic sum of the expected response to each individual variable taken separately we argue that while legitimate theoretically inadequate data and knowledge of the physical dynamical relationship among p t etp and q frequently lead to results that are not necessarily better than those obtained with the simplified assumptions of the elasticity method 4 summary and conclusions runoff is critically important in many human ecological and economic activities hence ability to estimate possible runoff change in response to changes in precipitation and temperature is highly desirable complicating this task however are constraints related to data access or lack of data at the density quality and the desired level of completeness the nrb exemplifies these conditions the results of gcms are in strong and unanimous agreement that the nrb will experience an increase in temperature of between 2 c and 4 c by midcentury the same models are split however about the direction and magnitude of possible future precipitation change these two processes tend to produce opposite effects on runoff increasing precipitation implies increasing runoff while increasing temperature implies decreasing runoff additionally given significant temporal and spatial variability the trends magnitudes and net effects of precipitation and temperature changes on runoff will likewise vary over time as well as throughout the basin in this paper we utilized the budyko curve and the analytical forms derived by arora 2002 to quantify changes in surface runoff due to hypothetical changes in precipitation and temperature within the range of projections under natural conditions the data utilized consist of gauge corrected precipitation temperature runoff and actual and potential evaporation as well as the projected future precipitation and temperature changes the results show that 1 within the tropical zone runoff sensitivity is about 1 6 in response to precipitation change and 0 35 in response to temperature in other words for comparable percentage change e g 10 precipitation exerts an impact on runoff five times the influence of temperature thus in this zone a 10 precipitation increase leads to a 16 increase in runoff while a 10 temperature increase leads to 3 5 runoff decrease the net effect assuming both changes occur simultaneously will be 12 5 2 the magnitude of the runoff response increases with aridity thus in the arid zone runoff sensitivity is about 2 65 in response to precipitation change and 0 99 in response to temperature change given 10 change in precipitation therefore runoff will increase by 26 5 in contrast a 10 temperature change will reduce runoff by nearly 10 the effect of both events occurring simultaneously is a net 16 5 increase in runoff 3 runoff response to precipitation change is strongly non linear across the basin that is the increase in runoff due to a 10 precipitation increase is significantly different from the decrease in runoff due to a 10 runoff decrease on the other hand runoff response to temperature change may be considered approximately linear in general a 10 increase in temperature produces an approximately proportional change in runoff as a 10 temperature decrease 4 the elasticity of runoff to precipitation and temperature is not time invariant over time it is likely to change either as a result of natural or human activities or more likely the combination of both necessitating periodic updates of the q p t relationships and the ensuing elasticity 5 while developed based on changes in the mean the method can readily be extended to investigate the effects of extreme variability by calculating the runoff response to extreme events during the observational period 6 as applied in this paper the effects of human activities on runoff response are only implicitly captured because human actions and decisions account increasingly for the larger proportion of basin scale changes future research is needed to account explicitly for the effects of human agency in this method 7 this research demonstrates the value of global gauge corrected grids for understanding the hydrology of complex basins such as the nile basin where access to in situ data is limited in sum the paper showed that the elasticity approach is a robust fast and intuitive method for estimating runoff changes using a limited set of hydroclimatic variables in data scarce regions

7281,in data scarce basins such as the nile river basin nrb in africa constraints related to data availability quality and access often complicate attempts to estimate runoff sensitivity using conventional methods in this paper we show that by integrating the concept of the aridity index ai derived from the budyko curve and climate elasticity we can obtain the first order response of the runoff sensitivity using minimal data input and modeling expertise or experience the concept of runoff elasticity relies on the fact that the energy available for evapotranspiration plays a major role in determining whether the precipitation received within a drainage basin generates runoff the approach does not account for human impacts on runoff modification and or diversions by making use of freely available gauge corrected satellite data for precipitation temperature runoff and potential evapotranspiration we derived the sensitivity indicator β to determine the runoff response to changes in precipitation and temperature for four climatic zones in the nrb namely tropical subtropical semiarid and arid zones the proposed sensitivity indicator can be partitioned into different elasticity components i e precipitation ε p potential evapotranspiration ε et p temperature ε t and the total elasticity ε tot these elasticities allow robust quantification of the runoff response to the potential changes in precipitation and temperature with a high degree of accuracy results indicate that the tropical zone is energy constrained with low sensitivity β 1 0 implying that input precipitation exceeds the amounts that can be evaporated given the available energy the subtropical zone is subdivided into two distinct regions the lowland machar and sudd marshes and the highland area blue nile basin where each area has a unique sensitivity the lowland area has high sensitivity β 1 0 the subtropical highland zone moves between energy limited to water limited conditions during periods of wet and dry spells with varying sensitivity the semiarid and arid zones are water limited with high sensitivity β 1 0 the calculated runoff elasticities show that a 10 decrease in precipitation leads to a decrease in runoff of between 19 in the tropical zone and 30 in the arid zones on the other hand a 10 precipitation increase leads to a runoff increase of 14 in the tropical zone and 22 in the arid zone the estimated runoff changes are consistent with the result obtained using other methods thus the elasticity approach combines data parsimony and analytical simplicity to produce results that are practically useful for most purposes while facilitating communication with stakeholders with different levels of scientific knowledge more research is needed to extend the application of the method to incorporate the effects of human activities and land use change keywords climate change nile river basin runoff elasticity water resources 1 introduction the nile river basin nrb is characterized by extreme hydroclimatic variability over space and time conway 2005 camberlin 2009 elshamy et al 2009a unep 2013 complicated hydro politics governed by numerous agreements and pacts swain 2011 martens 2011 ibrahim 2011 and rapid population and environmental changes mohamed and loulseged 2008 williams 2009 climate change will almost certainly complicate these dynamics for example labat et al 2004 calculated that a 1 c mean annual temperature increase would negatively impact runoff response throughout africa s major river basins in the nile basin specifically mean annual temperature is expected to rise by between 2 0 c and 4 0 c 0 28 c by mid century fig 1 ipcc 2014 fick and hijmans 2017 with respect to precipitation p climate models disagree on the direction of future precipitation change elshamy et al 2009b with estimates ranging from 12 to 24 the combination of above changes may alter existing tenuous systems for managing the hydroclimatic variability within the basin and disrupt best practices based on history and current knowledge such risk has prompted numerous modeling efforts with varying degrees of complexity to predict how different sectors are likely to respond to diverse types of perturbations and human activities beyene et al 2009 elshamy et al 2009a oestigaard 2010 setegn et al 2011 taye et al 2011 nis 2012 dile et al 2013 dessie et al 2014 hasan et al 2015 ideally basin scale hydrologic models offer the most comprehensive and reliable means of capturing the hydroclimatic response to changes within a basin gudmundsson et al 2012 in practice however the outputs of any modeling exercise are only as good as the completeness quality and spatiotemporal representativeness of available input data where the necessary data are lacking as is the case in the nrb even the most sophisticated models often produce equivocal results that are difficult to interpret and may not justify the expense of efforts and resources as an alternative sensitivity analysis or elasticity of one variable e g runoff r to concurrent changes in other variables e g precipitation and temperature have been shown to produce results useful for many applications the runoff elasticity to precipitation change ε p is defined as the proportional change in mean annual runoff divided by the proportional change in mean annual precipitation schaake 1990 chiew et al 2006 in other words ε p is a measure of the degree to which runoff is sensitive or responds to changes in precipitation under natural conditions low values of ε p imply that relatively large changes in precipitation produce relatively small responses in surface runoff conversely large values of ε p imply that relatively small changes in precipitation produce relatively large responses in surface runoff for instance an elasticity of 2 0 indicates that a 1 0 change in precipitation results in a 2 0 change in streamflow while a 10 change in precipitation results in a 20 change in the runoff a major advantage of the sensitivity or elasticity approach is the parsimony of data requirement for example to estimate ε p one requires only observations on the q p t relationship as well as expected future change in p t furthermore the method can be implemented even with limited or no modeling experience finally the results are in a form that is easily understood by stakeholders with different levels of scientific knowledge see schaake 1990 making it a useful communication tool on the other hand this simplification comes at a cost as a general rule significant natural changes such as extreme hydroclimatic variability or anthropogenic activities such as land use modification or surface water diversion and storage which alter the runoff precipitation temperature relationship also affect the ε p estimates this limitation is not unique to this method and implies that estimates of ε p need to be updated periodically to account for the dynamic nature of the runoff precipitation temperature relationship even so the method has been shown to produce results that are of an order of accuracy comparable to many models and sufficient for most practical applications dooge et al 1999 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 chiew 2006 chiew et al 2006 harman et al 2011 yang and yang 2011 for example in the blue nile basin bnb conway and hulme 1996 showed that a 10 precipitation increase would yield 25 30 change in surface runoff conway and hulme 1996 similarly in the niger river basin of west africa grijsen et al 2013 calculated the runoff elasticity to be about 2 5 meaning that a 10 change in precipitation produces a 25 change in runoff consistent with the results obtained using mike hydro basin water resources allocation model for the niger basin in this study we estimate the runoff elasticity for the entire nrb as well as for each bio climatic zone within the basin using a newly introduced sensitivity indicator β this research contributes to expanding the range of applications of the global hydrological datasets to study the hydrology of a complex basin such as the nile using gauge corrected grids especially where in situ data are inaccessible can help to address major hydrological challenges and better manage the water resources the study approach also represents a simple but rapid efficient and reliable methodology for estimating basin wide sensitivity using a single indicator β that can be derived using minimal data input notably β can be easily partitioned into different elasticities including elasticity to precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration to understand the runoff responses the results are intuitive to understand and easy to communicate with stakeholders the results also add to the growing literature on efforts to examine how changes in temperature and precipitation could affect runoff and thus the water balance over the nrb and other data scarce regions the rest of the

yields it can be concluded that in the absence of any change in et p surface runoff amounts are largely driven by changes in precipitation conversely in the absence of changes in precipitation the variation in surface runoff is mainly governed by δ et p as in the semiarid and arid zones according to eq 9 the ε tot reflects the combined effects of the changes in precipitation potential et and temperature on surface runoff generally ε tot 0 5 during wet periods and ε tot 0 5 during dry periods as total elasticity increases runoff generation also increases the zones with ε tot close to or greater than 1 0 are prominent water source areas table 2 shows the illustrative elasticity estimates across the nrb during two periods of extreme conditions section 3 2 below explores these dynamics in greater detail 3 2 sensitivity and elasticity analysis as explained previously the sensitivity index β is inversely proportional to the surface runoff coefficient rc see fig 4 thus the tropical zone is characterized by low sensitivity β 1 0 and high runoff potential rc 0 40 the subtropical lowland zone is highly sensitive zone β 1 0 while the subtropical highland area fluctuates between the water and energy limits with varying sensitivities the semiarid and arid zones are very sensitive β 1 0 and show very low runoff rc 0 10 it is worth noting that β changes over time it is lower during wet periods and higher during dry spells similar to its change spatially from areas of water surfeit such as the tropics to the water deficit arid zone fig 7 similarly β also changes periodically in response drought and wet regimes across the basin based on the β indicator the runoff elasticities ε p ε et p ε t and ε tot were calculated as shown in eqs 6 10 11 and 12 to understand the implications of these calculations table 2 summaries the average elasticities as well as the elasticities during extreme conditions for each climate zone and the entire basin for instance the elasticity analysis shows an average ε p of 1 59 2 26 2 06 2 46 and 2 65 respectively for the tropical subtropical lowland subtropical highlands semiarid and arid zones the calculated ε p was used to determine the runoff changes by rearranging eq 7 as follows 13 δ q q ε p δ p p using the above relation the relative change in runoff to the precipitation change can be obtained as shown in fig 8 a according to this relation a 10 precipitation increase leads to a runoff increase of 12 in the tropical zone and 18 in the arid zone on the other hand a 10 precipitation decrease results in a 10 runoff loss in the tropical region and 28 in the arid zone similarly we can estimate relative changes in runoff to et p and temperature as well as their combined effects ε tot by rearranging each corresponding equation table 2 as an example of a practical application we use eq 4 to produce runoff estimates over the basin the resulting runoff change is computed and compared with the runoff changes using the available gauge corrected runoff grids of the global runoff data center grdc runoff data from 2002 to 2012 fig 9 the simulated runoff explains over 80 r2 0 83 of the variation in the observed runoff in the same way future changes can be assessed using the calculated elasticity values and projected precipitation and temperature changes for example utilizing the extreme ends of gcm projected changes in precipitation and temperature table 3 provides the corresponding runoff change for each climate zone and the entire nile basin for 2050 similar runoff estimates can be obtained readily for any desired level of precipitation and temperature changes the estimated runoff changes in table 3 compare favorably with those obtained using other methods for example based on the analysis of precipitation and temperature records in bnb conway 2005 estimated that a 10 increase in precipitation will lead to 30 increase in runoff similarly using analysis of the gcms siam and eltahir 2017 projected a 15 increase in the runoff over the bnb by 2050 siam and eltahir 2017 over the entire nile basin schaake 1990 and chiew et al 2006 independently obtained a runoff elasticity of 2 5 corresponding to an expected 25 runoff increase it is important to note that due to non linearity in the runoff precipitation temperature relationship negative changes of comparable magnitude do not always produce similar responses that is 10 decline in precipitation does not automatically imply a 25 reduction in runoff studies of runoff sensitivity analysis have also been carried out at basin scale for several major african river systems including blue nile basin bnb niger congo and okavango river basins gleick 1991 chiew et al 2006 elshamy et al 2009b hasan and elshamy 2011 gebrekristos 2015 hence despite the analytical simplicity and parsimonious parameters the elasticity approach produces future runoff estimates comparable to those obtained from more computationally intensive and data demanding modeling methods we posit therefore that the elasticity approach can be used as a first estimate or in applications where high level accuracy is neither necessary nor feasible to produce practically useful results and to identify the scope for furthermore complex analysis fig 10 presents the results of the estimated runoff changes according to the calculated elasticities of ε p and ε t for current and future precipitation and temperature over the nrb clearly the estimated runoff changes are driven by projected precipitation and temperature changes see fig 1 further the spatial patterns of the runoff response to precipitation and temperature are consistent with the distribution of regions of water and energy limits we recognize that in practice precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration changes interact in complex ways that may result in runoff changes that are different from the arithmetic sum of the expected response to each individual variable taken separately we argue that while legitimate theoretically inadequate data and knowledge of the physical dynamical relationship among p t etp and q frequently lead to results that are not necessarily better than those obtained with the simplified assumptions of the elasticity method 4 summary and conclusions runoff is critically important in many human ecological and economic activities hence ability to estimate possible runoff change in response to changes in precipitation and temperature is highly desirable complicating this task however are constraints related to data access or lack of data at the density quality and the desired level of completeness the nrb exemplifies these conditions the results of gcms are in strong and unanimous agreement that the nrb will experience an increase in temperature of between 2 c and 4 c by midcentury the same models are split however about the direction and magnitude of possible future precipitation change these two processes tend to produce opposite effects on runoff increasing precipitation implies increasing runoff while increasing temperature implies decreasing runoff additionally given significant temporal and spatial variability the trends magnitudes and net effects of precipitation and temperature changes on runoff will likewise vary over time as well as throughout the basin in this paper we utilized the budyko curve and the analytical forms derived by arora 2002 to quantify changes in surface runoff due to hypothetical changes in precipitation and temperature within the range of projections under natural conditions the data utilized consist of gauge corrected precipitation temperature runoff and actual and potential evaporation as well as the projected future precipitation and temperature changes the results show that 1 within the tropical zone runoff sensitivity is about 1 6 in response to precipitation change and 0 35 in response to temperature in other words for comparable percentage change e g 10 precipitation exerts an impact on runoff five times the influence of temperature thus in this zone a 10 precipitation increase leads to a 16 increase in runoff while a 10 temperature increase leads to 3 5 runoff decrease the net effect assuming both changes occur simultaneously will be 12 5 2 the magnitude of the runoff response increases with aridity thus in the arid zone runoff sensitivity is about 2 65 in response to precipitation change and 0 99 in response to temperature change given 10 change in precipitation therefore runoff will increase by 26 5 in contrast a 10 temperature change will reduce runoff by nearly 10 the effect of both events occurring simultaneously is a net 16 5 increase in runoff 3 runoff response to precipitation change is strongly non linear across the basin that is the increase in runoff due to a 10 precipitation increase is significantly different from the decrease in runoff due to a 10 runoff decrease on the other hand runoff response to temperature change may be considered approximately linear in general a 10 increase in temperature produces an approximately proportional change in runoff as a 10 temperature decrease 4 the elasticity of runoff to precipitation and temperature is not time invariant over time it is likely to change either as a result of natural or human activities or more likely the combination of both necessitating periodic updates of the q p t relationships and the ensuing elasticity 5 while developed based on changes in the mean the method can readily be extended to investigate the effects of extreme variability by calculating the runoff response to extreme events during the observational period 6 as applied in this paper the effects of human activities on runoff response are only implicitly captured because human actions and decisions account increasingly for the larger proportion of basin scale changes future research is needed to account explicitly for the effects of human agency in this method 7 this research demonstrates the value of global gauge corrected grids for understanding the hydrology of complex basins such as the nile basin where access to in situ data is limited in sum the paper showed that the elasticity approach is a robust fast and intuitive method for estimating runoff changes using a limited set of hydroclimatic variables in data scarce regions

singapore 639798 singapore school of civil and environmental engineering nanyang technological university singapore 639798 singapore this manuscript was handled by g syme editor in chief with the assistance of ashok mishra associate editor a gini coefficient based stochastic optimization gbso model was developed by integrating the hydrological model water balance model gini coefficient and chance constrained programming ccp into a general multi objective optimization modeling framework for supporting water resources allocation at a watershed scale the framework was advantageous in reflecting the conflicting equity and benefit objectives for water allocation maintaining the water balance of watershed and dealing with system uncertainties gbso was solved by the non dominated sorting genetic algorithms ii nsga ii after the parameter uncertainties of the hydrological model have been quantified into the probability distribution of runoff as the inputs of ccp model and the chance constraints were converted to the corresponding deterministic versions the proposed model was applied to identify the pareto optimal water allocation schemes in the lake dianchi watershed china the optimal pareto front results reflected the tradeoff between system benefit α sb and gini coefficient α g under different significance levels i e q and different drought scenarios which reveals the conflicting nature of equity and efficiency in water allocation problems a lower q generally implies a lower risk of violating the system constraints and a worse drought intensity scenario corresponds to less available water resources both of which would lead to a decreased system benefit and a less equitable water allocation scheme thus the proposed modeling framework could help obtain the pareto optimal schemes under complexity and ensure that the proposed water allocation solutions are effective for coping with drought conditions with a proper tradeoff between system benefit and water allocation equity keywords gini coefficient chance constrained programming glue nsga ii water allocation lake dianchi watershed 1 introduction over the past decades water scarcity issues have aggravated intensive competition of fresh water among the stakeholders of interest and imposed necessity of carrying out optimal allocation of water resources friesen et al 2017 shao et al 2015 to achieve the fundamental principles of efficiency equity and eco environmental sustainability the water resources allocation process is fraught with complexities due to uncertainties associated with many system components and their interrelationships such as the random nature of runoff weather events of the watershed soil water storage and evapotranspiration rate of land surface jafarzadegan et al 2014 nikoo et al 2013 these complexities have posed great challenges for watershed managers in making decisions towards effective water resources management previously researchers have focused on developing various stochastic optimization techniques for tackling such complexities alcolea et al 2009 davidsen et al 2015 dong et al 2014 hariga et al 2005 mousavi et al 2014 xu et al 2017b among them chance constrained programming ccp has advantages in i effectively dealing with stochastic uncertainties expressed as cumulative distribution functions cdfs and reflecting the reliability of satisfying or risk of violating system constraints considering the irrigation water requirement as stochastic variable sethi et al 2006 used a ccp model to allocate available land and water resources to maximize the net annual farm income under various resource constraints in a coastal groundwater basin in eastern india dong et al 2014 integrated the interval linear programming and ccp model into an inexact optimization framework for achieving the maximum benefit of water resources allocation where chance constraints were used to ensure an allowable risk of facing water deficit li et al 2017 combined a ccp model and dynamic programming for water resources allocation of reservoirs in beijing china with consideration of maximum economic benefits and stochastic uncertainties of the available water amount in reservoirs for traditional water allocation study using ccp models the chance constraints are used to reflect the supply and demand relationship between water sources and water users where the stochastic parameters are generally associated with such a relationship such as the water demand from a water user or the available capacity of a reservoir in general the cdfs of such stochastic parameters were generated by predefining normal distributions with means and standard deviations based on experience singh 2016 xu et al 2017a when a hydrological cycle is linked with a water allocation system and the related uncertainties are originated from hydrological parameters a ccp model may be difficult to construct due to shortage of information to build the cdfs of runoff generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 is a popular uncertainty analysis technique and has been widely used for quantifying parameter and prediction uncertainties of hydrological models xie and lian 2013 for example sun et al 2016 reynolds et al 2017 and xue et al 2018 used the glue to evaluate the uncertainties of an agricultural hydrological model i e rzwqm2 an bucket type hydrological model i e hbv and a semi distributed hydrologic model i e topmodel respectively these studies demonstrated that the glue method is potentially applicable to address the uncertainties in the hydrological model and help offer cdf information for the benefit of implementing a ccp modeling framework on the other hand the previous studies made viable attempt in applying ccp in water resources management however most of these efforts focused on the objective of maximum system benefit but rarely concerned with the equity of water resources allocation in fact water allocation equality is imperative in helping relieve the conflicts of water users to maintain the social stability and harmony d exelle et al 2012 cullis and van koppen 2007 firstly proposed the gini coefficient as an effective tool in quantification of water resources allocation equality later on gini coefficient was employed to assess i the equality of distribution of urban water utilizations among the cities in the yangtze river delta area china zhang and shao 2010 ii the effect of global virtual water transfers on redressing the inequality of water uses among nations seekell et al 2011 and iii the equality in domestic water supply in the yellow river watershed wang et al 2012 more recently optimization models based on gini coefficient were used to improve water allocation designs in light of benefit and equity for example hu et al 2016b introduced a multi objective programming model for optimal allocation of water resources in the qujiang river watershed china the model s first objective is to maximize the economic benefit and the other is to maximize water allocation equity measured by the gini coefficient hu et al 2016c developed a multi objective bi level water allocation model where the upper level modeled the allocation principle of equity and the lower level modeled the economic benefit for each subarea in another work of hu et al 2016d the concept of value at risk was introduced into the gini coefficient based model to control the economic loss risk caused by the variation of available water resources generally there were studies on ccp glue and water allocation equity individually but very few of them considered all in a general optimization framework for the modeling theory a combinative consideration of methodology would have a better functionality under the condition of transferring the uncertainties from the hydrological model into a stochastic optimization model from the angle of practical applications watershed managers and interested stakeholders may prefer schemes from an optimization model with a well balanced deliberation between equity and efficiency a fusion of both uncertainty and equality could help better reflect the complexity of the water allocation system therefore this study aims to develop a gini coefficient based stochastic optimization gbso model by integrating hydrological model water balance model gini coefficient ccp and glue into a general multi objective optimization framework the water balance model is used to maintain the water supply demand balance of reservoir and lake where the inflow is estimated by the hydrological model gini coefficient is applied to help evaluate the equality of water allocation among administrative districts ccp and glue are used to handle stochastic uncertainties from the hydrological model multiple objectives are designed to address the tradeoff between equity and efficiency of water allocation schemes a lake watershed in china will be used for case demonstration 2 methodology consider a water allocation system at a lake watershed where the watershed management authority has the accountability to allocate multiple water resources to multiple users in multiple administrative districts as stakeholders all administrative districts expect the water allocation schemes to be both fair and efficient and at the same time maintain the water balances of the watershed to ensure its eco environmental sustainability in addition we need to consider the uncertainties existing in the water allocation system the water balance of lake may have the stochastic features as its inflow directly affected by the complex hydrological processes jones et al 2016 vázquez and hampel 2014 thus we propose to use a gbso model to address these complexities fig 1 shows the framework of the proposed model with details being explained in the following sections 2 1 two parameter hydrological model xiong and guo 1999 developed a two parameter hydrological model to simulate the monthly runoff by assuming that the runoff is a hyperbolic tangent function of the soil water content as the objective of this study is to produce the optimal annual time scale water allocation schemes we use a similar relationship between runoff and soil water content let q t be the annual runoff and it can be calculated as 1a q t s w t 1 p t i t e t tanh s w t 1 p t i t e t φ sc where s w t 1 is the soil water content at the end of the year t 1 i t is the irrigation water amount p t is the precipitation amount φ sc denotes the field capacity of watershed which is a hydrological parameter e t is the actual evapotranspiration and it can be estimated as follows li and xiong 2013 1b e t φ c e p t tanh p t e p t where e p t is the pan evaporation value and φ c denotes a time scale conversion coefficient which is the second hydrological parameter the soil water content in the lake watershed at the end of year t i e s w t can be computed as follows hosseini et al 2017 hu et al 2016a 1c s w t s w t 1 p t i t e t q t 2 2 water balance model of reservoir and lake we divide the lake watershed into two parts including the reservoir watershed and non reservoir watershed the reservoir watershed controlled by reservoirs can offer the fresh water to the users and the non reservoir watershed can generate the uncontrolled surface runoff flowing into the lake fig 2 shows the related water balance among the watershed reservoir lake and water users in this research we focus on the water volume of reservoir and lake the annual water volume changes in the reservoir and lake can be expressed based on the following water balance equations pan et al 2017 2a v e r v 0 r p s r e s r q r φ sc φ c d x r a x r 2b v e l v 0 l p s l e s l q n i x φ sc φ c d x r d x l b x a x l where superscripts r and l denote the reservoir and lake v 0 r and v 0 l are the initial water storage volume v e r and v e l are the water storage volume at the end of year p s r and p s l are the water surface precipitation e s r and e s l are the water surface evaporation which can be estimated by the penman monteith method silva et al 2010 i x is the irrigation water on the non reservoir watershed q r φ sc φ c and q n i x φ sc φ c which can be calculated by the two parameter hydrological model are the runoff generated from the reservoir watershed and non reservoir watershed respectively d x r and d x l are the discharge water volume a x r and a x l are the water volume allocated to the water users b x is the water returned from the water users 2 3 gini coefficient in water allocation system gini coefficient is one of effective equality measures for the equity evaluation of resource allocation problems vass et al 2013 it originally developed by italian economist corado gini to measures the inequality degree in the distribution of income in a given society milanovic 1997 gini coefficient is calculated based on the lorenz curve fig s1 of the supplementary material presents the lorenz curve representing the response relationship between the cumulative proportion of income and the corresponding cumulative proportion of population we assume that the area between the absolute equality line and the lorenz curve is s and the area under the lorenz curve is l the value of gini coefficient is equal to s s l zhang et al 2012 because of s l 1 2 the gini coefficient is also equal to 1 2 l the value range of the gini coefficient is from 0 to 1 in general a lower gini coefficient implies the allocation with more equality and a larger gini coefficient implies the allocation with less equality in addition the cumulative share of population is on the x axis meaning that the criterion i e population is selected to represent the income equality similarly in the water allocation system we also use the population to reflect the equality of water allocation among the administrative districts wang et al 2012 fig 3 presents the lorenz curve for water allocation problem according to the definition of gini coefficient we have 3 g 1 2 i 1 i l i 1 i 1 i ω i ω i 1 ρ i ρ i 1 where i is the name of the administrative district i 1 2 i g is the value of gini coefficient for the equity evaluation of water allocation l i is the area under the lorenz curve generated by the administrative district i ω i is the cumulative share of water volume allocated to administrative district i where ω 0 0 ρ i is the cumulative share of population in the administrative district i where ρ 0 0 2 4 gini coefficient based stochastic optimization model in this study the system benefit and water allocation equity are considered as separate conflicting objectives in a multi objective optimization model firstly we need to maximize the system benefit α sb as 4 max α sb i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k b ij x ijk i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k c k x ijk where j is the index of a water user j 1 2 j where j 1 is for the municipal sector j 2 is for the industrial sector and j 3 is for agricultural sector k is the index of the water resources k 1 2 k where k 1 is for the reservoir k 2 is for the lake and k 3 is for the outside watershed x ijk is the decision variable which denotes the water amount allocated to the user j of the district i from the water resource k b ij is the benefit of the user j of the district i when a cubic meter of water is allocated c k is the cost of a cubic meter from the water resource k secondly we use the gini coefficient to assess the water allocation equity in the water allocation system the parameters i e ω i and ρ i in eq 3 can be calculated as follows 5a ω i i j 1 j k 1 k x ijk i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k x ijk 5b ρ i i r i i 1 i r i where r i denotes the population in the administrative district i and i is an operational symbol introduced in this study for convenience in writing for an arbitrary variable π i we have i π i π 1 π 2 π i as a result we can calculate the gini coefficient as the second objective as follows 6 min α g 1 i 1 i 2 i 1 j 1 j k 1 k x i 1 jk j 1 j k 1 k x ijk i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k x ijk r i i 1 i r i let η j be the water use efficiency of water user j then we can link x ijk to the variables of a x r a x l b x and i x as follows 7a b x i 1 i j 1 2 k 1 k 1 η j x ijk 7b a x r i 1 i j 1 j x ij 1 7c a x l i 1 i j 1 j x ij 2 7d i x i 1 i k 1 k x i 3 k let v r and v l denote the minimum water storage volumes of the reservoirs and lake regulated by the local watershed management authority respectively thus we have v e r v r and v e l v l then eqs 2a and 2b can be converted to the following constraints 8a i 1 i j 1 j x ij 1 d x r q r φ sc φ c p s r e s r v 0 r v r 8b i 1 i j 1 j x ij 2 d x l d x r i 1 i j 1 2 k 1 k 1 η j x ijk q n x i 3 k φ sc φ c p s l e s l v 0 l v l consider the fact that uncertainty may exist in the runoff simulation we set the two hydrological parameters as the corresponding stochastic variables i e φ sc and φ c then constraints 8a and 8b can convert into a chance constrained version as follows 9a pr i 1 i j 1 j x ij 1 d x r p s r e s r v 0 r v r q r φ sc φ c 1 q 9b pr i 1 i j 1 j x ij 2 d x l d x r i 1 i j 1 2 k 1 k 1 η j x ijk p s l e s l v 0 l v l q n x i 3 k φ sc φ c 1 q where q 0 1 is the level of probability i e significance level representing the allowable risk of violating the constraint pr denotes the probability of occurrence of a stochastic event constrains 9a and 9b are to ensure the constraints are satisfied with a probability level greater than or equal to 1 q the following are technical constraints for the decision variables 10a d min r d x r d max r 10b d min l d x l d max l 10c j 1 j x ij 2 l i i 10d 0 k 1 k x ijk r ij i j where d min r and d max r are the minimum and maximum discharges for the reservoirs based on the reservoir operation rules d min l and d max l are the minimum and maximum discharges for the lake based on the lake operation rules l i is the maximum capacity of pumping lake water to district i r ij is the water demand of the water user j in the district i 2 5 solution method gbso model includes two objective functions 4 and 6 and constrains 9a and 9b and 10a to 10d fig 1 also shows the solution method flowchart consisting of three procedures for the gbso model firstly the gbso model requires to be converted into an equivalent deterministic version by using the ccp technology huang 1998 constraints 9a and 9b can be converted into the following equivalent version 11a i 1 i j 1 j x ij 1 d x r p s r e s r v 0 r v r q r q φ sc φ c 11b i 1 i j 1 j x ij 2 d x l d x r i 1 i j 1 2 k 1 k 1 η j x ijk p s l e s l v 0 l v l q n q x i 3 k φ sc φ c where q r q f q r 1 q given the cdfs of q r i e f q r and the significance level i e q q n q f q n 1 q given the cdfs of q n i e f q n and the significance level i e q eq 11a is a linear constrain while eq 11b is a nonlinear constraint this is because the inputs of q n contain the decision variables secondly we generate the cdfs of the q r and q n through using the glue to the two parameter hydrological model nott et al 2012 the details are i generate a sample of points φ sc and φ c of size m using the prior distribution p φ sc and p φ c respectively ii import each

θ we discard the m n non behavioral parameter sets and retain the n behavioral parameter sets which denote as φ sc j and φ c j j 1 2 n iv assign each predicted flow data h t φ sc j φ c j with probability ω j which can be calculated by 13 ω j l φ sc j φ c j o j 1 n l φ sc j φ c j o j v sort the predicted flow with probability ω j to generate the cdfs of the q r and q n finally we can use the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to search the solutions of pareto optimal front for the equivalent version of gbso model the fitness function nonlinear constraint bound and linear inequality modules of nsga ii consist of eqs 4 and 6 eq 11b eqs 10a and 10b and eqs 10c to 10d and 11a respectively nsga ii was proposed by deb et al 2000 to overcome the drawbacks e g a lager computation time for non dominated sorting of the first generation of nsga developed by srinivas and deb 1994 it introduces some features such as an elitist archive crowding distance calculation and non dominated sorting to obtain a well spread pareto front vonk et al 2014 technical details including the main computational steps of nsga ii can be referred to yazdi and neyshabouri 2012 and makaremi et al 2017 3 case study the study case is the lake dianchi watershed which has been reported by dai et al 2016 lake dianchi watershed 102 29 103 01 e 24 29 25 28 n is located in the kunming city yunnan province china it has a total area of about 2920 km2 covering the reservoir watersheds 1081 km2 the non reservoir watersheds 1538 km2 and the dianchi lake 301 km2 the watershed mainly resides six administrative districts denoted as pl wh xs jn cg and gd in fig 4 each district includes three water users i e municipal industrial and agricultural sectors table 1 shows the population distribution water demand magnitude and unit water benefit in different districts in 2008 liu 2011 the efficiencies of water usage for municipal industrial sectors are 0 53 and 0 89 respectively zhang et al 2013 this study focuses on two kinds of surface water resources i e reservoirs and lake lake dianchi watershed has eight reservoirs to supply water to three water users of six districts while the lake dianchi can only pump water to agricultural sector because the poor water quality cannot satisfy the water use standard for municipal and industrial sectors table 2 shows the parameter configuration related to reservoir and lake such as unit water use cost minimum and maximum discharge capacities minimum water storage volume and initial water storage volume fig 4 also shows the locations of the daguanlou meteorological station fig s2 a of the supplementary material presents the annual pan evaporation from 1999 to 2010 based on the meteorological variables such as temperature humidity radiation wind speed and atmospheric pressure we can estimate the water surface evaporation as shown in fig s2 b of the supplementary material there are 18 precipitation sites distributed in the lake dianchi watershed fig 4 we use the thiessen polygon interpolation method fiedler 2003 to estimate the weights of precipitation sites for synthesizing the spatial average precipitation series fig s3 of the supplementary material shows the annual spatial average precipitation at the reservoir and non reservoir watershed from 1980 to 2015 there are two flow stations i e baoxianghe and zhonghe station located in the reservoir and non reservoir watersheds respectively fig 4 we have 12 year flow data from 1999 to 2010 where the first year is the warm up period and the years from 2000 to 2010 are the calibration period for the two parameter hydrological model moreover the prior distributions of hydrological model of the reservoir and non reservoir watershed are set as φ sc u 0 3 and φ c u 100 2000 li and xiong 2013 xiong and guo 1999 in general the problem of water allocations in a dry year is more important to handle than that in a wet year mckee et al 1993 defined a standardized precipitation index spi as the relative departures of precipitation from normality it is an effective tool for quantitative assessment of drought intensity for multiple time scales naresh kumar et al 2009 table s1 of the supplementary material shows the drought category criterion based on the spi ranges in this research we estimate the year scale spi values using 36 year spatial average precipitation series in the reservoir and non reservoir watersheds as shown in fig s4 of the supplementary material the spi values of the reservoir and non reservoir watersheds in the worst drought year i e 2009 are 2 13 and 2 19 respectively we design four drought scenarios by selecting the mid value of spi ranges in the drought category criterion as the precipitation input of gbso model table 3 moreover the evaporation inputs of gbso model are collected by calculating the multi year average values of the pan evaporation and water surface evaporation series 4 results and discussion based on the solution method of the gbso model the cdfs of runoff for the reservoir and no reservoir watershed were estimated firstly then we used glue to quantify the parameter uncertainties in the hydrological models of the reservoir and no reservoir watershed respectively in glue 1000 behavioral parameter sets were generated by i setting a threshold of likelihood value of 0 8 to reject the non behavioral simulations and ii adjusting the number of sampling from the prior distributions fig 5 shows the likelihood values of behavioral parameter sets for the hydrological models of reservoir and non reservoir watersheds the results indicate that both of the two parameters i e φ c and φ sc would be sensitive to the hydrological models because they appear to exhibit peaked behaviors for the hydrological model of reservoir watershed the ranges of the behavioral φ c and φ sc would be 1 03 1 15 and 630 1918 respectively and the best model with φ c 1 12 and φ sc 981 would have the highest likelihood value of 0 856 for the hydrological model of non reservoir watershed the ranges of the behavioral φ c and φ sc would be 1 75 1 83 and 201 913 respectively and the best model with φ c 1 12 and φ sc 981 would have the highest likelihood value of 0 853 fig 6 a and c present the simulated cdfs of annual runoff amount by importing the behavioral parameter sets into the hydrological models of the reservoir and no reservoir watersheds respectively extracting the 2 5 97 5 and 50 quantiles of the simulated cdfs we can obtain the 95 prediction uncertainty 95 ppu and the median simulated series respectively as shown in fig 6 b and d it is indicated that the scope of the 95 ppu could cover most of the observed flow data moreover the absolute mean relative error between the observed and median simulated series of the hydrological models of the reservoir and no reservoir watershed would be 14 4 and 14 7 respectively thus the calibration performances for the two hydrological models were satisfactory the calibrated hydrological models and behavioral parameter sets are then linked to optimization model and the optimal solutions can be found through nsga ii the nsga ii on matlab platform was run on a workstation with intel xeon cpu at 2 70 ghz and 64 gb ram the features of applied nsga ii include i double vector for the population type ii tournament selection operator iii uniform mutation operator and iv scattered crossover operation the parameters of nsga ii were selected by carrying out some initial trial and error runs considering both the computational time and convergence efficiency the adopted values of tournament size crossover fraction for reproduction mutation rate migration fraction and population size were set to 2 0 8 0 01 0 2 and 200 respectively moreover three probabilities i e q 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 of constraint violation and four drought scenarios i e mild moderate severe and extreme drought were adopted in the optimization model in this study we used two types of termination criteria for nsga ii namely either the maximum generation number is reached or the fitness function value showing the difference of successive iterations is lower than a tolerance level 10 6 fig s5 of the supplementary material presents the progress of the pareto optimal front solutions at different q levels under different drought scenarios by setting the maximum number of generations as one of the nsga ii parameter to 10 50 100 500 and 1000 respectively during the optimization process the non dominated solutions on the pareto optimal front from nsga ii iterations with the maximum generation numbers of 10 50 100 and 500 would fast converge to the solutions with the maximum generation number of 1000 as benchmark in fact it was found that the termination conditions for the nsga ii were satisfied in 132 323 and 110 generations under q 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 for mild drought scenario and 107 82 and 391 generations under q 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 for extreme drought scenario respectively fig 7 presents the optimal pareto front between two objective functions such as system benefit α sb and gini coefficient α g at different q levels for different drought scenarios it implies a positively correlated relationship between α sb and α g generally a larger α sb suggests a more effective water allocation scheme and a smaller α g implies a more trustworthy condition of the water allocation equity a trade off between α sb and α g reveals the conflicting nature of equity and efficiency in water allocation problems decision makers could use the pareto fronts to analyze the effect of such conflicting nature and eventually identify a suitable solution of water allocation scheme with the aid of other considerations e g budget restrictions and policy priorities the results also indicate that the pareto optimal fronts would move to the lower right corner when q increases from 0 05 to 0 25 for any drought scenario the lower position corresponds to a combination of higher α sb and smaller α g values which is desired for a better pareto solution this is mainly because the quantile of the random variable i e q r and q n would increase with the increase of q level a higher right hand limit would lead to a decreased strictness for the constraints which would lead to a larger feasible region for nsga ii to seek better pareto optimal fronts on the pareto optimal fronts we select three typical cases for further analysis case 1 is the feasible solution from the upper right point of the pareto optimal front which corresponds to the maximum α sb value case 3 is the feasible solution from the lower left point of the pareto optimal front corresponding to the minimum α g value case 2 is the feasible solution from the middle point of the pareto optimal front which offers an equal weight for the two objectives fig 8 shows the optimal system benefits for cases 1 3 at different q levels under various drought scenarios the benefit for case 1 is the highest and that for case 3 would be the lowest under a specific combination of q level and drought scenario during a mild drought year when q is 0 05 the system benefits would be 8 41 109 7 86 109 and 7 14 109 for case 1 case 2 and case 3 respectively when q increases to 0 25 the system benefits would increase to 10 62 109 9 88 109 and 8 88 109 respectively this is because case 1 assigns the largest weight for the system benefit it is also indicated that the benefit would increase with the increase of q level for each case and different drought scenarios for instance during a mild drought year the system benefits would be 8 41 109 9 31 109 and 10 62 109 for case 1 and 7 14 109 8 34 109 and 8 88 109 for case 3 under significance levels of 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 respectively a higher q level means a higher risk of violating the constraints but it would lead to an increased system benefit a lower q level implies a stricter control of constraint satisfaction but with some compromise of system benefit moreover at a specific q level for each case the benefit would decrease when the watershed suffers from worse drought intensity the system benefits for case 1 under significance level of 0 05 would be 8 41 109 7 97 109 7 83 109 and 7 36 109 during a mild moderate severe and extreme drought year respectively a worse drought intensity scenario would correspond to a lower precipitation amount it may produce less surface runoff flowing into reservoirs and lake and lead to less water amount on the surface of reservoirs and lake thus there would be less allocated water amount to users and lower system benefit generated fig 9 presents the lorenz curves and the corresponding gini coefficient from the optimal allocation schemes for cases 1 3 at different p levels under various drought scenarios the gini coefficients appear to be 0 20 0 16 and 0 14 for case 1 case 2 and case 3 at q 0 05 under the mild drought scenario in an extreme drought year the gini coefficients would be 0 32 0 27 and 0 23 for case 1 case 2 and case 3 at the same q level such results demonstrate that case 3 has the lowest gini coefficient and it is the most equitable option among the three alternative cases this is due to the fact the definition of case 3 gives the highest weight for equity of water allocation it is also found that the gini coefficient would decrease with the increase of the significance level i e q level for example during a mild drought year the gini coefficient for case 1 would be 0 20 0 17 and 0 16 at q levels of 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 respectively this is because a higher significance level implies a looser right hand limit and a larger feasible region for nsga ii to identify the more equitable water allocation schemes i e a smaller gini coefficient moreover the drought intensity of the watershed has an effect on the optimal gini coefficient the gini coefficient for case 3 at a significance level of 0 25 would be 0 10 0 11 0 12 and 0 15 during a mild moderate severe and extreme drought year respectively the lower the drought intensity is the more the water resources would be stored in the reservoirs and lake which would lead to a larger feasible region for nsga ii searching table 4 shows the optimized water resources allocation schemes for cases 1 3 at different q levels under the mild drought scenario and the optimized allocation schemes for the moderate severe and extreme drought scenarios are shown in tables s2 s3 and s4 of the supplementary material respectively each solution including cases 1 2 and 3 on the pareto optimal front explicitly corresponds to a specific optimal water allocation scheme for example during a mild drought year if q 0 05 the allocated water amount from the reservoir to the municipal industrial and agricultural sectors in the pl district would be 59 14 15 75 and 0 87 million m3 for case 1 58 36 5 80 and 0 90 million m3 for case 2 and 58 96 1 60 and 0 73 million m3 for case 3 respectively meanwhile the allocated water amount from the lake to the agricultural sector in the pl district would be 0 51 million m3 for case 1 0 54 million m3 for case 2 and 0 38 million m3 for case 3 it is also indicated that any change in q i e the degree of constraint satisfaction would lead to changes of the quantile of the random runoffs i e q r q and q n q and thus affect different water allocation schemes taking case 1 for instance the water amount allocated from the reservoir to the industrial sector of the pl district would be 15 75 6 43 and 21 28 million m3 under q levels of 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 respectively moreover the drought intensity would affect the water resources allocation schemes any changes in drought intensity would lead to changes of precipitation amount and available amount of water resources and thus influence different water allocation schemes for case 3 at a significance level of 0 25 the schemes which allocate the lake water to the agricultural sector in the pl district would be 0 71 1 28 0 58 and 0 64 during a mild moderate severe and extreme drought year respectively table 5 shows the optimized discharge rules of reservoir and lake for cases 1 3 at different q levels under various drought scenarios the lake discharge could be regarded as one of the losses of available water resources for the entire lake watershed theoretically the larger the lake discharge is the worse the pareto solutions are a worse solution denotes attainment of a relatively lower water allocation benefit and a bigger gini coefficient thus the optimal solution of the lake discharge would tend to approach the minimum discharge capacity i e 144 10 million m3 however the optimal discharge amount of lake for all cases appear to vary from 146 22 million m3 to 152 96 million m3 which are still slightly above the minimum discharge capacity this is mainly because nsga ii could only achieve a close to optimal pareto front for the water allocation instead of an absolute one after system terminates the discharge from reservoir is dependent on the water balance relationship among reservoir watershed runoff water allocation to users precipitation evaporation and lake water requirement for maintaining a minimum water level table 5 also shows that the optimized discharge of reservoir has small variations among different cases but differs notably at different q levels under various drought scenarios different cases pose some impact on the water allocation schemes among users but their effect is minor on the total water allocation amount thus the water balance relationship is almost unchanged among different cases on the other hand drought scenarios correspond to various precipitation amounts and the q levels denote the uncertainty of simulated runoff where they are more sensitive to optimization results for comparison purpose if the effect of gini coefficients is not taken into consideration a stochastic single objective optimization sso model could be established i e the second objective function as described by eq 6 should be dropped sso reflect the principle of supreme efficiency thus the water amount would be preferentially allocated to the water user with the highest unit water benefit e g industrial sector of wh district of 55 85 m3 whereas the municipal and agricultural sectors would not receive any water allocation which would not be fair thus adding the gini coefficients in the modeling framework can help yield more reasonable water allocation schemes moreover the framework of gbso integrates the hydrological model and optimization model where the output of hydrological model i e runoff is one of the inputs of the optimization model if the hydrological model is not included in gbso it is difficult to obtain the available water resources amount allocated to users at the watershed scale due to the monstrous task for monitoring the flow on all rivers in addition the parameter uncertainties originated from the hydrological model have been transferred into the ccp model by glue technique such process could extend the application for ccp model if the concept of ccp is not included in gbso we would select typical runoff scenarios to tackle the similar problem in such a case a series of water allocation schemes could be generated under different runoff scenarios compared with ccp scenario based results may use the historical data i e runoff as the right hand side limit in a case by case manner however it is impossible to have any risk of violating the constraints and this may lead to overwhelming investment cost 5 conclusions in this study a gini coefficient based stochastic optimization gbso model was developed by integrating the hydrological model water balance model gini coefficient and ccp into a general multi objective optimization modeling framework in gbso a water balance model was used to maintain the water supply demand balance of reservoir and lake where the inflow is estimated by the hydrological model gini coefficient was introduced to evaluate the equality of water allocation among various water users the multiple objectives were used to reflect the tradeoff between equity and benefit of water allocation schemes using glue the parameter uncertainties of the hydrological model could be quantified into the probability distribution of runoff as the inputs for ccp model the gbso model was solved by using nsga ii after the ccp model was converted to the corresponding deterministic version gbso model was applied to identify the pareto optimal water allocation schemes from two water resources to three water users in the six administrative districts of the lake dianchi watershed china firstly behavioral parameter sets were identified based on the threshold of likelihood value of 0 8 and they were imported into the hydrological models to produce the cdfs of runoff then the model solutions of pareto fronts reflected the tradeoff between two objective functions such as system benefit α sb and gini coefficient α g at different significance levels under various drought scenarios finally we selected three cases on the pareto optimal fronts for calculating the corresponding water allocation schemes in general the positively correlated relationship between α sb and α g revealed the conflicting nature of equity and efficiency in a practical water allocation problem moreover a worse drought intensity scenario would correspond to lower precipitation amount which may lead to less water resources stored in the reservoirs and lake consequently the water amount allocated to water users would become less and the feasible region for nsga ii searching would become narrower in addition for the ccp constraints a lower q means a lower risk of violating the constraints but meanwhile it would result in stricter constraints and thus a decreased system benefit and a less equitable water allocation scheme the main contributions of this research work are i development of a gbso model with consideration of conflicting equity and benefit and its application to a lake watershed water allocation system and ii linkage of glue and ccp to reflect the propagation of uncertainties from a hydrologic model to an optimization framework the results suggested that gbso model was an effective tool for guiding watershed scale water allocation management some research gaps may need to be improved in future studies for example the two parameter hydrologic model focused on the balance of the surface water without considering the interaction of groundwater more comprehensive hydrologic models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat could also be integrated into the

assistance of ashok mishra associate editor a gini coefficient based stochastic optimization gbso model was developed by integrating the hydrological model water balance model gini coefficient and chance constrained programming ccp into a general multi objective optimization modeling framework for supporting water resources allocation at a watershed scale the framework was advantageous in reflecting the conflicting equity and benefit objectives for water allocation maintaining the water balance of watershed and dealing with system uncertainties gbso was solved by the non dominated sorting genetic algorithms ii nsga ii after the parameter uncertainties of the hydrological model have been quantified into the probability distribution of runoff as the inputs of ccp model and the chance constraints were converted to the corresponding deterministic versions the proposed model was applied to identify the pareto optimal water allocation schemes in the lake dianchi watershed china the optimal pareto front results reflected the tradeoff between system benefit α sb and gini coefficient α g under different significance levels i e q and different drought scenarios which reveals the conflicting nature of equity and efficiency in water allocation problems a lower q generally implies a lower risk of violating the system constraints and a worse drought intensity scenario corresponds to less available water resources both of which would lead to a decreased system benefit and a less equitable water allocation scheme thus the proposed modeling framework could help obtain the pareto optimal schemes under complexity and ensure that the proposed water allocation solutions are effective for coping with drought conditions with a proper tradeoff between system benefit and water allocation equity keywords gini coefficient chance constrained programming glue nsga ii water allocation lake dianchi watershed 1 introduction over the past decades water scarcity issues have aggravated intensive competition of fresh water among the stakeholders of interest and imposed necessity of carrying out optimal allocation of water resources friesen et al 2017 shao et al 2015 to achieve the fundamental principles of efficiency equity and eco environmental sustainability the water resources allocation process is fraught with complexities due to uncertainties associated with many system components and their interrelationships such as the random nature of runoff weather events of the watershed soil water storage and evapotranspiration rate of land surface jafarzadegan et al 2014 nikoo et al 2013 these complexities have posed great challenges for watershed managers in making decisions towards effective water resources management previously researchers have focused on developing various stochastic optimization techniques for tackling such complexities alcolea et al 2009 davidsen et al 2015 dong et al 2014 hariga et al 2005 mousavi et al 2014 xu et al 2017b among them chance constrained programming ccp has advantages in i effectively dealing with stochastic uncertainties expressed as cumulative distribution functions cdfs and reflecting the reliability of satisfying or risk of violating system constraints considering the irrigation water requirement as stochastic variable sethi et al 2006 used a ccp model to allocate available land and water resources to maximize the net annual farm income under various resource constraints in a coastal groundwater basin in eastern india dong et al 2014 integrated the interval linear programming and ccp model into an inexact optimization framework for achieving the maximum benefit of water resources allocation where chance constraints were used to ensure an allowable risk of facing water deficit li et al 2017 combined a ccp model and dynamic programming for water resources allocation of reservoirs in beijing china with consideration of maximum economic benefits and stochastic uncertainties of the available water amount in reservoirs for traditional water allocation study using ccp models the chance constraints are used to reflect the supply and demand relationship between water sources and water users where the stochastic parameters are generally associated with such a relationship such as the water demand from a water user or the available capacity of a reservoir in general the cdfs of such stochastic parameters were generated by predefining normal distributions with means and standard deviations based on experience singh 2016 xu et al 2017a when a hydrological cycle is linked with a water allocation system and the related uncertainties are originated from hydrological parameters a ccp model may be difficult to construct due to shortage of information to build the cdfs of runoff generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 is a popular uncertainty analysis technique and has been widely used for quantifying parameter and prediction uncertainties of hydrological models xie and lian 2013 for example sun et al 2016 reynolds et al 2017 and xue et al 2018 used the glue to evaluate the uncertainties of an agricultural hydrological model i e rzwqm2 an bucket type hydrological model i e hbv and a semi distributed hydrologic model i e topmodel respectively these studies demonstrated that the glue method is potentially applicable to address the uncertainties in the hydrological model and help offer cdf information for the benefit of implementing a ccp modeling framework on the other hand the previous studies made viable attempt in applying ccp in water resources management however most of these efforts focused on the objective of maximum system benefit but rarely concerned with the equity of water resources allocation in fact water allocation equality is imperative in helping relieve the conflicts of water users to maintain the social stability and harmony d exelle et al 2012 cullis and van koppen 2007 firstly proposed the gini coefficient as an effective tool in quantification of water resources allocation equality later on gini coefficient was employed to assess i the equality of distribution of urban water utilizations among the cities in the yangtze river delta area china zhang and shao 2010 ii the effect of global virtual water transfers on redressing the inequality of water uses among nations seekell et al 2011 and iii the equality in domestic water supply in the yellow river watershed wang et al 2012 more recently optimization models based on gini coefficient were used to improve water allocation designs in light of benefit and equity for example hu et al 2016b introduced a multi objective programming model for optimal allocation of water resources in the qujiang river watershed china the model s first objective is to maximize the economic benefit and the other is to maximize water allocation equity measured by the gini coefficient hu et al 2016c developed a multi objective bi level water allocation model where the upper level modeled the allocation principle of equity and the lower level modeled the economic benefit for each subarea in another work of hu et al 2016d the concept of value at risk was introduced into the gini coefficient based model to control the economic loss risk caused by the variation of available water resources generally there were studies on ccp glue and water allocation equity individually but very few of them considered all in a general optimization framework for the modeling theory a combinative consideration of methodology would have a better functionality under the condition of transferring the uncertainties from the hydrological model into a stochastic optimization model from the angle of practical applications watershed managers and interested stakeholders may prefer schemes from an optimization model with a well balanced deliberation between equity and efficiency a fusion of both uncertainty and equality could help better reflect the complexity of the water allocation system therefore this study aims to develop a gini coefficient based stochastic optimization gbso model by integrating hydrological model water balance model gini coefficient ccp and glue into a general multi objective optimization framework the water balance model is used to maintain the water supply demand balance of reservoir and lake where the inflow is estimated by the hydrological model gini coefficient is applied to help evaluate the equality of water allocation among administrative districts ccp and glue are used to handle stochastic uncertainties from the hydrological model multiple objectives are designed to address the tradeoff between equity and efficiency of water allocation schemes a lake watershed in china will be used for case demonstration 2 methodology consider a water allocation system at a lake watershed where the watershed management authority has the accountability to allocate multiple water resources to multiple users in multiple administrative districts as stakeholders all administrative districts expect the water allocation schemes to be both fair and efficient and at the same time maintain the water balances of the watershed to ensure its eco environmental sustainability in addition we need to consider the uncertainties existing in the water allocation system the water balance of lake may have the stochastic features as its inflow directly affected by the complex hydrological processes jones et al 2016 vázquez and hampel 2014 thus we propose to use a gbso model to address these complexities fig 1 shows the framework of the proposed model with details being explained in the following sections 2 1 two parameter hydrological model xiong and guo 1999 developed a two parameter hydrological model to simulate the monthly runoff by assuming that the runoff is a hyperbolic tangent function of the soil water content as the objective of this study is to produce the optimal annual time scale water allocation schemes we use a similar relationship between runoff and soil water content let q t be the annual runoff and it can be calculated as 1a q t s w t 1 p t i t e t tanh s w t 1 p t i t e t φ sc where s w t 1 is the soil water content at the end of the year t 1 i t is the irrigation water amount p t is the precipitation amount φ sc denotes the field capacity of watershed which is a hydrological parameter e t is the actual evapotranspiration and it can be estimated as follows li and xiong 2013 1b e t φ c e p t tanh p t e p t where e p t is the pan evaporation value and φ c denotes a time scale conversion coefficient which is the second hydrological parameter the soil water content in the lake watershed at the end of year t i e s w t can be computed as follows hosseini et al 2017 hu et al 2016a 1c s w t s w t 1 p t i t e t q t 2 2 water balance model of reservoir and lake we divide the lake watershed into two parts including the reservoir watershed and non reservoir watershed the reservoir watershed controlled by reservoirs can offer the fresh water to the users and the non reservoir watershed can generate the uncontrolled surface runoff flowing into the lake fig 2 shows the related water balance among the watershed reservoir lake and water users in this research we focus on the water volume of reservoir and lake the annual water volume changes in the reservoir and lake can be expressed based on the following water balance equations pan et al 2017 2a v e r v 0 r p s r e s r q r φ sc φ c d x r a x r 2b v e l v 0 l p s l e s l q n i x φ sc φ c d x r d x l b x a x l where superscripts r and l denote the reservoir and lake v 0 r and v 0 l are the initial water storage volume v e r and v e l are the water storage volume at the end of year p s r and p s l are the water surface precipitation e s r and e s l are the water surface evaporation which can be estimated by the penman monteith method silva et al 2010 i x is the irrigation water on the non reservoir watershed q r φ sc φ c and q n i x φ sc φ c which can be calculated by the two parameter hydrological model are the runoff generated from the reservoir watershed and non reservoir watershed respectively d x r and d x l are the discharge water volume a x r and a x l are the water volume allocated to the water users b x is the water returned from the water users 2 3 gini coefficient in water allocation system gini coefficient is one of effective equality measures for the equity evaluation of resource allocation problems vass et al 2013 it originally developed by italian economist corado gini to measures the inequality degree in the distribution of income in a given society milanovic 1997 gini coefficient is calculated based on the lorenz curve fig s1 of the supplementary material presents the lorenz curve representing the response relationship between the cumulative proportion of income and the corresponding cumulative proportion of population we assume that the area between the absolute equality line and the lorenz curve is s and the area under the lorenz curve is l the value of gini coefficient is equal to s s l zhang et al 2012 because of s l 1 2 the gini coefficient is also equal to 1 2 l the value range of the gini coefficient is from 0 to 1 in general a lower gini coefficient implies the allocation with more equality and a larger gini coefficient implies the allocation with less equality in addition the cumulative share of population is on the x axis meaning that the criterion i e population is selected to represent the income equality similarly in the water allocation system we also use the population to reflect the equality of water allocation among the administrative districts wang et al 2012 fig 3 presents the lorenz curve for water allocation problem according to the definition of gini coefficient we have 3 g 1 2 i 1 i l i 1 i 1 i ω i ω i 1 ρ i ρ i 1 where i is the name of the administrative district i 1 2 i g is the value of gini coefficient for the equity evaluation of water allocation l i is the area under the lorenz curve generated by the administrative district i ω i is the cumulative share of water volume allocated to administrative district i where ω 0 0 ρ i is the cumulative share of population in the administrative district i where ρ 0 0 2 4 gini coefficient based stochastic optimization model in this study the system benefit and water allocation equity are considered as separate conflicting objectives in a multi objective optimization model firstly we need to maximize the system benefit α sb as 4 max α sb i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k b ij x ijk i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k c k x ijk where j is the index of a water user j 1 2 j where j 1 is for the municipal sector j 2 is for the industrial sector and j 3 is for agricultural sector k is the index of the water resources k 1 2 k where k 1 is for the reservoir k 2 is for the lake and k 3 is for the outside watershed x ijk is the decision variable which denotes the water amount allocated to the user j of the district i from the water resource k b ij is the benefit of the user j of the district i when a cubic meter of water is allocated c k is the cost of a cubic meter from the water resource k secondly we use the gini coefficient to assess the water allocation equity in the water allocation system the parameters i e ω i and ρ i in eq 3 can be calculated as follows 5a ω i i j 1 j k 1 k x ijk i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k x ijk 5b ρ i i r i i 1 i r i where r i denotes the population in the administrative district i and i is an operational symbol introduced in this study for convenience in writing for an arbitrary variable π i we have i π i π 1 π 2 π i as a result we can calculate the gini coefficient as the second objective as follows 6 min α g 1 i 1 i 2 i 1 j 1 j k 1 k x i 1 jk j 1 j k 1 k x ijk i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k x ijk r i i 1 i r i let η j be the water use efficiency of water user j then we can link x ijk to the variables of a x r a x l b x and i x as follows 7a b x i 1 i j 1 2 k 1 k 1 η j x ijk 7b a x r i 1 i j 1 j x ij 1 7c a x l i 1 i j 1 j x ij 2 7d i x i 1 i k 1 k x i 3 k let v r and v l denote the minimum water storage volumes of the reservoirs and lake regulated by the local watershed management authority respectively thus we have v e r v r and v e l v l then eqs 2a and 2b can be converted to the following constraints 8a i 1 i j 1 j x ij 1 d x r q r φ sc φ c p s r e s r v 0 r v r 8b i 1 i j 1 j x ij 2 d x l d x r i 1 i j 1 2 k 1 k 1 η j x ijk q n x i 3 k φ sc φ c p s l e s l v 0 l v l consider the fact that uncertainty may exist in the runoff simulation we set the two hydrological parameters as the corresponding stochastic variables i e φ sc and φ c then constraints 8a and 8b can convert into a chance constrained version as follows 9a pr i 1 i j 1 j x ij 1 d x r p s r e s r v 0 r v r q r φ sc φ c 1 q 9b pr i 1 i j 1 j x ij 2 d x l d x r i 1 i j 1 2 k 1 k 1 η j x ijk p s l e s l v 0 l v l q n x i 3 k φ sc φ c 1 q where q 0 1 is the level of probability i e significance level representing the allowable risk of violating the constraint pr denotes the probability of occurrence of a stochastic event constrains 9a and 9b are to ensure the constraints are satisfied with a probability level greater than or equal to 1 q the following are technical constraints for the decision variables 10a d min r d x r d max r

of three procedures for the gbso model firstly the gbso model requires to be converted into an equivalent deterministic version by using the ccp technology huang 1998 constraints 9a and 9b can be converted into the following equivalent version 11a i 1 i j 1 j x ij 1 d x r p s r e s r v 0 r v r q r q φ sc φ c 11b i 1 i j 1 j x ij 2 d x l d x r i 1 i j 1 2 k 1 k 1 η j x ijk p s l e s l v 0 l v l q n q x i 3 k φ sc φ c where q r q f q r 1 q given the cdfs of q r i e f q r and the significance level i e q q n q f q n 1 q given the cdfs of q n i e f q n and the significance level i e q eq 11a is a linear constrain while eq 11b is a nonlinear constraint this is because the inputs of q n contain the decision variables secondly we generate the cdfs of the q r and q n through using the glue to the two parameter hydrological model nott et al 2012 the details are i generate a sample of points φ sc and φ c of size m using the prior distribution p φ sc and p φ c respectively ii import each

θ we discard the m n non behavioral parameter sets and retain the n behavioral parameter sets which denote as φ sc j and φ c j j 1 2 n iv assign each predicted flow data h t φ sc j φ c j with probability ω j which can be calculated by 13 ω j l φ sc j φ c j o j 1 n l φ sc j φ c j o j v sort the predicted flow with probability ω j to generate the cdfs of the q r and q n finally we can use the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to search the solutions of pareto optimal front for the equivalent version of gbso model the fitness function nonlinear constraint bound and linear inequality modules of nsga ii consist of eqs 4 and 6 eq 11b eqs 10a and 10b and eqs 10c to 10d and 11a respectively nsga ii was proposed by deb et al 2000 to overcome the drawbacks e g a lager computation time for non dominated sorting of the first generation of nsga developed by srinivas and deb 1994 it introduces some features such as an elitist archive crowding distance calculation and non dominated sorting to obtain a well spread pareto front vonk et al 2014 technical details including the main computational steps of nsga ii can be referred to yazdi and neyshabouri 2012 and makaremi et al 2017 3 case study the study case is the lake dianchi watershed which has been reported by dai et al 2016 lake dianchi watershed 102 29 103 01 e 24 29 25 28 n is located in the kunming city yunnan province china it has a total area of about 2920 km2 covering the reservoir watersheds 1081 km2 the non reservoir watersheds 1538 km2 and the dianchi lake 301 km2 the watershed mainly resides six administrative districts denoted as pl wh xs jn cg and gd in fig 4 each district includes three water users i e municipal industrial and agricultural sectors table 1 shows the population distribution water demand magnitude and unit water benefit in different districts in 2008 liu 2011 the efficiencies of water usage for municipal industrial sectors are 0 53 and 0 89 respectively zhang et al 2013 this study focuses on two kinds of surface water resources i e reservoirs and lake lake dianchi watershed has eight reservoirs to supply water to three water users of six districts while the lake dianchi can only pump water to agricultural sector because the poor water quality cannot satisfy the water use standard for municipal and industrial sectors table 2 shows the parameter configuration related to reservoir and lake such as unit water use cost minimum and maximum discharge capacities minimum water storage volume and initial water storage volume fig 4 also shows the locations of the daguanlou meteorological station fig s2 a of the supplementary material presents the annual pan evaporation from 1999 to 2010 based on the meteorological variables such as temperature humidity radiation wind speed and atmospheric pressure we can estimate the water surface evaporation as shown in fig s2 b of the supplementary material there are 18 precipitation sites distributed in the lake dianchi watershed fig 4 we use the thiessen polygon interpolation method fiedler 2003 to estimate the weights of precipitation sites for synthesizing the spatial average precipitation series fig s3 of the supplementary material shows the annual spatial average precipitation at the reservoir and non reservoir watershed from 1980 to 2015 there are two flow stations i e baoxianghe and zhonghe station located in the reservoir and non reservoir watersheds respectively fig 4 we have 12 year flow data from 1999 to 2010 where the first year is the warm up period and the years from 2000 to 2010 are the calibration period for the two parameter hydrological model moreover the prior distributions of hydrological model of the reservoir and non reservoir watershed are set as φ sc u 0 3 and φ c u 100 2000 li and xiong 2013 xiong and guo 1999 in general the problem of water allocations in a dry year is more important to handle than that in a wet year mckee et al 1993 defined a standardized precipitation index spi as the relative departures of precipitation from normality it is an effective tool for quantitative assessment of drought intensity for multiple time scales naresh kumar et al 2009 table s1 of the supplementary material shows the drought category criterion based on the spi ranges in this research we estimate the year scale spi values using 36 year spatial average precipitation series in the reservoir and non reservoir watersheds as shown in fig s4 of the supplementary material the spi values of the reservoir and non reservoir watersheds in the worst drought year i e 2009 are 2 13 and 2 19 respectively we design four drought scenarios by selecting the mid value of spi ranges in the drought category criterion as the precipitation input of gbso model table 3 moreover the evaporation inputs of gbso model are collected by calculating the multi year average values of the pan evaporation and water surface evaporation series 4 results and discussion based on the solution method of the gbso model the cdfs of runoff for the reservoir and no reservoir watershed were estimated firstly then we used glue to quantify the parameter uncertainties in the hydrological models of the reservoir and no reservoir watershed respectively in glue 1000 behavioral parameter sets were generated by i setting a threshold of likelihood value of 0 8 to reject the non behavioral simulations and ii adjusting the number of sampling from the prior distributions fig 5 shows the likelihood values of behavioral parameter sets for the hydrological models of reservoir and non reservoir watersheds the results indicate that both of the two parameters i e φ c and φ sc would be sensitive to the hydrological models because they appear to exhibit peaked behaviors for the hydrological model of reservoir watershed the ranges of the behavioral φ c and φ sc would be 1 03 1 15 and 630 1918 respectively and the best model with φ c 1 12 and φ sc 981 would have the highest likelihood value of 0 856 for the hydrological model of non reservoir watershed the ranges of the behavioral φ c and φ sc would be 1 75 1 83 and 201 913 respectively and the best model with φ c 1 12 and φ sc 981 would have the highest likelihood value of 0 853 fig 6 a and c present the simulated cdfs of annual runoff amount by importing the behavioral parameter sets into the hydrological models of the reservoir and no reservoir watersheds respectively extracting the 2 5 97 5 and 50 quantiles of the simulated cdfs we can obtain the 95 prediction uncertainty 95 ppu and the median simulated series respectively as shown in fig 6 b and d it is indicated that the scope of the 95 ppu could cover most of the observed flow data moreover the absolute mean relative error between the observed and median simulated series of the hydrological models of the reservoir and no reservoir watershed would be 14 4 and 14 7 respectively thus the calibration performances for the two hydrological models were satisfactory the calibrated hydrological models and behavioral parameter sets are then linked to optimization model and the optimal solutions can be found through nsga ii the nsga ii on matlab platform was run on a workstation with intel xeon cpu at 2 70 ghz and 64 gb ram the features of applied nsga ii include i double vector for the population type ii tournament selection operator iii uniform mutation operator and iv scattered crossover operation the parameters of nsga ii were selected by carrying out some initial trial and error runs considering both the computational time and convergence efficiency the adopted values of tournament size crossover fraction for reproduction mutation rate migration fraction and population size were set to 2 0 8 0 01 0 2 and 200 respectively moreover three probabilities i e q 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 of constraint violation and four drought scenarios i e mild moderate severe and extreme drought were adopted in the optimization model in this study we used two types of termination criteria for nsga ii namely either the maximum generation number is reached or the fitness function value showing the difference of successive iterations is lower than a tolerance level 10 6 fig s5 of the supplementary material presents the progress of the pareto optimal front solutions at different q levels under different drought scenarios by setting the maximum number of generations as one of the nsga ii parameter to 10 50 100 500 and 1000 respectively during the optimization process the non dominated solutions on the pareto optimal front from nsga ii iterations with the maximum generation numbers of 10 50 100 and 500 would fast converge to the solutions with the maximum generation number of 1000 as benchmark in fact it was found that the termination conditions for the nsga ii were satisfied in 132 323 and 110 generations under q 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 for mild drought scenario and 107 82 and 391 generations under q 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 for extreme drought scenario respectively fig 7 presents the optimal pareto front between two objective functions such as system benefit α sb and gini coefficient α g at different q levels for different drought scenarios it implies a positively correlated relationship between α sb and α g generally a larger α sb suggests a more effective water allocation scheme and a smaller α g implies a more trustworthy condition of the water allocation equity a trade off between α sb and α g reveals the conflicting nature of equity and efficiency in water allocation problems decision makers could use the pareto fronts to analyze the effect of such conflicting nature and eventually identify a suitable solution of water allocation scheme with the aid of other considerations e g budget restrictions and policy priorities the results also indicate that the pareto optimal fronts would move to the lower right corner when q increases from 0 05 to 0 25 for any drought scenario the lower position corresponds to a combination of higher α sb and smaller α g values which is desired for a better pareto solution this is mainly because the quantile of the random variable i e q r and q n would increase with the increase of q level a higher right hand limit would lead to a decreased strictness for the constraints which would lead to a larger feasible region for nsga ii to seek better pareto optimal fronts on the pareto optimal fronts we select three typical cases for further analysis case 1 is the feasible solution from the upper right point of the pareto optimal front which corresponds to the maximum α sb value case 3 is the feasible solution from the lower left point of the pareto optimal front corresponding to the minimum α g value case 2 is the feasible solution from the middle point of the pareto optimal front which offers an equal weight for the two objectives fig 8 shows the optimal system benefits for cases 1 3 at different q levels under various drought scenarios the benefit for case 1 is the highest and that for case 3 would be the lowest under a specific combination of q level and drought scenario during a mild drought year when q is 0 05 the system benefits would be 8 41 109 7 86 109 and 7 14 109 for case 1 case 2 and case 3 respectively when q increases to 0 25 the system benefits would increase to 10 62 109 9 88 109 and 8 88 109 respectively this is because case 1 assigns the largest weight for the system benefit it is also indicated that the benefit would increase with the increase of q level for each case and different drought scenarios for instance during a mild drought year the system benefits would be 8 41 109 9 31 109 and 10 62 109 for case 1 and 7 14 109 8 34 109 and 8 88 109 for case 3 under significance levels of 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 respectively a higher q level means a higher risk of violating the constraints but it would lead to an increased system benefit a lower q level implies a stricter control of constraint satisfaction but with some compromise of system benefit moreover at a specific q level for each case the benefit would decrease when the watershed suffers from worse drought intensity the system benefits for case 1 under significance level of 0 05 would be 8 41 109 7 97 109 7 83 109 and 7 36 109 during a mild moderate severe and extreme drought year respectively a worse drought intensity scenario would correspond to a lower precipitation amount it may produce less surface runoff flowing into reservoirs and lake and lead to less water amount on the surface of reservoirs and lake thus there would be less allocated water amount to users and lower system benefit generated fig 9 presents the lorenz curves and the corresponding gini coefficient from the optimal allocation schemes for cases 1 3 at different p levels under various drought scenarios the gini coefficients appear to be 0 20 0 16 and 0 14 for case 1 case 2 and case 3 at q 0 05 under the mild drought scenario in an extreme drought year the gini coefficients would be 0 32 0 27 and 0 23 for case 1 case 2 and case 3 at the same q level such results demonstrate that case 3 has the lowest gini coefficient and it is the most equitable option among the three alternative cases this is due to the fact the definition of case 3 gives the highest weight for equity of water allocation it is also found that the gini coefficient would decrease with the increase of the significance level i e q level for example during a mild drought year the gini coefficient for case 1 would be 0 20 0 17 and 0 16 at q levels of 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 respectively this is because a higher significance level implies a looser right hand limit and a larger feasible region for nsga ii to identify the more equitable water allocation schemes i e a smaller gini coefficient moreover the drought intensity of the watershed has an effect on the optimal gini coefficient the gini coefficient for case 3 at a significance level of 0 25 would be 0 10 0 11 0 12 and 0 15 during a mild moderate severe and extreme drought year respectively the lower the drought intensity is the more the water resources would be stored in the reservoirs and lake which would lead to a larger feasible region for nsga ii searching table 4 shows the optimized water resources allocation schemes for cases 1 3 at different q levels under the mild drought scenario and the optimized allocation schemes for the moderate severe and extreme drought scenarios are shown in tables s2 s3 and s4 of the supplementary material respectively each solution including cases 1 2 and 3 on the pareto optimal front explicitly corresponds to a specific optimal water allocation scheme for example during a mild drought year if q 0 05 the allocated water amount from the reservoir to the municipal industrial and agricultural sectors in the pl district would be 59 14 15 75 and 0 87 million m3 for case 1 58 36 5 80 and 0 90 million m3 for case 2 and 58 96 1 60 and 0 73 million m3 for case 3 respectively meanwhile the allocated water amount from the lake to the agricultural sector in the pl district would be 0 51 million m3 for case 1 0 54 million m3 for case 2 and 0 38 million m3 for case 3 it is also indicated that any change in q i e the degree of constraint satisfaction would lead to changes of the quantile of the random runoffs i e q r q and q n q and thus affect different water allocation schemes taking case 1 for instance the water amount allocated from the reservoir to the industrial sector of the pl district would be 15 75 6 43 and 21 28 million m3 under q levels of 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 respectively moreover the drought intensity would affect the water resources allocation schemes any changes in drought intensity would lead to changes of precipitation amount and available amount of water resources and thus influence different water allocation schemes for case 3 at a significance level of 0 25 the schemes which allocate the lake water to the agricultural sector in the pl district would be 0 71 1 28 0 58 and 0 64 during a mild moderate severe and extreme drought year respectively table 5 shows the optimized discharge rules of reservoir and lake for cases 1 3 at different q levels under various drought scenarios the lake discharge could be regarded as one of the losses of available water resources for the entire lake watershed theoretically the larger the lake discharge is the worse the pareto solutions are a worse solution denotes attainment of a relatively lower water allocation benefit and a bigger gini coefficient thus the optimal solution of the lake discharge would tend to approach the minimum discharge capacity i e 144 10 million m3 however the optimal discharge amount of lake for all cases appear to vary from 146 22 million m3 to 152 96 million m3 which are still slightly above the minimum discharge capacity this is mainly because nsga ii could only achieve a close to optimal pareto front for the water allocation instead of an absolute one after system terminates the discharge from reservoir is dependent on the water balance relationship among reservoir watershed runoff water allocation to users precipitation evaporation and lake water requirement for maintaining a minimum water level table 5 also shows that the optimized discharge of reservoir has small variations among different cases but differs notably at different q levels under various drought scenarios different cases pose some impact on the water allocation schemes among users but their effect is minor on the total water allocation amount thus the water balance relationship is almost unchanged among different cases on the other hand drought scenarios correspond to various precipitation amounts and the q levels denote the uncertainty of simulated runoff where they are more sensitive to optimization results for comparison purpose if the effect of gini coefficients is not taken into consideration a stochastic single objective optimization sso model could be established i e the second objective function as described by eq 6 should be dropped sso reflect the principle of supreme efficiency thus the water amount would be preferentially allocated to the water user with the highest unit water benefit e g industrial sector of wh district of 55 85 m3 whereas the municipal and agricultural sectors would not receive any water allocation which would not be fair thus adding the gini coefficients in the modeling framework can help yield more reasonable water allocation schemes moreover the framework of gbso integrates the hydrological model and optimization model where the output of hydrological model i e runoff is one of the inputs of the optimization model if the hydrological model is not included in gbso it is difficult to obtain the available water resources amount allocated to users at the watershed scale due to the monstrous task for monitoring the flow on all rivers in addition the parameter uncertainties originated from the hydrological model have been transferred into the ccp model by glue technique such process could extend the application for ccp model if the concept of ccp is not included in gbso we would select typical runoff scenarios to tackle the similar problem in such a case a series of water allocation schemes could be generated under different runoff scenarios compared with ccp scenario based results may use the historical data i e runoff as the right hand side limit in a case by case manner however it is impossible to have any risk of violating the constraints and this may lead to overwhelming investment cost 5 conclusions in this study a gini coefficient based stochastic optimization gbso model was developed by integrating the hydrological model water balance model gini coefficient and ccp into a general multi objective optimization modeling framework in gbso a water balance model was used to maintain the water supply demand balance of reservoir and lake where the inflow is estimated by the hydrological model gini coefficient was introduced to evaluate the equality of water allocation among various water users the multiple objectives were used to reflect the tradeoff between equity and benefit of water allocation schemes using glue the parameter uncertainties of the hydrological model could be quantified into the probability distribution of runoff as the inputs for ccp model the gbso model was solved by using nsga ii after the ccp model was converted to the corresponding deterministic version gbso model was applied to identify the pareto optimal water allocation schemes from two water resources to three water users in the six administrative districts of the lake dianchi watershed china firstly behavioral parameter sets were identified based on the threshold of likelihood value of 0 8 and they were imported into the hydrological models to produce the cdfs of runoff then the model solutions of pareto fronts reflected the tradeoff between two objective functions such as system benefit α sb and gini coefficient α g at different significance levels under various drought scenarios finally we selected three cases on the pareto optimal fronts for calculating the corresponding water allocation schemes in general the positively correlated relationship between α sb and α g revealed the conflicting nature of equity and efficiency in a practical water allocation problem moreover a worse drought intensity scenario would correspond to lower precipitation amount which may lead to less water resources stored in the reservoirs and lake consequently the water amount allocated to water users would become less and the feasible region for nsga ii searching would become narrower in addition for the ccp constraints a lower q means a lower risk of violating the constraints but meanwhile it would result in stricter constraints and thus a decreased system benefit and a less equitable water allocation scheme the main contributions of this research work are i development of a gbso model with consideration of conflicting equity and benefit and its application to a lake watershed water allocation system and ii linkage of glue and ccp to reflect the propagation of uncertainties from a hydrologic model to an optimization framework the results suggested that gbso model was an effective tool for guiding watershed scale water allocation management some research gaps may need to be improved in future studies for example the two parameter hydrologic model focused on the balance of the surface water without considering the interaction of groundwater more comprehensive hydrologic models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat could also be integrated into the

7283,during the last years there has been an increasing interest in assessing health risks caused by exposure to contaminants found in soil air and water like heavy metals or emerging contaminants this work presents a study on the spatial patterns and interaction effects among relevant heavy metals sb as and pb that may occur together in different minerals total organic carbon toc have been analyzed too because it is an essential component in the regulatory mechanisms that control the amount of metal in soils even more exposure to these elements is associated with a number of diseases and environmental problems these metals can have both natural and anthropogenic origins a key component of any exposure study is a reliable model of the spatial distribution the elements studied a geostatistical analysis have been performed in order to show that selected metals are auto correlated and cross correlated and type and magnitude of such cross correlation varies depending on the spatial scale under consideration after identifying general trends we analyzed the residues left after subtracting the trend from the raw variables three scales of variability were identified compounds or factors with scales of 5 35 and 135 km the first factor f1 basically identifies anomalies of natural origin but in some places of anthropogenics origin as well the other two are related to geology f2 and f3 although f3 represents more clearly geochemical background related to large lithological groups likewise mapping of two major structures indicates that significant faults have influence on the distribution of the studied elements finally influence of soil and lithology on groundwater by means of contingency analysis was assessed keywords geostatistic groundwater heavy metal multiscale soil 1 introduction many geochemical variables show scale dependent spatial variability pardo igúzquiza and dowd 2002 its origin often lies in natural and anthropic factors affecting these variables porteous 1996 reimann and garrett 2005 blonda and valenzano 2014 have studied both sources of metals many natural variables are rarely available for every location therefore an interpolation method is needed to complete coverage maps geostatistical spatial models provide a probabilistic framework for data analysis and predictions that build on the joint spatial and temporal dependence between observations kyriakidis and journel 1999 geostatistical tools have been applied to the modelling of spatiotemporal distributions in many disciplines such as geochemistry imrie et al 2008 santos francés et al 2017a santos francés et al 2017b environmental sciences ecology and health dogru et al 2017 warnken et al 2017 among others geostatistics has been used to evaluate spatial variability of arsenic contamination in groundwater goovaerts et al 2005 gong et al 2014 other authors have studied multiscale variability semivariogram analysis suggests that complex spatial distribution of high level arsenic concentration in groundwater is a consequence of interactions among multiscale geological and geochemical processes karthik et al 2001 serre et al 2003 showed that most of variability in arsenic concentrations across bangladesh occurs within a distance of 2 km which makes spatial interpolation very challenging yu et al 2003 found that much of large scale 10 km variability in arsenic concentration is explained by geology and geomorphology while small scale 3 km variability is mainly due to variations in well depth being measured lower concentrations in deeper wells antimony arsenic and lead often occur in paragenesis with other metals depending upon geological conditions sediments with different degrees of enrichment are produced by erosion of parent materials however according to adriano 2001 common values for sb in soils are in the range 0 1 10 mg kg as fluctuates between 1 and 10 mg kg and pb between 10 and 30 mg kg moreover presence of toc influences geochemical processes that can lead to significant increases in content of these metals in both soil boluda 1988 bohn et al 1985 ramos miras et al 2014 wang and qin 2008 and groundwater which is often used for irrigation of horticultural products and urban water supply in general terms major natural and anthropogenic sources of heavy metals were found to derive from lithogenic origin transportation and atmospheric deposition among others but more multivariate statistical analysis for assessing heavy metal distribution in soils on a regional scale must are required hou et al 2017

exposure was associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk gong and o bryant 2012 the exposure to sb and pb is also associated to a number of diseases related with skin lungs kidneys hearth and abortions among others in general direct hazardous effects or potential risks to human health and ecosystem stability can be caused by transport and transformation among multi media schemes of

work is to explore multi scale variability of elements in soil and establish relationship with groundwater composition by means of contingency analysis 2 methodology 2 1 data this work has been carry out with data surficial soil samples 20 cm depth from the geochemical atlas of spain locutura et al 2012 groundwater quality data were provided by the spanish ministry of the environment the sampling network assessed the quality of groundwater bodies according to the requirements of the ground water directives gwd although not all elements are studied in every groundwater body in this sense the spanish government has applied criteria such as the groundwater monitoring network shall be established in accordance with requirements of articles 7 and 8 of the aforementioned directives the monitoring network shall be designed to provide a coherent and comprehensive overview of groundwater chemical status within each river basin and to detect the presence of long term anthropogenically induced upward pollutants trends in total 8806 samples of as 2060 samples of sb and 4645 samples of pb have been studied most of the sampling points are wells used for water supply or farm supply and a low percentage are piezometers and springs mainland spain has a diverse fig 1 and complex geology vera 2004 http info igme es cartografia october 2015 this complex geology implies a wide variety of minerals in the iberian peninsula two main geological units are differentiated the western part constitutes the hercynian domain while the eastern part comprises the alpine domain and tertiary basins the hercynian domain consists of precambrian and paleozoic rocks prior to the permian period on the other hand the alpine domain consists of rocks and sediments generated during the mesozoic and tertiary it is therefore composed of young materials tectonically linked to the last orogeny in this latter domain the tertiary basins which act as sediments receptors during the tertiary are included moreover most metal ores deposits are located within the hercynian domain distributed among the following geotectonic areas cantabrian area characterized by having thick series of coal strata galicia trás os montes area differentiated by the existence of two poly metamorphic massifs mafic and ultramafic the accompanying formations are distinguished by the presence of acidic and basic volcanic rocks and granites high concentrations in chromium platinum copper nickel cobalt tin polymetallic sulphide and other elements can be found in this area central iberian zone in this unit the schist greywacke complex prevails there are also large areas of granitoids and even coal mines in this geotectonic zone there are important tungsten tin and precious metals mineralizations associated with arsenic and antimony ossa morena zone this unit is extremely complex centergranitic rocks similar in the north and the center dominate the northeast sector to the south the basic character of

portuguese zone this zone is characterized by the existence of a vulcan sedimentary complex the oldest geological formation contains phyllite and quartzite as well as acidic and basic volcanic rocks acidic volcanic rocks are the metallogeny of polymetallic massive sulphide iberian pyrite belt which is the most important metallogenic area of portugal cartography of main faults has been included as additional information to analyze its influence in spatial variation of selected variables 2 2 geostatistical tools geostatistics is nowadays considered as the standard technique for statistical analysis of spatial environmental data goovaerts 1997 wackernagel 2003 webster and oliver 2007 kriging and its multivariate version cokriging use a probabilistic framework that is needed for the spatial decomposition of total variability in scales of spatial variation as is used in pardo igúzquiza and dowd 2002 the set of spatial experimental values can be considered as realizations of a set z i u i 1 n of second order stationary random functions with autocorrelations and cross correlations or variogram and cross variograms and where the spatial variability is scale dependent for each pair of spatial environmental variables z i u z j u the cross variogram is defined as in chiles and delfiner 2012 γ ij h 1 2 e z i u z i u h z j u z j u h from experimental variograms it is possible to detect and model different scales of variability characterized by different variogram structures with different ranges this is the first objective of the methodology after the experimental variograms have been estimated the second objective is to fit theoretical models the lineal model of corregionalization lmc wackernagel 2003 is used for modeling the system of variograms and cross variograms or covariances and cross covariances a proportional covariance model is the simplest multivariate model used in geostatistics and is one in which all the variograms are proportional to a single variogram function γ ij h b ij γ h with symmetric coefficients b ij that define a positive definite matrix each variogram and semi variogram is represented as a sum of the same elementary variogram models γ ij h u 0 s b ij u γ u h the fitting of a model implies choosing the basic variogram models and the matrix b b ij a computer program for fitting the lmc by using the procedure described by goulard and voltz 1992 may be found in pardo igúzquiza and dowd 2002 the third objective is to estimate the different scales of variability related to different ranges observed in the experimental variograms and cross variograms thus each variable z i u i 1 n can be thought of as being generated by the superposition of s 1 spatially uncorrelated components z i s u s 0 s z i x s 0 s z i s u m i with e z i u m i e z i s u 0 cov z i s u z i s u h c ij s h if s t 0 otherwise the s thm component of the i thm variable z i s u can be estimated at any non sampled location by using factorial cokriging fck goovaerts 1997 chiles and delfiner 1999 pardo igúzquiza and dowd 2002 the fck estimator is given by z p 0 s 0 u 0 i 1 n α 1 n i ω i α z i u α where the weights ω i α are obtained by solving the system of fck j 1 n β 1 n j ω j β c ij u α u β μ i c ip 0 u 0 u α u 0 β 1 n i ω i β 0 i 1 n α 1 n i µi lagrange multiplier cij uα uβ spatial covariance for the distance vector

estimating a factor by using a cokriging estimator y p 0 s 0 u 0 i 1 n α 1 n i ω i α z i u α by solving the corresponding system of equations wackernagel 2003 the fck application has two main advantages a it determines the correlation between different variables and uses a common model to estimate variables in the area under investigation in this case if there is an information deficit in one of them estimation can be completed using spatial correlation with the other variables b differentiated structures in the adjusted models of variograms can be mapped separately in this way anomalies can be mapped and the geochemical background of the study area can be identified 2 3 contingency tables a contingency analysis to verify spatial relationship between pairs of variables has been done to do this a grid of 4 km 4 km was established to compare pairs of variables within the cell and their relationship with lithology relationship with lithology was defined comparing association between lithology and decile 90 finally the chi square statistic is calculated with the following expression x 2 n 1 n 1 e 2 n 2 n 2 e 2 n 3 n 3 e 2 n 4 n 4 e 2 n 1 e n 2 e n 3 e n 4 e chi square x2 with 1 freedom degree shows association with a level of confidence table 1 3 case study sample distribution of raw soil data is shown in fig 1 concentration statistics for as mg kg pb mg kg sb mg kg and toc in percentage are presented in table 2 these parameters were collected at 20 cm depth table 2 statistics of studied parameters c v common values of elements mg kg adriano 2001 na not available the mean toc value in the studied area is 2 6 located in the northern and mountainous wooded areas more humid in general the 1 of toc is a threshold which is established as a desertification limit loveland and webb 2003 values below this limit are condensed in the southern half of the study area and in the central parts of duero and ebro basins the range of variation is large table 2 and mean values are close to grls for human health protection established by a number of spanish autonomous communities rd 2005 conama10 2010 due to the fact that grls are not defined throughout spain the most restrictive conama10 2010 were selected as the standard these are 6 mg kg for sb 30 mg kg for as and 60 mg kg for pb according to adriano 2001 common values for sb in soils are in the range 0 1 10 mg kg as fluctuates between 1 and 10 mg kg and pb between 10 and 30 mg kg the mean contents of as pb and sb in soils table 2 are within the range established by adriano 2001 but as and pb are close to the upper limit in general the highest sb values are located in paleozoic formations values above 6 mg kg can also be found in industrialized areas in northern and central spain and agricultural land in the east values are lower in plutonic igneous rocks as well as in sedimentary basins filled with these materials concentrations are also lower in carbonate terrains arsenic values of over 30 mg kg can be found in paleozoic formations across the study area this grl reference is shown in many industrial sectors in large parts of northern central and eastern spain the concentration in soils is greater than the grl it is worth mentioning that as values of over 100 mg kg can be found in both industrial and agricultural soils with regard to grl of pb values of over 30 mg kg can be found in paleozoic terrains mining areas and industrial sectors in northern central and eastern parts of the iberian peninsula the presence of pb in agricultural areas of the duero and segura basins is remarkable nevertheless the highest values can be found in addition to mining regions where pb is the main ore in the aforementioned industrial areas the 10 mg kg limit is present in more than 90 of the samples in many parts of the study area as regards toc pb is the element with the largest match of high values this is followed by as and finally sb for all three elements a good cartographic match exists between the presence of clay and high sb as and pb content 3 1 groundwater quality data since the water framework directive wfd came into force networks have expanded in terms of both the number of sampling points and the parameters analyzed at each control station it is important to make clear that not all the parameters are analyzed in every groundwater body gwb table 3 shows main statistics of studied elements in groundwater as regards the metals studied since the enforcement of wfd official control networks show that there were around 700 readings in excess of 25 µgr l the maximum as concentration set by the environmental quality standard rd 2011 these high values are concentrated in the duero and tajo river basins there were also 1250 readings in exceedance 10 µgr l who 2011 almost 1000 readings found more than 7 2 µgr l of lead rd 2011 and more than 600 had over 10 µgr l who 2011 although these values are concentrated in the center and east they can also be observed scattered across the whole study area as regards sb there are no official quality standards although the who 2011 suggests 20 µgr l as reference level more than 2200 readings go beyond this value 3 2 geostatistical analyses due to the large bias of data distribution it was decided to apply a logarithmic transformation base 10 to the concentration of the selected elements in soil table 2 table 4 shows the adjusted parameters from the direct variogram model and variograms adjusted on the residuals are presented in table 5 the fundamental difference between variograms adjusted for the original variable and the residuals is observed mainly in the ranges which are larger in the latter in figs 2 5 the estimation ordinary kriging ok for the studied variables according to adjusted variogram models spherical in all cases is showed each element shows a different drift figs 6a d from low values blue color to high values red color figs 7a d shows the estimation of residuals once eliminated the drift in all cases we observed that the spatial distribution of the residue is very similar to the estimate for the variable 3 3 corregionalization models as stated calculated residuals were analyzed in the first step the models were optimized and the ranges for the linear model of coregionalization were set at 5000 m 35 000 m and 135 000 m correlation between the variables was examined in order to perform a cokriging of each one in relation to the others table 6 3 4 factorial cokriging this procedure allowed to co estimate each residual depending on its correlation with the others every component of the variogram short medium and long range was estimated in this way separating components it is easier to detect anomalies using the short range medium range can uncover more extensive anomalies but can also be part of the natural geochemical background lastly long range is mainly related to the geochemical background fig 8a represents the short range f1 of toc and clearly shows the highest and lowest values for the three compounds such fast variations are logical in this component the focus of interest of such high values is the fact that they can be associated with metal sinks the high toc values detected in some sectors of the sedimentary basins and especially in the duero river basin are noticeable the medium range f2 of toc fig 8b confirms the anomalies observed of the short range and greater continuity of the variable is perceived in some sectors in relation to its regional distribution when compared to ok fig 7a f2toc varies between 0 7 and 1 9 and is probably part of the variable background it represents a model of transition to f3toc the long range f3 reveals the background value of toc fig 8c and roughly indicates the same maximum and minimum areas as fig 7a however it provides more detail about the regional variability in a way diffused to some extent in the ok of this variable in this case the range of dark blue color corresponds to toc values below the 1 desertification limit loveland and webb 2003 this makes it easier to define desertified areas as classified using this parameter to verify the results of the method the three factors of estimated toc and the drift were added together if the sum is similar to the ok for the toc this means that the method has been correctly applied in all cases the results have been optimal fig 9a shows f1sb where the highest values in red are related to lithology paleozoic rocks and to a lesser extent to industrial and agricultural areas this factor shows the highest values of the three compounds as expected a rapid increase in spatial variability is observed in different parts of the study area if the proposed value of 6 mg kg conama10 2010 is considered 0 778 in terms of logarithm values the limit value is surpassed at five points in paleozoic rocks in the south cartography of f2sb fig 9b shows good correlation with lithology of the study area fig 1 although high values are also shown in some sectors of the detrital basins geochemical background plays an important role in this factor except in some points in the north and northeast where there are industrial areas f3sb fig 9c defines the geochemical background and points to paleozoic as the lithology with the highest concentrations it is also noticed that in some sectors the distribution of sb may be influenced by faults fig 9b most of the range of variation of the three mapped factors of as falls within the limits indicated by adriano 2001 f1as fig 10a varies from 0 03 to 9 98 mg kg high values of this factor are more than twice those estimated with f2as and f3as the rapid increase in the variability of this factor defines areas where there are major anomalies of natural origin furthermore although estimated values of this factor are far from the maximum showed in fig 4 there is a high degree of overlap between the areas where maximum values appear some of these high values are in the detrital duero basin where high values of as have been detected mapping f2as fig 10b shows a range between 0 3 mg kg and 3 54 mg kg maximum values of this factor are related to paleozoic and plutonic rocks plutonic rocks in the central sector show high values of as concentration with abrupt changes towards the northern detrital depressions rapid changes may be related in some cases to the presence of faults high values are also observed in quaternary detrital basins f3as fig 10c has values between 0 8 and 1 1 mg kg and defines major structures and alignments more clearly some sectors in quaternary detrital basins also show high values likewise some outcrops of jurassic cretaceous rocks show high values of sb related to f2as and f3as overall the spatial distribution of this factor is related to geochemical background values below the usual ones in soils adriano 2001 were estimated for all components of pb f1pb fig 11a ranges from 0 01 to 14 2 mg kg and shows higher values compared to the other ones many peak values match paleozoic rocks and to a lesser extent jurassic cretaceous in some sectors high values are observed in quaternary detrital rocks where some kind of economic activity takes place f2pb fig 11b shows a distribution of maximum and minimum similar to f1pb some quaternary detritus show important values in some cases related to industrial activity and in others to wetlands or topographically lower zones mapped values with this component vary between 0 4 and 3 mg kg f3pb fig 11c shows a range of variation between 0 6 and 1 8 mg kg this component represents the geochemical background for the studied area in some sectors faults may condition pb distribution 4 discussion and results 4 1 trend trend maps fig 6 show the overall fluctuations of the variables in the studied area the toc map fig 6a captures a clear increasing of percentages from the southern more dry to northern rainier sb map show two sectors with high values related with paleozoic outcrops located in the southern and northeastern fig 6b the spatial distribution of as fig 6c exhibit high values in the northwestern related with plutonic rocks and a wide central sector with low concentration towards eastern there is a slight increase related with mesozoic terrains while little plutonic outcrops located in the northeastern it produces an increase of the trend in conclusion pb has showed more similarity with as distribution the outcrops of plutonic rocks located in northwestern and southeastern have higher influence in the mapped trend fig 6d 4 2 fck relationship between the spatial variability of sb as and pb and geology according to fig 3 sb high values 2 5 mg kg are concentrated in paleozoic rocks broadly the three estimated factors figs 9a c show the highest values of sb in paleozoic rocks besides f1sb fig 9a shows values above 2 mg kg in jurassic and cretaceous zones and sedimentary basins moreover in a few points north and northeast concentrations observed in the could be due to industrial activities estimated values of f2sb fig 9b are part of the background of rocks from the triassic and older except in some parts of the sedimentary basins overall the distribution of values for this component is more consistent with hypothesis regarding natural origin of the element the f3sb fig 9c shows a close relationship with paleozoic rocks especially with proterozoic and cambrian devonian and to a lesser extent with neogene volcanic rocks rocks from the jurassic cretaceous have values of less than 1 5 mg kg similar values around 1 5 mg kg were also observed in some areas of neogene basins moreover there are clear lineaments running nw especially in materials from the cambrian devonian in this sense it is easy to see how faults also influence the distribution of sb in some sectors fig 4 shows that as is concentrated in paleozoic formations with jurassic cretaceous formations in the iberian range in second position 50 mg kg high values were also observed in certain outcrops of plutonic rocks in the center of the study area as one might expect the sedimentary basins filled with material from these outcrops are rich in arsenic by contrast large areas of detrital neogene and jurassic cretaceous in the south have low values highest concentrations are found in detrital formations on the east coast and in the northwest part of the duero river basin it is also observed that low values are more common in rocks from the cambrian devonian age f1as fig 10a confirms the distribution of anomalies in the rocks mentioned and shows that as values are also high in industrial areas of northeastern spain in addition concentration of these values in the northern coastal strip is particularly significant duero and guadalquivir basins show high as values 2 mg kg mapped values of f2as fig 10b can be considered part of the geochemical background maximum values are located in relation with as rich rocks and in industrial zones the most remarkable feature of the estimate of f3as fig 10c is that it represents geochemical background as explained by the fact that its distribution pattern resembles the great lithological units there is a notable coincidence between observed alignments in mapping f3as fig 10c and the geology fig 1 especially in cambrian devonian materials similarly in sedimentary basins especially in the duero basin graben like sectors not directly related to lithology are defined however faults and other tectonic accidents could themselves determine distribution of as in the above sectors in some cases rapid transitions between low and high values of this component can be observed in line with faults distribution of as in the estimate made by ok is conditioned by lithology while f3as seems to be much more influenced by tectonic structures faults the estimated values of pb fig 5 are concentrated on hercynian and permo triassic rocks in the southern half jurassic and cretaceous rocks in the north also show large areas with high values of pb as well as detrital terrains located in the coastal strip of the eastern sector fig 11a shows the estimate f1pb there is higher concentration of positive anomalies in cambrian devonian rocks of the southern half and in permian triassic rocks also in the south other anomalies are related to industrial areas in the north and south of spain there are also anomalies in some agricultural areas of the duero basin tajo basin eastern spain and southeast spain the agreement in some sectors of f2pb fig 11b with outcrops of cambrian devonian age can be observed in the south of the study area moreover some of the elongated morphologies observed match both cambrian devonian and jurassic cretaceous outcrops in some cases these outcrops have significant influence on neighboring deposits of the neogene in the rest of the study area maxima exhibit more circular shapes this factor can include values that may be due to both geochemical background and pollution f3pb fig 11c has a similar distribution to major lithological units however faults or equivalent structures also may act as boundaries of a part of the estimated maxima in some cases faults coincide with areas of rapid variations between minima and maxima values 4 3 fck and chemical groundwater composition 4 3 1 antimony according to who 2011 the overall exposure to antimony from environmental sources food and drinking water is very low compared with occupational exposure even more is a priority environmental contaminant relatively poorly studied warnken et al 2017 unlike other elements sb has not been analyzed in all groundwater bodies fig 12 shows points where sb is above 0 001 μg l there are two groups aquifers with values just above the detection limit and those with values below detection limit in general this element is found in detrital aquifers however most part of high values occur in aquifers where there is also a high value in soil and where important industrial activity is taking place on the surface on the gwb siose 2011 the guideline value for this element is 20 μg l values above this level were found at scattered points throughout the ebro river basin and the central study area the relationship between high values of the three factors and high values in groundwater bodies decreases from f1sb to f3sb likewise an analysis shows that anthropic activity decreases from f1sb to f3sb 4 3 2 arsenic as is usually present at concentrations less than 1 2 μg l in natural waters although concentrations may be quite high up to 12 mg l in areas containing natural sources in groundwater however where there are sulphide mineral and sedimentary deposits derived from volcanic rocks concentrations can be significantly higher in places where concentration of arsenic in drinking water is 10 μg l or greater this will be the dominant source of intake who 2011 in general terms high values of as in soil match gwb with values of 10 μg l or more fig 13 nevertheless higher values of arsenic over 10 mg l can be found in gwbs in the duero river basin where concentrations in soil are low less than 15 mg kg in the central area of the river basin though maximum values of f1as are not very high 5 mg kg there is a high match between high as content in gwb and maximum values of f1as in more than half of the groundwater quality control records the tajo river basin shows a similar situation but as values in gwb and soil are less than in the duero river basin in spite of this in the duero river basin and part of the coastal detrital aquifers in eastern spain a lower correlation between soil and groundwater can be observed however in these areas anthropic activity is quite important and may be the source of as in gwb overall f2as was less correlated with high as values in gwbs the duero river basin shows the highest f2as values but these are less than 1 7 mg kg in gwb where as concentration is higher f3as enables identification of sectors where groundwater is more influenced by geochemical background for example the duero river basin shows areas with a high concentration of f3as in soil and a high concentration of as in gwb from this perspective the occurrence of low values in soil at the same time as high values in groundwater could indicate the influence of industrial activities or groundwater exploitation capable of influencing the chemical equilibrium of as 4 3 3 lead lead concentration in groundwater vary from 1 µg l to 60 µg l in europe who 2011 generally the pb content in soil in detrital basins is low but on occasions concentrations in groundwater can exceed 10 μg l values above 10 μg l who 2011 are concentrated in the center and east fig 14 but they can also be observed in other parts of the study area from fig 14 it can be concluded that the best correlation between high values of soil and groundwater takes place in some points of the northern in the center of the study area and in some points in eastern spain less than 120 points in aquifers related to metamorphic and volcanic rocks high values of pb concur in soil and groundwater in detrital coastal aquifers in the east pb content is high in line with soil concentrations it should be noted that this area is an important industrial center and that various metals were mined there in the past siose 2011 in f1pb and f2pb a good correlation between high values in soil and in the underlying aquifer is observed especially as concentration in soil increases the lowest concentration of pb is found in sectors where f3pb has lower concentrations this is especially evident in aquifers with little or no influence from volcanic or metamorphic materials if the least common element is take as a reference where sb appears as and pb are also present in aquifers in the center of the study area there are many points with high values of as and pb this coincidence is greater when there are high concentrations of positive anomalies of both elements especially in the vicinity of outcrops of volcanic and metamorphic rocks 4 4 contingency tables correlation of studied elements in soil the chi square test table 7 was made from the estimation mesh in total 30 817 cells this method aims to count the number of points where both variables show high values and establish the confidence level on the relationship between them in all three cases association between values for metals above 90th percentile estimated by ok shows confidence values over 99 9 of the different associations the one with the highest number of matches is ok as ok sb followed close behind by ok pb ok sb the drift shows high correlation between as and pb while as and sb repel and the relationship between pb and sb is random i e chi around zero in all three cases association of the residual ok is over 99 9 with a higher number of coincidences compared when the ok of the raw variable is analyzed association between f1 values in all three cases shows a confidence of over 99 9 with very similar number of matches in the three pairs the confidence level of the test performed for f2 and f3 was also over 99 9 in both cases there are more coincidences in the as pb ratio especially in f2 10 times more coincidences this analysis indicates a high degree of affinity between the three elements in general the relationship between as and pb is stronger in factors f2 and f3 when analyzing estimates of ok in f2 and f3 the three elements have a closer relationship than when analyzed in f1 this suggests that the factors affecting the relationship between these elements are linked to the geochemical background 4 5 contingency tables lithology versus soil concentration contingency tables have been used too to test for significant differences in soil concentration depending on lithology table 7 the lithology has been splitted into six categories plutonic pr paleozoic pzr permo triassic ptr jurassic cretaceous mr paleogene pgr and neogene nr as in the previous analysis a mesh with 30 817 soil composition data estimated by ok and the three calculated factors was used in general the relationship between plutonic rocks pr and the three elements studied shows a higher chi square value with as the relation with ok as and the drift is over 99 9 whereas with the rest of the components it is less than 90 pr sb shows rejection in all relations with values close to those for random behavior the pr pb ratio is statistically low with only the drift above 75 in paleozoic rocks pzr the element with greatest affinity is sb table 7 except for the drift the confidence level of the hypothesis is over 99 9 followed by pb and then as note that f2 and specially f3 represent the geochemical background sb shows much higher affinity with pzr than the other elements the relation of the three elements with permotriassic rocks ptr is practically random table 5 only the drift in pb shows a confidence value of over 75 and with the drift at 99 9 the contingency analysis indicates that there is rejection in the association of the three elements with mesozoic rocks mr with no affinity table 7 only the relationship between mr f3 pb has a confidence level of over 90 according to this the geochemical background of pb is part of the composition of mr as shows a statistical confidence level of 75 in the relationship with mr which implies that it may be part of the geochemical background of these rocks the analysis of contingency with paleogene rocks pr shows hypothesis rejection although this is generally weak table 7 according to the test the as shows a weaker relationship with pr than the other two elements the rejection resulting from the contingency analysis with neogene rocks nr is even greater than with pr table 7 in these results as is the element that most clearly rejects the hypothesis of the relationship with nr 4 6 contingency tables elements versus toc in general the three elements have an affinity with toc table 7 although as clearly shows a much higher number of coincidences than the other elements and always with 99 9 confidence values fig 15 sb has more coincidences than pb with factors f1 and f2 the example in fig 15 shows the spatial coincidences summarized in table 7 it highlights the coincidence in gwb with high contents in as that also show surface coincidence with the factors mapped in the soil in other sectors where as and toc factors correlate well the concentrations of as in gw must be checked as there is no information from these sectors about the gwb in this sense this mapping must be interpreted in terms of risk 4 7 contingency tables lithology versus toc the lithology with more affinity with ocd is pzr with statistical confidence values of up to 99 9 and secondly pr table 7 it should also be noted that the residual mr ok ratio is 99 9 and over 97 7 with f3 toc this means that the lithology that shows greatest affinity with the regional background of toc is mr at the other end is nr which rejects all hypotheses of association 4 8 contingency tables soil geochemistry versus water composition the relationship between as content in gwb and soil and geology is random table 7 the most significant affinity of sb is with ok sb of the soil over 50 it is somewhat lower in relation to the ok for the sb soil residues in relation to the lithology there is only a limited level of confidence with ptr which approaches 75 and with nr 50 the rest of the chi values are practically random finally pb only shows a 50 confidence level with nr the others are random 4 9 contingency tables water composition versus water composition the three elements in gwb show affinity to each other as pb of 90 and as sb and sb pb of 75 significant in all cases these results must be taken into account in the analysis of risks derived from water consumption when these elements are present in significant quantities the highest concentrations where as coincides with pb or sb are located inside the areas defined in fig 15 5 conclusions overall the main objectives of the study have been reached three scales of spatial variation have been determined and mapped it has been verified that toc has capacity of retaining metals depending on the kind of metal there is relationship between soil and groundwater composition and it depends on lithology and the studied element in particular 1 the proposed methodology for analyzing relationships between different variables is optimal this means that it is very useful for analyzing spatial relationships between different elements or characteristics of the environment either of natural or anthropic origin for the same reason it could be also applied in medical geology a possibility that has yet to be explored 2 the kriging and its multivariate version cokriging use a probabilistic framework that is needed for the spatial decomposition of the total variability in scales of spatial variation other interpolation methods that have been used in the past as alternatives are not valid for this purpose 3 the correlation between as pb sb and toc has revealed the existence of three scales of spatial variability which correspond to variogram structures with a range 5 km 35 km and 135 km the shortest scale of variation is related with local anomalies in relation to anthropic and natural ones the second component is related to both human activities and natural soil composition the long range component is related with geology and fractures located in the boundaries between areas with high metal content in soil composition and those with low content 4 the estimation of components by fck has an advantage over ordinary kriging with the result that relations between elements in soil and those in groundwater are better explained 5 contingency tables were used to check hypotheses and confirmed the relationship between as sb and pb in both soil and groundwater and the influence of scales of variation or factors on the concentration of elements and their interrelationships it has also been very useful for determining the degree of fixation of these elements in the toc as a metal sink it has been also confirmed the important role of lithology and even of certain faults in the spatial distribution of the elements and their influence on the three components or factors analyzed 6 accurate determination of the influence of human activities on soil and water requires more detailed information intensive studies nevertheless the methodology used can help to determine those areas in which there is greater probability of anthropic influence 7 the faults may be limits that conditioning the spatial distribution of elements but additional work in the future must be made 8 this method improves and simplifies more traditional approaches to environmental studies as complex as the one presented in this paper in addition information similar to that used in this paper is available in many countries which means that the methodology used is completely exportable the only drawback of this method is data preparation which is time consuming and often a tedious task acknowledgements this article have

7283,during the last years there has been an increasing interest in assessing health risks caused by exposure to contaminants found in soil air and water like heavy metals or emerging contaminants this work presents a study on the spatial patterns and interaction effects among relevant heavy metals sb as and pb that may occur together in different minerals total organic carbon toc have been analyzed too because it is an essential component in the regulatory mechanisms that control the amount of metal in soils even more exposure to these elements is associated with a number of diseases and environmental problems these metals can have both natural and anthropogenic origins a key component of any exposure study is a reliable model of the spatial distribution the elements studied a geostatistical analysis have been performed in order to show that selected metals are auto correlated and cross correlated and type and magnitude of such cross correlation varies depending on the spatial scale under consideration after identifying general trends we analyzed the residues left after subtracting the trend from the raw variables three scales of variability were identified compounds or factors with scales of 5 35 and 135 km the first factor f1 basically identifies anomalies of natural origin but in some places of anthropogenics origin as well the other two are related to geology f2 and f3 although f3 represents more clearly geochemical background related to large lithological groups likewise mapping of two major structures indicates that significant faults have influence on the distribution of the studied elements finally influence of soil and lithology on groundwater by means of contingency analysis was assessed keywords geostatistic groundwater heavy metal multiscale soil 1 introduction many geochemical variables show scale dependent spatial variability pardo igúzquiza and dowd 2002 its origin often lies in natural and anthropic factors affecting these variables porteous 1996 reimann and garrett 2005 blonda and valenzano 2014 have studied both sources of metals many natural variables are rarely available for every location therefore an interpolation method is needed to complete coverage maps geostatistical spatial models provide a probabilistic framework for data analysis and predictions that build on the joint spatial and temporal dependence between observations kyriakidis and journel 1999 geostatistical tools have been applied to the modelling of spatiotemporal distributions in many disciplines such as geochemistry imrie et al 2008 santos francés et al 2017a santos francés et al 2017b environmental sciences ecology and health dogru et al 2017 warnken et al 2017 among others geostatistics has been used to evaluate spatial variability of arsenic contamination in groundwater goovaerts et al 2005 gong et al 2014 other authors have studied multiscale variability semivariogram analysis suggests that complex spatial distribution of high level arsenic concentration in groundwater is a consequence of interactions among multiscale geological and geochemical processes karthik et al 2001 serre et al 2003 showed that most of variability in arsenic concentrations across bangladesh occurs within a distance of 2 km which makes spatial interpolation very challenging yu et al 2003 found that much of large scale 10 km variability in arsenic concentration is explained by geology and geomorphology while small scale 3 km variability is mainly due to variations in well depth being measured lower concentrations in deeper wells antimony arsenic and lead often occur in paragenesis with other metals depending upon geological conditions sediments with different degrees of enrichment are produced by erosion of parent materials however according to adriano 2001 common values for sb in soils are in the range 0 1 10 mg kg as fluctuates between 1 and 10 mg kg and pb between 10 and 30 mg kg moreover presence of toc influences geochemical processes that can lead to significant increases in content of these metals in both soil boluda 1988 bohn et al 1985 ramos miras et al 2014 wang and qin 2008 and groundwater which is often used for irrigation of horticultural products and urban water supply in general terms major natural and anthropogenic sources of heavy metals were found to derive from lithogenic origin transportation and atmospheric deposition among others but more multivariate statistical analysis for assessing heavy metal distribution in soils on a regional scale must are required hou et al 2017

exposure was associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk gong and o bryant 2012 the exposure to sb and pb is also associated to a number of diseases related with skin lungs kidneys hearth and abortions among others in general direct hazardous effects or potential risks to human health and ecosystem stability can be caused by transport and transformation among multi media schemes of heavy metal residues such as ambient air soil surface water sediments etc mitchell et al 2011 keshavarzi et al 2012 mckinley et al 2013 zeng et al 2009 generic reference levels grls for human health protection set up by a number of autonomous communities boe 2005 conama10 2010 have been taken into account in this study a comprehensive study on spatial distributions and source identification from soils in spain is presented identifying aquifers with anomalous values and its possible source as a reference water quality values established by who in 2011 arsenic 10 µgr l antimony 20 µgr l and lead 10 µgr l and groundwater quality standards applicable in spain rd 2011 based on european directives are used 25 µgr l for arsenic 7 2 µgr l and not available for antimony the main purpose of this work is to explore multi scale variability of elements in soil and establish relationship with groundwater composition by means of contingency analysis 2 methodology 2 1 data this work has been carry out with data surficial soil samples 20 cm depth from the geochemical atlas of spain locutura et al 2012 groundwater quality data were provided by the spanish ministry of the environment the sampling network assessed the quality of groundwater bodies according to the requirements of the ground water directives gwd although not all elements are studied in every groundwater body in this sense the spanish government has applied criteria such as the groundwater monitoring network shall be established in accordance with requirements of articles 7 and 8 of the aforementioned directives the monitoring network shall be designed to provide a coherent and comprehensive overview of groundwater chemical status within each river basin and to detect the presence of long term anthropogenically induced upward pollutants trends in total 8806 samples of as 2060 samples of sb and 4645 samples of pb have been studied most of the sampling points are wells used for water supply or farm supply and a low percentage are piezometers and springs mainland spain has a diverse fig 1 and complex geology vera 2004 http info igme es cartografia october 2015 this complex geology implies a wide variety of minerals in the iberian peninsula two main geological units are differentiated the western part constitutes the hercynian domain while the eastern part comprises the alpine domain and tertiary basins the hercynian domain consists of precambrian and paleozoic rocks prior to the permian period on the other hand the alpine domain consists of rocks and sediments generated during the mesozoic and tertiary it is therefore composed of young materials tectonically linked to the last orogeny in this latter domain the tertiary basins which act as sediments receptors during the tertiary are included moreover most metal ores deposits are located within the hercynian domain distributed among the following geotectonic areas cantabrian area characterized by having thick series of coal strata galicia trás os montes area differentiated by the existence of two poly metamorphic massifs mafic and ultramafic the accompanying formations are distinguished by the presence of acidic and basic volcanic rocks and granites high concentrations in chromium platinum copper nickel cobalt tin polymetallic sulphide and other elements can be found in this area central iberian zone in this unit the schist greywacke complex prevails there are also large areas of granitoids and even coal mines in this geotectonic zone there are important tungsten tin and precious metals mineralizations associated with arsenic and antimony ossa morena zone this unit is extremely complex centergranitic rocks similar in the north and the center dominate the northeast sector to the south the basic character of intrusions is gradually increased from gabbro to diorite and serpentinite in the northern and southern margins of this area tungsten and tin also chromium nickel cobalt and platinum can be found south portuguese zone this zone is characterized by the existence of a vulcan sedimentary complex the oldest geological formation contains phyllite and quartzite as well as acidic and basic volcanic rocks acidic volcanic rocks are the metallogeny of polymetallic massive sulphide iberian pyrite belt which is the most important metallogenic area of portugal cartography of main faults has been included as additional information to analyze its influence in spatial variation of selected variables 2 2 geostatistical tools geostatistics is nowadays considered as the standard technique for statistical analysis of spatial environmental data goovaerts 1997 wackernagel 2003 webster and oliver 2007 kriging and its multivariate version cokriging use a probabilistic framework that is needed for the spatial decomposition of total variability in scales of spatial variation as is used in pardo igúzquiza and dowd 2002 the set of spatial experimental values can be considered as realizations of a set z i u i 1 n of second order stationary random functions with autocorrelations and cross correlations or variogram and cross variograms and where the spatial variability is scale dependent for each pair of spatial environmental variables z i u z j u the cross variogram is defined as in chiles and delfiner 2012 γ ij h 1 2 e z i u z i u h z j u z j u h from experimental variograms it is possible to detect and model different scales of variability characterized by different variogram structures with different ranges this is the first objective of the methodology after the experimental variograms have been estimated the second objective is to fit theoretical models the lineal model of corregionalization lmc wackernagel 2003 is used for modeling the system of variograms and cross variograms or covariances and cross covariances a proportional covariance model is the simplest multivariate model used in geostatistics and is one in which all the variograms are proportional to a single variogram function γ ij h b ij γ h with symmetric coefficients b ij that define a positive definite matrix each variogram and semi variogram is represented as a sum of the same elementary variogram models γ ij h u 0 s b ij u γ u h the fitting of a model implies choosing the basic variogram models and the matrix b b ij a computer program for fitting the lmc by using the procedure described by goulard and voltz 1992 may be found in pardo igúzquiza and dowd 2002 the third objective is to estimate the different scales of variability related to different ranges observed in the experimental variograms and cross variograms thus each variable z i u i 1 n can be thought of as being generated by the superposition of s 1 spatially uncorrelated components z i s u s 0 s z i x s 0 s z i s u m i with e z i u m i e z i s u 0 cov z i s u z i s u h c ij s h if s t 0 otherwise the s thm component of the i thm variable z i s u can be estimated at any non sampled location by using factorial cokriging fck goovaerts 1997 chiles and delfiner 1999 pardo igúzquiza and dowd 2002 the fck estimator is given by z p 0 s 0 u 0 i 1 n α 1 n i ω i α z i u α where the weights ω i α are obtained by solving the system of fck j 1 n β 1 n j ω j β c ij u α u β μ i c ip 0 u 0 u α u 0 β 1 n i ω i β 0 i 1 n α 1 n i µi lagrange multiplier cij uα uβ spatial covariance for the distance vector hαβ uα uβ between the i thm and j thm variables c ip 0 u 0 u α u 0 u0 component covariance between the i thm and p0 thm variables and for the distance vector hα0 uα u0 there is also the possibility of estimating a factor by using a cokriging estimator y p 0 s 0 u 0 i 1 n α 1 n i ω i α z i u α by solving the corresponding system of equations wackernagel 2003 the fck application has two main advantages a it determines the correlation between different variables and uses a common model to estimate variables in the area under investigation in this case if there is an information deficit in one of them estimation can be completed using spatial correlation with the other variables b differentiated structures in the adjusted models of variograms can be mapped separately in this way anomalies can be mapped and the geochemical background of the study area can be identified 2 3 contingency tables a contingency analysis to verify spatial relationship between pairs of variables has been done to do this a grid of 4 km 4 km was established to compare pairs of variables within the cell and their relationship with lithology relationship with lithology was defined comparing association between lithology and decile 90 finally the chi square statistic is calculated with the following expression x 2 n 1 n 1 e 2 n 2 n 2 e 2 n 3 n 3 e 2 n 4 n 4 e 2 n 1 e n 2 e n 3 e n 4 e chi square x2 with 1 freedom degree shows association with a level of confidence table 1 3 case study sample distribution of raw soil data is shown in fig 1 concentration statistics for as mg kg pb mg kg sb mg kg and toc in percentage are presented in table 2 these parameters were collected at 20 cm depth table 2 statistics of studied parameters c v common values of elements mg kg adriano 2001 na not available the mean toc value in the studied area is 2 6 located in the northern and mountainous wooded areas more humid in general the 1 of toc is a threshold which is established as a desertification limit loveland and webb 2003 values below this limit are condensed in the southern half of the study area and in the central parts of duero and ebro basins the range of variation is large table 2 and mean values are close to grls for human health protection established by a number of spanish autonomous communities rd 2005 conama10 2010 due to the fact that grls are not defined throughout spain the most restrictive conama10 2010 were selected as the standard these are 6 mg kg for sb 30 mg kg for as and 60 mg kg for pb according to adriano 2001 common values for sb in soils are in the range 0 1 10 mg kg as fluctuates between 1 and 10 mg kg and pb between 10 and 30 mg kg the mean contents of as pb and sb in soils table 2 are within the range established by adriano 2001 but as and pb are close to the upper limit in general the highest sb values are located in paleozoic formations values above 6 mg kg can also be found in industrialized areas in northern and central spain and agricultural land in the east values are lower in plutonic igneous rocks as well as in sedimentary basins filled with these materials concentrations are also lower in carbonate terrains arsenic values of over 30 mg kg can be found in paleozoic formations across the study area this grl reference is shown in many industrial sectors in large parts of northern central and eastern spain the concentration in soils is greater than the grl it is worth mentioning that as values of over 100 mg kg can be found in both industrial and agricultural soils with regard to grl of pb values of over 30 mg kg can be found in paleozoic terrains mining areas and industrial sectors in northern central and eastern parts of the iberian peninsula the presence of pb in agricultural areas of the duero and segura basins is remarkable nevertheless the highest values can be found in addition to mining regions where pb is the main ore in the aforementioned industrial areas the 10 mg kg limit is present in more than 90 of the samples in many parts of the study area as regards toc pb is the element with the largest match of high values this is followed by as and finally sb for all three elements a good cartographic match exists between the presence of clay and high sb as and pb content 3 1 groundwater quality data since the water framework directive wfd came into force networks have expanded in terms of both the number of sampling points and the parameters analyzed at each control station it is important to make clear that not all the parameters are analyzed in every groundwater body gwb table 3 shows main statistics of studied elements in groundwater as regards the metals studied since the enforcement of wfd official control networks show that there were around 700 readings in excess of 25 µgr l the maximum as concentration set by the environmental quality standard rd 2011 these high values are concentrated in the duero and tajo river basins there were also 1250 readings in exceedance 10 µgr l who 2011 almost 1000 readings found more than 7 2 µgr l of lead rd 2011 and more than 600 had over 10 µgr l who 2011 although these values are concentrated in the center and east they can also be observed scattered across the whole study area as regards sb there are no official quality standards although the who 2011 suggests 20 µgr l as reference level more than 2200 readings go beyond this value 3 2 geostatistical analyses due to the large bias of data distribution it was decided to apply a logarithmic transformation base 10 to the concentration of the selected elements in soil table 2 table 4 shows the adjusted parameters from the direct variogram model and variograms adjusted on the residuals are presented in table 5 the fundamental difference between variograms adjusted for the original variable and the residuals is observed mainly in the ranges which are larger in the latter in figs 2 5 the estimation ordinary kriging ok for the studied variables according to adjusted variogram models spherical in all cases is showed each element shows a different drift figs 6a d from low values blue color to high values red color figs 7a d shows the estimation of residuals once eliminated the drift in all cases we observed that the spatial distribution of the residue is very similar to the estimate for the variable 3 3 corregionalization models as stated calculated residuals were analyzed in the first step the models were optimized and the ranges for the linear model of coregionalization were set at 5000 m 35 000 m and 135 000 m correlation between the variables was examined in order to perform a cokriging of each one in relation to the others table 6 3 4 factorial cokriging this procedure allowed to co estimate each residual depending on its correlation with the others every component of the variogram short medium and long range was estimated in this way separating components it is easier to detect anomalies using the short range medium range can uncover more extensive anomalies but can also be part of the natural geochemical background lastly long range is mainly related to the geochemical background fig 8a represents the short range f1 of toc and clearly shows the highest and lowest values for the three compounds such fast variations are logical in this component the focus of interest of such high values is the fact that they can be associated with metal sinks the high toc values detected in some sectors of the sedimentary basins and especially in the duero river basin are noticeable the medium range f2 of toc fig 8b confirms the anomalies observed of the short range and greater continuity of the variable is perceived in some sectors in relation to its regional distribution when compared to ok fig 7a f2toc varies between 0 7 and 1 9 and is probably part of the variable background it represents a model of transition to f3toc the long range f3 reveals the background value of toc fig 8c and roughly indicates the same maximum and minimum areas as fig 7a however it provides more detail about the regional variability in a way diffused to some extent in the ok of this variable in this case the range of dark blue color corresponds to toc values below the 1 desertification limit loveland and webb 2003 this makes it easier to define desertified areas as classified using this parameter to verify the results of the method the three factors of estimated toc and the drift were added together if the sum is similar to the ok for the toc this means that the method has been correctly applied in all cases the results have been optimal fig 9a shows f1sb where the highest values in red are related to lithology paleozoic rocks and to a lesser extent to industrial and agricultural areas this factor shows the highest values of the three compounds as expected a rapid increase in spatial variability is observed in different parts of the study area if the proposed value of 6 mg kg conama10 2010 is considered 0 778 in terms of logarithm values the limit value is surpassed at five points in paleozoic rocks in the south cartography of f2sb fig 9b shows good correlation with lithology of the study area fig 1 although high values are also shown in some sectors of the detrital basins geochemical background plays an important role in this factor except in some points in the north and northeast where there are industrial areas f3sb fig 9c defines the geochemical background and points to paleozoic as the lithology with the highest concentrations it is also noticed that in some sectors the distribution of sb may be influenced by faults fig 9b most of the range of variation of the three mapped factors of as falls within the limits indicated by adriano 2001 f1as fig 10a varies from 0 03 to 9 98 mg kg high values of this factor are more than twice those estimated with f2as and f3as the rapid increase in the variability of this factor defines areas where there are major anomalies of natural origin furthermore although estimated values of this factor are far from the maximum showed in fig 4 there is a high degree of overlap between the areas where maximum values appear some of these high values are in the detrital duero basin where high values of as have been detected mapping f2as fig 10b shows a range between 0 3 mg kg and 3 54 mg kg maximum values of this factor are related to paleozoic and plutonic rocks plutonic rocks in the central sector show high values of as concentration with abrupt changes towards the northern detrital depressions rapid changes may be related in some cases to the presence of faults high values are also observed in quaternary detrital basins f3as fig 10c has values between 0 8 and 1 1 mg kg and defines major structures and alignments more clearly some sectors in quaternary detrital basins also show high values likewise some outcrops of jurassic cretaceous rocks show high values of sb related to f2as and f3as overall the spatial distribution of this factor is related to geochemical background values below the usual ones in soils adriano 2001 were estimated for all components of pb f1pb fig 11a ranges from 0 01 to 14 2 mg kg and shows higher values compared to the other ones many peak values match paleozoic rocks and to a lesser extent jurassic cretaceous in some sectors high values are observed in quaternary detrital rocks where some kind of economic activity takes place f2pb fig 11b shows a distribution of maximum and minimum similar to f1pb some quaternary detritus show important values in some cases related to industrial activity and in others to wetlands or topographically lower zones mapped values with this component vary between 0 4 and 3 mg kg f3pb fig 11c shows a range of variation between 0 6 and 1 8 mg kg this component represents the geochemical background for the studied area in some sectors faults may condition pb distribution 4 discussion and results 4 1 trend trend maps fig 6 show the overall fluctuations of the variables in the studied area the toc map fig 6a captures a clear increasing of percentages from the southern more dry to northern rainier sb map show two sectors with high values related with paleozoic outcrops located in the southern and northeastern fig 6b the spatial distribution of as fig 6c exhibit high values in the northwestern related with plutonic rocks and a wide central sector with low concentration towards eastern there is a slight increase related with mesozoic terrains while little plutonic outcrops located in the northeastern it produces an increase of the trend in conclusion pb has showed more similarity with as distribution the outcrops of plutonic rocks located in northwestern and southeastern have higher influence in the mapped trend fig 6d 4 2 fck relationship between the spatial variability of sb as and pb and geology according to fig 3 sb high values 2 5 mg kg are concentrated in paleozoic rocks broadly the three estimated factors figs 9a c show the highest values of sb in paleozoic rocks besides f1sb fig 9a shows values above 2 mg kg in jurassic and cretaceous zones and sedimentary basins moreover in a few points north and northeast concentrations observed in the could be due to industrial activities estimated values of f2sb fig 9b are part of the background of rocks from the triassic and older except in some parts of the sedimentary basins overall the distribution of values for this component is more consistent with hypothesis regarding natural origin of the element the f3sb fig 9c shows a close relationship with paleozoic rocks especially with proterozoic and cambrian devonian and to a lesser extent with neogene volcanic rocks rocks from the jurassic cretaceous have values of less than 1 5 mg kg similar values around 1 5 mg kg were also observed in some areas of neogene basins moreover there are clear lineaments running nw especially in materials from the cambrian devonian in this sense it is easy to see how faults also influence the distribution of sb in some sectors fig 4 shows that as is concentrated in paleozoic formations with jurassic cretaceous formations in the iberian range in second position 50 mg kg high values were also observed in certain outcrops of plutonic rocks in the center of the study area as one might expect the sedimentary basins filled with material from these outcrops are rich in arsenic by contrast large areas of detrital neogene and jurassic cretaceous in the south have low values highest concentrations are found in detrital formations on the east coast and in the northwest part of the duero river basin it is also observed that low values are more common in rocks from the cambrian devonian age f1as fig 10a confirms the distribution of anomalies in the rocks mentioned and shows that as values are also high in industrial areas of northeastern spain in addition concentration of these values in the northern coastal strip is particularly significant duero and guadalquivir basins show high as values 2 mg kg mapped values of f2as fig 10b can be considered part of the geochemical background maximum values are located in relation with as rich rocks and in industrial zones the most remarkable feature of the estimate of f3as fig 10c is that it represents geochemical background as explained by the fact that its distribution pattern resembles the great lithological units there is a notable coincidence between observed alignments in mapping f3as fig 10c and the geology fig 1 especially in cambrian devonian materials similarly in sedimentary basins especially in the duero basin graben like sectors not directly related to lithology are defined however faults and other tectonic accidents could themselves determine distribution of as in the above sectors in some cases rapid transitions between low and high values of this component can be observed in line with faults distribution of as in the estimate made by ok is conditioned by lithology while f3as seems to be much more influenced by tectonic structures faults the estimated values of pb fig 5 are concentrated on hercynian and permo triassic rocks in the southern half jurassic and cretaceous rocks in the north also show large areas with high values of pb as well as detrital terrains located in the coastal strip of the eastern sector fig 11a shows the estimate f1pb there is higher concentration of positive anomalies in cambrian devonian rocks of the southern half and in permian triassic rocks also in the south other anomalies are related to industrial areas in the north and south of spain there are also anomalies in some agricultural areas of the duero basin tajo basin eastern spain and southeast spain the agreement in some sectors of f2pb fig 11b with outcrops of cambrian devonian age can be observed in the south of the study area moreover some of the elongated morphologies observed match both cambrian devonian and jurassic cretaceous outcrops in some cases these outcrops have significant influence on neighboring deposits of the neogene in the rest of the study area maxima exhibit more circular shapes this factor can include values that may be due to both geochemical background and pollution f3pb fig 11c has a similar distribution to major lithological units however faults or equivalent structures also may act as boundaries of a part of the estimated maxima in some cases faults coincide with areas of rapid variations between minima and maxima values 4 3 fck and chemical groundwater composition 4 3 1 antimony according to who 2011 the overall exposure to antimony from environmental sources food and drinking water is very low compared with occupational exposure even more is a priority environmental contaminant relatively poorly studied warnken et al 2017 unlike other elements sb has not been analyzed in all groundwater bodies fig 12 shows points where sb is above 0 001 μg l there are two groups aquifers with values just above the detection limit and those with values below detection limit in general this element is found in detrital aquifers however most part of high values occur in aquifers where there is also a high value in soil and where important industrial activity is taking place on the surface on the gwb siose 2011 the guideline value for this element is 20 μg l values above this level were found at scattered points throughout the ebro river basin and the central study area the relationship between high values of the three factors and high values in groundwater bodies decreases from f1sb to f3sb likewise an analysis shows that anthropic activity decreases from f1sb to f3sb 4 3 2 arsenic as is usually present at concentrations less than 1 2 μg l in natural waters although concentrations may be quite high up to 12 mg l in areas containing natural sources in groundwater however where there are sulphide mineral and sedimentary deposits derived from volcanic rocks concentrations can be significantly higher in places where concentration of arsenic in drinking water is 10 μg l or greater this will be the dominant source of intake who 2011 in general terms high values of as in soil match gwb with values of 10 μg l or more fig 13 nevertheless higher values of arsenic over 10 mg l can be found in gwbs in the duero river basin where concentrations in soil are low less than 15 mg kg in the central area of the river basin though maximum values of f1as are not very high 5 mg kg there is a high match between high as content in gwb and maximum values of f1as in more than half of the groundwater quality control records the tajo river basin shows a similar situation but as values in gwb and soil are less than in the duero river basin in spite of this in the duero river basin and part of the coastal detrital aquifers in eastern spain a lower correlation between soil and groundwater can be observed however in these areas anthropic activity is quite important and may be the source of as in gwb overall f2as was less correlated with high as values in gwbs the duero river basin shows the highest f2as values but these are less than 1 7 mg kg in gwb where as concentration is higher f3as enables identification of sectors where groundwater is more influenced by geochemical background for example the duero river basin shows areas with a high concentration of f3as in soil and a high concentration of as in gwb from this perspective the occurrence of low values in soil at the same time as high values in groundwater could indicate the influence of industrial activities or groundwater exploitation capable of influencing the chemical equilibrium of as 4 3 3 lead lead concentration in groundwater vary from 1 µg l to 60 µg l in europe who 2011 generally the pb content in soil in detrital basins is low but on occasions concentrations in groundwater can exceed 10 μg l values above 10 μg l who 2011 are concentrated in the center and east fig 14 but they can also be observed in other parts of the study area from fig 14 it can be concluded that the best correlation between high values of soil and groundwater takes place in some points of the northern in the center of the study area and in some points in eastern spain less than 120 points in aquifers related to metamorphic and volcanic rocks high values of pb concur in soil and groundwater in detrital coastal aquifers in the east pb content is high in line with soil concentrations it should be noted that this area is an important industrial center and that various metals were mined there in the past siose 2011 in f1pb and f2pb a good correlation between high values in soil and in the underlying aquifer is observed especially as concentration in soil increases the lowest concentration of pb is found in sectors where f3pb has lower concentrations this is especially evident in aquifers with little or no influence from volcanic or metamorphic materials if the least common element is take as a reference where sb appears as and pb are also present in aquifers in the center of the study area there are many points with high values of as and pb this coincidence is greater when there are high concentrations of positive anomalies of both elements especially in the vicinity of outcrops of volcanic and metamorphic rocks 4 4 contingency tables correlation of studied elements in soil the chi square test table 7 was made from the estimation mesh in total 30 817 cells this method aims to count the number of points where both variables show high values and establish the confidence level on the relationship between them in all three cases association between values for metals above 90th percentile estimated by ok shows confidence values over 99 9 of the different associations the one with the highest number of matches is ok as ok sb followed close behind by ok pb ok sb the drift shows high correlation between as and pb while as and sb repel and the relationship between pb and sb is random i e chi around zero in all three cases association of the residual ok is over 99 9 with a higher number of coincidences compared when the ok of the raw variable is analyzed association between f1 values in all three cases shows a confidence of over 99 9 with very similar number of matches in the three pairs the confidence level of the test performed for f2 and f3 was also over 99 9 in both cases there are more coincidences in the as pb ratio especially in f2 10 times more coincidences this analysis indicates a high degree of affinity between the three elements in general the relationship between as and pb is stronger in factors f2 and f3 when analyzing estimates of ok in f2 and f3 the three elements have a closer relationship than when analyzed in f1 this suggests that the factors affecting the relationship between these elements are linked to the geochemical background 4 5 contingency tables lithology versus soil concentration contingency tables have been used too to test for significant differences in soil concentration depending on lithology table 7 the lithology has been splitted into six categories plutonic pr paleozoic pzr permo triassic ptr jurassic cretaceous mr paleogene pgr and neogene nr as in the previous analysis a mesh with 30 817 soil composition data estimated by ok and the three calculated factors was used in general the relationship between plutonic rocks pr and the three elements studied shows a higher chi square value with as the relation with ok as and the drift is over 99 9 whereas with the rest of the components it is less than 90 pr sb shows rejection in all relations with values close to those for random behavior the pr pb ratio is statistically low with only the drift above 75 in paleozoic rocks pzr the element with greatest affinity is sb table 7 except for the drift the confidence level of the hypothesis is over 99 9 followed by pb and then as note that f2 and specially f3 represent the geochemical background sb shows much higher affinity with pzr than the other elements the relation of the three elements with permotriassic rocks ptr is practically random table 5 only the drift in pb shows a confidence value of over 75 and with the drift at 99 9 the contingency analysis indicates that there is rejection in the association of the three elements with mesozoic rocks mr with no affinity table 7 only the relationship between mr f3 pb has a confidence level of over 90 according to this the geochemical background of pb is part of the composition of mr as shows a statistical confidence level of 75 in the relationship with mr which implies that it may be part of the geochemical background of these rocks the analysis of contingency with paleogene rocks pr shows hypothesis rejection although this is generally weak table 7 according to the test the as shows a weaker relationship with pr than the other two elements the rejection resulting from the contingency analysis with neogene rocks nr is even greater than with pr table 7 in these results as is the element that most clearly rejects the hypothesis of the relationship with nr 4 6 contingency tables elements versus toc in general the three elements have an affinity with toc table 7 although as clearly shows a much higher number of coincidences than the other elements and always with 99 9 confidence values fig 15 sb has more coincidences than pb with factors f1 and f2 the example in fig 15 shows the spatial coincidences summarized in table 7 it highlights the coincidence in gwb with high contents in as that also show surface coincidence with the factors mapped in the soil in other sectors where as and toc factors correlate well the concentrations of as in gw must be checked as there is no information from these sectors about the gwb in this sense this mapping must be interpreted in terms of risk 4 7 contingency tables lithology versus toc the lithology with more affinity with ocd is pzr with statistical confidence values of up to 99 9 and secondly pr table 7 it should also be noted that the residual mr ok ratio is 99 9 and over 97 7 with f3 toc this means that the lithology that shows greatest affinity with the regional background of toc is mr at the other end is nr which rejects all hypotheses of association 4 8 contingency tables soil geochemistry versus water composition the relationship between as content in gwb and soil and geology is random table 7 the most significant affinity of sb is with ok sb of the soil over 50 it is somewhat lower in relation to the ok for the sb soil residues in relation to the lithology there is only a limited level of confidence with ptr which approaches 75 and with nr 50 the rest of the chi values are practically random finally pb only shows a 50 confidence level with nr the others are random 4 9 contingency tables water composition versus water composition the three elements in gwb show affinity to each other as pb of 90 and as sb and sb pb of 75 significant in all cases these results must be taken into account in the analysis of risks derived from water consumption when these elements are present in significant quantities the highest concentrations where as coincides with pb or sb are located inside the areas defined in fig 15 5 conclusions overall the main objectives of the study have been reached three scales of spatial variation have been determined and mapped it has been verified that toc has capacity of retaining metals depending on the kind of metal there is relationship between soil and groundwater composition and it depends on lithology and the studied element in particular 1 the proposed methodology for analyzing relationships between different variables is optimal this means that it is very useful for analyzing spatial relationships between different elements or characteristics of the environment either of natural or anthropic origin for the same reason it could be also applied in medical geology a possibility that has yet to be explored 2 the kriging and its multivariate version cokriging use a probabilistic framework that is needed for the spatial decomposition of the total variability in scales of spatial variation other interpolation methods that have been used in the past as alternatives are not valid for this purpose 3 the correlation between as pb sb and toc has revealed the existence of three scales of spatial variability which correspond to variogram structures with a range 5 km 35 km and 135 km the shortest scale of variation is related with local anomalies in relation to anthropic and natural ones the second component is related to both human activities and natural soil composition the long range component is related with geology and fractures located in the boundaries between areas with high metal content in soil composition and those with low content 4 the estimation of components by fck has an advantage over ordinary kriging with the result that relations between elements in soil and those in groundwater are better explained 5 contingency tables were used to check hypotheses and confirmed the relationship between as sb and pb in both soil and groundwater and the influence of scales of variation or factors on the concentration of elements and their interrelationships it has also been very useful for determining the degree of fixation of these elements in the toc as a metal sink it has been also confirmed the important role of lithology and even of certain faults in the spatial distribution of the elements and their influence on the three components or factors analyzed 6 accurate determination of the influence of human activities on soil and water requires more detailed information intensive studies nevertheless the methodology used can help to determine those areas in which there is greater probability of anthropic influence 7 the faults may be limits that conditioning the spatial distribution of elements but additional work in the future must be made 8 this method improves and simplifies more traditional approaches to environmental studies as complex as the one presented in this paper in addition information similar to that used in this paper is available in many countries

7284,the hydrological community often turns to widely available spatial datasets such as the nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo to characterize the spatial variability of soil properties when used to spatially characterize and parameterize watershed models this has served as a reasonable first approximation when lacking localized or incomplete soil data within agriculture soil data has been left relatively coarse when compared to numerous other data sources measured this is because localized soil sampling is both expensive and time intense thus a need exists in better connecting spatial datasets with ground observations given that hydrogeophysics is data dense rapid non invasive and relatively easy to adopt it is a promising technique to help dovetail localized soil sampling with spatially exhaustive datasets in this work we utilize two common near surface geophysical methods cosmic ray neutron probe and electromagnetic induction to identify temporally stable spatial patterns of measured geophysical properties in three 65 ha agricultural fields in western nebraska this is achieved by repeat geophysical observations of the same study area across a range of wet to dry field conditions in order to evaluate with an empirical orthogonal function shallow cores were then extracted within each identified zone and water retention functions were generated in the laboratory using eof patterns as a covariate we quantify the predictive skill of estimating soil hydraulic properties in areas without measurement using a bootstrap validation analysis results indicate that sampling locations informed via repeat hydrogeophysical surveys required only five cores to reduce the cross validation root mean squared error by an average of 64 as compared to soil parameters predicted by a commonly used benchmark ssurgo and rosetta the reduction to five strategically located samples within the 65 ha fields reduces sampling efforts by up to 90 as compared to the common practice of soil grid sampling every 1 ha keywords hydrogeophysics cosmic ray neutron probe soil water content soil hydraulic properties van genuchten parameters 1 introduction soil spatial datasets are important in different contexts for instance the hydrological community often turns to widely available datasets such as the nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo soil survey staff 2016 to characterize the spatial variability of soil across a field watershed or landscape of interest when used to spatially characterize and parameterize watershed models e g soil and water assessment tool neitsch et al 2002 this approach has served as a reasonable first approximation when lacking localized soil data within agriculture soil information plays a key role in the effort to increase efficiency in water and nutrient use and in this effort an ever increasing amount of information is being collected by farming implements e g seed planters weed sprayers and yield monitors however in both use cases watershed modeling and farming operations soil information is often either left qualitative or informed from ssurgo as localized soil sampling is both expensive and time intense particularly as average farm size continues to increase in the usa given that hydrogeophysical methods are data dense rapid non invasive and relatively easy to adopt they are valuable approaches to help dovetail localized soil sampling with spatially exhaustive datasets binley et al 2015 indeed much work has been done to refine large scale surveys i e ssurgo as well as to identify and delineate smaller scale soil units doolittle and brevik 2014 parsekian et al 2015 in order to parameterize watershed models one common practice is to combine ssurgo data e g texture and bulk density with a pedotransfer function ptf like rosetta schaap et al 2001 to generate the required soil hydraulic parameters while serving as a reasonable first approximation this can be problematic for several reasons first soil properties provided by ssurgo e g texture and bulk density often are sourced from a limited number of soil cores extracted within a county land use and other local factors are well known to impact soil properties on the field to subfield level blanco canqui and lal 2007 cambardella et al 1994 second ssurgo zones are often delineated with covariates that are not necessarily causally linked with soil hydraulic properties for instance vegetation differences observed from aerial photographs are not necessarily the result of soil hydraulic properties driving differences in soil water content swc but rather differences may be due to soil chemical properties cation exchange capacity ph etc lastly soil properties may be gradational within a ssurgo zone due to topography driven soil formational processes moore et al 1993 as opposed to steep transitions soil water content is well known to govern key hydrological processes runoff infiltration irrigation drainage etc within agriculture swc is being aggressively monitored and managed irmak et al 2010 across large areas and on a spatial scale finer than most current watershed models neitsch et al 2002 this is in part due to water conservation regulation motivating farm management operations to reduce irrigation pumping volumes butler et al 2016 in need of finer scale information additional information such as apparent electrical conductivity eca and topography are commercially produced and or utilized to create irrigation management zones for producers in areas with similar eca or elevation soil properties are assumed to be reasonably similar and efforts are focused on sampling areas with variations however these covariates often produce noisy relationships with swc patterns in part due to eca being a function of not just swc but also soil physical properties solute concentration and temperature haghverdi et al 2015 rodríguez pérez et al 2011 samouelian et al 2005 zhu et al 2010 mapping eca over a range of temperature and swc can lead to different maps due to these confounding factors mccutcheon et al 2006 zhu et al 2010 despite this the industry standard remains to produce one map per field here we survey over a range of conditions and then statistically contextualize the observed relative differences in the measured geophysical property throughout the field based on our knowledge that soil migration formation processes and soil water content redistribution often follow the same topographic gradients albeit on different timescales minasny and mcbratney 2016 we hypothesize that the time series of high resolution geophysical measurements will provide the opportunity to derive high resolution spatial maps of soil hydraulic properties which may later be used in more accurate quantitative modeling of soil water fluxes previous work has shown swc patterns to be good predictors of soil physical properties korres et al 2010 pedrera parrilla et al 2016 and while these soil physical properties are often correlated with soil hydraulic parameters patil and singh 2016 vereecken et al 2010 wosten et al 2001 a gap exists in explicitly linking spatial swc patterns and soil hydraulic parameters addressing this gap will likely better constrain flux estimates as a wide range of fluxes can occur within a single soil textural class groenendyk et al 2015 in order to approximate and quantify the spatial pattern of the time history of swc we utilize two common hydrogeophysical methods swc measured via a cosmic ray neutron probe crnp and apparent bulk electrical conductivity eca measured by electromagnetic induction emi these measurements were taken over a wide range of swc conditions in order to utilize an empirical orthogonal function eof with the purpose of identifying temporally stable sub field less than 1 km2 spatial patterns our study site consisted of three 65 ha agricultural fields located on the western fringe of the united states corn belt in the state of nebraska this selected study area is an ideal location for testing our hypothesis in a real world setting for three reasons 1 the fields are located in a river valley where soil units are often heterogeneous and create complex patterns due to fluvial formational processes 2 the proximity to the river valley makes the fields highly utilized for commercial agriculture via sprinkler irrigation 3 given the aridity of the region and demand for water resources precision agriculture techniques are actively being tested and adopted for optimizing irrigation management this natural resource dependent socio economic environment is a critical location for demonstrating the validity and utility of these approaches the primary objectives of this study are to 1 identify temporally stable spatial patterns using hydrogeophysical methods and statistical techniques 2 measure and compare water retention functions of soil cores extracted from the range of identified swc regions that are relatively wet average and dry and 3 quantify and benchmark the skill of using identified swc patterns as a covariate to predict soil hydraulic parameters the objectives were carried out on three fields with varying soil types and topography in the study region of western nebraska results of this analysis are then compared to water retention functions determined from a standard and widely used benchmark ssurgo and rosetta lastly a framework for carrying out these objectives in novel environments is presented specifying the likely number of hydrogeophysical maps and soil cores needed 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study sites the study area is located in western nebraska where the south platte river enters the state fig 1 n 41 007 w 102 192 the three study sites are each approximately 65 ha and 10 km apart primarily under irrigated maize production the study area is semi arid where annual crop referenced maize evapotranspiration etc is significantly higher than precipitation p hprcc 2016 the 10 year average annual p is 440 mm yr and average annual etc is 820 mm yr as measured by the high plains regional climate center weather station hprcc 2016 located within the study area near brule nebraska data obtained from ssurgo soil survey staff 2016 indicates that soil texture in the area falls within two usda textural classes sandy loam and loam lidar elevation rasters at 1 m resolution for each field were obtained from the usgs usgs 2016 using the elevation data relative elevation was calculated by subtracting the lowest elevation in the field from all elevations in order to investigate the influence of local topography 2 2 near surface hydrogeophysics 2 2 1 electromagnetic induction between march 2016 and may 2017 a minimum of three hydrogeophysical surveys were collected at each of the three study sites using an all terrain vehicle atv see table 1 for exact dates of data collection bulk electrical conductivity eca maps were collected using a dualem 21s electrical magnetic induction emi sensor dualem milton canada the emi sensor has dual geometry receivers at separations of 1 and 2 1 m from the transmitter which provided four simultaneous depth estimates of eca ms m 1 every second dualem inc 2013 here we use the sensor with an exploration depth of 1 m the emi boom was towed behind an atv on a plastic sled at speeds of 8 15 km hr 1 with 8 10 row spacing 7 9 m taking about 90 min to complete each survey a hemisphere gps xf101 dgps juniper systems inc logan ut unit recorded the location of each measurement following basic quality assurance and quality control of the raw eca data franz et al 2011 a spatial map with 5 by 5 m resolution was created using an inverse distance weighting procedure we note here that temporal differences in eca mapping stem from soil temperature swc and soil solute concentration franz et al 2015 robinson et al 2009 swc has been shown to account for approximately 50 of this variability brevik et al 2006 we take advantage of this fact here to use changes in eca as an indicator of relative change in swc spatial patterns 2 2 2 cosmic ray neutron probe the mobile crnp has been used to quantify spatial patterns of swc across a range of spatial scales from transects across the state of hawaii to mesoscale maps around tucson arizona and central nebraska chrisman and zreda 2013 desilets et al 2010 franz et al 2015 here we use the mobile crnp to map the spatial variability of swc within each 65 ha field over relatively short time periods 1 5 h using the same atv and collection pattern as described above we also note that minimal vegetation present at the time of sampling 0 5 kg m2 due to crop planting and harvest schedules on site the mobile crnp records epithermal neutron intensity integrated over one minute counting intervals the change in epithermal neutron intensity is inversely correlated to the mass of hydrogen in the measurement volume zreda et al 2012 the authors note that swc changes are by far the largest change in hydrogen mass mcjannet et al 2014 numerous validation studies across the globe bogena et al 2013 franz et al 2016 2011 hawdon et al 2014 have shown the crnp to have area average measurement accuracies of root mean square errors rmse less than 0 03 cm3 cm 3 against a variety of industry standard swc point scale probes the measurement volume is roughly a disk with a 130 250 m radius and a penetration depth of 0 15 0 40 m köhli et al 2015 depending on local conditions e g elevation water vapor soil water content etc for simplicity a constant penetration depth of 0 3 m was assumed for all surveys in order to provide a swc map first a spatial map of neutron intensity was estimated then a calibration function was applied following details in franz et al 2015 for use in agricultural fields we note that if spatial patters are of only of interest then the spatial neutron field could be used directly however the quantitative difference in swc patterns may provide insight to the investigator to decide if differences between surveys are meaningful whereas differences in neutron counts may be opaque the neutron intensity map is created in two steps first a drop in the bucket preprocessing step is applied chan et al 2014 where a dense grid is generated here 20 by 20 m and all raw data points are found within a certain radius here 50 m then the average of all raw data found within the search radius is assigned to the grid center this oversampling approach is necessary for sharpening the image quality and is a common strategy used in remote sensing analyses chan et al 2014 when overlapping area average observations are collected as is the case with the crnp in this study next an inverse distance weighted approach is used on the resampled 20 m grid to provide the 5 m neutron intensity estimate finally the neutron intensity gridded estimate is converted to swc following franz et al 2015 the authors refer the reader to the rapidly growing crnp literature see andreasen et al 2017 zreda et al 2012 in lieu of providing full details of the methodology here 2 3 soil hydraulic property measurement in each field up to 18 soil cores were extracted at locations that encompassed the range of variability determined by the geophysical surveys and elevation see supplementary data ds02 for core locations the sampling strategy was informed based of visual inspection of the maps eof and elevation and sample locations were prioritized based on 1 ensuring that the numerical scale of each data source had at least three locations sampled in the high low and mid values 2 areas were avoided near known disturbances in soil e g irrigation recirculation pits center pivot roads and 3 large areas with similar eof values were prioritized over small areas with significant variability these cores were undisturbed and extracted at a depth of 20 cm inside a steel cylinder of volume 250 cm3 with a height of 5 cm ums gmbh munich germany cores were placed in cold storage 4 c until they were sampled in the laboratory water retention data was determined using two decagon devices a hyprop and a wp4c to cover a wide range of soil tension values the combination of both devices has been shown to produce reasonably continuous water retention data for a range of soil textures schelle et al 2013 the hyprop is a benchtop evaporation system that produces continuous measurement of both swc and soil tension from saturation pf 0 to a pf of 3 where pf is the log10 of the absolute value of soil tension in units of cm the wp4c utilizes the chilled mirror technique gee et al 1992 scanlon et al 2002 and has a measurement range from pf 3 to pf 6 which was used to measure two points near a pf of 4 2 typically one below and one above water retention data was fit using the constrained van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat measurements were taken on the same core using a decagon ksat device under falling head soil bulk densities were taken after soil hydraulic parameters were measured by dividing the dried mass dried at 105 c for 24 h by the known volume of the core saturated water contents θs cm3 cm 3 were calculated by 1 θ s 1 ρ s ρ g where ρ s was measured soil dry bulk density g cm 3 and ρ g is mineral grain density assumed here as 2 65 g cm 3 because θs is a direct conversion of bulk density only bulk density will be correlated with environmental covariates hereafter although bulk density can be a dynamic parameter e g land management changes compaction by traffic erosion we note here that conditions were fairly consistent over the approximately 1 year the surveys were conducted over this combined with the extracted depth of 20 cm we do not expect significant changes to have occurred the remainder of the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 soil hydraulic model is 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 3 k s e k sat s e 1 2 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where θ is swc cm3 cm 3 θr cm3 cm 3 and θs cm3 cm 3 are residual and saturated swc respectively h cm is pressure head k cm day 1 and ksat cm day 1 are unsaturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity respectively and se is saturation degree calculated as 4 se θ θ r θ s θ r with respect to the fitting factors α 1 cm is inversely related to air entry pressure n measures the pore size distribution of a soil with m 1 1 n and l is a parameter accounting for pore space tortuosity and connectivity assumed to be equal to 0 5 here 2 4 statistical methods 2 4 1 empirical orthogonal function eof to identify the spatial variability of eca from emi measurements and swc from crnp measurements an eof analysis was used on both the emi eca and crnp swc geophysical property maps full details on the multivariate statistical eof analysis are provided in previous literature korres et al 2010 perry and niemann 2007 and only a summary is provided here the eof analysis decomposes the observed swc and eca variability measured by the hydrogeophysical surveys into a set of orthogonal spatial patterns eofs which are invariant in time and a set of time series called expansion coefficients ecs which are invariant in space perry and niemann 2007 multiplication of the eofs and ecs will exactly reconstruct the original data often the number of necessary coefficients i e eigenvectors to reconstruct most of the data is less than the original dataset i e determined by the ranked eigenvalues thus the procedure can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving the key information here dominant geophysical property spatial patterns the authors note that eof is nearly identical to principal component analysis pca save the splitting of axes of variation into spatial and temporal coefficients instead of arbitrary linear combinations using this approach the eof analysis is able to contextualize the behavior of geophysical property at any given point in the field relative to the mean geophysical property of the field as a whole for example points that are persistently dry relative to the mean will be represented with a negative reprojected coefficient similarly points that are persistently wet relative to the mean will be represented with a positive coefficient the magnitude of each coefficient is assigned based on the difference between the mean behavior of the field and the mean behavior of each respective point each point is then spatially reprojected and a continuous surface is created eof surfaces from the eca and crnp mapping along with the lidar elevation data will serve as the three environmental covariates utilized in this study following franz et al 2017 2 4 2 regression of environmental covariates and soil hydraulic parameters following the eof analysis measured soil hydraulic parameters were regressed with the environmental covariates using a simple linear model to determine correlation this provides the ability to spatially estimate soil hydraulic parameters using the exhaustive spatial datasets similar approaches have been carried out in other studies pedrera parrilla et al 2016 referring to this as pca instead of eof we note here that because the eof analysis provides results that are both invariant and incommensurate regressions from one study field will not be comparable to another 2 4 3 bootstrap validation in order to determine 1 the accuracy of the regressed parameter relative to measured parameter and 2 how many samples are necessary for a rmse to converge we utilized a bootstrap validation analysis using the statistical package r version 3 3 3 2017 this was carried out by randomly selecting n 1 samples where n is the number of samples extracted at each study site building a simple linear model and then determining the rmse of the remaining validation samples relative to the model predicted value this process was repeated 1000 times and then repeated again with n 2 for the training set and so on until only 3 samples were used as a training set with the rest used as a validation set results are also contextualized with a comparison of using ssurgo soil texture sand silt and clay percentages and bulk density data as inputs to the rosetta pedotransfer function model to estimate soil hydraulic parameters we assumed this framework is a reasonable benchmark given the widespread use of rosetta schaap et al 2001 with the hydrological and agricultural communities 3 results and discussion 3 1 near surface hydrogeophysical surveys fig 2 illustrates seven crnp rover surveys along with the accompanying calculated 1st eof within field t1s4 serving as an example case to present the eof result along with the underlying spatial data table 1 presents geophysical survey summary data collected in each field along with the associated statistical information from the eof analyses in the case of t1s4 the southwest edge of the field tends to be relatively dry swc 0 15 0 20 cm3 cm 3 the north central part of the field tends to be relatively wet swc 0 35 0 40 cm3 cm 3 when compared to the southwest edge of the field both of these patterns are highlighted in the 1st eof result demonstrating the efficacy of the method we note that similar results were found in the other two field sites so only the eofs of the geophysical properties will be presented a supplemental table ds01 is provided with the 5 m processed data for all surveys and study sites while there are similarities amongst all the crnp surveys the location of the wettest areas varies from survey to survey this observation underscores the need for repeat geophysical mapping to highlight this further fig 3 illustrates how the eof analysis evolves as more maps are added into the analysis of particular note we find that between the two and three survey analysis new wet features emerge as more surveys are added in the boundaries of eof features tend to converge with the five and seven survey eof analyses being fairly similar this underscores the need for multiple surveys in the attempt to link hydrogeophysical techniques with soil properties particularly where fine scale information is desired for agricultural management decisions 3 2 soil hydraulic parameter measurements raw observations from the soil water retention function wrf measurements are presented in fig 4 while data obtained from ssurgo indicated 2 textural classes for each field we note the wide range of water retention functions the nature of an evaporation experiment provides significantly denser data in the relatively wet portion of the wrf which is critical for constraining its shape a wide range of soils were collected during the sampling effort as reflected by the spread of wrfs and sample hydraulic property results can be found in the supplementary data measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity produced a wide range of values this is consistent with similar studies often finding a range of at least one order of magnitude gwenzi et al 2011 papanicolaou et al 2015 residual water content only ranged from 0 to 0 05 cm3 cm 3 with most samples set to 0 in the fitting process due to the lack of variability in residual water content this variable was not regressed against the environmental covariates 3 3 separation of wrfs using hydrogeophysics fig 5 presents the fitted wrfs of cores extracted from each field in both t1s1 and t1s4 both hydrogeophysical methods were able to separate the range of wrfs for example in the upper right plot the wrfs with a low crnp eof value represented with a red color group together and those with a high crnp eof value represented with a blue color group together the coarser textured samples have wrfs that group lower and finer samples group higher which was consistent with the eof values t1s3 had little spatial variability in the wrfs sampled across the field except for θs and as a result proved difficult for any method to describe the variability this speaks to the limitation of the method in fields with no to minimal soil property variability the hydrogeophysical methods may not provide a robust correlation to predict small variations we also note that in this same field wrfs of coarse textured soil samples were observed in higher relative elevations and vice versa for finer textured soils however this is contrasted with the opposite trend observed in the other two fields and this highlights the challenge of predicting small variation in soil properties from elevation alone we also note that the performance of relative elevation was likely enhanced by the hydrogeophysical surveys informing ideal sampling locations if relative elevation was used as the only covariate performance may have been reduced given that the environmental covariates were able to separate fitted wrfs we further investigated the correlation between the environmental covariates the laboratory estimated wrf parameters and bulk density however we note that correlations may be somewhat limited or weak due to equifinality associated with the fitting process and nature of soil water flow beven and freer 2001 binley et al 1989 as well as the scale mismatch between the geophysics measurement volumes 5 by 5 m and the extracted soil cores correlations between all three covariates are presented in table 3 the three environmental covariates were all correlated amongst themselves pearson s r ranging from 0 63 to 0 95 given the tendency for topographically low areas to typically be relatively wet and often the most clay rich in the field the results were not unexpected correlations between the environmental covariates and both α and ksat were low ranging from 0 1 to 0 45 both of these parameters α and ksat are defined in the wet range of swc and previous work has shown that both parameters drive fluxes under wet conditions jiménez martínez et al 2009 wang et al 2015 wang and franz 2015 because high swc within a field limits the practical feasibility of mapping too wet for a vehicle to travel we are unable to capture geophysical patterns on the very wet end of the curve the lack of our ability to map in wet conditions may limit our ability to predict these parameters α and ksat spatially and deserves more attention in future studies we speculate the spatial pattern for the very wet end is likely different follows topography more closely and persists for a much shorter period of time future work should focus on collecting spatial datasets during these wet short time periods using unmanned aerial systems and multi spectral data as summarized by minasny and mcbratney 2016 3 4 bootstrapping validation results of the bootstrapping validation are illustrated in fig 6 in general most cross validation rmse reduction values converged after 5 samples selected within the training set of up to 18 samples per site this is a significant finding considering each site was approximately 65 ha in most agricultural soil sampling 1 ha grid sampling is recommended http cropwatch unl edu ssm soilsampling requiring 65 samples to cover this area this highlights the potential savings in cost time and labor of a priori hydrogeophysical mapping being able to reduce the sampling effort by up to 90 often densely gridded strategies are carried out in order to ensure the variability in a field is captured given that the underlying spatial variability is unknown however by using the proposed environmental covariates the range of the variability can be rapidly identified within a field and then sampled strategically we note that additional research is needed to validate this finding of 5 sample locations per 65 ha particularly where underlying soil heterogeneities and correlation length scales of soil texture vary additional summary statistics are presented in table 2 to serve as a reference benchmark to compare rmse values average parameters were calculated from all samples in each field rmse reduction relative to ssurgo was calculated as 5 rmse reduction 1 rmse cov ariate rmse ssurgo 100 where rmse covariate is the rmse using the covariate prediction obtained by bootstrapping with a training set of 17 samples and rmse ssurgo using the ssurgo based ptf prediction across all parameters rmse values were reduced on average by 64 relative to predictions from ssurgo and rosetta where applicable even in fields with low correlations between the parameters and environmental covariates low rmses were also obtained in these cases while the environmental covariates may not have served as a better estimate relative to using the mean value of measured parameters they likely reduced the number of samples necessary to obtain a representative mean value compared to a gridded sampling strategy therefore even in fields with relatively little soil variability these methods are still useful to ensure the range of soil variability is sampled 3 5 prediction of ksat and α parameters given the practical restrictions of driving a vehicle over very wet soil the geophysical methods were unable to capture the extreme wet end of the range of swc we speculate that capturing the very wet spatial pattern may be key to spatial prediction of both ksat and α as these parameters control the magnitude of fluxes at the wet end of soils with this in mind future work may test this hypothesis by placing a crnp on a rotating center pivot lateral that is able to more efficiently move through the field under wet conditions in non irrigated areas a dense swc sensor grid may be able to capture spatial patterns using the combination of these environmental covariates to inform placement of sensors shows some promise to aid in experimental design barker et al 2017 3 6 informing management decisions in agriculture current agricultural practices are shifting to finer and finer scale management given the advent of real time kinematic gps soil hydrology is often a key underlying factor in yield differences within a field however most producers lack soil data that is of the same resolution that their planters sprayers and yield monitors provide while commercial products such as veris tualatin or exist to help bridge this gap such technologies currently only map each field once and are therefore more susceptible to temperature and soil solute differences impacting eca and soil property correlation numerous commercial modeling efforts the climate corporation encirca clearag etc are currently attempting to inform both swc and nitrogen management as these models and others capable of dense geospatial simulation e g foster et al 2017 move toward subfield simulation it is critical that they are able to spatially map soil hydraulic parameters at a minimum the methods presented here could help inform field calibration sites aiding in model development calibration validation and evaluation hydrogeophysics may provide a critical link to inform the number and location of swc sensors in the effort to connect point sensors with the information spatially discretized models need here we illustrate its utility to bound the variability of wrfs and even considering equifinality we demonstrate reasonable statistical skill when predicting parameters previous work has connected time lapse emi observations with predicting soil properties and states in variably saturated landscapes franz et al 2017 this paper serves as a next step connecting spatial observations of state variables with parameters that control water flux 3 7 framework for use at novel sites as best practice for use in novel settings we recommend the following procedure conduct a minimum of four hydrogeophysical surveys over a range of wet and dry field conditions franz et al 2017 found that 4 5 maps at varying water contents established 1st eof coefficients within 5 fig 3 also illustrated minimal changes in eof values and zone locations following 3 4 swc maps following completion of these surveys we recommend extracting 5 7 cores i e 1 core per 10 ha spanning the range of observed 1st eof values and elevation data here we found that this number of local samples reduces rmse by approximately 50 we note that greater number of samples did not significantly reduce the cross validation rmse and illustrate a diminishing return on information gained we note that additional research is needed to validate these recommendations particularly in study sites where the underlying soil heterogeneities and correlation length scales of soil texture may vary 3 8 environmental covariate selection within this work three environmental covariates were correlated with soil hydraulic parameters the two geophysical methods have uncertainties inherent to measurement with changing state variables e g temperature swc etc while the eof analysis helps reduce the impact of these time varying factors a portion of the spatial variance remains unexplained with regards to the error in the geophysical data we believe that the first eof axis of explained variance serves as a proxy table 1 while relative elevation is often correlated with soil textures in areas with lower relief this correlation may not be as dependable as was the case in t1s3 for these reasons selecting one data source to predict soil hydraulic parameters can be challenging and best case use will likely incorporate a portfolio of environmental covariates 4 conclusions in this work we tested different environmental covariates to help constrain the spatial variability of wrfs and to predict soil hydraulic parameters where no measurement information was used in a cross validation experiment we note that using hydrogeophysics to inform a more strategic sampling approach would drastically reduce the number of extracted samples cutting the number by up to 90 compared to current soil sampling strategies presented by agricultural extension using these approaches we were able to reduce the rmse of soil hydraulic parameters described in ssurgo and using rosetta where applicable by 64 on average we anticipate that such datasets will provide a key missing piece of information to better evaluate the next generation of watershed and crop models to aid in real time management decisions future work will focus on collecting geophysical data over very wet swc in order to help better predict α and ksat furthermore future modeling work will evaluate the impact of these different soil hydraulic parameters on both water fluxes and the fate of fertilizers acknowledgements this research is supported

7284,the hydrological community often turns to widely available spatial datasets such as the nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo to characterize the spatial variability of soil properties when used to spatially characterize and parameterize watershed models this has served as a reasonable first approximation when lacking localized or incomplete soil data within agriculture soil data has been left relatively coarse when compared to numerous other data sources measured this is because localized soil sampling is both expensive and time intense thus a need exists in better connecting spatial datasets with ground observations given that hydrogeophysics is data dense rapid non invasive and relatively easy to adopt it is a promising technique to help dovetail localized soil sampling with spatially exhaustive datasets in this work we utilize two common near surface geophysical methods cosmic ray neutron probe and electromagnetic induction to identify temporally stable spatial patterns of measured geophysical properties in three 65 ha agricultural fields in western nebraska this is achieved by repeat geophysical observations of the same study area across a range of wet to dry field conditions in order to evaluate with an empirical orthogonal function shallow cores were then extracted within each identified zone and water retention functions were generated in the laboratory using eof patterns as a covariate we quantify the predictive skill of estimating soil hydraulic properties in areas without measurement using a bootstrap validation analysis results indicate that sampling locations informed via repeat hydrogeophysical surveys required only five cores to reduce the cross validation root mean squared error by an average of 64 as compared to soil parameters predicted by a commonly used benchmark ssurgo and rosetta the reduction to five strategically located samples within the 65 ha fields reduces sampling efforts by up to 90 as compared to the common practice of soil grid sampling every 1 ha keywords hydrogeophysics cosmic ray neutron probe soil water content soil hydraulic properties van genuchten parameters 1 introduction soil spatial datasets are important in different contexts for instance the hydrological community often turns to widely available datasets such as the nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo soil survey staff 2016 to characterize the spatial variability of soil across a field watershed or landscape of interest when used to spatially characterize and parameterize watershed models e g soil and water assessment tool neitsch et al 2002 this approach has served as a reasonable first approximation when lacking localized soil data within agriculture soil information plays a key role in the effort to increase efficiency in water and nutrient use and in this effort an ever increasing amount of information is being collected by farming implements e g seed planters weed sprayers and yield monitors however in both use cases watershed modeling and farming operations soil information is often either left qualitative or informed from ssurgo as localized soil sampling is both expensive and time intense particularly as average farm size continues to increase in the usa given that hydrogeophysical methods are data dense rapid non invasive and relatively easy to adopt they are valuable approaches to help dovetail localized soil sampling with spatially exhaustive datasets binley et al 2015 indeed much work has been done to refine large scale surveys i e ssurgo as well as to identify and delineate smaller scale soil units doolittle and brevik 2014 parsekian et al 2015 in order to parameterize watershed models one common practice is to combine ssurgo data e g texture and bulk density with a pedotransfer function ptf like rosetta schaap et al 2001 to generate the required soil hydraulic parameters while serving as a reasonable first approximation this can be problematic for several reasons first soil properties provided by ssurgo e g texture and bulk density often are sourced from a limited number of soil cores extracted within a county land use and other local factors are well known to impact soil properties on the field to subfield level blanco canqui and lal 2007 cambardella et al 1994 second ssurgo zones are often delineated with covariates that are not necessarily causally linked with soil hydraulic properties for instance vegetation differences observed from aerial photographs are not necessarily the result of soil hydraulic properties driving differences in soil water content swc but rather differences may be due to soil chemical properties cation exchange capacity ph etc lastly soil properties may be gradational within a ssurgo zone due to topography driven soil formational processes moore et al 1993 as opposed to steep transitions soil water content is well known to govern key hydrological processes runoff infiltration irrigation drainage etc within agriculture swc is being aggressively monitored and managed irmak et al 2010 across large areas and on a spatial scale finer than most current watershed models neitsch et al 2002 this is in part due to water conservation regulation motivating farm management operations to reduce irrigation pumping volumes butler et al 2016 in need of finer scale information additional information such as apparent electrical conductivity eca and topography are commercially produced and or utilized to create irrigation management zones for producers in areas with similar eca or elevation soil properties are assumed to be reasonably similar and efforts are focused on sampling areas with variations however these covariates often produce noisy relationships with swc patterns in part due to eca being a function of not just swc but also soil physical properties solute concentration and temperature haghverdi et al 2015 rodríguez pérez et al 2011 samouelian et al 2005 zhu et al 2010 mapping eca over a range of temperature and swc can lead to different maps due to these confounding factors mccutcheon et al 2006 zhu et al 2010 despite this the industry standard remains to produce one map per field here we survey over a range of conditions and then statistically contextualize the observed relative differences in the measured geophysical property throughout the field based on our knowledge that soil migration formation processes and soil water content redistribution often follow the same topographic gradients albeit on different timescales minasny and mcbratney 2016 we hypothesize that the time series of high resolution geophysical measurements will provide the opportunity to derive high resolution spatial maps of soil hydraulic properties which may later be used in more accurate quantitative modeling of soil water fluxes previous work has shown swc patterns to be good predictors of soil physical properties korres et al 2010 pedrera parrilla et al 2016 and while these soil physical properties are often correlated with soil hydraulic parameters patil and singh 2016 vereecken et al 2010 wosten et al 2001 a gap exists in explicitly linking spatial swc patterns and soil hydraulic parameters addressing this gap will likely better constrain flux estimates as a wide range of fluxes can occur within a single soil textural class groenendyk et al 2015 in order to approximate and quantify the spatial pattern of the time history of swc we utilize two common hydrogeophysical methods swc measured via a cosmic ray neutron probe crnp and apparent bulk electrical conductivity eca measured by electromagnetic induction emi these measurements were taken over a wide range of swc conditions in order to utilize an empirical orthogonal function eof with the purpose of identifying temporally stable sub field less than 1 km2 spatial patterns our study site consisted of three 65 ha agricultural fields located on the western fringe of the united states corn belt in the state of nebraska this selected study area is an ideal location for testing our hypothesis in a real world setting for three reasons 1 the fields are located in a river valley where soil units are often heterogeneous and create complex patterns due to fluvial formational processes 2 the proximity to the river valley makes the fields highly utilized for commercial agriculture via sprinkler irrigation 3 given the aridity of the region and demand for water resources precision agriculture techniques are actively being tested and adopted for optimizing irrigation management this natural resource dependent socio economic environment is a critical location for demonstrating the validity and utility of these approaches the primary objectives of this study are to 1 identify temporally stable spatial patterns using hydrogeophysical methods and statistical techniques 2 measure and compare water retention functions of soil cores extracted from the range of identified swc regions that are relatively wet average and dry and 3 quantify and benchmark the skill of using identified swc patterns as a covariate to predict soil hydraulic parameters the objectives were carried out on three fields with varying soil types and topography in the study region of western nebraska results of this analysis are then compared to water retention functions determined from a standard and widely used benchmark ssurgo and rosetta lastly a framework for carrying out these objectives in novel environments is presented specifying the likely number of hydrogeophysical maps and soil cores needed 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study sites the study area is located in western nebraska where the south platte river enters the state fig 1 n 41 007 w 102 192 the three study sites are each approximately 65 ha and 10 km apart primarily under irrigated maize production the study area is semi arid where annual crop referenced maize evapotranspiration etc is significantly higher than precipitation p hprcc 2016 the 10 year average annual p is 440 mm yr and average annual etc is 820 mm yr as measured by the high plains regional climate center weather station hprcc 2016 located within the study area near brule nebraska data obtained from ssurgo soil survey staff 2016 indicates that soil texture in the area falls within two usda textural classes sandy loam and loam lidar elevation rasters at 1 m resolution for each field were obtained from the usgs usgs 2016 using the elevation data relative elevation was calculated by subtracting the lowest elevation in the field from all elevations in order to investigate the influence of local topography 2 2 near surface hydrogeophysics 2 2 1 electromagnetic induction between march 2016 and may 2017 a minimum of three hydrogeophysical surveys were collected at each of the three study sites using an all terrain vehicle atv see table 1 for exact dates of data collection bulk electrical conductivity eca maps were collected using a dualem 21s electrical magnetic induction emi sensor dualem milton canada the emi sensor has dual geometry receivers at separations of 1 and 2 1 m from the transmitter which provided four simultaneous depth estimates of eca ms m 1 every second dualem inc 2013 here we use the sensor with an exploration depth of 1 m the emi boom was towed behind an atv on a plastic sled at speeds of 8 15 km hr 1 with 8 10 row spacing 7 9 m taking about 90 min to complete each survey a hemisphere gps xf101 dgps juniper systems inc logan ut unit recorded the location of each measurement following basic quality assurance and quality control of the raw eca data franz et al 2011 a spatial map with 5 by 5 m resolution was created using an inverse distance weighting procedure we note here that temporal differences in eca mapping stem from soil temperature swc and soil solute concentration franz et al 2015 robinson et al 2009 swc has been shown to account for approximately 50 of this variability brevik et al 2006 we take advantage of this fact here to use changes in eca as an indicator of relative change in swc spatial patterns 2 2 2 cosmic ray neutron probe the mobile crnp has been used to quantify spatial patterns of swc across a range of spatial scales from transects across the state of hawaii to mesoscale maps around tucson arizona and central nebraska chrisman and zreda 2013 desilets et al 2010 franz et al 2015 here we use the mobile crnp to map the spatial variability of swc within each 65 ha field over relatively short time periods 1 5 h using the same atv and collection pattern as described above we also note that minimal vegetation present at the time of sampling 0 5 kg m2 due to crop planting and harvest schedules on site the mobile crnp records epithermal neutron intensity integrated over one minute counting intervals the change in epithermal neutron intensity is inversely correlated to the mass of hydrogen in the measurement volume zreda et al 2012 the authors note that swc changes are by far the largest change in hydrogen mass mcjannet et al 2014 numerous validation studies across the globe bogena et al 2013 franz et al 2016 2011 hawdon et al 2014 have shown the crnp to have area average measurement accuracies of root mean square errors rmse less than 0 03 cm3 cm 3 against a variety of industry standard swc point scale probes the measurement volume is roughly a disk with a 130 250 m radius and a penetration depth of 0 15 0 40 m köhli et al 2015 depending on local conditions e g elevation water vapor soil water content etc for simplicity a constant penetration depth of 0 3 m was assumed for all surveys in order to provide a swc map first a spatial map of neutron intensity was estimated then a calibration function was applied following details in franz et al 2015 for use in agricultural fields we note that if spatial patters are of only of interest then the spatial neutron field could be used directly however the quantitative difference in swc patterns may provide insight to the investigator to decide if differences between surveys are meaningful whereas differences in neutron counts may be opaque the neutron intensity map is created in two steps first a drop in the bucket preprocessing step is applied chan et al 2014 where a dense grid is generated here 20 by 20 m and all raw data points are found within a certain radius here 50 m then the average of all raw data found within the search radius is assigned to the grid center this oversampling approach is necessary for sharpening the image quality and is a common strategy used in remote sensing analyses chan et al 2014 when overlapping area average observations are collected as is the case with the crnp in this study next an inverse distance weighted approach is used on the resampled 20 m grid to provide the 5 m neutron intensity estimate finally the neutron intensity gridded estimate is converted to swc following franz et al 2015 the authors refer the reader to the rapidly growing crnp literature see andreasen et al 2017 zreda et al 2012 in lieu of providing full details of the methodology here 2 3 soil hydraulic property measurement in each field up to 18 soil cores were extracted at locations that encompassed the range of variability determined by the geophysical surveys and elevation see supplementary data ds02 for core locations the sampling strategy was informed based of visual inspection of the maps eof and elevation and sample locations were prioritized based on 1 ensuring that the numerical scale of each data source had at least three locations sampled in the high low and mid values 2 areas were avoided near known disturbances in soil e g irrigation recirculation pits center pivot roads and 3 large areas with similar eof values were prioritized over small areas with significant variability these cores were undisturbed and extracted at a depth of 20 cm inside a steel cylinder of volume 250 cm3 with a height of 5 cm ums gmbh munich germany cores were placed in cold storage 4 c until they were sampled in the laboratory water retention data was determined using two decagon devices a hyprop and a wp4c to cover a wide range of soil tension values the combination of both devices has been shown to produce reasonably continuous water retention data for a range of soil textures schelle et al 2013 the hyprop is a benchtop evaporation system that produces continuous measurement of both swc and soil tension from saturation pf 0 to a pf of 3 where pf is the log10 of the absolute value of soil tension in units of cm the wp4c utilizes the chilled mirror technique gee et al 1992 scanlon et al 2002 and has a measurement range from pf 3 to pf 6 which was used to measure two points near a pf of 4 2 typically one below and one above water retention data was fit using the constrained van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat measurements were taken on the same core using a decagon ksat device under falling head soil bulk densities were taken after soil hydraulic parameters were measured by dividing the dried mass dried at 105 c for 24 h by the known volume of the core saturated water contents θs cm3 cm 3 were calculated by 1 θ s 1 ρ s ρ g where ρ s was measured soil dry bulk density g cm 3 and ρ g is mineral grain density assumed here as 2 65 g cm 3 because θs is a direct conversion of bulk density only bulk density will be correlated with environmental covariates hereafter although bulk density can be a dynamic parameter e g land management changes compaction by traffic erosion we note here that conditions were fairly consistent over the approximately 1 year the surveys were conducted over this combined with the extracted depth of 20 cm we do not expect significant changes to have occurred the remainder of the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 soil hydraulic model is 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 3 k s e k sat s e 1 2 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where θ is swc cm3 cm 3 θr cm3 cm 3 and θs cm3 cm 3 are residual and saturated swc respectively h cm is pressure head k cm day 1 and ksat cm day 1 are unsaturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity respectively and se is saturation degree calculated as 4 se θ θ r θ s θ r with respect to the fitting factors α 1 cm is inversely related to air entry pressure n measures the pore size distribution of a soil with m 1 1 n and l is a parameter accounting for pore space tortuosity and connectivity assumed to be equal to 0 5 here 2 4 statistical methods 2 4 1 empirical orthogonal function eof to identify the spatial variability of eca from emi measurements and swc from crnp measurements an eof analysis was used on both the emi eca and crnp swc geophysical property maps full details on the multivariate statistical eof analysis are provided in previous literature korres et al 2010 perry and niemann 2007 and only a summary is provided here the eof analysis decomposes the observed swc and eca variability measured by the hydrogeophysical surveys into a set of orthogonal spatial patterns eofs which are invariant in time and a set of time series called expansion coefficients ecs which are invariant in space perry and niemann 2007 multiplication of the eofs and ecs will exactly reconstruct the original data often the number of necessary coefficients i e eigenvectors to reconstruct most of the data is less than the original dataset i e determined by the ranked eigenvalues thus the procedure can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving the key information here dominant geophysical property spatial patterns the authors note that eof is nearly identical to principal component analysis pca save the splitting of axes of variation into spatial and temporal coefficients instead of arbitrary linear combinations using this approach the eof analysis is able to contextualize the behavior of geophysical property at any given point in the field relative to the mean geophysical property of the field as a whole for example points that are persistently dry relative to the mean will be represented with a negative reprojected coefficient similarly points that are persistently wet relative to the mean will be represented with a positive coefficient the magnitude of each coefficient is assigned based on the difference between the mean behavior of the field and the mean behavior of each respective point each point is then spatially reprojected and a continuous surface is created eof surfaces from the eca and crnp mapping along with the lidar elevation data will serve as the three environmental covariates utilized in this study following franz et al 2017 2 4 2 regression of environmental covariates and soil hydraulic parameters following the eof analysis measured soil hydraulic parameters were regressed with the environmental covariates using a simple linear model to determine correlation this provides the ability to spatially estimate soil hydraulic parameters using the exhaustive spatial datasets similar approaches have been carried out in other studies pedrera parrilla et al 2016 referring to this as pca instead of eof we note here that because the eof analysis provides results that are both invariant and incommensurate regressions from one study field will not be comparable to another 2 4 3 bootstrap validation in order to determine 1 the accuracy of the regressed parameter relative to measured parameter and 2 how many samples are necessary for a rmse to converge we utilized a bootstrap validation analysis using the statistical package r version 3 3 3 2017 this was carried out by randomly selecting n 1 samples where n is the number of samples extracted at each study site building a simple linear model and then determining the rmse of the remaining validation samples relative to the model predicted value this process was repeated 1000 times and then repeated again with n 2 for the training set and so on until only 3 samples were used as a training set with the rest used as a validation set results are also contextualized with a comparison of using ssurgo soil texture sand silt and clay percentages and bulk density data as inputs to the rosetta pedotransfer function model to estimate soil hydraulic parameters we assumed this framework is a reasonable benchmark given the widespread use of rosetta schaap et al 2001 with the hydrological and agricultural communities 3 results and discussion 3 1 near surface hydrogeophysical surveys fig 2 illustrates seven crnp rover surveys along with the accompanying calculated 1st eof within field t1s4 serving as an example case to present the eof result along with the underlying spatial data table 1 presents geophysical survey summary data collected in each field along with the associated statistical information from the eof analyses in the case of t1s4 the southwest edge of the field tends to be relatively dry swc 0 15 0 20 cm3 cm 3 the north central part of the field tends to be relatively wet swc 0 35 0 40 cm3 cm 3 when compared to the southwest edge of the field both of these patterns are highlighted in the 1st eof result demonstrating the efficacy of the method we note that similar results were found in the other two field sites so only the eofs of the geophysical properties will be presented a supplemental table ds01 is provided with the 5 m processed data for all surveys and study sites while there are similarities amongst all the crnp surveys the location of the wettest areas varies from survey to survey this observation underscores the need for repeat geophysical mapping to highlight this further fig 3 illustrates how the eof analysis evolves as more maps are added into the analysis of particular note we find that between the two and three survey analysis new wet features emerge as more surveys are added in the boundaries of eof features tend to converge with the five and seven survey eof analyses being fairly similar this underscores the need for multiple surveys in the attempt to link hydrogeophysical techniques with soil properties particularly where fine scale information is desired for agricultural management decisions 3 2 soil hydraulic parameter measurements raw observations from the soil water retention function wrf measurements are presented in fig 4 while data obtained from ssurgo indicated 2 textural classes for each field we note the wide range of water retention functions the nature of an evaporation experiment provides significantly denser data in the relatively wet portion of the wrf which is critical for constraining its shape a wide range of soils were collected during the sampling effort as reflected by the spread of wrfs and sample hydraulic property results can be found in the supplementary data measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity produced a wide range of values this is consistent with similar studies often finding a range of at least one order of magnitude gwenzi et al 2011 papanicolaou et al 2015 residual water content only ranged from 0 to 0 05 cm3 cm 3 with most samples set to 0 in the fitting process due to the lack of variability in residual water content this variable was not regressed against the environmental covariates 3 3 separation of wrfs using hydrogeophysics fig 5 presents the fitted wrfs of cores extracted from each field in both t1s1 and t1s4 both hydrogeophysical methods were able to separate the range of wrfs for example in the upper right plot the wrfs with a low crnp eof value represented with a red color group together and those with a high crnp eof value represented with a blue color group together the coarser textured samples have wrfs that group lower and finer samples group higher which was consistent with the eof values t1s3 had little spatial variability in the wrfs sampled across the field except for θs and as a result proved difficult for any method to describe the variability this speaks to the limitation of the method in fields with no to minimal soil property variability the hydrogeophysical methods may not provide a robust correlation to predict small variations we also note that in this same field wrfs of coarse textured soil samples were observed in higher relative elevations and vice versa for finer textured soils however this is contrasted with the opposite trend observed in the other two fields and this highlights the challenge of predicting small variation in soil properties from elevation alone we also note that the performance of relative elevation was likely enhanced by the hydrogeophysical surveys informing ideal sampling locations if relative elevation was used as the only covariate performance may have been reduced given that the environmental covariates were able to separate fitted wrfs we further investigated the correlation between the environmental covariates the laboratory estimated wrf parameters and bulk density however we note that correlations may be somewhat limited or weak due to equifinality associated with the fitting process and nature of soil water flow beven and freer 2001 binley et al 1989 as well as the scale mismatch between the geophysics measurement volumes 5 by 5 m and the extracted soil cores correlations between all three covariates are presented in table 3 the three environmental covariates were all correlated amongst themselves pearson s r ranging from 0 63 to 0 95 given the tendency for topographically low areas to typically be relatively wet and often the most clay rich in the field the results were not unexpected correlations between the environmental covariates and both α and ksat were low ranging from 0 1 to 0 45 both of these parameters α and ksat are defined in the wet range of swc and previous work has shown that both parameters drive fluxes under wet conditions jiménez martínez et al 2009 wang et al 2015 wang and franz 2015 because high swc within a field limits the practical feasibility of mapping too wet for a vehicle to travel we are unable to capture geophysical patterns on the very wet end of the curve the lack of our ability to map in wet conditions may limit our ability to predict these parameters α and ksat spatially and deserves more attention in future studies we speculate the spatial pattern for the very wet end is likely different follows topography more closely and persists for a much shorter period of time future work should focus on collecting spatial datasets during these wet short time periods using unmanned aerial systems and multi spectral data as summarized by minasny and mcbratney 2016 3 4 bootstrapping validation results of the bootstrapping validation are illustrated in fig 6 in general most cross validation rmse reduction values converged after 5 samples selected within the training set of up to 18 samples per site this is a significant finding considering each site was approximately 65 ha in most agricultural soil sampling 1 ha grid sampling is recommended http cropwatch unl edu ssm soilsampling requiring 65 samples to cover this area this highlights the potential savings in cost time and labor of a priori hydrogeophysical mapping being able to reduce the sampling effort by up to 90 often densely gridded strategies are carried out in order to ensure the variability in a field is captured given that the underlying spatial variability is unknown however by using the proposed environmental covariates the range of the variability can be rapidly identified within a field and then sampled strategically we note that additional research is needed to validate this finding of 5 sample locations per 65 ha particularly where underlying soil heterogeneities and correlation length scales of soil texture vary additional summary statistics are presented in table 2 to serve as a reference benchmark to compare rmse values average parameters were calculated from all samples in each field rmse reduction relative to ssurgo was calculated as 5 rmse reduction 1 rmse cov ariate rmse ssurgo 100 where rmse covariate is the rmse using the covariate prediction obtained by bootstrapping with a training set of 17 samples and rmse ssurgo using the ssurgo based ptf prediction across all parameters rmse values were reduced on average by 64 relative to predictions from ssurgo and rosetta where applicable even in fields with low correlations between the parameters and environmental covariates low rmses were also obtained in these cases while the environmental covariates may not have served as a better estimate relative to using the mean value of measured parameters they likely reduced the number of samples necessary to obtain a representative mean value compared to a gridded sampling strategy therefore even in fields with relatively little soil variability these methods are still useful to ensure the range of soil variability is sampled 3 5 prediction of ksat and α parameters given the practical restrictions of driving a vehicle over very wet soil the geophysical methods were unable to capture the extreme wet end of the range of swc we speculate that capturing the very wet spatial pattern may be key to spatial prediction of both ksat and α as these parameters control the magnitude of fluxes at the wet end of soils with this in mind future work may test this hypothesis by placing a crnp on a rotating center pivot lateral that is able to more efficiently move through the field under wet conditions in non irrigated areas a dense swc sensor grid may be able to capture spatial patterns using the combination of these environmental covariates to inform placement of sensors shows some promise to aid in experimental design barker et al 2017 3 6 informing management decisions in agriculture current agricultural practices are shifting to finer and finer scale management given the advent of real time kinematic gps soil hydrology is often a key underlying factor in yield differences within a field however most producers lack soil data that is of the same resolution that their planters sprayers and yield monitors provide while commercial products such as veris tualatin or exist to help bridge this gap such technologies currently only map each field once and are therefore more susceptible to temperature and soil solute differences impacting eca and soil property correlation numerous commercial modeling efforts the climate corporation encirca clearag etc are currently attempting to inform both swc and nitrogen management as these models and others capable of dense geospatial simulation e g foster et al 2017 move toward subfield simulation it is critical that they are able to spatially map soil hydraulic parameters at a minimum the methods presented here could help inform field calibration sites aiding in model development calibration validation and evaluation hydrogeophysics may provide a critical link to inform the number and location of swc sensors in the effort to connect point sensors with the information spatially discretized models need here we illustrate its utility to bound the variability of wrfs and even considering equifinality we demonstrate reasonable statistical skill when predicting parameters previous work has connected time lapse emi observations with predicting soil properties and states in variably saturated landscapes franz et al 2017 this paper serves as a next step connecting spatial observations of state variables with parameters that control water flux 3 7 framework for use at novel sites as best practice for use in novel settings we recommend the following procedure conduct a minimum of four hydrogeophysical surveys over a range of wet and dry field conditions franz et al 2017 found that 4 5 maps at varying water contents established 1st eof coefficients within 5 fig 3 also illustrated minimal changes in eof values and zone locations following 3 4 swc maps following completion of these surveys we recommend extracting 5 7 cores i e 1 core per 10 ha spanning the range of observed 1st eof values and elevation data here we found that this number of local samples reduces rmse by approximately 50 we note that greater number of samples did not significantly reduce the cross validation rmse and illustrate a diminishing return on information gained we note that additional research is needed to validate these recommendations particularly in study sites where the underlying soil heterogeneities and correlation length scales of soil texture may vary 3 8 environmental covariate selection within this work three environmental covariates were correlated with soil hydraulic parameters the two geophysical methods have uncertainties inherent to measurement with changing state variables e g temperature swc etc while the eof analysis helps reduce the impact of these time varying factors a portion of the spatial variance remains unexplained with regards to the error in the geophysical data we believe that the first eof axis of explained variance serves as a proxy table 1 while relative elevation is often correlated with soil textures in areas with lower relief this correlation may not be as dependable as was the case in t1s3 for these reasons selecting one data source to predict soil hydraulic parameters can be challenging and best case use will likely incorporate a portfolio of environmental covariates 4 conclusions in this work we tested different environmental covariates to help constrain the spatial variability of wrfs and to predict soil hydraulic parameters where no measurement information was used in a cross validation experiment we note that using hydrogeophysics to inform a more strategic sampling approach would drastically reduce the number of extracted samples cutting the number by up to 90 compared to current soil sampling strategies presented by agricultural extension using these approaches we were able to reduce the rmse of soil hydraulic parameters described in ssurgo and using rosetta where applicable by 64 on average we anticipate that such datasets will provide a key missing piece of information to better evaluate the next generation of watershed and crop models to aid in real time management decisions future work will focus on collecting geophysical data over very wet swc in order to help better predict α and ksat furthermore future modeling work will evaluate the impact of these different soil hydraulic parameters on both water fluxes and the fate of fertilizers acknowledgements this research is supported
