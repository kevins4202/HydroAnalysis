23925,resonant triad interaction is an important mechanism via which the energy of internal tides its is dissipated in this study based on a two dimensional high resolution non hydrostatic model resonant triad interaction over mid ocean ridges and corresponding energetics are investigated impacts of topographic criticality the ratio of topographic slope to internal wave slope on resonant triad interaction are examined by a series of simulations results indicate that the topographic criticality not only affects the occurrence of resonant triad interaction but also modulates the frequencies of generated subharmonic waves near critical and supercritical topographies are beneficial to the occurrence of resonant triad interaction with enhanced energy production and dissipation the impacts of topographic criticality are modulated by latitude at the critical latitude where local coriolis frequency is equal to half of the tidal frequency subharmonic waves are intensified over critical and subcritical topographies but their frequencies are fixed to local coriolis frequency in contrast resonant triad interaction is suppressed poleward of the critical latitude despite the topographic criticality although the energy of subharmonic waves is less than a quarter of the total energy they contribute to 50 of the total energy dissipation on average given that global its are dominated by the m 2 and most of the m 2 its are generated upon mid ocean ridges equatorward of the critical latitude a remarkable proportion of global it energy may be dissipated through resonant triad interaction therefore the contribution of resonant triad interaction should be taken into consideration when developing the parameterization of it driven mixing keywords resonant triad interaction internal tides mid ocean ridges numerical simulation 1 introduction as predominant peaks in the continuum internal wave spectrum garrett and munk 1975 internal tides its are main energy sources of oceanic turbulence and mixing st laurent and garrett 2002 garrett 2003a garrett and kunze 2007 carter et al 2012 in the stratified ocean when barotropic tidal currents flow over varying

wunsch 1998 and their dissipation has a significant contribution to the maintenance of thermohaline circulation in the ocean garrett 2003b nikurashin and ferrari 2013 de lavergne et al 2016 however mechanisms for the dissipation of its remain unclear to some extent resulting in difficulties in accurately parameterizing them in global climate ocean models mackinnon et al 2017 fox kemper et al 2019 oceanic observations have indicated that turbulent mixing over small scale rough topographies is greatly elevated polzin et al 1997 by performing a series of high resolution and non hydrostatic numerical simulations nikurashin and legg 2011 demonstrated that the enhanced mixing is attributed to resonant triad interaction resonant triad interaction is a nonlinear phenomenon through which the energy of its is transferred into two subharmonic waves mccomas and bretherton 1977 to form a triad the frequencies and wavenumbers of subharmonic waves should satisfy 1 ω 0 ω 1 ω 2 and 2 k 0 k 1 k 2 where the subscripts 0 1 and 2 denote its and two subharmonic waves respectively resonant triad interaction is capable of dissipating the energy of its locally because small scale topographies are regarded as important energy sink for its in the ocean resonant triad interaction over them has received attention in recent years nikurashin and legg 2011 demonstrated that the dissipation induced by resonant triad interaction is latitude dependent with the peak value appearing at the critical latitude where local coriolis frequency is equal to half of the tidal frequency this result agrees with observations in the ocean hibiya and nagasawa 2004 hibiya et al 2007 alford 2008 following nikurashin and legg 2011 and yi et al 2017 investigated the tidal dissipation over periodic sinusoidal topographies induced by resonant triad interaction and found that the dependence of dissipation fraction on coriolis frequency is significantly modulated by the topographic steepness due to constructive or destructive patterns between topographic peaks furthermore richet et al 2018 pointed out that the it dissipation is dominated by different mechanisms equatorward and poleward of the critical latitude resonant triad interaction plays a key role equatorward of the critical latitude while the generation of evanescent waves is essential poleward of the critical latitude in addition the ocean is always filled with background currents which could also modulate resonant triad interaction as pointed out by richet et al 2017 the energy dissipation is less peaked at the critical latitude in the presence of a mean current in addition to small scale topographies significant dissipation of its is found near the mid ocean ridges rudnick et al 2003 klymak et al 2008 which are also predominant generation sites for its simmons et al 2004 niwa and hibiya 2011 2014 zhao et al 2016 although low mode its can propagate far away from the mid ocean ridges alford 2003 zhao et al 2010 2016 alford et al 2019 there remains a considerable amount of energy which is dissipated locally rudnick et al 2003 liang 2014 vic et al 2019 liang and wunsch 2015 demonstrated that the occurrence of resonant triad interaction over an ideal mid ocean ridge plays an important role in the energy dissipation of its however there still remain several questions to be addressed a which characteristics of the isolated topography affect the construction of the resonant triad b if the resonant triad forms what determines the frequencies of subharmonic waves c how is the energy of its transferred and dissipated in the process given that its are the energy source for subharmonic waves in resonant triad interaction the factors that affect the generation of its are believed to influence resonant triad interaction over mid ocean ridges according to legg and huijts 2006 and garrett and kunze 2007 several non dimensional parameters control the generation of its among which the topographic criticality is a key one 3 γ s t o p o s w a v e d h d x max ω 2 f 2 n 2 ω 2 where ω f and n are the tidal coriolis and buoyancy frequencies respectively balmforth et al 2002 llewellyn smith and young 2002 balmforth and peacock 2009 mathur et al 2016 topographies with γ 1 γ 1 and γ 1 are described as subcritical critical and supercritical respectively how topographic criticality affects the generation of its has been widely investigated in previous studies e g legg and huijts 2006 echeverri and peacock 2010 nevertheless the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction over isolated topographies have not been adequately considered which provides the motivation of this study in this study we investigate resonant triad interaction over an ideal mid ocean ridge using numerical simulations the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction are the main focus in addition how the latitude modulates the impacts of topographic criticality is explored the paper is organized as follows the model configuration and basic equations are presented in section 2 in section 3 a series of numerical experiments are performed and corresponding results are analyzed discussions are provided in section 4 finally the paper is summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 model configuration the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 is applied in this study which solves the fully nonlinear equations under boussinesq approximation with finite volume method a 2d version of the mitgcm is configured in the non hydrostatic mode the domain in x z plane is 120 km wide and 3200 m deep fig 1 with horizontal resolution δ x 100 m and vertical resolution δ z 10 m a uniform stratification is considered with n 10 3 s 1 both the viscosity ν and diffusivity κ are constant and set to 10 3 m2 s and 10 4 m2 s respectively the same as in liang and wunsch 2015 and richet et al 2018 a free surface is considered and free slip boundary condition is applied to the bottom boundary the model is forced by oscillating barotropic tidal velocities u t u 0 sin ω 0 t at both the left and right open boundaries li 2014 with the forcing frequency ω 0 1 41 10 4 s 1 the m 2 tidal frequency and amplitude u 0 2 5 cm s the same as those in previous studies nikurashin and legg 2011 liang and wunsch 2015 richet et al 2017 2018 sponge layers with a thickness of 50 grids are added to both the left and right open boundaries to avoid boundary reflection of internal waves the model is run for 50 days with time step δ t 120 s and simulated results are output every one hour in this study the mid ocean ridge is described by an analytical function following liang and wunsch 2015 4 h x h 0 exp x l where h 0 is the topographic height and l controls the topographic width the topography is located at the center of the domain fig 1 and h 0 is set to 700 m in all simulations a series of sensitivity simulations with different topographic criticality are conducted by varying l in equation 18 as in previous studies e g legg and huijts 2006 balmforth and peacock 2009 cao et al 2014 mathur et al 2016 wang et al 2018 moreover the coriolis frequency f varies in different runs to investigate how the latitude modulates the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction a total of three coriolis frequencies are considered i e f 5 3 10 5 f ω 0 0 38 7 05 10 5 f ω 0 0 50 and 8 8 10 5 s 1 f ω 0 0 62 corresponding to latitudes of 21 3 29 0 and 37 1 n which are equatorward of at and poleward of the m 2 critical latitude respectively 2 2 analysis following hazewinkel and winters 2011 and onuki and hibiya 2015 the fields are decomposed as 5 u u t u s b b t b s p p t p s where subscripts t and s denote its and subharmonic waves respectively the energy equation for subharmonic wave is 6 e s t f s g d s derivation of eq 6 is shown in the appendix note that in the derivation of this equation the buoyancy frequency n z is assumed to vary slowly enough so that terms involving its derivative could be neglected pedlosky 2003 hazewinkel and winters 2011 non uniform stratification with a pycnocline would introduce extra terms hence have potential influence in eq 6 the first term on the left hand side is the temporal tendency of energy density 7 e s 1 2 u s 2 v s 2 w s 2 b s 2 n 2 the second term on the left hand side is the divergence of energy flux which is attributed to the pressure work and advection 8 f s 1 ρ 0 u s p s u t e s the right hand terms are the energy production rate 9 g u s u s u t b s n 2 u s b t and dissipation rate 10 d s ν u s z 2 according to eq 9 energy production is attributed to both the horizontal strain and buoyancy term however the calculated result shows that the magnitude of buoyancy term is an order lower than that of the horizontal strain this implies that the buoyancy term can be neglected which has been confirmed in previous studies young et al 2008 mackinnon and winters 2005 hazewinkel and winters 2011 ansong et al 2018 yang et al 2018 in this study we focus on a two dimensional 2d motion in the x z plane y 0 as a result the energy production and dissipation rates are simplified as 11 g u s u s u t x u s v s v t x and 12 d s ν u s z 2 v s z 2 3 results 3 1 impacts of topographic criticality first of all the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction are investigated here the coriolis frequency is set to 5 3 10 5 s 1 equatorward of the critical latitude a total of ten runs are performed in which γ varies among 0 25 0 5 0 65 0 75 0 85 0 95 1 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 respectively in each run the model reached a visually steady state after approximately 15 days fig 2 displays snapshots of horizontal baroclinic velocities on day 45 according to the dispersion relation of internal waves 13 ω 2 k 2 n 2 m 2 f 2 k 2 m 2 where k and m are the horizontal and vertical wavenumbers the slope of internal wave beam 14 s w a v e k m ω 2 f 2 n 2 ω 2 increases with the frequency ω for the given coriolis and buoyancy frequencies therefore appearance of beams with slope lower than that of the its implies the generation of subharmonic waves for small γ fig 2a and b only two upward m 2 it beams with s wave 0 13 are found to radiate from the crest of the ridge which is consistent with internal tide generation theory llewellyn smith and young 2002 balmforth and peacock 2009 echeverri and peacock 2010 as γ increases fig 2c i beams with s wave 0 13 are gradually observed indicating the generation of subharmonic waves according to eq 14 for γ 0 65 fig 2c the engendered subharmonic waves are much weaker than the m 2 its suggesting that the nonlinear interaction is weak in this case when γ 0 75 fig 2d i nearly horizontal propagating beams are radiated from the crest of the ridge suggesting the generation of near inertial waves niws at frequency around f liang and wunsch 2015 the other subharmonic beams have a slope of s wave 0 07 according to eq 14 the frequency of these subharmonic waves can be calculated which is close to ω 0 f therefore we can preliminarily infer that the resonant triad ω 0 f ω 0 f is formed in these cases fig 2d h according to eq 1 in this triad the beams of niws are the widest while those of the subharmonic waves at the frequency of ω 0 f are the narrowest in addition the nonlinear interaction mentioned above is intense since the strength of the two subharmonic waves becomes generally comparable to that of the its when γ reaches 1 5 fig 2i the generated subharmonic waves exhibit different features from those analyzed above an apparent difference is that the niw beams which propagate nearly horizontally become almost invisible instead both upward and downward subharmonic beams with s wave 0 13 are found to radiate from the crest of the ridge which have a wide range of slopes this result suggests that the resonant triad constructed when γ 1 5 is different from ω 0 f ω 0 f which is constructed when 0 75 γ 1 25 similar result is also found for γ 1 75 which is not shown here based on the qualitative analysis presented above we can preliminarily conclude that topographic criticality can affect the occurrence of the resonant triad interaction furthermore to determine the frequencies of the generated subharmonic waves quantitatively spectral analysis is performed at x 10 km for the last 10 days of the simulations for γ 0 25 and 0 5 the spectra exhibit a similar pattern in which a dominant peak is located at ω 0 and small peaks at 2 ω 0 and 3 ω 0 fig 3a b this result indicates the generation of higher harmonics of its no peaks are found at frequencies lower than ω 0 in other words no subharmonic waves are generated and hence the resonant triad is not formed in these runs in accordance with the results shown in fig 2a and b for γ 0 65 in addition to the peaks at ω 0 and higher harmonics another two peaks are found between f and ω 0 f the sum of the frequencies of the two peaks is equal to ω 0 indicating the occurrence of the resonant triad interaction in this run eq 1 also note that the spectral values of the two peaks are about two orders of magnitude smaller than the one at ω 0 suggesting a weak resonant triad interaction which agrees with the result of wave field presented in fig 2c with the increase of γ from 0 75 to 1 25 two predominant peaks appear at f and ω 0 f and their spectral values become comparable to that at ω 0 fig 3d h this result suggests the occurrence of intense resonant triad interaction among its at frequency ω 0 niws at frequency f and subharmonic waves at frequency ω 0 f in addition it is interesting to find that when γ reaches 1 5 the two peaks at f and ω 0 f disappear while a broad peak around ω 0 2 appears fig 3i moreover the peak around ω 0 2 becomes a bit narrower with further increase of γ fig 3j γ 1 75 considering that the broad peak is nearly symmetric about ω 0 2 it can be deduced that resonant triad interaction also occurs in this case it could be the generation of a set of resonant triads and no triad is dominant as a result the accurate frequencies of subharmonic waves cannot be directly obtained from the spectrum combining all the above results it can be first concluded that the topographic criticality significantly modulates the resonant triad interaction not only the occurrence but also the combination of subharmonic waves the mid ocean ridges with small slope cannot lead to resonant triad interaction with only its generated and radiated away from the ridge for steep topography resonant triad interaction occurs but it differs with the variation of γ when 0 75 γ 1 25 the dominant resonant triad ω 0 f ω 0 f is formed however with further increase of γ the generated subharmonic waves tend to have a wide range of frequency and no dominant triad are found to explore the temporal evolution of the waves involved in the resonant triad time series of domain averaged baroclinic kinetic energy ke density are displayed fig 4a here results for γ 1 0 is presented as an example it is found that the baroclinic ke of niws and subharmonic waves of ω 0 f is simultaneously increased from zero this result is also consistent with the continuous wavelet spectra along the beams of niws and subharmonic waves at frequency ω 0 f fig 4b and c these results provide solid evidence that the subharmonic waves are generated via the resonant triad interaction after approximately 15 days the system almost reaches a steady state except that the baroclinic ke of the subharmonic waves at frequency ω 0 f shows some small fluctuations a possible cause is the removal of energy from the subharmonic waves at frequency ω 0 f by dissipation as also shown in nikurashin and legg 2011 and richet et al 2018 note that the baroclinic ke density of both the its and niws is nearly one order of magnitude larger than that of the subharmonic waves at frequency ω 0 f therefore the small fluctuations of the baroclinic ke density of the subharmonic waves at frequency ω 0 f have little influence on the total baroclinic ke density also note that when the system is steady the baroclinic ke of the niws can be larger than that of the m2 its indicating an accumulation of energy in niws in addition wavenumber frequency spectrum of horizontal baroclinic velocity is calculated following richet et al 2018 from which the vertical scale of generated subharmonic waves can be estimated fig 4d all the waves at frequencies f ω 0 f and ω 0 have relatively broad wavenumber ranges but centered at 1 3 10 3 2 5 10 3 and 1 0 10 3 cpm respectively which generally satisfies the condition of resonant triad interaction eqs 1 and 2 the generated subharmonic waves have larger wavenumber than those of its indicating that they could be easily dissipated due to smaller vertical scales for the investigation of energetics in resonant triad interaction the energy density energy production rate and dissipation rate are calculated based on the eqs 7 11 and 12 in section 2 2 the variables corresponding to the subharmonic waves and its are extracted by a fourth order butterworth filter with the cutoff frequencies of 0 4 1 5 and 1 75 2 15 cpd respectively fig 3 the results are shown in fig 5 the energy field is dominated by the its since the large values of energy density mainly concentrate on the characteristic rays of the its fig 5a c in contrast energy density of the niws and subharmonic waves at ω 0 f is weak of which the magnitude is approximately two orders smaller than that of the its fig 5a and b for the supercritical topography with γ 1 5 the energy density of subharmonic waves at a frequency close to ω 0 2 is also smaller than that of the its fig 5c these results indicate that the energy radiated away from the topography is mainly carried by the its rather than the generated subharmonic waves for the energy production rate large values of g appear just over the crest of the ridge fig 5d f suggesting that the energy of the its is transferred into subharmonic waves near the ridge for supercritical topography with γ 1 5 fig 5f although the its propagate both upward and downward from the crest of the ridge large production rate mainly appears along the upward beams this result implies that the distribution of energy production rate can be affected by topographic criticality the energy dissipation rate exhibits a different pattern from the energy density and production rate with large values concentrated on the beams of subharmonic waves fig 5g h this is due to the smaller vertical scale of subharmonic waves as analyzed above in addition the dissipation rate reaches the maximal value at the crest of ridge and gradually decreases along the path of beam indicating that most of the energy is dissipated locally although the subharmonic waves in fig 5i γ 1 5 have different frequencies from those in fig 5g and h γ 0 75 and 1 0 as shown in fig 3 both of them cause intense energy dissipation moreover it can be found in fig 5g i that the energy dissipation is gradually intensified with the increase of γ this implies that the dissipation over mid ocean ridges can be affected by the topographic criticality via modulating resonant triad interaction based on all aforementioned analysis it can be concluded that the topographic criticality has considerable impacts on resonant triad interaction over mid ocean ridges for small γ only its are generated and no resonant triad is constructed the resonant triad interaction occurs upon the ridges within a certain range of γ and the frequencies of generated subharmonic waves also vary with the γ when resonant triad interaction occurs energy is transferred from its into subharmonic waves and thereafter locally dissipated by the subharmonic waves although the subharmonic waves are less energetic than the its in addition energy dissipation is enhanced over steep topographies 3 2 modulation of latitude on the impacts of topographic criticality previous studies have illustrated the latitudinal dependence of resonant triad interaction e g nikurashin and legg 2011 richet et al 2017 2018 hence we are curious about whether the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction differ at different latitudes a series of simulations are conducted to investigate how latitude modulates the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction over mid ocean ridges here the topographies with γ 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 are used as stated in section 2 1 three coriolis frequencies f 5 3 10 5 7 05 10 5 and 8 8 10 5 s 1 are considered corresponding to f ω 0 0 38 0 50 and 0 62 respectively results of a total of nine runs are presented in this section fig 6 displays the wave fields of these simulations for the ridges equatorward of the critical latitude resonant triad interaction is significantly affected by topographic criticality fig 6a d and g as analyzed in section 3 1 at the critical latitude subharmonic waves generated over the ridge crest are observed for all runs and have a much smaller characteristic slope that the its fig 6b e and h these wave fields generally share a similar pattern in which the upward subharmonic beams are predominant note that the subharmonic waves generated over the critical and supercritical ridges fig 6e and h are much stronger than those over the subcritical ridge fig 6b although the slopes of them are generally equal the frequency of the subharmonic waves is 1 02f which is determined from the power spectrum fig 7b indicating the occurrence of the resonant triad interaction according to eq 1 this also explains why the niw beams propagate upward and downward with small slopes rather than horizontally according to eq 14 it should be noted that the subharmonic waves are even more energetic than the its fig 7b because all of the energy of subharmonic waves concentrates at the frequency of ω 0 2 these results preliminarily demonstrate that the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction vary with latitude at the critical latitude the subharmonic waves generated via resonant triad interaction are intensified over steep topographies nevertheless their frequencies almost do not change with γ with a value generally fixed at ω 0 2 resonant triad interaction is suppressed upon topographies poleward of the critical latitude regardless of the topographic criticality which is confirmed by both the wave field fig 6c f and i and corresponding power spectrum fig 7c in addition result of additional simulation with other f poleward of the critical latitude provides further validation not shown according to eq 14 frequencies of the two subharmonic waves should be equal to or greater than f and then the sum of their frequencies would be greater than ω 0 poleward of the critical latitude hence resonant triad cannot be constructed over any of these ridges poleward of the critical latitude according to eq 1 this result implies that poleward of the critical latitude the topographic criticality does not affect the resonant triad interaction because of the suppression of resonant triad here the energy fields for the subcritical and critical topographies at the critical latitude are shown in fig 8 as intense resonant triad interaction occurs there the supercritical case generally shares a same pattern as the critical case not shown at the critical latitude the energy density is dominated by the subharmonic waves instead of the its fig 8a and b which is different from the results for topographies equatorward of the critical latitude fig 5a c specifically the energy density of niws is nearly two orders of magnitude larger than that of the its upon the critical topography fig 8b also note that the energy of niws quickly decreases as radiating away from the ridge crest which is different from the its the energy transfer from its into subharmonic waves is enhanced at the critical latitude fig 8c and d since the region with high production rate is much larger than that equatorward of the critical latitude in addition energy is also transferred into subharmonic waves at the near surface reflection regions of its with lower production rate this is because the upgoing and downgoing waves interact at the near surface reflection region which is favorable for the growth of instability as demonstrated in oceanic observation xie et al 2013 and numerical simulations lamb 2004 korobov and lamb 2008 energy dissipation is greatly elevated at the critical topography fig 8f remarkable dissipation mainly occurs along the niw beams this result explains why niws generated via the resonant triad interaction cannot propagate far away from the topography these results demonstrate that the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction are considerably modulated by latitude at the critical latitude resonant triad interaction is significantly enhanced over critical and supercritical topographies since the energy transfer from its into subharmonic waves is efficient with high energy production rate in contrast the frequencies of generated subharmonic waves are not affected by topographic criticality which are generally fixed to ω 0 2 i e the local coriolis frequency in addition both the energy density and dissipation are dominated by the generated niws due to the intense dissipation the generated niws are restricted near the ridge and greatly contribute to local turbulent mixing poleward of the critical latitude the resonant triad interaction is suppressed because the frequency of subharmonic waves falls out of the frequency range of internal waves hence the topographic criticality has no influences here 3 3 energetics results shown in sections 3 1 and 3 2 have demonstrated the topographic criticality has significant impacts on the resonant triad interaction over mid ocean ridges and hence modulate the energy production and dissipation to further examine the impacts of topographic criticality quantitatively we calculate the domain averaged energy density production and dissipation rates in all simulations which are presented in fig 9 the total energy density first increases with γ and then generally remains unchanged when γ 1 0 fig 9a it is amplified by a factor of approximately 10 when γ is increased from 0 25 to 1 0 by separating the wave fields into its and subharmonic waves their contributions to the total energy density are revealed note that the energy does not satisfy linear superposition therefore the sum of tidal and subharmonic energy may exceed the total energy it is easy to find that the energy density is dominated by the its no matter how γ varies the variation of energy density of its with γ is almost the same as that of the total energy density regardless of the latitude fig 9a b the energy density of subharmonic waves is quickly increased accompanied with the construction of resonant triad but its magnitude is still smaller than that of its at the critical latitude the energy density of subharmonic waves is further elevated especially for near critical and supercritical ridges consistent with aforementioned results proportions of energy density for its and subharmonic waves are estimated to evaluate their contribution quantitatively equatorward of the critical latitude its account for approximately two third of the total energy density on average even when the resonant triad interaction occurs this proportion still reaches approximately 50 in contrast the subharmonic waves only account for 17 of the total energy density on average with a maximum proportion of 30 at the critical latitude for γ 1 0 and 1 5 the subharmonic waves are much stronger than the its fig 8b c in these cases the proportions of energy density reach nearly 50 for subharmonic waves but are lower than 30 for its however energy is dominated by its for subcritical topography with γ 0 5 which account for 67 of the total energy although the generation of subharmonic waves are observed figs 6b 7b and 8a the energy production rate fig 9d shows a similar pattern to the energy density of subharmonic waves the production rate increases quickly with γ when the resonant triad is formed for critical and supercritical topographies equatorward of the critical latitude energy production rate reaches a level of 5 10 11 m2 s3 at the critical latitude the production rate even exceeds 10 10 m2 s3 for topographies with γ 1 0 and 1 5 this indicates that the energy transfer is latitude dependent which has been illustrated in previous studies e g simmons 2008 ansong et al 2018 for near critical and supercritical topographies near the critical latitude such energy transfer from its into subharmonic waves via the resonant triad interaction is quite efficient resonant triad interaction is an important mechanism via which the energy of its is dissipated over mid ocean ridges which is also demonstrated by the results of this study the total dissipation rate increases nearly by two orders of magnitude when intense resonant triad interaction occurs fig 9e for γ 1 0 f ω 0 0 5 both the dissipation rates of its and subharmonic waves increase with γ fig 9f and g however in contrast to the energy density the energy dissipation is mainly caused by the subharmonic waves rather than its upon the critical and supercritical topographies dissipation rate of the subharmonic waves is generally one order greater than that of the its which is observed both equatorward of and at the critical latitude when the resonant triad interaction occurs its only account for approximately 10 of the total dissipation while the contribution of subharmonic waves exceeds 50 on average especially the proportion of dissipation of subharmonic waves reaches over 70 upon topographies at the critical latitude the results highlight the important role of subharmonic waves in energy dissipation 4 discussions results shown in section 3 have demonstrated the significant impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction over mid ocean ridges the underlying mechanism could be explained as follows for flat topography with small γ the generated its is weak which are unfavorable for the occurrence of resonant triad interaction nikurashin and legg 2011 with the increase of γ the generated its generated are strong enough leading to the growth of subharmonic instability simmons 2008 so that the resonant triad interaction occurs when the resonant triad interaction occurs the generated subharmonic waves on different topographies can have various frequencies with the variation of γ the well unknown resonant triad ω 0 f ω 0 f in previous studies nikurashin and legg 2011 liang and wunsch 2015 yi et al 2017 richet et al 2018 is detected apart from ω 0 f ω 0 f triads with other frequencies are also observed which have not been reported previously this is consistent with the theory of resonant triad interaction in previous studies maurer et al 2016 richet et al 2018 which demonstrates that the frequencies of secondary waves in the resonant triad can be any values between f and ω 0 f as long as the sum of them is equal to ω 0 eq 1 however it generation is different when the topographic criticality changes and those generated over steep topographies tend to have large wavenumbers and strong intensity legg and huijts 2006 these could affect the generation of subharmonic waves in a resonant triad richet et al 2018 hence resulting in the differences in their frequencies as analyzed in above section large amount of energy radiated away from the ridge is attributed to its while subharmonic waves only account for a small proportion therefore the wave field near the mid ocean ridges is always dominated by the its as revealed by oceanic observations e g alford 2010 vic et al 2018 and subharmonic waves generated through the resonant triad interaction upon the topographic crest are rarely reported however the subharmonic waves generated via resonant triad interaction have considerable contribution to energy dissipation due to their small energy density and large dissipation rate the subharmonic waves would be restricted near the generation sites rather than propagate a long distance in open ocean note that energy production and dissipation rates estimated in this study is lower than those observed in the ocean mackinnon et al 2013 sun and pinkel 2013 because an ideal model is considered here the differences in topographic tidal forcing stratification as well as the lack of background currents and wind may lead to the inconsistency the m 2 its are predominant in the global ocean niwa and hibiya 2011 2014 according to zhao et al 2016 and zhao 2019 amplitude of sea surface height induced by its reflects their intensity in the global ocean energetic m 2 its are mainly generated upon mid ocean ridges e g the hawaii ridges the mariana arc and the french polynesian ridge which are located equatorward of the critical latitude fig 10a additionally these mid ocean ridges are mostly critical or supercritical for the m 2 its fig 10b this implies the occurrence of intense resonant triad interaction according to the results of this study furthermore considering that large amount of energy of the m 2 its appears equatorward of the critical latitude this mechanism is of vital significance since it is capable of dissipating the energy of its locally the results of this study provide insights for the improvement of turbulent mixing parameterizations of the its st laurent et al 2002 set the local dissipation coefficient of its as 0 3 0 1 in the parameterization however their estimation is based on a linear model st laurent and garrett 2002 our results indicate that the nonlinear process plays a significant role since the contribution of subharmonic waves to energy dissipation is several times greater than that of the its given that the topographic criticality significantly affects the resonant triad interaction so as to modulate corresponding energy dissipation equatorward of and at the critical latitude the local dissipation coefficient should not be a constant in the real ocean at least it should be a function of topographic criticality γ and coriolis frequency f it should also be noted that other non dimensional parameters which control the generation of its legg and huijts 2006 garrett and kunze 2007 may also affect the resonant triad interaction and hence energy dissipation for instance the normalized topographic height the ratio of topographic height to the depth of ocean also determines it generation as the energy conversion is proportional to the square of the normalized topographic height balmforth et al 2002 llewellyn smith and young 2002 this implies that tall topographies are favorable for the occurrence of resonant triad interaction because strong its easily leads to the growth of instability nikurashin and legg 2011 therefore the influence of other non dimensional parameters should also be assessed for the improvement of parameterizations of it driven turbulent mixing 5 summary in this study resonant triad interaction over mid ocean ridges is investigated with a 2d high resolution and non hydrostatic model the impacts of topographic criticality γ on the resonant triad interaction are analyzed the main conclusions of this study are outlined below a resonant triad interaction is significantly affected by an important topographic characteristic i e topographic criticality it does not occur over ridges with small γ with the increase of γ the resonant triad is constructed but the frequencies of subharmonic waves vary with the γ for a certain range of γ the frequencies of the generated subharmonic waves are f and ω 0 f respectively near critical and supercritical topographies are beneficial to the occurrence of resonant triad interaction upon which both the energy production and dissipation are greatly enhanced b the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction are modulated by the latitude at the critical latitude the energy transfer from its into subharmonic waves is quite efficient for steep topographies however the frequencies of the generated subharmonic waves are fixed to ω 0 2 regardless of the topographic criticality moreover resonant triad interaction can occur over ridges with smaller γ at the critical latitude poleward of the critical latitude the frequencies of subharmonic waves do not fall into the frequency range of internal waves resulting in the suppression of resonant triad interaction hence the impacts of topographic criticality are absent c the resonant triad interaction is an important mechanism via which the energy of its is dissipated although the proportion of energy attributed to subharmonic waves is less than a quarter of the total energy they contribute 50 of energy dissipation on average at the critical latitude the proportion of energy dissipation of subharmonic waves even exceeds 70 these results emphasize the importance of subharmonic waves on energy dissipation which should be carefully taken into consideration in the development of parameterizations on it driven turbulent mixing although the resonant triad interaction is successfully simulated in this study as well as in previous studies e g nikurashin and legg 2011 liang and wunsch 2015 richet et al 2017 2018 yi et al 2017 it still awaits validation with oceanic observations up to now generation of subharmonic waves in the near bottom region has been rarely reported in a few observational studies carter and gregg 2006 liang and thurnherr 2012 which provide preliminary confirmation of our results nevertheless due to the presence of other dynamical processes e g mesoscale eddies and restriction of oceanic observation the true generation mechanism of observed subharmonic waves still needs further clarification therefore we call for focus on this topic in oceanic observational studies if this mechanism can be validated it would actually contribute to the development of parameterization of turbulent mixing mackinnon et al 2017 fox kemper et al 2019 given that the subharmonic waves generated

23925,resonant triad interaction is an important mechanism via which the energy of internal tides its is dissipated in this study based on a two dimensional high resolution non hydrostatic model resonant triad interaction over mid ocean ridges and corresponding energetics are investigated impacts of topographic criticality the ratio of topographic slope to internal wave slope on resonant triad interaction are examined by a series of simulations results indicate that the topographic criticality not only affects the occurrence of resonant triad interaction but also modulates the frequencies of generated subharmonic waves near critical and supercritical topographies are beneficial to the occurrence of resonant triad interaction with enhanced energy production and dissipation the impacts of topographic criticality are modulated by latitude at the critical latitude where local coriolis frequency is equal to half of the tidal frequency subharmonic waves are intensified over critical and subcritical topographies but their frequencies are fixed to local coriolis frequency in contrast resonant triad interaction is suppressed poleward of the critical latitude despite the topographic criticality although the energy of subharmonic waves is less than a quarter of the total energy they contribute to 50 of the total energy dissipation on average given that global its are dominated by the m 2 and most of the m 2 its are generated upon mid ocean ridges equatorward of the critical latitude a remarkable proportion of global it energy may be dissipated through resonant triad interaction therefore the contribution of resonant triad interaction should be taken into consideration when developing the parameterization of it driven mixing keywords resonant triad

mechanisms for the dissipation of its remain unclear to some extent resulting in difficulties in accurately parameterizing them in global climate ocean models mackinnon et al 2017 fox kemper et al 2019 oceanic observations have indicated that turbulent mixing over small scale rough topographies is greatly elevated polzin et al 1997 by performing a series of high resolution and non hydrostatic numerical simulations nikurashin and legg 2011 demonstrated that the enhanced mixing is attributed to resonant triad interaction resonant triad interaction is a nonlinear phenomenon through which the energy of its is transferred into two subharmonic waves mccomas and bretherton 1977 to form a triad the frequencies and wavenumbers of subharmonic waves should satisfy 1 ω 0 ω 1 ω 2 and 2 k 0 k 1 k 2 where the subscripts 0 1 and 2 denote its and two subharmonic waves respectively resonant triad interaction is capable of dissipating the energy of its locally because small scale topographies are regarded as important energy sink for its in the ocean resonant triad interaction over them has received attention in recent years nikurashin and legg 2011 demonstrated that the dissipation induced by resonant triad interaction is latitude dependent with the peak value appearing at the critical latitude where local coriolis frequency is equal to half of the tidal frequency this result agrees with observations in the ocean hibiya and nagasawa 2004 hibiya et al 2007 alford 2008 following nikurashin and legg 2011 and yi et al 2017 investigated the tidal dissipation over periodic sinusoidal topographies induced by resonant triad interaction and found that the dependence of dissipation fraction on coriolis frequency is significantly modulated by the topographic steepness due to constructive or destructive patterns between topographic peaks furthermore richet et al 2018 pointed out that the it dissipation is dominated by different mechanisms equatorward and poleward of the critical latitude resonant triad interaction plays a key role equatorward of the critical latitude while the generation of evanescent waves is essential poleward of the critical latitude in addition the ocean is always filled with background currents which could also modulate resonant triad interaction as pointed out by richet et al 2017 the energy dissipation is less peaked at the critical latitude in the presence of a mean current in addition to small scale topographies significant dissipation of its is found near the mid ocean ridges rudnick et al 2003 klymak et al 2008 which are also predominant generation sites for its simmons et al 2004 niwa and hibiya 2011 2014 zhao et al 2016 although low mode its can propagate far away from the mid ocean ridges alford 2003 zhao et al 2010 2016 alford et al 2019 there remains a considerable amount of energy which is dissipated locally rudnick et al 2003 liang 2014 vic et al 2019 liang and wunsch 2015 demonstrated that the occurrence of resonant triad interaction over an ideal mid ocean ridge plays an important role in the energy dissipation of its however there still remain several questions to be addressed a which characteristics of the isolated topography affect the construction of the resonant triad b if the resonant triad forms what determines the frequencies of subharmonic waves c how is the energy of its transferred and dissipated in the process given that its are the energy source for subharmonic waves in resonant triad interaction the factors that affect the generation of its are believed to influence resonant triad interaction over mid ocean ridges according to legg and huijts 2006 and garrett and kunze 2007 several non dimensional parameters control the generation of its among which the topographic criticality is a key one 3 γ s t o p o s w a v e d h d x max ω 2 f 2 n 2 ω 2 where ω f and n are the tidal coriolis and buoyancy frequencies respectively balmforth et al 2002 llewellyn smith and young 2002 balmforth and peacock 2009 mathur et al 2016 topographies with γ 1 γ 1 and γ 1 are described as subcritical critical and supercritical respectively how topographic criticality affects the generation of its has been widely investigated in previous studies e g legg and huijts 2006 echeverri and peacock 2010 nevertheless the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction over isolated topographies have not been adequately considered which provides the motivation of this study in this study we investigate resonant triad interaction over an ideal mid ocean ridge using numerical simulations the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction are the main focus in addition how the latitude modulates the impacts of topographic criticality is explored the paper is organized as follows the model configuration and basic equations are presented in section 2 in section 3 a series of numerical experiments are performed and corresponding results are analyzed discussions are provided in section 4 finally the paper is summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 model configuration the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997 is applied in this study which solves the fully nonlinear equations under boussinesq approximation with finite volume method a 2d version of the mitgcm is configured in the non hydrostatic mode the domain in x z plane is 120 km wide and 3200 m deep fig 1 with horizontal resolution δ x 100 m and vertical resolution δ z 10 m a uniform stratification is considered with n 10 3 s 1 both the viscosity ν and diffusivity κ are constant and set to 10 3 m2 s and 10 4 m2 s respectively the same as in liang and wunsch 2015 and richet et al 2018 a free surface is considered and free slip boundary condition is applied to the bottom boundary the model is forced by oscillating barotropic tidal velocities u t u 0 sin ω 0 t at both the left and right open boundaries li 2014 with the forcing frequency ω 0 1 41 10 4 s 1 the m 2 tidal frequency and amplitude u 0 2 5 cm s the same as those in previous studies nikurashin and legg 2011 liang and wunsch 2015 richet et al 2017 2018 sponge layers with a thickness of 50 grids are added to both the left and right open boundaries to avoid boundary reflection of internal waves the model is run for 50 days with time step δ t 120 s and simulated results are output every one hour in this study the mid ocean ridge is described by an analytical function following liang and wunsch 2015 4 h x h 0 exp x l where h 0 is the topographic height and l controls the topographic width the topography is located at the center of the domain fig 1 and h 0 is set to 700 m in all simulations a series of sensitivity simulations with different topographic criticality are conducted by varying l in equation 18 as in previous studies e g legg and huijts 2006 balmforth and peacock 2009 cao et al 2014 mathur et al 2016 wang et al 2018 moreover the coriolis frequency f varies in different runs to investigate how the latitude modulates the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction a total of three coriolis frequencies are considered i e f 5 3 10 5 f ω 0 0 38 7 05 10 5 f ω 0 0 50 and 8 8 10 5 s 1 f ω 0 0 62 corresponding to latitudes of 21 3 29 0 and 37 1 n which are equatorward of at and poleward of the m 2 critical latitude respectively 2 2 analysis following hazewinkel and winters 2011 and onuki and hibiya 2015 the fields are decomposed as 5 u u t u s b b t b s p p t p s where subscripts t and s denote its and subharmonic waves respectively the energy equation for subharmonic wave is 6 e s t f s g d s derivation of eq 6 is shown in the appendix note that in the derivation of this equation the buoyancy frequency n z is assumed to vary slowly enough so that terms involving its derivative could be neglected pedlosky 2003 hazewinkel and winters 2011 non uniform stratification with a pycnocline would introduce extra terms hence have potential influence in eq 6 the first term on the left hand side is the temporal tendency of energy density 7 e s 1 2 u s 2 v s 2 w s 2 b s 2 n 2 the second term on the left hand side is the divergence of energy flux which is attributed to the pressure work and advection 8 f s 1 ρ 0 u s p s u t e s the right hand terms are the energy production rate 9 g u s u s u t b s n 2 u s b t and dissipation rate 10 d s ν u s z 2 according to eq 9 energy production is attributed to both the horizontal strain and buoyancy term however the calculated result shows that the magnitude of buoyancy term is an order lower than that of the horizontal strain this implies that the buoyancy term can be neglected which has been confirmed in previous studies young et al 2008 mackinnon and winters 2005 hazewinkel and winters 2011 ansong et al 2018 yang et al 2018 in this study we focus on a two dimensional 2d motion in the x z plane y 0 as a result the energy production and dissipation rates are simplified as 11 g u s u s u t x u s v s v t x and 12 d s ν u s z 2 v s z 2 3 results 3 1 impacts of topographic criticality first of all the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction are investigated here the coriolis frequency is set to 5 3 10 5 s 1 equatorward of the critical latitude a total of ten runs are performed in which γ varies among 0 25 0 5 0 65 0 75 0 85 0 95 1 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 respectively in each run the model reached a visually steady state after approximately 15 days fig 2 displays snapshots of horizontal baroclinic velocities on day 45 according to the dispersion relation of internal waves 13 ω 2 k 2 n 2 m 2 f 2 k 2 m 2 where k and m are the horizontal and vertical wavenumbers the slope of internal wave beam 14 s w a v e k m ω 2 f 2 n 2 ω 2 increases with the frequency ω for the given coriolis and buoyancy frequencies therefore appearance of beams with slope lower than that of the its implies the generation of subharmonic waves for small γ fig 2a and b only two upward m 2 it beams with s wave 0 13 are found to radiate from the crest of the ridge which is consistent with internal tide generation theory llewellyn smith and young 2002 balmforth and peacock 2009 echeverri and peacock 2010 as γ increases fig 2c i beams with s wave 0 13 are gradually observed indicating the generation of subharmonic waves according to eq 14 for γ 0 65 fig 2c the engendered subharmonic waves are much weaker than the m 2 its suggesting that the nonlinear interaction is weak in this case when γ 0 75 fig 2d i nearly horizontal propagating beams are radiated from the crest of the ridge suggesting the generation of near inertial waves niws at frequency around f liang and wunsch 2015 the other subharmonic beams have a slope of s wave 0 07 according to eq 14 the frequency of these subharmonic waves can be calculated which is close to ω 0 f therefore we can preliminarily infer that the resonant triad ω 0 f ω 0 f is formed in these cases fig 2d h according to eq 1 in this triad the beams of niws are the widest while those of the subharmonic waves at the frequency of ω 0 f are the narrowest in addition the nonlinear interaction mentioned above is intense since the strength of the two subharmonic waves becomes generally comparable to that of the its when γ reaches 1 5 fig 2i the generated subharmonic waves exhibit different features from those analyzed above an apparent difference is that the niw beams which propagate nearly horizontally become almost invisible instead both upward and downward subharmonic beams with s wave 0 13 are found to radiate from the crest of the ridge which have a wide range of slopes this result suggests that the resonant triad constructed when γ 1 5 is different from ω 0 f ω 0 f which is constructed when 0 75 γ 1 25 similar result is also found for γ 1 75 which is not shown here based on the qualitative analysis presented above we can preliminarily conclude that topographic criticality can affect the occurrence of the resonant triad interaction furthermore to determine the frequencies of the generated subharmonic waves quantitatively spectral analysis is performed at x 10 km for the last 10 days of the simulations for γ 0 25 and 0 5 the spectra exhibit a similar pattern in which a dominant peak is located at ω 0 and small peaks at 2 ω 0 and 3 ω 0 fig 3a b this result indicates the generation of higher harmonics of its no peaks are found at frequencies lower than ω 0 in other words no subharmonic waves are generated and hence the resonant triad is not formed in these runs in accordance with the results shown in fig 2a and b for γ 0 65 in addition to the peaks at ω 0 and higher harmonics another two peaks are found between f and ω 0 f the sum of the frequencies of the two peaks is equal to ω 0 indicating the occurrence of the resonant triad interaction in this run eq 1 also note that the spectral values of the two peaks are about two orders of magnitude smaller than the one at ω 0 suggesting a weak resonant triad interaction which agrees with the result of wave field presented in fig 2c with the increase of γ from 0 75 to 1 25 two predominant peaks appear at f and ω 0 f and their spectral values become comparable to that at ω 0 fig 3d h this result suggests the occurrence of intense resonant triad interaction among its at frequency ω 0 niws at frequency f and subharmonic waves at frequency ω 0 f in addition it is interesting to find that when γ reaches 1 5 the two peaks at f and ω 0 f disappear while a broad peak around ω 0 2 appears fig 3i moreover the peak around ω 0 2 becomes a bit narrower with further increase of γ fig 3j γ 1 75 considering that the broad peak is nearly symmetric about ω 0 2 it can be deduced that resonant triad interaction also occurs in this case it could be the generation of a set of resonant triads and no triad is dominant as a result the accurate frequencies of subharmonic waves cannot be directly obtained from the spectrum combining all the above results it can be first concluded that the topographic criticality significantly modulates the resonant triad interaction not only the occurrence but also the combination of subharmonic waves the mid ocean ridges with small slope cannot lead to resonant triad interaction with only its generated and radiated away from the ridge for steep topography resonant triad interaction occurs but it differs with the variation of γ when 0 75 γ 1 25 the dominant resonant triad ω 0 f ω 0 f is formed however with further increase of γ the generated subharmonic waves tend to have a wide range of frequency and no dominant triad are found to explore the temporal evolution of the waves involved in the resonant triad time series of domain averaged baroclinic kinetic energy ke density are displayed fig 4a here results for γ 1 0 is presented as an example it is found that the baroclinic ke of niws and subharmonic waves of ω 0 f is simultaneously increased from zero this result is also consistent with the continuous wavelet spectra along the beams of niws and subharmonic waves at frequency ω 0 f fig 4b and c these results provide solid evidence that the subharmonic waves are generated via the resonant triad interaction after approximately 15 days the system almost reaches a steady state except that the baroclinic ke of the subharmonic waves at frequency ω 0 f shows some small fluctuations a possible cause is the removal of energy from the subharmonic waves at frequency ω 0 f by dissipation as also shown in nikurashin and legg 2011 and richet et al 2018 note that the baroclinic ke density of both the its and niws is nearly one order of magnitude larger than that of the subharmonic waves at frequency ω 0 f therefore the small fluctuations of the baroclinic ke density of the subharmonic waves at frequency ω 0 f have little influence on the total baroclinic ke density also note that when the system is steady the baroclinic ke of the niws can be larger than that of the m2 its indicating an accumulation of energy in niws in addition wavenumber frequency spectrum of horizontal baroclinic velocity is calculated following richet et al 2018 from which the vertical scale of generated subharmonic waves can be estimated fig 4d all the waves at frequencies f ω 0 f and ω 0 have relatively broad wavenumber ranges but centered at 1 3 10 3 2 5 10 3 and 1 0 10 3 cpm respectively which generally satisfies the condition of resonant triad interaction eqs 1 and 2 the generated subharmonic waves have larger wavenumber than those of its indicating that they could be easily dissipated due to smaller vertical scales for the investigation of energetics in resonant triad interaction the energy density energy production rate and dissipation rate are calculated based on the eqs 7 11 and 12 in section 2 2 the variables corresponding to the subharmonic waves and its are extracted by a fourth order butterworth filter with the cutoff frequencies of 0 4 1 5 and 1 75 2 15 cpd respectively fig 3 the results are shown in fig 5 the energy field is dominated by the its since the large values of energy density mainly concentrate on the characteristic rays of the its fig 5a c in contrast energy density of the niws and subharmonic waves at ω 0 f is weak of which the magnitude is approximately two orders smaller than that of the its fig 5a and b for the supercritical topography with γ 1 5 the energy density of subharmonic waves at a frequency close to ω 0 2 is also smaller than that of the its fig 5c these results indicate that the energy radiated away from the topography is mainly carried by the its rather than the generated subharmonic waves for the energy production rate large values of g appear just over the crest of the ridge fig 5d f suggesting that the energy of the its is transferred into subharmonic waves near the ridge for supercritical topography with γ 1 5 fig 5f although the its propagate both upward and downward from the crest of the ridge large production rate mainly appears along the upward beams this result implies that the distribution of energy production rate can be affected by topographic criticality the energy dissipation rate exhibits a different pattern from the energy density and production rate with large values concentrated on the beams of subharmonic waves fig 5g h this is due to the smaller vertical scale of subharmonic waves as analyzed above in addition the dissipation rate reaches the maximal value at the crest of ridge and gradually decreases along the path of beam indicating that most of the energy is dissipated locally although the subharmonic waves in fig 5i γ 1 5 have different frequencies from those in fig 5g and h γ 0 75 and 1 0 as shown in fig 3 both of them cause intense energy dissipation moreover it can be found in fig 5g i that the energy dissipation is gradually intensified with the increase of γ this implies that the dissipation over mid ocean ridges can be affected by the topographic criticality via modulating resonant triad interaction based on all aforementioned analysis it can be concluded that the topographic criticality has considerable impacts on resonant triad interaction over mid ocean ridges for small γ only its are generated and no resonant triad is constructed the resonant triad interaction occurs upon the ridges within a certain range of γ and the frequencies of generated subharmonic waves also vary with the γ when resonant triad interaction occurs energy is transferred from its into subharmonic waves and thereafter locally dissipated by the subharmonic waves although the subharmonic waves are less energetic than the its in addition energy dissipation is enhanced over steep topographies 3 2 modulation of latitude on the impacts of topographic criticality previous studies have illustrated the latitudinal dependence of resonant triad interaction e g nikurashin and legg 2011 richet et al 2017 2018 hence we are curious about whether the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction differ at different latitudes a series of simulations are conducted to investigate how latitude modulates the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction over mid ocean ridges here the topographies with γ 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 are used as stated in section 2 1 three coriolis frequencies f 5 3 10 5 7 05 10 5 and 8 8 10 5 s 1 are considered corresponding to f ω 0 0 38 0 50 and 0 62 respectively results of a total of nine runs are presented in this section fig 6 displays the wave fields of these simulations for the ridges equatorward of the critical latitude resonant triad interaction is significantly affected by topographic criticality fig 6a d and g as analyzed in section 3 1 at the critical latitude subharmonic waves generated over the ridge crest are observed for all runs and have a much smaller characteristic slope that the its fig 6b e and h these wave fields generally share a similar pattern in which the upward subharmonic beams are predominant note that the subharmonic waves generated over the critical and supercritical ridges fig 6e and h are much stronger than those over the subcritical ridge fig 6b although the slopes of them are generally equal the frequency of the subharmonic waves is 1 02f which is determined from the power spectrum fig 7b indicating the occurrence of the resonant triad interaction according to eq 1 this also explains why the niw beams propagate upward and downward with small slopes rather than horizontally according to eq 14 it should be noted that the subharmonic waves are even more energetic than the its fig 7b because all of the energy of subharmonic waves concentrates at the frequency of ω 0 2 these results preliminarily demonstrate that the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction vary with latitude at the critical latitude the subharmonic waves generated via resonant triad interaction are intensified over steep topographies nevertheless their frequencies almost do not change with γ with a value generally fixed at ω 0 2 resonant triad interaction is suppressed upon topographies poleward of the critical latitude regardless of the topographic criticality which is confirmed by both the wave field fig 6c f and i and corresponding power spectrum fig 7c in addition result of additional simulation with other f poleward of the critical latitude provides further validation not shown according to eq 14 frequencies of the two subharmonic waves should be equal to or greater than f and then the sum of their frequencies would be greater than ω 0 poleward of the critical latitude hence resonant triad cannot be constructed over any of these ridges poleward of the critical latitude according to eq 1 this result implies that poleward of the critical latitude the topographic criticality does not affect the resonant triad interaction because of the suppression of resonant triad here the energy fields for the subcritical and critical topographies at the critical latitude are shown in fig 8 as intense resonant triad interaction occurs there the supercritical case generally shares a same pattern as the critical case not shown at the critical latitude the energy density is dominated by the subharmonic waves instead of the its fig 8a and b which is different from the results for topographies equatorward of the critical latitude fig 5a c specifically the energy density of niws is nearly two orders of magnitude larger than that of the its upon the critical topography fig 8b also note that the energy of niws quickly decreases as radiating away from the ridge crest which is different from the its the energy transfer from its into subharmonic waves is enhanced at the critical latitude fig 8c and d since the region with high production rate is much larger than that equatorward of the critical latitude in addition energy is also transferred into subharmonic waves at the near surface reflection regions of its with lower production rate this is because the upgoing and downgoing waves interact at the near surface reflection region which is favorable for the growth of instability as demonstrated in oceanic observation xie et al 2013 and numerical simulations lamb 2004 korobov and lamb 2008 energy dissipation is greatly elevated at the critical topography fig 8f remarkable dissipation mainly occurs along the niw beams this result explains why niws generated via the resonant triad interaction cannot propagate far away from the topography these results demonstrate that the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction are considerably modulated by latitude at the critical latitude resonant triad interaction is significantly enhanced over critical and supercritical topographies since the energy transfer from its into subharmonic waves is efficient with high energy production rate in contrast the frequencies of generated subharmonic waves are not affected by topographic criticality which are generally fixed to ω 0 2 i e the local coriolis frequency in addition both the energy density and dissipation are dominated by the generated niws due to the intense dissipation the generated niws are restricted near the ridge and greatly contribute to local turbulent mixing poleward of the critical latitude the resonant triad interaction is suppressed because the frequency of subharmonic waves falls out of the frequency range of internal waves hence the topographic criticality has no influences here 3 3 energetics results shown in sections 3 1 and 3 2 have demonstrated the topographic criticality has significant impacts on the resonant triad interaction over mid ocean ridges and hence modulate the energy production and dissipation to further examine the impacts of topographic criticality quantitatively we calculate the domain averaged energy density production and dissipation rates in all simulations which are presented in fig 9 the total energy density first increases with γ and then generally remains unchanged when γ 1 0 fig 9a it is amplified by a factor of approximately 10 when γ is increased from 0 25 to 1 0 by separating the wave fields into its and subharmonic waves their contributions to the total energy density are revealed note that the energy does not satisfy linear superposition therefore the sum of tidal and subharmonic energy may exceed the total energy it is easy to find that the energy density is dominated by the its no matter how γ varies the variation of energy density of its with γ is almost the same as that of the total energy density regardless of the latitude fig 9a b the energy density of subharmonic waves is quickly increased accompanied with the construction of resonant triad but its magnitude is still smaller than that of its at the critical latitude the energy density of subharmonic waves is further elevated especially for near critical and supercritical ridges consistent with aforementioned results proportions of energy density for its and subharmonic waves are estimated to evaluate their contribution quantitatively equatorward of the critical latitude its account for approximately two third of the total energy density on average even when the resonant triad interaction occurs this proportion still reaches approximately 50 in contrast the subharmonic waves only account for 17 of the total energy density on average with a maximum proportion of 30 at the critical latitude for γ 1 0 and 1 5 the subharmonic waves are much stronger than the its fig 8b c in these cases the proportions of energy density reach nearly 50 for subharmonic waves but are lower than 30 for its however energy is dominated by its for subcritical topography with γ 0 5 which account for 67 of the total energy although the generation of subharmonic waves are observed figs 6b 7b and 8a the energy production rate fig 9d shows a similar pattern to the energy density of subharmonic waves the production rate increases quickly with γ when the resonant triad is formed for critical and supercritical topographies equatorward of the critical latitude energy production rate reaches a level of 5 10 11 m2 s3 at the critical latitude the production rate even exceeds 10 10 m2 s3 for topographies with γ 1 0 and 1 5 this indicates that the energy transfer is latitude dependent which has been illustrated in previous studies e g simmons 2008 ansong et al 2018 for near critical and supercritical topographies near the critical latitude such energy transfer from its into subharmonic waves via the resonant triad interaction is quite efficient resonant triad interaction is an important mechanism via which the energy of its is dissipated over mid ocean ridges which is also demonstrated by the results of this study the total dissipation rate increases nearly by two orders of magnitude when intense resonant triad interaction occurs fig 9e for γ 1 0 f ω 0 0 5 both the dissipation rates of its and subharmonic waves increase with γ fig 9f and g however in contrast to the energy density the energy dissipation is mainly caused by the subharmonic waves rather than its upon the critical and supercritical topographies dissipation rate of the subharmonic waves is generally one order greater than that of the its which is observed both equatorward of and at the critical latitude when the resonant triad interaction occurs its only account for approximately 10 of the total dissipation while the contribution of subharmonic waves exceeds 50 on average especially the proportion of dissipation of subharmonic waves reaches over 70 upon topographies at the critical latitude the results highlight the important role of subharmonic waves in energy dissipation 4 discussions results shown in section 3 have demonstrated the significant impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction over mid ocean ridges the underlying mechanism could be explained as follows for flat topography with small γ the generated its is weak which are unfavorable for the occurrence of resonant triad interaction nikurashin and legg 2011 with the increase of γ the generated its generated are strong enough leading to the growth of subharmonic instability simmons 2008 so that the resonant triad interaction occurs when the resonant triad interaction occurs the generated subharmonic waves on different topographies can have various frequencies with the variation of γ the well unknown resonant triad ω 0 f ω 0 f in previous studies nikurashin and legg 2011 liang and wunsch 2015 yi et al 2017 richet et al 2018 is detected apart from ω 0 f ω 0 f triads with other frequencies are also observed which have not been reported previously this is consistent with the theory of resonant triad interaction in previous studies maurer et al 2016 richet et al 2018 which demonstrates that the frequencies of secondary waves in the resonant triad can be any values between f and ω 0 f as long as the sum of them is equal to ω 0 eq 1 however it generation is different when the topographic criticality changes and those generated over steep topographies tend to have large wavenumbers and strong intensity legg and huijts 2006 these could affect the generation of subharmonic waves in a resonant triad richet et al 2018 hence resulting in the differences in their frequencies as analyzed in above section large amount of energy radiated away from the ridge is attributed to its while subharmonic waves only account for a small proportion therefore the wave field near the mid ocean ridges is always dominated by the its as revealed by oceanic observations e g alford 2010 vic et al 2018 and subharmonic waves generated through the resonant triad interaction upon the topographic crest are rarely reported however the subharmonic waves generated via resonant triad interaction have considerable contribution to energy dissipation due to their small energy density and large dissipation rate the subharmonic waves would be restricted near the generation sites rather than propagate a long distance in open ocean note that energy production and dissipation rates estimated in this study is lower than those observed in the ocean mackinnon et al 2013 sun and pinkel 2013 because an ideal model is considered here the differences in topographic tidal forcing stratification as well as the lack of background currents and wind may lead to the inconsistency the m 2 its are predominant in the global ocean niwa and hibiya 2011 2014 according to zhao et al 2016 and zhao 2019 amplitude of sea surface height induced by its reflects their intensity in the global ocean energetic m 2 its are mainly generated upon mid ocean ridges e g the hawaii ridges the mariana arc and the french polynesian ridge which are located equatorward of the critical latitude fig 10a additionally these mid ocean ridges are mostly critical or supercritical for the m 2 its fig 10b this implies the occurrence of intense resonant triad interaction according to the results of this study furthermore considering that large amount of energy of the m 2 its appears equatorward of the critical latitude this mechanism is of vital significance since it is capable of dissipating the energy of its locally the results of this study provide insights for the improvement of turbulent mixing parameterizations of the its st laurent et al 2002 set the local dissipation coefficient of its as 0 3 0 1 in the parameterization however their estimation is based on a linear model st laurent and garrett 2002 our results indicate that the nonlinear process plays a significant role since the contribution of subharmonic waves to energy dissipation is several times greater than that of the its given that the topographic criticality significantly affects the resonant triad interaction so as to modulate corresponding energy dissipation equatorward of and at the critical latitude the local dissipation coefficient should not be a constant in the real ocean at least it should be a function of topographic criticality γ and coriolis frequency f it should also be noted that other non dimensional parameters which control the generation of its legg and huijts 2006 garrett and kunze 2007 may also affect the resonant triad interaction and hence energy dissipation for instance the normalized topographic height the ratio of topographic height to the depth of ocean also determines it generation as the energy conversion is proportional to the square of the normalized topographic height balmforth et al 2002 llewellyn smith and young 2002 this implies that tall topographies are favorable for the occurrence of resonant triad interaction because strong its easily leads to the growth of instability nikurashin and legg 2011 therefore the influence of other non dimensional parameters should also be assessed for the improvement of parameterizations of it driven turbulent mixing 5 summary in this study resonant triad interaction over mid ocean ridges is investigated with a 2d high resolution and non hydrostatic model the impacts of topographic criticality γ on the resonant triad interaction are analyzed the main conclusions of this study are outlined below a resonant triad interaction is significantly affected by an important topographic characteristic i e topographic criticality it does not occur over ridges with small γ with the increase of γ the resonant triad is constructed but the frequencies of subharmonic waves vary with the γ for a certain range of γ the frequencies of the generated subharmonic waves are f and ω 0 f respectively near critical and supercritical topographies are beneficial to the occurrence of resonant triad interaction upon which both the energy production and dissipation are greatly enhanced b the impacts of topographic criticality on resonant triad interaction are modulated by the latitude at the critical latitude the energy transfer from its into subharmonic waves is quite efficient for steep topographies however the frequencies of the generated subharmonic waves are fixed to ω 0 2 regardless of the topographic criticality moreover resonant triad interaction can occur over ridges with smaller γ at the critical latitude poleward of the critical latitude the frequencies of subharmonic waves do not fall into the frequency range of internal waves resulting in the suppression of resonant triad interaction hence the impacts of topographic criticality are absent c the resonant triad interaction is an important mechanism via which the energy of its is dissipated although the proportion of energy attributed to subharmonic waves is less than a quarter of the total energy they contribute 50 of energy dissipation on average at the critical latitude the proportion of energy dissipation of subharmonic waves even exceeds 70 these results emphasize the importance of subharmonic waves on energy dissipation which should be carefully taken into consideration in the development of parameterizations on it driven turbulent mixing although the resonant triad interaction is successfully simulated in this study as well as in previous studies e g nikurashin and legg 2011 liang and wunsch 2015 richet et al 2017 2018 yi et al 2017 it still awaits validation with oceanic observations up to now generation of subharmonic waves in the near bottom region has been rarely reported in a few observational studies carter and gregg 2006 liang and thurnherr 2012 which provide preliminary confirmation of our results nevertheless due to the presence of other dynamical processes e g mesoscale eddies and restriction of oceanic observation the true generation mechanism of observed subharmonic waves still needs further clarification therefore we call for focus on this topic in oceanic observational studies if this mechanism can be validated it would actually contribute to the development of parameterization of turbulent mixing mackinnon et al 2017 fox kemper et al 2019 given that the subharmonic waves generated through the resonant triad interaction dissipate much more energy than the its credit authorship contribution statement shuya wang software methodology investigation writing original draft anzhou cao

23926,coastal hazard is rarely driven by only one source as exemplified by the compound flooding from hurricane harvey in galveston bay in 2017 a 3d creek to ocean model is developed to explicitly resolve without grid nesting the marine combination of atmospheric forcing and tides fluvial and pluvial extremes for this extreme event we first thoroughly assess the model skills using all available observations in the galveston bay region including high water marks hwms and field estimates of maximum inundation extent in the watershed subject to uncertainties in the river flows atmospheric forcing initial condition of salinity and temperature and digital elevation model of bathymetry topography the model is shown to generally exhibit good skills for predicting inundation and compound surges with a hit rate for inundation extent of 0 92 average mean absolute errors of 0 65 m for hwms 1 7 psu for salinity and 1 4 c for temperature we then apply the model to quantify the individual contributions from the three major forcings ocean river and precipitation comparison of results in the form of compound ratio from the simulations with three factors being applied individually with those from the baseline simulation with all factors included in a single model reveals the nonlinear compounding effects in most of the areas in galveston bay and indicates that the compound flooding problems are best simulated using a single model that integrates across all factors because the interactions among processes are very complex and highly nonlinear in other words summing up the results from individual forcings would lead to large errors for example the hydrodynamic model results forced by river inflows at boundary and oceanic and atmospheric forcings without explicitly accounting for the direct precipitation in the coastal watersheds would severely underestimate the resultant flow and surge by up to 90 regions of dominance are also identified for each forcing factor from the sensitivity results these concepts are applicable to other compound flooding studies as well keywords compound flooding hurricane harvey galveston bay schism 1 introduction recent tropical cyclones have shown tendency to stall near the coast hall and kossin 2019 and an increasing trend of concurrent heavy precipitation pfahl et al 2017 which together with the large scale sea level rise may cause severe flooding nearshore one of the most extreme examples is hurricane harvey which caused catastrophic flood in the texas and louisiana coast in 2017 harvey started as an atmospheric tropical wave between western africa and the caribbean on august 16 17 2017 and developed into a stronger depression and tropical storm as it moved westward across the caribbean before being disintegrated briefly for a few days valle levinson et al 2020 after the tropical wave moved northward into the gulf of mexico it quickly intensified into a category 4 hurricane by august 24 2017 the hurricane made its first landfall on august 26 at san josé island texas followed by another landfall at holiday beach at category 3 intensity fig 1a from there on the storm lingered for about a week near texas and louisiana coast and even briefly reemerged into the gulf of mexico on august 28 as a result harvey dumped record breaking amount of rainfalls fig 2 with the return period of the peak 3 day precipitation exceeding 1000 years van oldenborgh et al 2018 and caused more than 80 fatalities and over 150 billion economic losses mostly due to the extraordinary flooding emanuel 2017 balaguru et al 2018 over the 5 day period from august 26 to 30 harvey dumped 92 7 109 m3 of water across texas and louisiana fritz and samenow 2017 making it the wettest tropical cyclone in the u s history the extraordinary amount of water load even caused up to 21 mm subsidence of earth s crust milliner et al 2018 a freshwater load of 14 109 m3 was estimated to discharge into galveston bay about 3 7 times the bay volume making the entire bay virtually fresh for several days du et al 2019a b the large freshwater load led to a prolonged restoration time for bay salinity with the bay wide average of 62 days which had profound impact on pollutant transport and estuarine ecosystem du and park 2019 du et al 2019a 2020 as many climate models predict a warmer and wetter future climate in parts of the us and the rest of the world and as evident from the record breaking atlantic hurricane season in 2020 including a number of very wet storms it is urgent to gain a deeper understanding of this type of extreme precipitation events as exemplified by harvey as explained by valle levinson et al 2020 the compounding effects were very significant during harvey near houston which had already been affected by flooding due to a smaller rainfall event before the storm during harvey the houston metropolitan area received multiple pulses punches of water from various sources the river flood from shipping channel in buffalo bayou cf fig 3a that cuts through the city the subsequent flooding in the larger tributary san jacinto to the north cf fig 3a which was hypothesized to have blocked the outflowing water from buffalo bayou and storm surges from the ocean that entered through the bay entrance they also suspected that various constrictions in the bay system might have caused significant backflow which ultimately caused a 3 5 m surge at manchester gauge in buffalo bayou e1 in fig 1b numerical models can serve as a powerful tool for the study of compound flooding and potential mitigation measures e g lewis et al 2019 ye et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however because the numerical models used in previous studies of harvey did not directly account for precipitation and the watershed ocean interactions significant knowledge gaps still exist on how different processes ocean rivers and rainfall interact to produce the observed compound surges during this extreme event for example wing et al 2019 used a 2d hydrologic model coupled to national water model nwm https water noaa gov about nwm last accessed in august 2020 for hurricane harvey forced by the boundary conditions from a simple storm surge model at the ocean side as a result the feedback from river to ocean surges was missing which we will show to be significant in this paper therefore in the present study we apply a recently developed 3d cross scale model ye et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 to examine the relative importance of multiple factors for the observed compound flooding in different areas of the galveston bay system a rich myriad of complex nonlinear interactions among processes has so far been identified however in this paper we will first focus on a very thorough model validation and some results from salient sensitivity tests we will focus on 3d model results only in this paper and omit the discussions on the comparison of results from the 2d and 3d models the latter has been carefully assessed in ye et al 2020 in general the 3d model has the advantage of being able to capture the baroclinic response of the ocean especially in the post storm adjustment thus giving a better prediction of the sub tidal elevations due to the interaction between large and small scale processes on the other hand the two model configurations yield similar results in the watershed which is not surprising since the 3d model morphs into the 2dh mode there cf section 2 3 in addition the 3d model is able to predict other relevant variables besides the surface elevation and depth averaged velocity during the storm such as the 3d velocity shear and tracer salinity and temperature etc stratification in the vertical and horizontal directions in the case of harvey large shear and stratification in the deep shipping channel during the event are revealed by our model the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area observation assets we utilize in this paper and model setup for the baseline and sensitivity simulations section 3 presents a comprehensive model validation for 2d and 3d variables inside and outside the bay as well as in the watershed section 4 focuses on the individual contributions from the three major forcings ocean rivers and precipitation and the nonlinear compound effects as revealed from the comparison between the baseline simulation with all three forcings applied simultaneously and the sensitivity simulations with only one forcing applied at a time a brief conclusion is summarized in section 5 2 methods 2 1 study site galveston bay located at the upper coast of texas along the northwestern gulf of mexico is the seventh largest estuary in the continental us it is also adjacent to the heavily urbanized and industrialized metropolis of houston which is connected to the gulf of mexico through an intricate system of bayous rivers and bays dorado et al 2015 galveston bay is a wide and shallow estuary with average depth of 2 m and total area of 1600 km2 its major freshwater sources are the trinity river 50 the san jacinto river 30 buffalo bayou 12 and other local watersheds feeding galveston bay 8 guthrie et al 2012 lucena and lee 2017 d sa et al

the lake houston dam to the upper galveston bay galveston bay is connected to the open ocean by a deep 14 m and narrow 200 m channel houston ship channel through bolivar roads pass fig 3a at the entrance of the bay lakshmanan et al 2010 the northern gulf of mexico is a microtidal region and the major diurnal tidal range for the bay is from 0 15 to 0 5 m during non hurricane seasons liu et al 2019 there are several sub bays including trinity bay in the northeast east west bays to the northeast southwest that are surrounded by galveston island and bolivar peninsula fig 3a and a few smaller embayments that connect b b and sjr to the main bay 2 2 observational data water level data were obtained from seven noaa gauges fig 1b 8770777 e1 manchester 8770613 e2 morgan point 8771013 e3 eagle

of the flood and to determine the map of flood extent watson et al 2018 the usgs field crews surveyed 2123 hwms referenced to navd88 datum finally 1258 hwms about half of which are outside our domain were obtained with averaging over some locations inundation maps were then created to estimate the areal extent of maximum flooding based on these hwms and a best estimate of the maximum flood extent

building on previous successes we have implemented a seamless creek to ocean schism 3d model zhang et al 2016 for the entire us east coast and gulf of mexico fig 1a schism is a general purpose 3d hydrodynamic model grounded on accurate robust and efficient semi implicit time stepping with no mode splitting and hybrid finite element finite volume methods on hybrid triangular quadrangular unstructured grids in the horizontal dimension and a highly flexible vertical gridding system in the vertical dimension lsc2 zhang et al 2015 a list of worldwide applications of schism can be found at schism wiki unlike in the hurricane irene study ye et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the model domain is now extended to include all major bays and estuaries in high resolution in us east coast and gulf of mexico this way we can address all potential land falling hurricanes in the us east coast and gulf of mexico regions the landward boundary is set at 10 m above navd88 to include most of coastal watersheds fig 3c with the grid resolution of 300 m furthermore higher resolutions are deployed in the focus area of this study galveston bay with average resolution of 150 m fig 1f overall the horizontal resolution varies from 1 m to 7 km with a statistic mode of 250 m and 50 of the elements having a finer resolution than 200 m fig 1e in addition all major geometric and bathymetric features manmade or otherwise are resolved in the grid in order to accurately capture localized processes that may impact compound surges from all potential flood events for example the finest resolution of 1 m is used to resolve some small scale structures e g galveston seawall and levees in the lower mississippi river fig 1d strictly speaking however a hydrostatic model such as ours cannot accurately capture the fine details of flow over small scale structures levees etc as the latter is non hydrostatic in nature due to large vertical acceleration however as explained by zhang et al 2020 if our focus is on the impact of such processes on the larger scales we can still use hydrostatic models to efficiently simulate the interactions all 284673 nwm river segments located inside our domain have been explicitly incorporated into our grid during the grid generation process cf ye et al 2020 in order to facilitate the routing of water in the watershed cf fig 1c altogether the horizontal unstructured grid has 2 2 million nodes and 4 4 million triangular quadrangular elements the 3d grid takes full advantage of schism s polymorphism zhang et al 2016 with variable number of vertical layers ranging from 44 in the deep ocean to capture the large scale processes to 1 in the watershed fig 3b in other words the model is 2dh in the watersheds the average number of vertical layers is 8 which results in greater efficiency customary of all schism applications no manipulation or smoothing of bathymetry was done in the computational grid after interpolating depths from dems including steep slopes in the caribbean and all shipping channels the vertical datum used in all simulations was navd88 12 cm above the local msl in the bay and the 3d model was able to largely capture the sub tidal variations locally ye et al 2020 the 3d model is initialized on august 4 2017 and run for 40 days to cover the entire storm event the very large freshwater outflow in this event makes the system memory of initial condition short other aspects of the setup largely follow those in ye et al 2020 the initial and ocean boundary conditions are from hycom https www hycom org data glbu0pt08 and fes2014 tidal database carrere et al 2016 since hycom results are not accurate nearshore the initial conditions there are interpolated from limited observation found there the atmospheric forcing is derived from era5 31 km resolution and a high resolution 9 km ecmwf product see cf acknowledgments precipitation data is from noaa s high resolution rapid refresh hrrr that uses a 3 km resolution an hourly updated cloud resolving convection allowing atmospheric model initialized by 3 km grids with 3 km radar assimilation https rapidrefresh noaa gov hrrr last accessed in august 2020 the watershed inflow from rivers is mostly derived from nwm version 2 0 and the flow is simply injected at 6752 intersecting locations between nwm segments and our land boundary fig 4b ye et al 2020 however the current version of nwm tends to over estimate the flow peaks at managed rivers brian cosgrove private comm as was the case for hurricane irene ye et al 2020 the errors in the river flows will greatly impact the predicted surges cf figs 4 and 5 therefore in the baseline setup we have replaced nwm flows at the two major rivers b b and sjr with either usgs observation at b b or a best estimate at sjr based on a flow stage relationship developed by twdb fig 4c d during harvey significant flooding occurred at all rivers and the sjr flow which peaked above 10000 m3 s is comparable to the total flow from the other 84 rivers discharging into galveston bay fig 4d therefore the uncertainty in the other river flows is also expected to impact the predicted surges note that the river flows injected at our model land boundary have indirectly incorporated the precipitation that occurred outside but not inside the model domain and therefore the addition of direct precipitation onto our model domain is justified and will be shown to exert a significant impact on the compound processes since we have no information on the scalar concentrations for river inflows and rainfall we applied 0 psu for salinity and ambient water temperature i e the temperature at the local receiving cell calculated without accounting for the rivers or raindrops for the injected water and also for the rainfall obviously the latter will impact the calculated temperature which is another source of uncertainty for the model results cf section 3 6 multiple simulation runs were done during the calibration process the baseline setup generally follows zhang et al 2020 and is briefly described here the time step was set at 100 s although 150 s led to very similar results the wetting and drying threshold was set at 10 6 m in order to capture very thin layer of water from rainfall initially zhang et al 2020 the air sea exchange scheme used was the bulk aerodynamic algorithm of zeng et al 1998 for heat and salt exchanges including precipitation and evaporation the air sea heat exchange was found to misbehave on very thin layer of water and was therefore turned off based on the local water depth the baseline run used 0 1 mm as the minimum threshold for the local total water depth section 3 7 will further discuss the sensitivity to this choice as stated in ye et al 2020 the bottom friction coefficients should be larger in the watershed for a national grid like this and in view of lack of bottom characteristic and bed form data in most bays not to mention the vegetation and building effects in the watershed we start from a simple friction parametrization function of bathymetry only the friction coefficients increase linearly from a constant 0 0025 in the ocean to 0 025 in the watershed as the bathymetry changes from 1 m to 3 m in the future fine tuning of friction in light of bottom characteristics information may be done for specific systems the turbulence closure scheme used generic length scale scheme of k kl umlauf and burchard 2003 but several other schemes yielded similar results observation at ndbc buoy 42019 located 120 km southwest of the bay in the deep ocean indicated a relatively modest sea state with maximum wave height of 6 m vs 10 m during hurricane ike in 2008 the wave height decreased quickly toward the shoreline and at the buoy nearest to the bay 42035 the maximum wave height was only 3 2 m results from a coupled wave current simulation not shown suggested a modest wave induced setup of up to 30 cm in some parts of the barrier islands only the dominant wave direction was from the south which was not conducive for the wave energy to penetrate into the bay through the narrow nw se oriented entrance more importantly the large freshwater outflow from the watershed which dominates the maximum elevations occurred a few days after the storm has made the landfall and so we found there is little difference in the predicted maximum elevation inside the bay i e the wave induced setups do not enhance the positive bias as shown in section 3 furthermore no wave induced overtopping flow across the barrier islands in the galveston bay was observed during the event anarde et al 2020 therefore we will not discuss further the wave effects in this paper the baseline and important sensitivity runs presented in this paper are described in table 1 the baseline is a 3d baroclinic run with river flows oceanic and atmospheric forcing and direct precipitation onto the model domain for river flows the b b flow was from usgs gauges and sjr flow was derived from a flow stage relationship from twdb as discussed before the nwm results were used for all other river flows which will likely introduce biases also three sensitivity runs were designed to separately assess three major forcing factors ocean river flows and direct precipitation and a detailed description for these runs is given in section 4 another experiment was done with all river flows including b b and sjr using nwm values in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of surges to different estimates of river flows the last sensitivity run in table 1 was used to assess the impact of the threshold used in the air sea heat exchange on temperature results cf section 3 7 all simulation runs achieved performance of 49 times faster than real time on 800 cores of sciclone cluster https www wm edu offices it services researchcomputing acctreq index php last accessed in august 2020 or 80 times faster than real time on 2000 cores of nasa s pleiades another important caveat is that no groundwater runoff or infiltration is explicitly included in schism although nwm has incorporated some of these effects a future task is to assess the local runoffs provided by nwm although these are expected to have a minor impact for the maximum surges during harvey note that the nwm domain partially overlaps our model domain thus allowing us to inter compare some flow results between the two models cf section 3 5 3 model validation and discussion before applying the current model to specific events like harvey we had first validated the model for tides and sub tides for the entire east coast and gulf of mexico some results in the galveston bay area can be seen below before the storm a comprehensive presentation of the tidal results for other bays and estuaries is out of scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere however to set the stage for the discussion of total elevation in the next subsection we remark first that the averaged complex error for the most dominant frequency k1 calculated as 1 c e a o cos ϕ o a m cos ϕ m 2 a o sin ϕ o a m sin ϕ m 2 for a non storm period aug 9 to sep 9 2011 for the same 7 stations is only 3 7 cm which serves as the lower bound for the model errors for all periods in eq 1 a o and a m are amplitudes from observation and model respectively and ϕ o and ϕ m are phases respectively 3 1 compound surges the model calculated water levels are compared with the noaa observations fig 5 overall the baseline model results show a good agreement with the observations with an averaged mae of 0 13 m and cross correlation of 0 94 comparison of mae and the complex error shown above suggests that the total error is dominated by the storm signals not tidal signals note that the 3d model is able to largely capture both the tidal and sub tidal variations with reference to navd88 more importantly the model captured the high surges that were sustained for 5 days at all stations the maximum surge is 1 m in most part of the main bay but the compound effects have led to a 3 5 m surge at the b b station e1 valle levinson et al 2020 a later and higher second surge occurred at e1 only which is mostly due to the compound river effect and to a lesser extent precipitation effect cf section 4 relatively large errors are found at upstream stations e1 e3 and are attributed to the uncertainty in the river flows as demonstrated by the comparison among model results driven by different flows at b b and sjr in particular the larger flows from nwm fig 4 have led to higher and overestimated surges at e1 e3 green lines in fig 5 but the effect of the timing differences in the flow peaks between nwm and baseline fig 4d is also clearly seen at these stations the earlier decline in the nwm flow has produced a better phase match with the observation for the retreating wave around august 31 while the baseline results showed a delayed response in the retreat fig 5 on the other hand using the upstream flow for sjr gauge 08070200 which almost certainly underestimates the true flow has led to dramatically underestimated and short lived surges especially at e1 blue dashed lines in fig 5 note that e2 and e3 are also influenced by other nearby rivers whose flows are also uncertain the comparison serves as a direct evidence that the peak outflow from sjr that occurred about a day later than the b b peak flow is the main reason for the later and higher surge at the b b station e1 on august 30 as sjr flow was blocking the outflow from b b valle levinson et al 2020 the results suggest that the river flows account for the largest uncertainties for the simulated surges upstream and better estimates of sjr and other river flows should further improve the model results unfortunately there is no direct measurement on the sjr outflow from the lake houston dam empirical functions have been used by twdb to estimate the outflow based on monitored water level at lake houston dale crockett private communication the function presumably only works under normal condition when water level does not exceed the dam s maximum capacity it is doubtful the empirical function is applicable during harvey as water was spilled over the dam during the peak flow the overall freshwater input to galveston bay during harvey has been estimated by du et al 2019a b and thyng et al 2020 with the values ranging widely from 12 to 22 billion cubic meters considering this large range of uncertainty and the fact that the total freshwater inflow into the bay is 3 7 times the bay volume the model error of 0 5 m in the predicted maximum surges at the upstream stations e1 e3 is quite reasonable while we acknowledge these uncertainties we deem that the analysis below about the compounding factors for the flooding will not be greatly affected by these uncertainties as we focus more on the difference between sensitivity runs and the baseline on the other hand the compound surges at other stations including the sheltered stations e4 e7 behind the barrier islands are all well simulated 3 2 high water marks hwms represent the highest water level reached during the storm event at a specific location simulated hwms are compared with 510 usgs field estimates collected during post disaster survey in the region including galveston bay sabin lake and calcasieu lake fig 6 the vertical datum used in the hwms is navd88 but the quality of the local dems varies which partly contributes to the model errors the overall mae is 0 65 m with a positive bias of 0 32 m indicating a general overestimation by the model the hot spots of relatively large errors occur in the lake charles region north of calcasieu lake fig 6c which is likely caused by the larger uncertainty in the dems used there the mae would be reduced to 0 58 m if this region were excluded the combination of the smaller errors in most of the galveston bay region fig 6c expected larger model errors on high ground 24 of the bottom elevations at those points are above 5 m and the high correlation between the observation and model fig 6d with the correlation coefficient being 0 96 indicates an overall satisfactory performance of our model the mae in this study appears to be lower than that in wing et al 2019 although they included many observation points outside our domain 3 3 inundation spatial extent the hwms serve as a more rigorous validation of modeled water levels and given accurate dems flood depths but shed little light on the spatial limit of inundation during the storm event the latter was estimated by fema using hwms from harris county flood control district usgs surveys and other inspection data elevation data comprised a mosaic of 3 m resampled elevations from 1 and 3 m lidar and ifsar data with one erroneous ifsar data replaced with a blended 10 m section note that this estimation inherently contains errors and uncertainties as described by watson et al 2018 therefore in assessing the modeled inundation we will only assess the extent to which the model captured the overall spatial pattern of the flooding by comparing the hit rate h r defined as 2 h r m 1 b 1 where m 1 indicates the total area of observed wet cells correctly captured by the model true wet and b 1 represents the total area of wet cells from the field estimates observation the h r therefore can be interpreted as the proportion of observed flooded areas that is successfully reproduced by the model wing et al 2019 it ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 indicating no match between model and observation and 1 indicating a perfect match it penalizes false dry errors and is thus a measure of the model s tendency to underpredict the flood extent wing et al 2019 note that the observation here contains no dry spots so we cannot assess the model error for false wet comparison of the inundation extent from model and observation indicates that the model mostly reproduces the observed flooded areas with false dry areas found in the watershed of matagorda bay brazoria river west of galveston bay and north of anahuac national wildlife refuge in the galveston bay fig 7 the overall hit rate however is very high 0 92 indicating that the model is capable of reproducing the observed flooding pattern 3 4 velocity having thoroughly validated the model for water level we now turn our attention to 3d variables in the next subsections as stated in introduction comparing to 2d models 3d models like schism have the advantage of being able to provide better sub tidal elevations and more complete 3d information about the event as shown in du and park 2019 some of the 3d information is critical for our understanding of how the ecosystem is altered by the storm beyond inundation observation at two tabs stations in galveston bay offers rare insight into the sheer magnitude of the punches from the river flood valle levinson et al 2020 station g08010 fred hartman bridge at the upper shipping channel downstream of the confluence of sjr and b b and station g06010 at the bay entrance e2 and e5 respectively in fig 1b the observed peak outflow exceeded 3 m s at g08010 despite data gap and 2 m s at the bay entrance station g06010 fig 8 the upper bay velocity data showed no inflows over 8 days between august 26 and september 3 and no tidal fluctuations between august 28 and september 2 at the bay entrance station there were tidal fluctuations but no inflows for 5 days all of these observed features are successfully captured by the model fig 8 in addition there is also occasionally large shear and stratification at the deep station e5 particularly during the large outflow not shown which obviously cannot be captured by a 2d model 3 5 watershed flows nwm provides flow outputs for part of the coastal watershed within our model domain which can be qualitatively compared to schism flow results across the river channels note that nwm is essentially a 1d model while schism is 3d as nwm and schism use very different flow routing algorithms muskingum cunge channel routing for nwm and shallow water equations for schism a qualitative agreement between the two modeled flows would be reassuring since nwm results do not yet include tidal signal a 30 hour low pass filter was applied to the schism results before the comparison comparison of the flow rates at t1 b b near manchester at which the usgs observed flow data are also available indicates that the schism computed flow reproduces the usgs observation well with some overestimation fig 9a likely due to precipitation added inside our domain on the other hand nwm output at this transect is more than twice of the observed closer to the main bay into the tidal environment we found a general agreement between nwm and schism flows at t2 clear lake and t3 dickinson bayou fig 9b c the differences are attributed to the different flow routing algorithms used as shown in section 4 2 pluvial effect at t3 may also play a role in making the difference it is reassuring that the schism and nwm flows generally agree with each other at these two interior locations 3 6 salinity and temperature salinity and temperature are important environmental variables for both large and small scale processes ye et al 2020 examined the relationship between the large scale gulf stream and compound flooding inside delaware bay during hurricane irene and found that the prevailing surface slope induced by the gulf stream played an important role in blocking the outflow during the post storm water level re adjustment du and park 2019 used schism to study the recovery time for bay salinity after harvey and found that it took an average of two months for the salinity over the entire bay to recover the model validation for the large scale is shown in appendix and here we focus on the response in the bay during harvey the large freshwater load 3 7 times the bay volume has led to freshening of the bay du and park 2019 and created large salinity gradients afterward fig 10 the enormous pulse of freshwater drastically transformed the bay salinity condition dropping the salinity from 30 psu to 0 within 3 days even at the bay entrance and leaving the whole bay fresh for 2 days starting from around september 1 the ocean water started to re intrude into the bay fig 10a but the full restoration of salinity there did not happen until two months later du and park 2019 the bay temperature on the other hand exhibits a synchronous drop of 5 c during the passage of the cold wake of the storm around august 30 fig 10 the most upstream station oldr just downstream of the trinity river mouth however showed a slightly delayed response fig 10h likely due to different heat content of river water that was eventually mixed with the bay water the lack of information on the water temperature in the rivers makes it difficult to assess its impact the current model application did a good job in capturing the above mentioned processes with validation of temperature and salinity as summarized in fig 10 in particular the dramatic drop and gradual recovery of the bay salinity were captured in terms of both magnitude and timing the synchronous drop in the bay temperature was also captured albeit with small cold biases the largest error occurred at the most upstream station oldr where the model at times showed a 2 c cold bias this bias was attributed to the uncertainties in the water temperature boundary conditions specifically the unknown temperature in the river flows injected at the model land boundary and to a lesser extent the unknown temperature of the rainwater both are assumed to be at the ambient model temperature which is not a good assumption overall the averaged maes for temperature and salinity are 1 4 c and 1 7 psu respectively normalized by the mean observation the scaled maes are respectively 0 06 and 0 22 addressing the uncertainties in the watershed temperature should be a priority in the future 3 7 sensitivity of temperature to threshold depth for air sea exchange the temperature skill was also found to be sensitive to the heat fluxes calculated from the air sea exchange model used in schism zeng et al 1998 this is because large areas of watershed are covered with thin layer of water e g from rainfall initially where small errors in the calculated heat fluxes would lead to large temperature swings due to the small water mass there therefore the exchange is best to be deactivated when the water depth falls below a threshold to demonstrate that the choice of the threshold used in the baseline is robust an additional simulation was conducted to test the sensitivity of modeled temperature to this choice sensitivity run 6 in table 1 results suggest that thresholds lower than 1 mm would have a relatively minor influence on the calculated temperature fig 11 and therefore the choice of 0 1 mm in the baseline run is acceptable 4 compound effects of oceanic fluvial and pluvial origins in this section we will assess the individual contributions from three forcing factors ocean river and rainfall three sensitivity runs were conducted using only one factor in each run sensitivity runs 2 4 in table 1 specifically ocean only simulation includes all processes of oceanic origin tides gulf stream atmospheric forcing etc but excludes the effects from river flows injected at the land boundary and precipitation rivers only simulation turns off all oceanic and atmospheric forcing ocean as lake and precipitation with the only forcing coming from river flows at our land boundary similarly the only forcing in precipitation only simulation is the precipitation note that the rivers only simulation indirectly includes precipitation that occurred outside the model domain which contributed to the river flows injected at the land boundary but not the direct precipitation inside the model domain strictly speaking turning on off precipitation or rivers affects the bay salinity but this effect is deemed minor for surges therefore the three factors are mostly orthogonal to each other and it is a common practice in many other models as reviewed by santiago collazo et al 2019 to use the sum to represent the compound flood by implicitly assuming linearity comparison of this sum to the current baseline model results thus reveals the nonlinear compound effects 4 1 impact of compounding factors on the total water level a calibrated model like ours allows us to assess the contributions from each of the three forcing factors on the total water level fig 12 the ocean induced storm surge is on the order of 1 m at all stations except at e4 which is located in a small sheltered embayment on the eastern end of east bay rollover bay behind bolivar peninsula where the surge is slightly lower note that there is a small man made inlet near e4 connecting the rollover bay to the gulf which sometimes gets clogged hence the water level at e4 tends to be more erratic all of the ocean induced surges reached their peaks on aug 26 followed by a steady decline afterward and all showed a negative set down around aug 31 as the water withdrew from the bay and tidal oscillations were restored which is typical in all storm surges however the more sheltered station e4 showed more complex processes of wave reflection and water stacking comparison between the ocean only results and the observation indicates that the ocean alone can adequately explain the surges at the coastal stations e5 e7 and also the initial surges at the upstream stations e1 e3 but the ocean induced surges there were not sustained as long as the observation in addition part of the initial surge at e1 is not of ocean origin fig 12 the fluvial effect is very significant at e1 e4 not surprisingly the effect increases toward upstream rivers and watershed fig 12 at e1 this effect dwarfs the other two factors even at the entrance station e5 the fluvial effect is still visible the fluvial peaks lag the storm surge by 2 days the pluvial effect is smaller than the other two factors at all stations except e4 where local stacking of water seems to be severe possibly due to the very small inlet there still the pluvial effect accounts for up to 30 cm of surge at the upstream stations e1 e4 and tends to be synergistic with the fluvial forcing in raising the surge level fig 12 in summary e1 is heavily dominated by river flows and all three factors are important at e1 e4 the downstream stations e5 e7 are heavily dominated by the ocean factor the three factors work in tandem to sustain the surge for over 5 days due to their different arrival times as the ocean surge is retreating the arrival of river and rainfall induced flood is crucial in re raising the water level fig 12 the compound effects are most severe at upstream stations however the factors do not always reinforce each other a prominent example is seen around august 29 at e1 when the river alone would have led to a higher surge than the baseline but the latter is partially offset by the withdrawing flow decreasing water level from the ocean source during this period therefore the time history of different forcing factors is very important for compound flooding processes 4 2 impact of compounding factors on flow like the water levels the flow in the bay and watershed is expected to be dominated by different forcings at different locations river and or precipitation may dominate watershed locations while oceanic forcing is expected to be important for bay locations this hypothesis is tested here using the 3 transects cf fig 9 the oceanic effects turn out to be relatively minor at all 3 transects when compared with the other two factors fig 13 both river and precipitation effects are significant at t1 and t2 at t3 the river factor is minor and most of the flow there came from local rainfall at all locations the sum of the flows calculated from the three factors is close to the baseline results albeit with some discrepancies in the form of over estimation at t1 and under estimation at t2 and t3 which indicates nonlinear compound effects for flow it is likely that the situation at t1 is more complex than the other two transects because it is located near the two largest rivers and additional blocking of the outflow from b b by sjr provided by the inclusion of precipitation effects in the baseline might have reduced the t1 flow as compared to the linear superposition an important finding here is that imposing inflow boundary condition alone in a typical coastal watershed domain while neglecting local precipitation may considerably underestimate the resultant flow 4 3 contributions from each forcing in different regions to better understand the spatial variability of the impacts of the three factors on water levels we first introduce the concept of disturbance for compound flooding processes that involve both ocean and watershed neither the water surface elevation nor the water depth is a satisfactory metric because the nominally large water elevations on the high ground of watershed are dominated by the high bottom elevation there and the large water depths in the bays and ocean are dominated by the local bathymetry on the other hand what we often need is the departure of water level from the initial state therefore here we define disturbance d as 3 d η i f h 0 η h i f h 0 where η is the water surface elevation and h is the bathymetry with h 0 for ocean and h 0 for watershed basically d represents the departure from initial condition either the initial water surface or bottom whichever is higher note that d is continuous across h 0 and dependent on the vertical datum used on the initially dry ground of watershed d simply represents the local water depth which is usually smaller than h whereas at initially wet locations d is simply the surface elevation d is also a smoother metric to measure the compound effects as one transitions from oceanic into riverine regimes in the analysis here we will first neglect the nonlinear compound effects and examine the contributions of each factor to the total disturbance in the form of the ratio of the maximum disturbance from each factor to the total sum so that the sum of the 3 ratios is equal to 1 although the compound effects are ignored here the ratios can still shed light on places where the compound effects may be potentially important i e any non red regions in fig 14 the oceanic factor dominates in the coastal ocean 98 but accounts for less than 80 of the total in the lower bay less than 60 in the upper bay and low lying rivers the river factor dominates in the watershed regions with existing river network but also accounts for 30 and 10 in the upper and lower bay respectively the direct precipitation is significant mostly on high ground in the watershed but still accounts for 10 in the bay and more near the river network these findings are consistent with the previous analysis for the impact of the three factors on water level section 4 1 which showed small influence from the ocean at the upstream stations e1 e3 where the pluvial and fluvial effects play significant roles it is also in line with the conclusion on the impact of three factors on the flows fig 13 in particular t2 and t3 happened to be located inside a region heavily influenced by precipitation fig 14c 4 4 compound ratio the results shown in the previous section did not account for the nonlinear compound effects the latter can be assessed by comparing the sum of the results from the three factors to the baseline we define the compound ratio as the ratio between the maximum disturbance from the baseline and the sum of the three maximum disturbances at a given location 4 c r max d j 1 3 max d j the denominator is a conservative estimate of the total maximum disturbance because the maxima from each factor may occur at different times cf fig 12 therefore the compound ratio calculated this way is generally no greater than 1 compound ratios close to 1 indicate negligible compound effects and any values far from 1 indicate significant nonlinear compound effects as shown in fig 15 the compound effects are generally weak in the coastal ocean and portions of lower bay where the ocean factor dominates and on the high ground in the watershed where the precipitation is the sole source but are significant elsewhere in the east and west bays upper bay and watershed areas with river network etc near the maximum inundation extent in the barrier islands in the wildlife refuge north of east bay and in parts of the northern watershed of b b the baseline maximum actually exceeds the sum of three factors suggesting localized amplifications there one possible explanation is that these regions correspond to where two factors are about equally important fig 14 these results demonstrate that summing up the results from model runs forced by individual factors would overestimate in most regions by at least 20 and thus a single model that incorporates all factors should be used to avoid the large biases 5 conclusions hurricane harvey 2017 represents an extreme case for compound flooding due to record breaking precipitation and ensuing river flood in the texas and louisiana coasts the excess freshwater dumped into galveston bay also profoundly changed the physical and biological systems with a prolonged recovery time to fill in our knowledge gaps for this important event we have successfully validated a 3d creek to ocean model and used the model to assess the contributions from all major forcing factors ocean rivers and precipitation the major findings from this study are summarized as follows 1 coastal watersheds are considerably more complex than other types of watersheds with a myriad of competing factors from ocean rivers atmosphere wind heat fluxes and precipitation and groundwater not accounted for in this paper 2 compound effects are highly nonlinear and so simulating the impact of each source ocean river and rainfall separately and summing them up would lead to large errors therefore the compound flooding studies are best carried out using a single model that integrates across all factors 3 treating watershed flows as boundary conditions and neglecting direct precipitation in a typical coastal watershed may result in large errors in downstream flow delivery and surges the well validated 3d model presented in this paper has so far revealed many other interesting aspects of the compound flooding that have not been discussed in this paper role of manmade structures levees dams etc and constrictions on flow routing and surges impact of the large and persistent freshwater plume on coastal regions etc note that forecasts for atmospheric and hydrologic conditions already exist in noaa and other agencies and given the realism across a broad range of spatial scales and model efficiency as demonstrated in this paper an operational forecast based on the current study is being tested at noaa this study also exposes some remaining critical knowledge gaps the compound flooding results are shown to be particularly sensitive to several key factors river flows dems especially bathymetry in small rivers boundary condition for temperature in the watershed and atmospheric forcing wind air pressure various heat fluxes and precipitation and evaporation the accuracy of the predicted surges is critically dependent on the river flows dems and atmospheric forcing in the ocean and bay and therefore a critical need in the future is to further improve the accuracy of the hydrologic and atmospheric models as well as the nearshore seamless bathymetry topography information that models rely on declaration of competing interest the authors

23926,coastal hazard is rarely driven by only one source as exemplified by the compound flooding from hurricane harvey in galveston bay in 2017 a 3d creek to ocean model is developed to explicitly resolve without grid nesting the marine combination of atmospheric forcing and tides fluvial and pluvial extremes for this extreme event we first thoroughly assess the model skills using all available observations in the galveston bay region including high water marks hwms and field estimates of maximum inundation extent in the watershed subject to uncertainties in the river flows atmospheric forcing initial condition of salinity and temperature and digital elevation model of bathymetry topography the model is shown to generally exhibit good skills for predicting inundation and compound surges with a hit rate for inundation extent of 0 92 average mean absolute errors of 0 65 m for hwms 1 7 psu for salinity and 1 4 c for temperature we then apply the model to quantify the individual contributions from the three major forcings ocean river and precipitation comparison of results in the form of compound ratio from the simulations with three factors being applied individually with those from the baseline simulation with all factors included in a single model reveals the nonlinear compounding effects in most of the areas in galveston bay and indicates that the compound flooding problems are best simulated using a single model that integrates across all factors because the interactions among processes are very complex and highly nonlinear in other words summing up the results from individual forcings would lead to large errors for example the hydrodynamic model results forced by river inflows at boundary and oceanic and atmospheric forcings without explicitly accounting for the direct precipitation in the coastal watersheds would severely underestimate the resultant flow and surge by up to 90 regions of dominance are also identified for each forcing factor from the sensitivity results these concepts are applicable to other compound flooding studies as well keywords compound flooding hurricane harvey galveston bay schism 1 introduction recent tropical cyclones have shown tendency to stall near the coast hall and kossin 2019 and an increasing trend of concurrent heavy precipitation pfahl et al 2017 which together with the large scale sea level rise may cause severe flooding nearshore one of the most extreme examples is hurricane harvey which caused catastrophic flood in the texas and louisiana coast in 2017 harvey started as an atmospheric tropical wave between western africa and the caribbean on august 16 17 2017 and developed into a stronger depression and tropical storm as it moved westward across the caribbean before being disintegrated briefly for a few days valle levinson et al 2020 after the tropical wave moved northward into the gulf of mexico it quickly intensified into a category 4 hurricane by august 24 2017 the hurricane made its first landfall on august 26 at san josé island texas followed by another landfall at holiday beach at category 3 intensity fig 1a from there on the storm lingered for about a week near texas and louisiana coast and even briefly reemerged into the gulf of mexico on august 28 as a result harvey dumped record breaking amount of rainfalls fig 2 with the return period of the peak 3 day precipitation exceeding 1000 years van oldenborgh et al 2018 and caused more than 80 fatalities and over 150 billion economic losses mostly due to the extraordinary flooding emanuel 2017 balaguru et al 2018 over the 5 day period from august 26 to 30 harvey dumped 92 7 109 m3 of water across texas and louisiana fritz and samenow 2017 making it the wettest tropical cyclone in the u s history the extraordinary amount of water load even caused up to 21 mm subsidence of earth s crust milliner et al 2018 a freshwater load of 14 109 m3 was estimated to discharge into galveston bay about 3 7 times the bay volume making the entire bay virtually fresh for several days du et al 2019a b the large freshwater load led to a prolonged restoration time for bay salinity with the bay wide average of 62 days which had profound impact on pollutant transport and estuarine ecosystem du and park 2019 du et al 2019a 2020 as many climate models predict a warmer and wetter future climate in parts of the us and the rest of the world and as evident from the record breaking atlantic hurricane season in 2020 including a number of very wet storms it is urgent to gain a deeper understanding of this type of extreme precipitation events as exemplified by harvey as explained by valle levinson et al 2020 the compounding effects were very significant during harvey near houston which had already been affected by flooding due to a smaller rainfall event before the storm during harvey the houston metropolitan area received multiple pulses punches of water from various sources the river flood from shipping channel in buffalo bayou cf fig 3a that cuts through the city the subsequent flooding in the larger tributary san jacinto to the north cf fig 3a which was hypothesized to have blocked the outflowing water from buffalo bayou and storm surges from the ocean that entered through the bay entrance they also suspected that various constrictions in the bay system might have caused significant backflow which ultimately caused a 3 5 m surge at manchester gauge in buffalo bayou e1 in fig 1b numerical models can serve as a powerful tool for the study of compound flooding and potential mitigation measures e g lewis et al 2019 ye et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however because the numerical models used in previous studies of harvey did not directly account for precipitation and the watershed ocean interactions significant knowledge gaps still exist on how different processes ocean rivers and rainfall interact to produce the observed compound surges during this extreme event for example wing et al 2019 used a 2d hydrologic model coupled to national water model nwm https water noaa gov about nwm last accessed in august 2020 for hurricane harvey forced by the boundary conditions from a simple storm surge model at the ocean side as a result the feedback from river to ocean surges was missing which we will show to be significant in this paper therefore in the present study we apply a recently developed 3d cross scale model ye et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 to examine the relative importance of multiple factors for the observed compound flooding in different areas of the galveston bay system a rich myriad of complex nonlinear interactions among processes has so far been identified however in this paper we will first focus on a very thorough model validation and some results from salient sensitivity tests we will focus on 3d model results only in this paper and omit the discussions on the comparison of results from the 2d and 3d models the latter has been carefully assessed in ye et al 2020 in general the 3d model has the advantage of being able to capture the baroclinic response of the ocean especially in the post storm adjustment thus giving a better prediction of the sub tidal elevations due to the interaction between large and small scale processes on the other hand the two model configurations yield similar results in the watershed which is not surprising since the 3d model morphs into the 2dh mode there cf section 2 3 in addition the 3d model is able to predict other relevant variables besides the surface elevation and depth averaged velocity during the storm such as the 3d velocity shear and tracer salinity and temperature etc stratification in the vertical and horizontal directions in the case of harvey large shear and stratification in the deep shipping channel during the event are revealed by our model the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area observation assets we utilize in this paper and model setup for the baseline and sensitivity simulations section 3 presents a comprehensive model validation for 2d and 3d variables inside and outside the bay as well as in the watershed section 4 focuses on the individual contributions from the three major forcings ocean rivers and precipitation and the nonlinear compound effects as revealed from the comparison between the baseline simulation with all three forcings applied simultaneously and the sensitivity simulations with only one forcing applied at a time a brief conclusion is summarized in section 5 2 methods 2 1 study site galveston bay located at the upper coast of texas along the northwestern gulf of mexico is the seventh largest estuary in the continental us it is also adjacent to the heavily urbanized and industrialized metropolis of houston which is connected to the gulf of mexico through an intricate system of bayous rivers and bays dorado et al 2015 galveston bay is a wide and shallow estuary with average depth of 2 m and total area of 1600 km2

2019 there are several sub bays including trinity bay in the northeast east west bays to the northeast southwest that are surrounded by galveston island and bolivar peninsula fig 3a and a few smaller embayments that connect b b and sjr to the main bay 2 2 observational data water level data were obtained from seven noaa gauges fig 1b 8770777 e1 manchester 8770613 e2 morgan point 8771013 e3 eagle

building on previous successes we have implemented a seamless creek to ocean schism 3d model zhang et al 2016 for the entire us east coast and gulf of mexico fig 1a schism is a general purpose 3d hydrodynamic model grounded on accurate robust and efficient semi implicit time stepping with no mode splitting and hybrid finite element finite volume methods on hybrid triangular quadrangular unstructured grids in the horizontal dimension and a highly flexible vertical gridding system in the vertical dimension lsc2 zhang et al 2015 a list of worldwide applications of schism can be found at schism wiki unlike in the hurricane irene study ye et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the model domain is now extended to include all major bays and estuaries in high resolution in us east coast and gulf of mexico this way we can address all potential land falling hurricanes in the us east coast and gulf of mexico regions the landward boundary is set at 10 m above navd88 to include most of coastal watersheds fig 3c with the grid resolution of 300 m furthermore higher resolutions are deployed in the focus area of this study galveston bay with average resolution of 150 m fig 1f overall the horizontal resolution varies from 1 m to 7 km with a statistic mode of 250 m and 50 of the elements having a finer resolution than 200 m fig 1e in addition all major geometric and bathymetric features manmade or otherwise are resolved in the grid in order to accurately capture localized processes that may impact compound surges from all potential flood events for example the finest resolution of 1 m is used to resolve some small scale structures e g galveston seawall and levees in the lower mississippi river fig 1d strictly speaking however a hydrostatic model such as ours cannot accurately capture the fine details of flow over small scale structures levees etc as the latter is non hydrostatic in nature due to large vertical acceleration however as explained by zhang et al 2020 if our focus is on the impact of such processes on the larger scales we can still use hydrostatic models to efficiently simulate the interactions all 284673 nwm river segments located inside our domain have been explicitly incorporated into our grid during the grid generation process cf ye et al 2020 in order to facilitate the routing of water in the watershed cf fig 1c altogether the horizontal unstructured grid has 2 2 million nodes and 4 4 million triangular quadrangular elements the 3d grid takes full advantage of schism s polymorphism zhang et al 2016 with variable number of vertical layers ranging from 44 in the deep ocean to capture the large scale processes to 1 in the watershed fig 3b in other words the model is 2dh in the watersheds the average number of vertical layers is 8 which results in greater efficiency customary of all schism applications no manipulation or smoothing of bathymetry was done in the computational grid after interpolating depths from dems including steep slopes in the caribbean and all shipping channels the vertical datum used in all simulations was navd88 12 cm above the local msl in the bay and the 3d model was able to largely capture the sub tidal variations locally ye et al 2020 the 3d model is initialized on august 4 2017 and run for 40 days to cover the entire storm event the very large freshwater outflow in this event makes the system memory of initial condition short other aspects of the setup largely follow those in ye et al 2020 the initial and ocean boundary conditions are from hycom https www hycom org data glbu0pt08 and fes2014 tidal database carrere et al 2016 since hycom results are not accurate nearshore the initial conditions there are interpolated from limited observation found there the atmospheric forcing is derived from era5 31 km resolution and a high resolution 9 km ecmwf product see cf acknowledgments precipitation data is from noaa s high resolution rapid refresh hrrr that uses a 3 km resolution an hourly updated cloud resolving convection allowing atmospheric model initialized by 3 km grids with 3 km radar assimilation https rapidrefresh noaa gov hrrr last accessed in august 2020 the watershed inflow from rivers is mostly derived from nwm version 2 0 and the flow is simply injected at 6752 intersecting locations between nwm segments and our land boundary fig 4b ye et al 2020 however the current version of nwm tends to over estimate the flow peaks at managed rivers brian cosgrove private comm as was the case for hurricane irene ye et al 2020 the errors in the river flows will greatly impact the predicted surges cf figs 4 and 5 therefore in the baseline setup we have replaced nwm flows at the two major rivers b b and sjr with either usgs observation at b b or a best estimate at sjr based on a flow stage relationship developed by twdb fig 4c d during harvey significant flooding occurred at all rivers and the sjr flow which peaked above 10000 m3 s is comparable to the total flow from the other 84 rivers discharging into galveston bay fig 4d therefore the uncertainty in the other river flows is also expected to impact the predicted surges note that the river flows injected at our model land boundary have indirectly incorporated the precipitation that occurred outside but not inside the model domain and therefore the addition of direct precipitation onto our model domain is justified and will be shown to exert a significant impact on the compound processes since we have no information on the scalar concentrations for river inflows and rainfall we applied 0 psu for salinity and ambient water temperature i e the temperature at the local receiving cell calculated without accounting for the rivers or raindrops for the injected water and also for the rainfall obviously the latter will impact the calculated temperature which is another source of uncertainty for the model results cf section 3 6 multiple simulation runs were done during the calibration process the baseline setup generally follows zhang et al 2020 and is briefly described here the time step was set at 100 s although 150 s led to very similar results the wetting and drying threshold was set at 10 6 m in order to capture very thin layer of water from rainfall initially zhang et al 2020 the air sea exchange scheme used was the bulk aerodynamic algorithm of zeng et al 1998 for heat and salt exchanges including precipitation and evaporation the air sea heat exchange was found to misbehave on very thin layer of water and was therefore turned off based on the local water depth the baseline run used 0 1 mm as the minimum threshold for the local total water depth section 3 7 will further discuss the sensitivity to this choice as stated in ye et al 2020 the bottom friction coefficients should be larger in the watershed for a national grid like this and in view of lack of bottom characteristic and bed form data in most bays not to mention the vegetation and building effects in the watershed we start from a simple friction parametrization function of bathymetry only the friction coefficients increase linearly from a constant 0 0025 in the ocean to 0 025 in the watershed as the bathymetry changes from 1 m to 3 m in the future fine tuning of friction in light of bottom characteristics information may be done for specific systems the turbulence closure scheme used generic length scale scheme of k kl umlauf and burchard 2003 but several other schemes yielded similar results observation at ndbc buoy 42019 located 120 km southwest of the bay in the deep ocean indicated a relatively modest sea state with maximum wave height of 6 m vs 10 m during hurricane ike in 2008 the wave height decreased quickly toward the shoreline and at the buoy nearest to the bay 42035 the maximum wave height was only 3 2 m results from a coupled wave current simulation not shown suggested a modest wave induced setup of up to 30 cm in some parts of the barrier islands only the dominant wave direction was from the south which was not conducive for the wave energy to penetrate into the bay through the narrow nw se oriented entrance more importantly the large freshwater outflow from the watershed which dominates the maximum elevations occurred a few days after the storm has made the landfall and so we found there is little difference in the predicted maximum elevation inside the bay i e the wave induced setups do not enhance the positive bias as shown in section 3 furthermore no wave induced overtopping flow across the barrier islands in the galveston bay was observed during the event anarde et al 2020 therefore we will not discuss further the wave effects in this paper the baseline and important sensitivity runs presented in this paper are described in table 1 the baseline is a 3d baroclinic run with river flows oceanic and atmospheric forcing and direct precipitation onto the model domain for river flows the b b flow was from usgs gauges and sjr flow was derived from a flow stage relationship from twdb as discussed before the nwm results were used for all other river flows which will likely introduce biases also three sensitivity runs were designed to separately assess three major forcing factors ocean river flows and direct precipitation and a detailed description for these runs is given in section 4 another experiment was done with all river flows including b b and sjr using nwm values in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of surges to different estimates of river flows the last sensitivity run in table 1 was used to assess the impact of the threshold used in the air sea heat exchange on temperature results cf section 3 7 all simulation runs achieved performance of 49 times faster than real time on 800 cores of sciclone cluster https www wm edu offices it services researchcomputing acctreq index php last accessed in august 2020 or 80 times faster than real time on 2000 cores of nasa s pleiades another important caveat is that no groundwater runoff or infiltration is explicitly included in schism although nwm has incorporated some of these effects a future task is to assess the local runoffs provided by nwm although these are expected to have a minor impact for the maximum surges during harvey note that the nwm domain partially overlaps our model domain thus allowing us to inter compare some flow results between the two models cf section 3 5 3 model validation and discussion before applying the current model to specific events like harvey we had first validated the model for tides and sub tides for the entire east coast and gulf of mexico some results in the galveston bay area can be seen below before the storm a comprehensive presentation of the tidal results for other bays and estuaries is out of scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere however to set the stage for the discussion of total elevation in the next subsection we remark first that the averaged complex error for the most dominant frequency k1 calculated as 1 c e a o cos ϕ o a m cos ϕ m 2 a o sin ϕ o a m sin ϕ m 2 for a non storm period aug 9 to sep 9 2011 for the same 7 stations is only 3 7 cm which serves as the lower bound for the model errors for all periods in eq 1 a o and a m are amplitudes from observation and model respectively and ϕ o and ϕ m are phases respectively 3 1 compound surges the model calculated water levels are compared with the noaa observations fig 5 overall the baseline model results show a good agreement with the observations with an averaged mae of 0 13 m and cross correlation of 0 94 comparison of mae and the complex error shown above suggests that the total error is dominated by the storm signals not tidal signals note that the 3d model is able to largely capture both the tidal and sub tidal variations with reference to navd88 more importantly the model captured the high surges that were sustained for 5 days at all stations the maximum surge is 1 m in most part of the main bay but the compound effects have led to a 3 5 m surge at the b b station e1 valle levinson et al 2020 a later and higher second surge occurred at e1 only which is mostly due to the compound river effect and to a lesser extent precipitation effect cf section 4 relatively large errors are found at upstream stations e1 e3 and are attributed to the uncertainty in the river flows as demonstrated by the comparison among model results driven by different flows at b b and sjr in particular the larger flows from nwm fig 4 have led to higher and overestimated surges at e1 e3 green lines in fig 5 but the effect of the timing differences in the flow peaks between nwm and baseline fig 4d is also clearly seen at these stations the earlier decline in the nwm flow has produced a better phase match with the observation for the retreating wave around august 31 while the baseline results showed a delayed response in the retreat fig 5 on the other hand using the upstream flow for sjr gauge 08070200 which almost certainly underestimates the true flow has led to dramatically underestimated and short lived surges especially at e1 blue dashed lines in fig 5 note that e2 and e3 are also influenced by other nearby rivers whose flows are also uncertain the comparison serves as a direct evidence that the peak outflow from sjr that occurred about a day later than the b b peak flow is the main reason for the later and higher surge at the b b station e1 on august 30 as sjr flow was blocking the outflow from b b valle levinson et al 2020 the results suggest that the river flows account for the largest uncertainties for the simulated surges upstream and better estimates of sjr and other river flows should further improve the model results unfortunately there is no direct measurement on the sjr outflow from the lake houston dam empirical functions have been used by twdb to estimate the outflow based on monitored water level at lake houston dale crockett private communication the function presumably only works under normal condition when water level does not exceed the dam s maximum capacity it is doubtful the empirical function is applicable during harvey as water was spilled over the dam during the peak flow the overall freshwater input to galveston bay during harvey has been estimated by du et al 2019a b and thyng et al 2020 with the values ranging widely from 12 to 22 billion cubic meters considering this large range of uncertainty and the fact that the total freshwater inflow into the bay is 3 7 times the bay volume the model error of 0 5 m in the predicted maximum surges at the upstream stations e1 e3 is quite reasonable while we acknowledge these uncertainties we deem that the analysis below about the compounding factors for the flooding will not be greatly affected by these uncertainties as we focus more on the difference between sensitivity runs and the baseline on the other hand the compound surges at other stations including the sheltered stations e4 e7 behind the barrier islands are all well simulated 3 2 high water marks hwms represent the highest water level reached during the storm event at a specific location simulated hwms are compared with 510 usgs field estimates collected during post disaster survey in the region including galveston bay sabin lake and calcasieu lake fig 6 the vertical datum used in the hwms is navd88 but the quality of the local dems varies which partly contributes to the model errors the overall mae is 0 65 m with a positive bias of 0 32 m indicating a general overestimation by the model the hot spots of relatively large errors occur in the lake charles region north of calcasieu lake fig 6c which is likely caused by the larger uncertainty in the dems used there the mae would be reduced to 0 58 m if this region were excluded the combination of the smaller errors in most of the galveston bay region fig 6c expected larger model errors on high ground 24 of the bottom elevations at those points are above 5 m and the high correlation between the observation and model fig 6d with the correlation coefficient being 0 96 indicates an overall satisfactory performance of our model the mae in this study appears to be lower than that in wing et al 2019 although they included many observation points outside our domain 3 3 inundation spatial extent the hwms serve as a more rigorous validation of modeled water levels and given accurate dems flood depths but shed little light on the spatial limit of inundation during the storm event the latter was estimated by fema using hwms from harris county flood control district usgs surveys and other inspection data elevation data comprised a mosaic of 3 m resampled elevations from 1 and 3 m lidar and ifsar data with one erroneous ifsar data replaced with a blended 10 m section note that this estimation inherently contains errors and uncertainties as described by watson et al 2018 therefore in assessing the modeled inundation we will only assess the extent to which the model captured the overall spatial pattern of the flooding by comparing the hit rate h r defined as 2 h r m 1 b 1 where m 1 indicates the total area of observed wet cells correctly captured by the model true wet and b 1 represents the total area of wet cells from the field estimates observation the h r therefore can be interpreted as the proportion of observed flooded areas that is successfully reproduced by the model wing et al 2019 it ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 indicating no match between model and observation and 1 indicating a perfect match it penalizes false dry errors and is thus a measure of the model s tendency to underpredict the flood extent wing et al 2019 note that the observation here contains no dry spots so we cannot assess the model error for false wet comparison of the inundation extent from model and observation indicates that the model mostly reproduces the observed flooded areas with false dry areas found in the watershed of matagorda bay brazoria river west of galveston bay and north of anahuac national wildlife refuge in the galveston bay fig 7 the overall hit rate however is very high 0 92 indicating that the model is capable of reproducing the observed flooding pattern 3 4 velocity having thoroughly validated the model for water level we now turn our attention to 3d variables in the next subsections as stated in introduction comparing to 2d models 3d models like schism have the advantage of being able to provide better sub tidal elevations and more complete 3d information about the event as shown in du and park 2019 some of the 3d information is critical for our understanding of how the ecosystem is altered by the storm beyond inundation observation at two tabs stations in galveston bay offers rare insight into the sheer magnitude of the punches from the river flood valle levinson et al 2020 station g08010 fred hartman bridge at the upper shipping channel downstream of the confluence of sjr and b b and station g06010 at the bay entrance e2 and e5 respectively in fig 1b the observed peak outflow exceeded 3 m s at g08010 despite data gap and 2 m s at the bay entrance station g06010 fig 8 the upper bay velocity data showed no inflows over 8 days between august 26 and september 3 and no tidal fluctuations between august 28 and september 2 at the bay entrance station there were tidal fluctuations but no inflows for 5 days all of these observed features are successfully captured by the model fig 8 in addition there is also occasionally large shear and stratification at the deep station e5 particularly during the large outflow not shown which obviously cannot be captured by a 2d model 3 5 watershed flows nwm provides flow outputs for part of the coastal watershed within our model domain which can be qualitatively compared to schism flow results across the river channels note that nwm is essentially a 1d model while schism is 3d as nwm and schism use very different flow routing algorithms muskingum cunge channel routing for nwm and shallow water equations for schism a qualitative agreement between the two modeled flows would be reassuring since nwm results do not yet include tidal signal a 30 hour low pass filter was applied to the schism results before the comparison comparison of the flow rates at t1 b b near manchester at which the usgs observed flow data are also available indicates that the schism computed flow reproduces the usgs observation well with some overestimation fig 9a likely due to precipitation added inside our domain on the other hand nwm output at this transect is more than twice of the observed closer to the main bay into the tidal environment we found a general agreement between nwm and schism flows at t2 clear lake and t3 dickinson bayou fig 9b c the differences are attributed to the different flow routing algorithms used as shown in section 4 2 pluvial effect at t3 may also play a role in making the difference it is reassuring that the schism and nwm flows generally agree with each other at these two interior locations 3 6 salinity and temperature salinity and temperature are important environmental variables for both large and small scale processes ye et al 2020 examined the relationship between the large scale gulf stream and compound flooding inside delaware bay during hurricane irene and found that the prevailing surface slope induced by the gulf stream played an important role in blocking the outflow during the post storm water level re adjustment du and park 2019 used schism to study the recovery time for bay salinity after harvey and found that it took an average of two months for the salinity over the entire bay to recover the model validation for the large scale is shown in appendix and here we focus on the response in the bay during harvey the large freshwater load 3 7 times the bay volume has led to freshening of the bay du and park 2019 and created large salinity gradients afterward fig 10 the enormous pulse of freshwater drastically transformed the bay salinity condition dropping the salinity from 30 psu to 0 within 3 days even at the bay entrance and leaving the whole bay fresh for 2 days starting from around september 1 the ocean water started to re intrude into the bay fig 10a but the full restoration of salinity there did not happen until two months later du and park 2019 the bay temperature on the other hand exhibits a synchronous drop of 5 c during the passage of the cold wake of the storm around august 30 fig 10 the most upstream station oldr just downstream of the trinity river mouth however showed a slightly delayed response fig 10h likely due to different heat content of river water that was eventually mixed with the bay water the lack of information on the water temperature in the rivers makes it difficult to assess its impact the current model application did a good job in capturing the above mentioned processes with validation of temperature and salinity as summarized in fig 10 in particular the dramatic drop and gradual recovery of the bay salinity were captured in terms of both magnitude and timing the synchronous drop in the bay temperature was also captured albeit with small cold biases the largest error occurred at the most upstream station oldr where the model at times showed a 2 c cold bias this bias was attributed to the uncertainties in the water temperature boundary conditions specifically the unknown temperature in the river flows injected at the model land boundary and to a lesser extent the unknown temperature of the rainwater both are assumed to be at the ambient model temperature which is not a good assumption overall the averaged maes for temperature and salinity are 1 4 c and 1 7 psu respectively normalized by the mean observation the scaled maes are respectively 0 06 and 0 22 addressing the uncertainties in the watershed temperature should be a priority in the future 3 7 sensitivity of temperature to threshold depth for air sea exchange the temperature skill was also found to be sensitive to the heat fluxes calculated from the air sea exchange model used in schism zeng et al 1998 this is because large areas of watershed are covered with thin layer of water e g from rainfall initially where small errors in the calculated heat fluxes would lead to large temperature swings due to the small water mass there therefore the exchange is best to be deactivated when the water depth falls below a threshold to demonstrate that the choice of the threshold used in the baseline is robust an additional simulation was conducted to test the sensitivity of modeled temperature to this choice sensitivity run 6 in table 1 results suggest that thresholds lower than 1 mm would have a relatively minor influence on the calculated temperature fig 11 and therefore the choice of 0 1 mm in the baseline run is acceptable 4 compound effects of oceanic fluvial and pluvial origins in this section we will assess the individual contributions from three forcing factors ocean river and rainfall three sensitivity runs were conducted using only one factor in each run sensitivity runs 2 4 in table 1 specifically ocean only simulation includes all processes of oceanic origin tides gulf stream atmospheric forcing etc but excludes the effects from river flows injected at the land boundary and precipitation rivers only simulation turns off all oceanic and atmospheric forcing ocean as lake and precipitation with the only forcing coming from river flows at our land boundary similarly the only forcing in precipitation only simulation is the precipitation note that the rivers only simulation indirectly includes precipitation that occurred outside the model domain which contributed to the river flows injected at the land boundary but not the direct precipitation inside the model domain strictly speaking turning on off precipitation or rivers affects the bay salinity but this effect is deemed minor for surges therefore the three factors are mostly orthogonal to each other and it is a common practice in many other models as reviewed by santiago collazo et al 2019 to use the sum to represent the compound flood by implicitly assuming linearity comparison of this sum to the current baseline model results thus reveals the nonlinear compound effects 4 1 impact of compounding factors on the total water level a calibrated model like ours allows us to assess the contributions from each of the three forcing factors on the total water level fig 12 the ocean induced storm surge is on the order of 1 m at all stations except at e4 which is located in a small sheltered embayment on the eastern end of east bay rollover bay behind bolivar peninsula where the surge is slightly lower note that there is a small man made inlet near e4 connecting the rollover bay to the gulf which sometimes gets clogged hence the water level at e4 tends to be more erratic all of the ocean induced surges reached their peaks on aug 26 followed by a steady decline afterward and all showed a negative set down around aug 31 as the water withdrew from the bay and tidal oscillations were restored which is typical in all storm surges however the more sheltered station e4 showed more complex processes of wave reflection and water stacking comparison between the ocean only results and the observation indicates that the ocean alone can adequately explain the surges at the coastal stations e5 e7 and also the initial surges at the upstream stations e1 e3 but the ocean induced surges there were not sustained as long as the observation in addition part of the initial surge at e1 is not of ocean origin fig 12 the fluvial effect is very significant at e1 e4 not surprisingly the effect increases toward upstream rivers and watershed fig 12 at e1 this effect dwarfs the other two factors even at the entrance station e5 the fluvial effect is still visible the fluvial peaks lag the storm surge by 2 days the pluvial effect is smaller than the other two factors at all stations except e4 where local stacking of water seems to be severe possibly due to the very small inlet there still the pluvial effect accounts for up to 30 cm of surge at the upstream stations e1 e4 and tends to be synergistic with the fluvial forcing in raising the surge level fig 12 in summary e1 is heavily dominated by river flows and all three factors are important at e1 e4 the downstream stations e5 e7 are heavily dominated by the ocean factor the three factors work in tandem to sustain the surge for over 5 days due to their different arrival times as the ocean surge is retreating the arrival of river and rainfall induced flood is crucial in re raising the water level fig 12 the compound effects are most severe at upstream stations however the factors do not always reinforce each other a prominent example is seen around august 29 at e1 when the river alone would have led to a higher surge than the baseline but the latter is partially offset by the withdrawing flow decreasing water level from the ocean source during this period therefore the time history of different forcing factors is very important for compound flooding processes 4 2 impact of compounding factors on flow like the water levels the flow in the bay and watershed is expected to be dominated by different forcings at different locations river and or precipitation may dominate watershed locations while oceanic forcing is expected to be important for bay locations this hypothesis is tested here using the 3 transects cf fig 9 the oceanic effects turn out to be relatively minor at all 3 transects when compared with the other two factors fig 13 both river and precipitation effects are significant at t1 and t2 at t3 the river factor is minor and most of the flow there came from local rainfall at all locations the sum of the flows calculated from the three factors is close to the baseline results albeit with some discrepancies in the form of over estimation at t1 and under estimation at t2 and t3 which indicates nonlinear compound effects for flow it is likely that the situation at t1 is more complex than the other two transects because it is located near the two largest rivers and additional blocking of the outflow from b b by sjr provided by the inclusion of precipitation effects in the baseline might have reduced the t1 flow as compared to the linear superposition an important finding here is that imposing inflow boundary condition alone in a typical coastal watershed domain while neglecting local precipitation may considerably underestimate the resultant flow 4 3 contributions from each forcing in different regions to better understand the spatial variability of the impacts of the three factors on water levels we first introduce the concept of disturbance for compound flooding processes that involve both ocean and watershed neither the water surface elevation nor the water depth is a satisfactory metric because the nominally large water elevations on the high ground of watershed are dominated by the high bottom elevation there and the large water depths in the bays and ocean are dominated by the local bathymetry on the other hand what we often need is the departure of water level from the initial state therefore here we define disturbance d as 3 d η i f h 0 η h i f h 0 where η is the water surface elevation and h is the bathymetry with h 0 for ocean and h 0 for watershed basically d represents the departure from initial condition either the initial water surface or bottom whichever is higher note that d is continuous across h 0 and dependent on the vertical datum used on the initially dry ground of watershed d simply represents the local water depth which is usually smaller than h whereas at initially wet locations d is simply the surface elevation d is also a smoother metric to measure the compound effects as one transitions from oceanic into riverine regimes in the analysis here we will first neglect the nonlinear compound effects and examine the contributions of each factor to the total disturbance in the form of the ratio of the maximum disturbance from each factor to the total sum so that the sum of the 3 ratios is equal to 1 although the compound effects are ignored here the ratios can still shed light on places where the compound effects may be potentially important i e any non red regions in fig 14 the oceanic factor dominates in the coastal ocean 98 but accounts for less than 80 of the total in the lower bay less than 60 in the upper bay and low lying rivers the river factor dominates in the watershed regions with existing river network but also accounts for 30 and 10 in the upper and lower bay respectively the direct precipitation is significant mostly on high ground in the watershed but still accounts for 10 in the bay and more near the river network these findings are consistent with the previous analysis for the impact of the three factors on water level section 4 1 which showed small influence from the ocean at the upstream stations e1 e3 where the pluvial and fluvial effects play significant roles it is also in line with the conclusion on the impact of three factors on the flows fig 13 in particular t2 and t3 happened to be located inside a region heavily influenced by precipitation fig 14c 4 4 compound ratio the results shown in the previous section did not account for the nonlinear compound effects the latter can be assessed by comparing the sum of the results from the three factors to the baseline we define the compound ratio as the ratio between the maximum disturbance from the baseline and the sum of the three maximum disturbances at a given location 4 c r max d j 1 3 max d j the denominator is a conservative estimate of the total maximum disturbance because the maxima from each factor may occur at different times cf fig 12 therefore the compound ratio calculated this way is generally no greater than 1 compound ratios close to 1 indicate negligible compound effects and any values far from 1 indicate significant nonlinear compound effects as shown in fig 15 the compound effects are generally weak in the coastal ocean and portions of lower bay where the ocean factor dominates and on the high ground in the watershed where the precipitation is the sole source but are significant elsewhere in the east and west bays upper bay and watershed areas with river network etc near the maximum inundation extent in the barrier islands in the wildlife refuge north of east bay and in parts of the northern watershed of b b the baseline maximum actually exceeds the sum of three factors suggesting localized amplifications there one possible explanation is that these regions correspond to where two factors are about equally important fig 14 these results demonstrate that summing up the results from model runs forced by individual factors would overestimate in most regions by at least 20 and thus a single model that incorporates all factors should be used to avoid the large biases 5 conclusions hurricane harvey 2017 represents an extreme case for compound flooding due to record breaking precipitation and ensuing river flood in the texas and louisiana coasts the excess freshwater dumped into galveston bay also profoundly changed the physical and biological systems with a prolonged recovery time to fill in our knowledge gaps for this important event we have successfully validated a 3d creek to ocean model and used the model to assess the contributions from all major forcing factors ocean rivers and precipitation the major findings from this study are summarized as follows 1 coastal watersheds are considerably more complex than other types of watersheds with a myriad of competing factors from ocean rivers atmosphere wind heat fluxes and precipitation and groundwater not accounted for in this paper 2 compound effects are highly nonlinear and so simulating the impact of each source ocean river and rainfall separately and summing them up would lead to large errors therefore the compound flooding studies are best carried out using a single model that integrates across all factors 3 treating watershed flows as boundary conditions and neglecting direct precipitation in a typical coastal watershed may result in large errors in downstream flow delivery and surges the well validated 3d model presented in this paper has so far revealed many other interesting aspects of the compound flooding that have not been discussed in this paper role of manmade structures levees dams etc and constrictions on flow routing and surges impact of the large and persistent freshwater plume on coastal regions etc note that forecasts for atmospheric and hydrologic conditions already exist in noaa and other agencies and given the realism across a broad range of spatial scales and model efficiency as demonstrated in this paper an operational forecast based on the current study is being tested at noaa this study also exposes some remaining critical knowledge gaps the compound flooding results are shown to be particularly sensitive to several key factors river flows dems especially bathymetry in small rivers boundary condition for temperature in the watershed and atmospheric forcing wind air pressure various heat fluxes and precipitation and evaporation the accuracy of the predicted surges is critically dependent on the river flows dems and atmospheric forcing in the ocean and bay and therefore a critical need in the future is to further improve the accuracy of the hydrologic and atmospheric models as well as the nearshore seamless bathymetry topography information that models rely on declaration of competing interest the authors

23927,understanding the trajectory of oil droplets in crossflow jets is important to estimate the pathways of hydrocarbons and to plan countermeasures we report experimental results of an oil jet with release velocity around 1 5 m s in a crossflow of 0 3 m s the hydrodynamics of the jet obtained with the large eddy simulation les were used to predict the migration of the oil droplets two lagrangian techniques were explored one with the inertia of the droplet is considered and the other that treats the droplets as massless particles with rising velocities corresponding to their size we did not note a large difference between the two approaches the droplets showed stronger segregation in the vertical direction which renders the usage of a gaussian distribution approximation in the vertical inapplicable the dispersion coefficient at each direction was computed for different sized droplets the eddy diffusivity computed based on boussinesq gradient approximation using the les data was compared with the dispersion coefficients obtained based on lagrangian tracking we also found that droplets 500 μ m and larger escape the vortex while smaller ones get trapped within the vortex a similar outcome was observed using a vortex trapping function based on inward outward force balancing at the elevation of the vortex core the counter rotating vortex pair cvp altered the distribution of droplets of 1 mm and smaller significantly and bimodal concentration distributions with peaks near the cvp vortex cores and minimum concentration near the center plane were obtained in the lateral horizontal direction therefore measurements of the oil droplet size distribution dsd in the center plane of crossflow jets could underestimate the number of small droplets in the whole plume keywords jet in crossflow lagrangian particle tracking dispersion coefficient eddy diffusivity counter rotating vortex pair vortex trapping 1 introduction the size of an oil droplet emanating from an underwater blowout is important as it determines its trajectory and fate large droplets rise faster in the water column zhao et al 2015 and dissolve and or biodegrade slower than smaller ones gros et al 2017 socolofsky et al 2019 a recent comprehensive review by boufadel et al 2020 detailed the effects of the droplet size distribution and the chemistry of oil droplets on multiphase oil plumes the interest in the droplet formation and transport increased following the deepwater horizon disaster which occurred at 1500 m depth of the gulf of mexico in 2010 reddy et al 2012 although that plume was vertical in a stratified environment there is also interest in understanding multiphase plumes in crossflow droplet transport in crossflow plumes is crucial to estimate the fate of oil droplets and has been addressed through experiments that simulated large scale 300 diameters from the orifice plume socolofsky et al 2002 in contrast to vertical plumes i e no crossflow the spatial distribution of droplets cannot be assumed axisymmetric due to the different rise velocity of droplets based on their size socolofsky et al 2002 and different hydrodynamics obtained for jets in crossflow the discrete large droplets are separated from the entrained water due to their higher individual buoyancy socolofsky et al 2002 there are several experimental works cheung 1991 socolofsky et al 2002 tian and roberts 2003 gopalan et al 2004 milanovic et al 2012 murphy et al 2016 and numerical studies yuan et al 1999 muldoon and acharya 2006 muppidi and mahesh 2007 bodart et al 2013 behzad et al 2016 for the jet in crossflow in most of the work in the literature the fluids are miscible or only single phase and do not create discrete droplets in the experimental work of cheung 1991 hot water was injected into the crossflow to create a buoyant plume and the dilution along its path was quantified based on the variation of the temperature muppidi and mahesh 2007 conducted single phase direct numerical simulation dns of a jet in crossflow and reported the turbulent kinetic energy budgets in the near and far field of the plume gopalan et al 2004 revealed the two dimensional velocity field of the jet in crossflow using particle image velocimetry piv technique at low jet to crossflow velocity ratios r between 0 5 and 2 5 different types of coherent vortical structures such as wake vortices and counter rotating vortex pair arise due to the interaction between the jet and crossflow the elongated tornado like wake vortices originate from the leeward side of the plume milanovic et al 2012 daskiran et al 2020 and move downward in the vertical direction although they resemble the vortex street behind a solid cylinder they are actually dissimilar fric and roshko 1994 since the wake vortices are located beneath the plume with a relatively smaller size with respect to cvp their role in mixing across the plume is not robust the cvp was considered as the signature of jets in crossflow becoming the only structure persisting in the far field of the plume cambonie et al 2013 mahesh 2013 the increase in velocity ratio delays the counter rotating vortex pair cvp formation smith and mungal 1998 mahesh 2013 since the jet starts to resemble a vertical jet with increasing r the cvp induces upward velocity along the centerline of the plume and downward velocity along the sides of the plume moreover it creates outward velocity near the top and inward velocity near the lower part of the plume blanchard et al 1999 investigated the evolution of the size of each vortex left and right vortices in cvp in the lateral and vertical directions and reported negligible asymmetry up to x d 20 they observed cvp near the orifice after four pipe diameters away from the orifice in crossflow direction cambonie et al 2013 compared the jet centerline trajectory to the cvp trajectories at different velocity ratios from 0 5 to 3 0 and found that the cvp trajectory scales with the jet to crossflow momentum ratio and the crossflow boundary layer thickness they also studied the influence of jet velocity jet velocity profile and crossflow velocity on cvp trajectory salewski et al 2007 conducted single and multiphase simulations for jets in crossflow for the same momentum and mass flow ratios they reported stronger cvp and weaker wake vortices for the multiphase case with droplets several models including the visjet by cheung et al 2000 the corjet by jirka 2004 and the tamoc by socolofsky et al 2015 can estimate the trajectories and dilution of plumes in crossflow based on the eulerian or lagrangian integral method however these models do not account for the cvp and hence assume self similar velocity and concentration distribution across the plume ignoring the cvp can also cause incorrect estimation of the plume dilution especially for immiscible plumes in which the dispersed phase i e bubbles or droplets is affected by the flow induced by the continuous phase recently murphy et al 2016 conducted oil jet experiments by towing the pipe horizontally to mimic the crossflow they obtained the droplet size distribution near the core of the left side vortex of the cvp through images obtained by mini holocam cameras almost all of the droplets obtained near the vortex core were smaller than 200 μ m which suggested that droplets smaller than 200 μ m were trapped inside the vortex since they also observed 3 mm to 5 mm droplets near the upper boundary of the plume in this work we conducted experiments of a vertical oil release in crossflow and we measured the oil droplet size distribution at downstream distances and we investigated the transport of individual droplets of comparable sizes to the measured values we also applied continuous release of different sized droplets from the vortex cores and monitored the number of droplets that remain trapped inside the cvp the hydrodynamics used herein was obtained in our prior work with large eddy simulation les daskiran et al 2020 to our best knowledge this is the first numerical work investigating the vortex trapping for jets in crossflow moreover we investigated the transport of oil droplets of various sizes through the lagrangian particle tracking approach the location of the droplet cloud centroid and the variance and dispersion coefficient of the droplet cloud estimated with the kinematics approach and newton s second law were compared the role of the drag buoyancy added mass pressure gradient and lift force on droplet transport were investigated the turbulent diffusion coefficient was computed based on boussinesq gradient approximation from les data and compared to the dispersion coefficient in different directions 2 methods and materials the hydrodynamics and characteristics of the oil jet in crossflow were addressed in our previous work daskiran et al 2020 in which simulated plume trajectory was compared to our experiments at ohmsett tank www ohmsett com in leonardo new jersey the oil was released from a 25 mm one inch diameter vertical orifice with a flow rate of 40 liters min the system was towed at a speed of 0 27 m s generating a relative crossflow this resulted in a jet to crossflow velocity ratio r u o i l u 5 0 and a jet to crossflow momentum ratio r m ρ o i l u o i l 2 ρ u 2 4 6 the velocity ratio is an important parameter for characterizing the flow field of jets in crossflow friedman and katz 2002 muppidi and mahesh 2007 milanovic et al 2012 mahesh 2013 a velocity ratio smaller than 10 0 represents a strong crossflow ghosh and hunt 1998 in the les simulation detailed in daskiran et al 2020 a pipe with a length of 50 cm 20d where d is the pipe diameter was placed 8d above the tank bottom similar to the experiments the pipe was placed 160d away from the crossflow inlet and 240d away from the channel outlet the orifice was 70d away from the water surface a top hat velocity profile was assigned at the pipe inlet which became sheared at the orifice and a top hat horizontal velocity profile was adopted at the crossflow inlet with a speed of 0 27 m s mimicking the towing speed in the experiments at the outlet a zero gradient condition normal to the outlet boundary was imposed for the velocity and constant gauge pressure of 0 pa atmospheric pressure was adopted a no slip condition was assigned to the inner and outer surfaces of the pipe and the bottom surface of the computational domain a zero shear condition was adopted for the side boundaries of the domain and the water free surface initially a top hat velocity profile was adopted inside the pipe filled with oil and a horizontal velocity of 0 27 m s was set in crossflow direction outside of the pipe a total of 20 million mesh elements were used in the les simulation the mesh was refined inside the oil plume region based on the snapshots from the experiments the cell size varied in the range of 2 mm to 8 mm by coarsening along the plume path the cell size outside of the oil plume was increased gradually to 32 mm and then increased to 64 mm near the domain boundaries far away from the region of interest the images of droplets near the top and bottom boundaries of the plume were taken using two shadowgraph cameras that consist of illumination and camera pods between which the droplets pass through and captured with the camera the gap between the illumination and the camera can be adjusted based on the concentration of oil for the cases with higher oil droplet concentration a smaller gap becomes favorable to avoid dark images due to back to back droplets across the gap the maximum droplet size is another parameter to determine the gap size in our experiments the gap for the top and bottom shadowgraph cameras was 3 4 cm and 2 0 cm respectively the top camera was placed at x y z 66 4d 1 6d 56 7d where the origin 0 0 0 was placed at the center of the pipe exit the bottom camera was placed at x y z 76 4d 1 2d 32d the field of view was 65 4 mm 49 1 mm for the top camera and 33 6 mm 24 6 mm for the bottom camera the speed of the top camera was higher with 24 fps while the speed of the bottom camera was 8 fps the flow parameters and properties of the oil fuel oil 2 are reported in table 1 the crossflow is in the x direction and the jet is in the z direction the origin was placed at the center of the pipe orifice

stokes rans modeling and using sub grid eddy diffusivity d s g s in large eddy simulation les raman et al 2005 since a portion of the turbulent velocity has already been resolved the unresolved

is the time step the sub grid eddy diffusivity was estimated by assuming constant sub grid schmidt number s c s g s of 1 0 where s c s g s ν s g s d s g s and ν s g s is sub grid eddy viscosity the sub grid eddy viscosity was computed using the smagorinsky sgs model smagorinsky 1963 in les given by 3 v s g s c s δ 2 s where c s is the smagorinsky constant taken as 0 168 in the present study δ is the local grid size and s 2 s i j s i j is the strain rate magnitude where s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i is the strain rate tensor and u i is the resolved velocity by les we used two different approaches to obtain the velocity vector u p u p v p w p in eq 1 i kinematics approach and ii newton s second law 2 2 kinematics approach in this approach the fluid velocity components are assigned to the droplet velocity in the vertical direction the terminal rise velocity of the droplet is added to the fluid velocity vector u f u f v f w f as follows 4a u p u f 4b v p v f 4c w p w f w t where u f v f and w f are fluid velocity components in x y and z directions and w t is the terminal rise velocity of droplet due to buoyancy the terminal rise velocity of droplets of diameter d is given by white

can be estimated using the schiller naumann drag coefficient model schiller 1935 given by 6 c d 24 1 0 15 re r 0 687 re r re r 1000 0 44 re r 1000 the relative reynold number re r in the equation above is defined as 7 re r ρ w u f u p d μ w here μ w is the dynamic viscosity of water and u f u p is the magnitude of the slip velocity which is the velocity resulting from the difference between the droplet velocity and the fluid velocity the influence of the droplet deformation on the drag force was investigated for the droplet sizes considered and the current method for the droplet terminal velocity eq 5 was found to be agreeing well with the prior work by clift et al 2005 and zheng and yapa 2000 see the comparison in table 2 2 2 1 newton s second law in newton s approach the droplet motion is governed by the equation of motion which is newton s second law following earlier works saffman 1965 maxey and riley 1983 eames 2008 bakhoday paskyabi 2015 the equation of motion can be

was calculated based on eqs 6 7 the buoyancy force could be upward or downward depending on the density of the fluid around the droplet upward in water for oil the added mass term results from the fact that the droplet accelerates or decelerates the surrounding fluid the pressure gradient induces motion from high pressure to low pressure zones in the flow field the lift force causes displacement of the droplet normal to the direction of the continuous phase eq 1 was solved using the fourth order runge kutta scheme hairer et al 1987 eq 8 is nonlinear and solved using the implicit picard s iterative method istok 1989 connelly and kokini 2007 the time step size used in the les was 7 10 5 s after the flow reached quasi steady behavior ensuring the courant friedrichs lewy condition cfl number less than unity the hydrodynamics from the les was saved for each 0 05 s and used herein for particle tracking the time step size used in both the kinematics and newton approaches was 2 0 10 3 s in two dimensional simulations and 2 5 10 4 s in three dimensional simulations for all droplet sizes considered since the time step size in the lagrangian approach was smaller than the frequency of the data obtained from the les linear interpolation was applied to two consecutive les data the cell size was 5 mm 0 2d in both 2d and 3d simulations 2 3 spatial moments of oil droplets the method of moments was used to compute the motion of droplet cloud centroid and the dispersion of the droplet cloud fischer et al 1979 these variables can be considered upscaled quantities of the plume and have been used in our previous studies boufadel et al 2006 2007 geng et al 2016 the moments can be computed numerically as follows 9 m c q t i 1 n m i s c i t q q 0 1 2 where n is the total

m c 0 t 2 here m i is the mass of an oil droplet which can be set to 1 0 since same sized droplets were released for each simulation and all same sized droplets are assumed to be of equal mass the dispersion coefficient in direction c is given by 12 e c t 1 2 d d t σ c 2 2 4 computation of eddy diffusivity through les simulation the eddy viscosity was extracted from the les through boussinesq gradient approximation muldoon and acharya 2006 pichler et al 2016 ling et al 2017 which was given by 13 v t i 1 3 j i 3 2 3 k δ i j s i j u i u j s i j i 1 3 j i 3 2 s i j s i j 14 where k 1 2 u i 2 here k is turbulent kinetic energy and s i j is the mean strain rate tensor which was computed using the spatial derivations of time averaged resolved velocity components the fluctuating component of the resolved velocity was computed as follows 15 u i u i u i where u i is the resolved velocity by les and u i is the time averaged resolved velocity in the computation of eddy diffusivity constant turbulent schmidt number s c t 1 0 gualtieri et al 2017 which is the ratio of eddy viscosity v t to eddy diffusivity d t was assumed 2 5 dimensionless formulation in literature the characteristic length scale for a jet in crossflow is the diameter of the pipe d and the characteristic time scale is the ratio of the pipe diameter to the crossflow speed d u muppidi and mahesh 2007 galeazzo et al 2013 the eddy diffusivity can be normalized by the product of the jet velocity at the pipe orifice and the pipe diameter u o i l d coletti et al 2013 ryan et al 2017 or by the product of the crossflow speed and the pipe diameter u d ling et al 2017 the latter was adopted herein to make the modeling results comparable to other studies with different flow parameters the flow parameters were normalized as follows 16 x x d y y d z z d t t d u u u u v v u w w u and d t d t u d 3 results fig 1a shows the oil plume from our experiments the plume was opaque near the field of the plume x d 14 and large clearances were observed at x d 14 32 42 and 54 inside the plume in the vertical direction which might be related to the variability in oil flow rate experimental errors and or the strong crossflow with a jet to crossflow velocity ratio of 5 0 two shadowgraph cameras were placed near the top and bottom boundaries of the plume to record images of droplets numerical simulations of the jet in crossflow were conducted using les simulation coupled with the mixture multiphase model daskiran et al 2020 fig 1b shows the simulated plume holdup oil content from les as a snapshot the outline of the plume observed in the experiment is also superimposed the simulated lower boundary of the plume matched well with the observations however the simulated upper boundary was below the observed one since a constant rise slip velocity was adopted in the les based on the volume median droplet size d 50 near the lower boundary of the plume which was smaller than that near the upper boundary 1 6 mm vs 4 4 mm the vertical motion of the plume was found out by comparing the plume trajectory without rise velocity and with rise velocity of 5 cm s based on the d 50 of 1 6 mm then the upper boundary of the plume was computed using the rise velocity of droplets near the upper boundary which was 11 cm s for 4 4 mm droplet size the estimated upper boundary compared well with the observations fig 1b note that the rise velocity to apply to the oil holdup does not impact the momentum equation daskiran et al 2020 fig 2 shows the oil droplet size distribution dsd obtained by analyzing the images taken by the shadowgraph cameras near the lower and upper boundaries of the plume in the experiments for the bottom camera the dsd shows a unimodal distribution with a peak at around the droplet size of 1 8 mm which is close to the d 50 of the distribution which was 1 6 mm the minimum droplet size captured was 400 μ m while the maximum droplet size obtained was 5 8 mm the dsd showed a large variability at droplets larger than 4 mm which is related to the small number of large droplets at that location fig 2b shows a unimodal dsd obtained from the top camera near the upper boundary of the plume the minimum droplet size was 1 mm and the maximum droplet size was 10 mm the dsd had a peak at around 4 mm and the d 50 was computed to be 4 4 mm by comparison to the bottom camera the oil droplets from the top camera were thus larger than those from the bottom camera fig 3 shows the oil holdup in various sections of the plume the instantaneous oil holdup at the center plane a shows that the plume was opaque up to z d 8 and beyond it was broken down to oil blobs the jet was almost vertical up to z d 3 beyond z d 3 it started to bend in crossflow direction until z d 12 then the plume continued to move with 30 to the crossflow direction higher oil holdup was obtained near the top boundary of the plume the time averaged oil holdup contours at the center plane b revealed the rapid dilution of oil from unity at the orifice to 0 1 at x d 14 and to 0 01 at x d 50 time averaged oil holdup contours are shown in fig 3c at different cross sections of the plume at x d 8 x d 20 x d 32 and x d 48 at x d 8 higher oil holdup was obtained almost in a circular region with a low oil holdup in a small region near the center bottom part of the cross section higher oil holdup was obtained near the top boundary of the plume at x d 20 the oil distribution looks like a kidney shape with higher oil holdup near the top and side boundaries of the plume the overall oil holdup decreased as compared to that at x d 8 the plume boundaries expanded in each direction at x d 32 and 48 the kidney shape of the plume did not change however the oil holdup decreased dramatically while moving downstream the non uniform kidney shaped oil distribution is related to the coherent vortical structures named counter rotating vortex pair and will be detailed next fig 4 shows the fluid velocity in different directions along various sections or cuts all velocity components were normalized by the crossflow speed fig 4a shows that the horizontal crossflow speed decreased near the top boundary of the plume increased inside the plume and decreased again near the lower boundary of the plume which is clear by following the velocity variation along the x direction at y d 0 the purely horizontal velocity vectors gained lateral components at x d 30 in fig 4b the cvp induced upward motion along the center plane at y d 0 and a smaller downward motion near the side boundaries of the plume the velocity vectors identified the recirculation cells clearly the lateral velocity contours in c reveal velocity in y direction along top right and bottom left subzones and in y direction along top left and bottom right subzones in b c it must be noted that the vertical and lateral velocities became almost zero above the cvp which is important while evaluating the motion of large droplets separated from the cvp 3 1 droplet tracking in the near field of the plume three dimensional analysis different sized oil droplets were seeded randomly with a uniform distribution from a circumscribed circular region with a diameter of 8d at x d 8 which corresponds to s d 15 where s is the direction in the jet path fig 1 shown in fig 3c the center of the circular region was placed at x d 8 and z d 10 this was done because based on our work with jets zhao et al 2014 2015 2017 the majority of oil droplets are created within 10 to 15 diameters from the orifice at each simulation oil droplets of sizes 50 μ m 500 μ m 1 mm and 3 mm were released which is based on the range of the droplet size obtained in the experiments fig 2 three hundred droplets were released for each droplet size fig 5 shows the side view of the spatial distribution of droplets with various sizes computed at consecutive times along with the instantaneous streamlines on the central plane the positions of the cameras used in the experiment are also shown the droplet trajectory was computed based on newton s second law eq 8 the streamlines were displaced in both vertical and horizontal directions due to the turbulence in the plume at t 10 8 the relatively larger spatial variation of the horizontal velocity at the location of 1 mm and smaller droplets fig 8a in daskiran et al 2020 resulted in more spatial dispersion of the small droplets this behavior might also be related to the high velocity shear at the location of the small droplets since their buoyancy is relatively small they keep staying near the oil plume water shear layer near the lower boundary of the plume at t 32 4 the cloud size in crossflow direction was 22d for the 50 μ m and 500 μ m droplets 19d for the 1 mm droplets and 17d for the 3 mm droplets which was 7d for all droplet sizes at the beginning t 5 4 at t 43 2 the maximum elevation reached was z d 28 for the 50 μ m and 500 μ m droplets z d 32 for the 1 mm droplets and z d 40 for the 3 mm droplets at t 54 0 most of the droplets reaching the bottom camera were 1 mm and smaller and only the bottom part of the 3 mm droplet cloud passed through the bottom camera based on the simulations the supplementary video video s1 shows the transient behavior of this process clearly see the video in the online version comparing to the dsd obtained in the experiments fig 2 the range of the droplet size was captured well at the location of the bottom camera however although the droplets around 1 mm to 3 mm i e the lower range of the dsd plot obtained in the experiments were captured by the top camera in the experiments the released 1 mm and 3 mm droplets did not reach the location of the top camera this could be that the 1 mm and 3 mm droplets that were observed in the experiments did not emanate from the location where we place them initially x d 8 in our simulation but at a location further downstream in the plume however we believe it is due to the fact that the les simulation and the mixture model that we considered could not capture the drag of individual droplets on the surrounding fluid as they rise which would have the effect of displacing the fluid upward which would accelerate the rise of droplets our approach is similar to that of yang et al 2016 and fabregat et al 2016 considering the drift stress term which appears in the mixture momentum equation due to the relative velocity among the phases manninen et al 1996 would allow the 1 mm and 3 mm droplets to pass through the top camera however this would alter the trajectory of the droplet cloud that passed through the bottom camera therefore it seems the only way to accurately model droplet transport in the multiphase plume is through the usage of an eulerian eulerian two fluid approach daskiran et al 2017 zhang and jiao 2018 where the size of the dispersed phase i e oil droplet size herein is provided to the model and the momentum equations are solved for both phases separately by allowing momentum exchange between the phases through the interfacial forces term the distribution of different sized droplets along the plume cross section is shown in fig 6 at consecutive times the position of the top and bottom cameras employed in the experiments is provided the instantaneous streamlines at each cross section revealed the cvp and its transient behavior at t 5 4 the overall droplet cloud expanded in the vertical direction due to the different rise velocity of different sized droplets where one notes the large droplets at the top and the small ones at the bottom the centerline of the vortex pair and the vortex cores were covered by the droplets all droplets seemed entrained upward by the vertical flow among two vortices at t 10 8 the tail of the droplet cloud for the 1 mm and smaller droplets elongated more at the bottom right side of the droplet cloud due to the instantaneous asymmetric nature of the cvp the cvp distributed droplets in the vertical and lateral directions which resulted in droplet dilution along the center leeward side of the droplet cloud the elevations of the 50 μ m and 500 μ m droplet clouds were similar at t 16 2 the size of the overall droplet cloud increased in both vertical and lateral directions the droplets with a diameter of 3 mm got closer to the top portion of cvp which improved their dispersion in the lateral direction at t 21 6 the number of the droplets and the shape of the 3 mm droplet cloud was different on both sides of the cvp due to the cvp asymmetry it was clearer to distinguish the 50 μ m and 500 μ m droplet clouds at t 27 0 kidney shaped droplet distribution was obtained for each droplet cloud similar to the oil holdup contours in fig 3 at t 32 4 and later due to higher rise velocity near the center plane the left side of the 3 mm droplet cloud elongated from z d 22 to z d 42 at t 43 2 although the central part of the 1 mm droplet cloud reached the top part of the cvp at t 48 6 the 1 mm droplets mostly rise within the cvp some of the 1 mm droplets escaped the cvp until t 64 8 the 50 μ m and 500 μ m droplets continued dispersing into both vortex bodies and mostly moved with the cvp until t 64 8 the supplementary video video s2 shows the transient behavior of this process clearly see the video in the online version it was observed from the streamlines and particle tracking analysis that the cvp was not symmetric along the central plane similarly mahesh 2013 reported the cvp is highly unstable and asymmetric instantaneously the linear stability analysis by alves et al 2007 revealed different growth rates of the cvp vortices which resulted in asymmetry in the experiments of blanchard et al 1999 lateral evolution of the left and vortices was also observed to be asymmetric after x d 20 fig 7 shows the time series of the physical forces applied to one of the droplets for each size bin in the vertical direction the physical forces were normalized with the droplet mass to present the vertical acceleration or deceleration of the droplets for each droplet size the buoyancy is constant since it only depends on the density of the droplet and the surrounding fluid the droplet diameter and the gravity which were assumed constant in the simulations for each droplet size the dominant forces were drag and buoyancy the drag force for the 50 μ m droplet varied rapidly with time which is probably due to the small inertia of the droplet as noted below the 50 μ m droplets move closely with the flow and thus would be highly impacted by the turbulence the added mass force was also negligible as compared to the drag force for all droplets except for the 50 μ m ones which became positive and negative instantly for all droplet sizes the contribution of pressure gradient force was mostly higher than the added mass force the pressure gradient force became higher than the drag force for a short time at t 5 0 for the 3 mm droplets the lift force was almost zero for droplets 1 mm and smaller for the whole time range considered herein it showed a peak with an amplitude 20 of the drag force at t 6 0 for the 3 mm droplet however it was mostly zero and considered to be negligible in this work in addition to the individual forces the sum of the normalized forces was also plotted to show the vertical acceleration of the droplet in different sizes the 50 μ m 500 μ m droplets showed higher acceleration initially due to the pressure gradient force with a peak at t 4 0 at which it started to decrease to reach small values around zero at t 8 after t 8 they experienced acceleration and deceleration in the range between 0 5 m s2 and 0 5 m s2 the 1 mm droplet accelerated until t 18 with a value of around 1 0 m s2 after t 18 it showed acceleration and deceleration with a smaller magnitude the 3 mm droplet decelerated in the range of 4 t 12 due to a sudden increase in the drag and pressure gradient forces and made a peak at t 5 with a value of 2 8 m s2 after t 12 it showed acceleration and deceleration with a smaller magnitude tracking forces exerted on a single droplet only in the vertical direction may not be sufficient to come up with a proper conclusion therefore additional droplet tracking simulations were conducted for each droplet size by excluding the added mass pressure gradient and lift forces fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of different sized droplets with and without three forces added mass pressure gradient and lift forces at t 53 4 for the 50 μ m droplets the vertical and lateral distribution of droplets were almost the same with and without these three forces there was only a slight position difference for some of the droplets the number of droplets affected by other forces increased for the droplet size of 500 μ m and 1 mm however the cumulative distribution of droplets and the outer boundary of the droplet cloud were not affected noticeably the narrowing cloud tail near the right vortex was captured well in both cases the elongated and thinning tail of the 3 mm droplet cloud near the left vortex was captured mostly with a slightly larger width in the lateral direction with the addition of other forces the m like shape of the 3 mm droplet cloud was captured well with and without the additional forces as the distribution of different sized droplets was considered across the plume cross section one can conclude that the dominant forces are the drag and buoyancy forces the influence of the added mass pressure gradient and lift forces can be neglected smith and mungal 1998 reported the concentration along the line in lateral horizontal direction for miscible fluid they normalized distance with the product of the velocity ratio r 10 and the orifice diameter and provided concentration at x rd 2 0 which corresponds to x d 10 in this work r 5 however while the plume expands 14d in the lateral direction at x rd 2 0 in the experiments where the jet reynolds number based on jet exit diameter and jet velocity was 33000 it expanded 12d in the present work with r 5 0 and re 7100 see figs 3c and 6a in the present work the lateral expansion of the 50 μ m droplet cloud became similar to the experiment 14d at x rd 6 0 i e x d 30 fig 9 compares the concentration distribution of the 50 μ m droplet cloud obtained in this work with the lagrangian approach along the lateral horizontal line across the cvp at z d 16 as the cloud centroid reached x c d 30 at t 22 to the concentration distribution obtained in the experiments of smith and mungal 1998 at z d 16 0 in the experiments of smith and mungal 1998 a miscible jet with a velocity ratio of 10 0 and a higher re number was used while an immiscible jet with a velocity ratio of 5 0 was used in this work hence the comparison in fig 9 is rather qualitative to indicate where the low and high concentrations occur the distribution of the 50 μ m droplets was selected to compare to the concentration in miscible jets since the 50 μ m droplets were considered to be following the continuous fluid due to their negligible inertia in the lagrangian approach the droplets passing through the cubic volumes with a size of d in all directions were counted for the time period of t 75 0 with increments of d in the lateral direction in this work the maximum concentration was observed with bimodal distribution closer to the cores of the cvp vortices at y d 3 and y d 4 the concentration was relatively higher near the right vortex core with a value of 0 2 as compared to the droplet concentration near the left vortex with a value of 0 13 for y d 6 and at y d 1 0 no droplets were counted a minimum number of droplets were counted at y d 0 and y d 1 0 similar to the numerical predictions the bimodal distribution of concentration was obtained across the cvp in the experiments the maximum concentration was observed at y d 6 and y d 4 with both instantaneous and mean data the maximum concentration near the left vortex was relatively higher than that near the right vortex 0 16 vs 0 1 based on the instantaneous data and 0 07 vs 0 04 based on the mean data the minimum concentration was obtained near the middle of the cvp vortices at y d 1 0 the trend of the concentration distribution across the cvp was similar in both the experiments and the numerical simulation higher near the vortex cores with peaks and lower near the middle which is induced with the cvp similar concentration distribution was reported by several researchers for the jet in crossflow such as bodart et al 2013 galeazzo et al 2013 and ruiz et al 2015 3 2 spatial moments comparison of the kinematics approach and newton s second law the horizontal centroid position of the droplet clouds obtained based on the kinematics approach and newton s second law is shown in the left panel of fig 10 as a function of the normalized time the initial position of all droplets was x d 8 the droplet motion in the horizontal direction was dominated by the crossflow speed as confirmed by the slope of 1 0 for each line for different sizes of droplets the horizontal position of the droplet cloud centroid changed slightly since the interaction between the jet and crossflow induces horizontal velocity locally higher or lower than the crossflow velocity fig 4a the similar horizontal velocity of droplet clouds with different sizes of droplets can also be revealed through the transient droplet distribution in fig 5 both the kinematics and newton approaches gave almost the same results the right panel in fig 10 shows the lateral location of the cloud centroids which slightly meandered about the center plane the centroid of the 50 μ m 500 μ m and 1 mm droplet clouds moved similarly in the lateral direction while looking downstream the centroid moved toward the right side of the center plane up to x c d 11 where it changed its direction toward the left then the centroid passed through the center plane at x c d 16 and continued moving toward the left reaching y c d 1 1 y c d 0 7 and y c d 0 6 for the 50 μ m 500 μ m and 1 mm droplet clouds respectively once each droplet cloud reached x c d 67 the lateral motion of the cloud centroid can be related to the instantaneous asymmetric behavior of the cvp mahesh 2013 it must be noted that the lateral motion of the cloud centroid is less than 1d the centroid of the 3 mm droplet cloud started to move toward the right and changed its direction to the left at x c d 20 and then to the right again at x c d 32 and reached y c d 0 35 at x c d 67 the difference between the kinematics and newton approaches for the lateral position of the cloud centroid increased with the droplet size the kinematics approach mostly estimated the lateral motion larger however considering the scale of the vertical axis on the plots the differences can be considered negligible fig 11 shows the vertical location of the cloud centroid for different droplet sizes as a function of the horizontal location of the cloud centroid each plot in fig 11 represents the trajectory of droplet clouds with different sizes of droplets in addition to the trajectories of the droplet cloud centroids with different droplet sizes the plume trajectory obtained from our les simulation based on the streamline of the mean velocity field introduced from the pipe center was presented the center streamline showed a similar trend to the droplet clouds with 1 mm and smaller droplets in the near field of the plume up to x c d 20 the centroid of the droplet clouds with 1 mm and smaller droplets was similar and the offset of their trajectory to the trajectory of the center streamline was around 3d with lower penetration of the droplet clouds to the crossflow in the far field the offset between the center streamline and the trajectory of the 1 mm droplet cloud kept almost the same at 3d but increased gradually for the 50 μ m and 500 μ m droplet clouds to 7d and 5d respectively at x c d 65 the bending of the vertical jet in crossflow direction occurred mostly just before the initial position of the droplets see fig 3 therefore the cloud centroids rise almost linear for each droplet size with only slight bending in the far field of the plume the trajectories of small droplets almost non buoyant are expected to be aligned with crossflow direction due to decay in the vertical jet momentum and decrease in the cvp strength which induces upward velocity the centroid of large sized droplets rose faster at x c d 65 the droplet clouds with 50 μ m 500 μ m 1 mm and 3 mm droplets reached the height z c d equal to 25 26 28 and 37 respectively the kinematics approach gave similar results to newton s approach for all droplet sizes considered for the 3 mm droplet cloud the kinematics approach overestimated the rise velocity slightly at x c d 60 the kinematics approach gave a centroid that is less than 1d above the centroid given by newton s approach the left panel in fig 12 shows the normalized horizontal variance of the droplet cloud for different sizes of droplets the horizontal variance becomes zero initially for each droplet size since all the droplets were released exactly from x d 8 the horizontal variance increased continuously with the time for each droplet size the horizontal variance of droplets decreased with increasing droplet size for the droplet clouds with 1 mm and 3 mm droplets the droplet size of 1 mm and smaller showed the highest dispersion in the horizontal direction with a horizontal variance of 20 d 2 at x c d 67 which corresponds to a horizontal standard deviation of 20 d 2 4 5 d see fig 5j to compare the horizontal dispersion of different sized droplets as mentioned earlier while discussing fig 5 the larger dispersion of 1 mm and smaller droplets might be related to more spatial variation of the horizontal velocity and strong shear in the location of the smaller droplets both the kinematics and newton approaches estimated the horizontal variance of the cloud similarly for droplets 1 mm and smaller the discrepancy for the dispersion of the 3 mm droplet cloud started to increase at x c d 20 and reached a standard deviation of 2d at x c d 67 the right panel in fig 12 shows the variation of the normalized horizontal dispersion coefficient of the cloud with different sizes of droplets the dispersion coefficient was obtained with the time derivative of the variance eq 12 and normalized with the product of crossflow speed and pipe diameter the normalized horizontal dispersion coefficient of the 50 μ m droplet cloud increased suddenly from zero at x c d 8 to 0 5 at x c d 20 where it decreased to reach 0 1 at x c d 30 then it varied between 0 1 and 0 2 up to x c d 67 for the 500 μ m droplets the dispersion coefficient increased suddenly from zero at x c d 8 to 0 5 at x c d 20 where it decreased to reach 0 1 at x c d 40 and varied between 0 07 and 0 17 up to x c d 67 for the 1 mm droplet cloud the horizontal dispersion coefficient trend was similar to the 50 μ m and 500 μ m droplet clouds up to x c d 38 by making a peak at x c d 20 with a value of 0 45 and then decreasing to 0 1 at x c d 38 then it varied between 0 1 and 0 15 up to x c d 46 where it decreased to reach 0 07 at x c d 50 and then increased gradually to reach 0 2 at x c d 67 for the 3 mm droplet cloud it increased from zero at x c d 8 to 0 24 at x c d 19 where it decreased to reach 0 05 at x c d 28 then it increased to reach 0 2 at x c d 42 where it decreased to reach zero at x c d 62 and kept its value at zero up to x c d 67 the kinematics approach and newton s second law estimated the horizontal dispersion coefficient similarly with small local discrepancies for all droplet clouds the normalized vertical variance of droplet clouds with different sizes of droplets is depicted in the left panel of fig 13 as mentioned earlier all the droplets were released from a circular region with a diameter of 8d at x d 8 the vertical variance was computed to be 4 d 2 at the beginning which corresponds to a vertical standard deviation of 2d once the droplets were released the vertical variance of each droplet cloud decreased up to x c d 18 and then they started to disperse in the vertical direction since the buoyancy of smaller droplets is lower their motion was under the influence of the cvp induced flow and hence they dispersed more in the vertical direction the vertical variance of the droplet cloud with 1 mm and smaller droplets was similar and kept increasing with a decreasing slope up to x c d 67 to reach a vertical variance of 16 d 2 at x c d 67 thus a vertical standard deviation of 4d the 3 mm droplets also dispersed significantly in the vertical direction due to the elongated tails of the droplet cloud in the vertical direction fig 6 the vertical variance of the 3 mm droplet cloud increased continuously after x c d 18 with varying increase rates i e the slope there was an almost linear increase up to x c d 42 and then the rate of increase decreased gradually between x c d 42 and x c d 52 and then it picked up its initial rate of increase the 3 mm droplet cloud reached a vertical standard deviation of 4 2 d at x c d 67 the kinematics approach showed small deviations from newton s second law locally for all the droplet clouds the normalized vertical dispersion coefficient for different droplet sizes is shown in the right panel of fig 13 for all droplets the vertical dispersion coefficient was below zero up to x c d 18 due to decreasing vertical variance for the 50 μ m droplet cloud it increased suddenly from zero at x c d 18 to 0 25 at x c d 24 where it decreased to reach around zero at x c d 67 for the 500 μ m droplet cloud it increased suddenly from zero at x c d 18 to 0 35 at x c d 28 where it decreased to reach 0 03 at x c d 67 for the 1 mm droplet cloud it increased suddenly from zero at x c d 18 to 0 38 at x c d 23 where it decreased to reach 0 1 at x c d 60 and then varied between 0 1 and 0 16 up to x c d 67 for the 3 mm droplet cloud it increased suddenly from zero at x c d 18 to 0 25 at x c d 22 where it decreased to reach 0 1 at x c d 46 then it increased to reach 0 28 at x c d 55 where it decreased to reach 0 1 at x c d 67 the kinematics approach estimated the vertical dispersion coefficient similar to newton s second law with increasing local discrepancies for larger droplets the kinematics approach estimated a peak at x c d 31 for the 3 mm droplet cloud which was not obtained with newton s second law the normalized lateral variance of the cloud for different sized droplets is depicted in the left panel of fig 14 for the 50 μ m droplet cloud the variance of the cloud increased linearly up to x c d 25 and then continued increasing with a smaller slope up to x c d 67 where it has a variance value of 24 d 2 for the 500 μ m droplet cloud the variance increased linearly with almost the same slope up to x c d 67 where it has a variance value of 33 d 2 for the 1 mm droplet cloud similar to that of the 500 μ m droplet cloud the lateral variance increased linearly with almost the same slope up to x c d 67 where it has a variance value of 40 d 2 for the 3 mm droplet cloud the lateral variance increased continuously with slightly varying slopes and reached a variance value of 38 d 2 at x c d 67 for all droplets the kinematics approach captured the lateral variance of the cloud with a slight discrepancy the right panel of fig 14 shows the normalized lateral dispersion coefficient as a function of the horizontal location of the cloud centroid for the 50 μ m droplet cloud the normalized lateral dispersion coefficient varied between 0 28 and 0 38 for the range of 8 x c d 20 and then started to decrease to reach 0 1 at x c d 36 and increased gradually with small fluctuations up to x c d 60 where it reached a value of 0 18 for the 500 μ m droplet cloud it varied between 0 3 and 0 38 for the range of 8 x c d 20 and then started to decrease to reach 0 24 at x c d 30 beyond x c d 30 it increased suddenly to 0 3 at x c d 32 where it decreased to reach 0 18 at x c d 43 and then increased with fluctuations to reach 0 26 at x c d 67 for the 1 mm droplet cloud the lateral dispersion coefficient increased suddenly from 0 32 at x c d 8 to 0 42 at x c d 11 where it decreased to reach 0 33 at x c d 19 then it made a peak at x c d 22 with a value of 0 4 where it decreased to reach 0 2 at x c d 37 and then increased to reach 0 32 at x c d 67 for the 3 mm droplet cloud the lateral dispersion increased suddenly from 0 3 at x c d 8 to 0 48 at x c d 10 where it decreased to reach 0 18 at x c d 23 then it increased and reached a value of 0 3 between x c d 30 and x c d 40 where it decreased to reach 0 2 at x c d 43 then it increased and made a peak at x c d 53 at a value of 0 5 where it decreased to reach 0 26 at x c d 67 the kinematics and newton approaches estimated the lateral dispersion coefficient with small differences for the droplet clouds having 1 mm and smaller droplets for the 3 mm droplet cloud the kinematics approach could not capture the peak at x c d 53 and the fall at x c d 43 fig 15 shows the normalized eddy diffusivity based on eq 13 and the normalized dispersion coefficient of the cloud in different directions eddy diffusivity was computed based on boussinesq gradient approximation using resolved and fluctuating components of the velocity from the les simulation in the computation of eddy diffusivity the contours of eddy diffusivity at different cross sections of the plume were analyzed outside of the plume the eddy diffusivity was almost zero most probably due to the no perturbation condition at the crossflow inlet to reveal the eddy diffusivity inside the plume the field of interest was obtained by removing parts of the contours having values smaller than 3 10 4 m2 s d t u d 0 044 the average eddy diffusivity was computed across the plume cross section and presented in fig 15 the eddy diffusivity was computed negative in a small portion of the cross section in the computation of the mean eddy diffusivity absolute values were used to compare the eddy diffusivity and the dispersion coefficient of droplets the dispersion coefficient of the droplet cloud was estimated for droplets moving with the flow field through the kinematics approach without slip velocity in any direction w t 0 in eq 4c the mean eddy diffusivity increased gradually in the horizontal direction the normalized eddy diffusivity varied between 0 11 and 0 18 the normalized horizontal dispersion coefficient increased from zero at x c d 8 to 0 5 at x c d 20 where it decreased to reach 0 1 at x c d 20 and then varied between 0 1 and 0 16 up to x c d 60 the normalized vertical dispersion coefficient was below zero up to x c d 17 and increased rapidly from zero x c d 17 to 0 23 at x c d 22 and then decreased gradually with fluctuations to reach 0 18 at x c d 60 the normalized lateral dispersion coefficient was around 0 3 up to x c d 16 where it increased rapidly to reach 0 38 at x c d 17 where it decreased to reach 0 07 at x c d 33 beyond x c d 33 it varies between 0 07 and 0 17 up to x c d 60 ling et al 2017 conducted a large eddy simulation of a jet in crossflow and depicted the contours of normalized eddy viscosity the velocity ratio in their work was 5 7 which is close to the velocity ratio of 5 0 in this work they also normalized the eddy viscosity by upstream velocity and pipe diameter they depicted normalized eddy viscosity at the center plane from 0 to 0 45 which covers the eddy diffusivity computed in this work from 0 11 to 0 18 recall that the eddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity become equal for the turbulent schmidt number of unity kohli and bogard 2005 performed an experimental study of an inclined jet in crossflow for film cooling applications of gas turbines the instant velocity and temperature were measured through laser doppler velocimetry ldv and cold wire techniques respectively the holes with a diameter of 11 1 mm were inclined at 35 the crossflow velocity was 10 0 m s and the jet velocity was 3 8 m s which resulted in a velocity ratio r 0 38 they studied two cases with different free stream turbulence levels as 0 6 and 20 they observed normalized eddy diffusivity in the range from 0 01 to 0 07 with low free stream turbulence level and from 0 03 to 0 6 with high free stream turbulence level along the center plane the high free stream turbulence case covers the eddy diffusivity obtained in this work in both turbulence levels the eddy diffusivity increased in the horizontal direction which concurred with our findings 3 3 droplet tracking in the cvp vortex trapping dispersed droplets are expected to be trapped by vortices relatively larger than themselves as long as the inward force applied on the droplet toward the vortex core is higher than the outward force vigolo et al 2014 observed trapping of particles at a t junction which is used to split the flow into two branches their dns simulation revealed a counter rotating vortex pair inside each branch after the t junction they observed trapping and accumulation of particles in the vortices in their experiments and the lagrangian particle tracking approach murphy et al 2016 performed an oil jet experiment by towing the pipe in the horizontal direction to mimic the crossflow they measured the droplet size inside one of the cvp vortices using a hologram camera and obtained only the droplets smaller than 200 μ m outside the cvp they observed large droplets up to 3 5 mm near the upper boundary of the plume their observation revealed the potential of cvp on vortex trapping to investigate the behavior of different sized droplets against the trapping action of cvp we released different sized droplets from the vortex cores continuously and tracked their motion across the plume cross section the transient fluid velocity which is used in the equation of motion for droplets is only available up to 20 s of the flow time from daskiran et al 2020 which is not enough to reveal vortex trapping behavior of the cvp therefore time averaged flow data was used to track the droplets across the two dimensional plume cross section at x d 48 newton s second law was adopted and the added mass pressure gradient and lift forces were not considered based on the conclusion in section 3 2 fig 16 shows the distribution of different sized droplets across the plume cross section at different times initially two droplets for each droplet diameter of 400 μ m 500 μ m 600 μ m 700 μ m and 800 μ m were released randomly from the cores of each vortex after each 1 0 s t 10 8 two more droplets were released for each droplet size from each vortex core however their positions were different from the ones released previously at t 108 the droplets inside the left and right vortices moved in northwest and northeast directions respectively the droplets crossing the red colored streamline in fig 16a was considered as escaped while others were counted as trapped we decided on the location of the streamline based on the outer boundary of the circulating trapped droplets as long as the streamline covers the circulating droplet region one can determine the droplets leaving and staying inside the streamline choosing the streamline away from the vortex core will make the time longer to count the droplets as escaped which is not important for the objective of this study the 700 μ m and 800 μ m droplets started to escape from the left vortex due to their higher buoyancy at t 216 the larger droplets continue to escape both vortices the elevation of larger droplets was observed to be higher above the left vortex which reveals the asymmetric behavior of cvp although the flow has downward velocity around y d 20 and z d 34 see the streamlines the vertical motion of the 700 μ m and 800 μ m droplets was dominated by the buoyancy forces and they kept rising at t 324 the leading droplets on the left hand side with a diameter of 600 μ m 700 μ m and 800 μ m rose about 15d 26d and 34d respectively however only a few droplets with a diameter of 600 μ m escaped the right vortex at t 432 a few of the 600 μ m droplets were observed to be leaving the right vortex while the leading 600 μ m droplet with its followers reached z d 41 at the left vortex at t 1080 the escaped droplets with 600 μ m diameter and larger showed a series of droplets in the vertical direction the path of larger droplets was closer to the centerline since they separate the vortex earlier a few droplets of 500 μ m diameter escaped both vortices all of the 400 μ m droplets were trapped in the cvp the supplementary video video s3 shows the transient behavior of this process clearly see the video in the online version to reveal the number of trapped and escaped droplets the number of trapped droplets in both vortices are plotted as a function of time in fig 17 the number of released droplets was also shown in fig 17 as a reference the plot for the number of 400 μ m droplets inside the cvp follows the same trend as the number of released droplets only a few of the 500 μ m droplets started to escape the left vortex at t 850 almost all of them were trapped in the right vortex the number of trapped droplets with a diameter of 600 μ m was 125 in the left vortex and 150 in the right vortex at t 1100 the 600 μ m droplets started to escape both vortices at around t 250 and the number of trapped droplets did not reach a plateau within t 1100 in both vortices reaching a plateau means that the number of droplets with the plateau value keeps cycling inside the vortex the behavior of 700 μ m and 800 μ m droplets was almost the same in both vortices the number of 700 μ m reached a plateau by t 400 in both vortices and kept its number around 60 in the left vortex and 70 in the right vortex up to t 1100 the 800 μ m droplets in both vortices reached a plateau value of 40 around t 200 in addition to the determination of trapped and separated droplets with different sizes the motion of different sized droplets was also tracked fig 18a shows the vertical z coordinate of a single droplet of different sizes inside the right vortex the selected droplets of 400 μ m 500 μ m and 600 μ m were trapped in the cvp while the 700 μ m and 800 μ m droplets escaped the cvp and rose continuously without cycling inside the vortex the 700 μ m and 800 μ m droplets left the domain at t 400 the oscillating vertical trajectory of 600 μ m and smaller droplets revealed their revolution inside the vortex with a period of t 220 for 400 μ m and 500 μ m droplets and t 275 for 600 μ m droplet the radius of the path followed by 400 μ m and 500 μ m droplet was similar and larger than that of 600 μ m droplet and increased with time the 600 μ m droplet gets closer to the vortex core with the time which is clear from the decreasing amplitude of z d in fig 18a the snapshot of the path of the droplets on the right hand side of the cvp at t 1000 is shown in fig 18b the supplementary video video s4 shows the transient behavior of this process clearly see the video in the online version the lateral velocity of 700 μ m and 800 μ m droplets became higher than the vertical velocity at 10 y d 13 due to the lateral velocity induced by the cvp see the velocity vectors in fig 4c for y d 13 and z d 30 the flow induced by the cvp dissipated and the droplets rose with their buoyancy the droplets smaller than 700 μ m followed the circular motion in the vortex the buoyancy of droplets was not enough to overcome the downward vertical velocity induced by the cvp for these particular droplets the path of the 400 μ m and 500 μ m droplets expanded in the radial direction while the path of the 600 μ m droplet decreased which is related to the initial position of the droplets and local variations of the flow dynamics as the motion of another droplet released from a different location is analyzed a different pattern can be observed 3 4 vortex trapping function trapping of different sized droplets within cvp was evaluated using a trapping function developed by friedman and katz 2002 by considering inward and outward forces applied on a particle the final form of the trapping function is given by 17 ω ρ d c a ρ c ρ c 1 c a 1 v q u 2 c l 1 c a v q u where ρ c and ρ d are the density of the continuous and dispersed phases respectively the term v q is the rise velocity of droplets in the quiescent continuous phase eq 5 and u is the root mean square of the turbulent component of the continuous phase velocity following murphy et al 2016 the u was replaced with the vertical velocity estimated on both sides of the vortex core the trapping function is defined as the ratio of the outward escaping force to the inward force capturing acting on a droplet placed within the flow induced by a horizontal vortex and located at the same elevation as the vortex core in eq 17 the occurs in both terms as v q has the same direction with local vortex flow whereas sign occurs as v q counters the flow induced by the vortex if ω 1 the droplet has a net outward force which leads to droplet escape and if ω 1 the inward force dominates and leads to droplet trapping the trapping function can be used to evaluate the behavior of different sized droplets within the vortex flow induced by cvp fig 19a shows normalized relative vertical velocity profile v v cvp u along a horizontal line in the lateral direction passing through the left side vortex core where y d 0 corresponds to the center of the vortex core the term v represents the vertical fluid velocity along a horizontal line from the left side of the left vortex to the right side of the left vortex passing through the vortex core at y d 0 y is the lateral coordinate centered at the core of the left vortex and moves up to the plume center plane at y d 0 the term v cvp represents the vertical fluid velocity at the vortex core at y d 0 as observed in fig 19a the relative vertical velocity v v cvp u becomes zero at the vortex core since v v cvp and has the maximum value close to the center plane of the plume the location of the y d where maximum relative vertical velocity observed increases with x d because the increase of the vortex size with x d increases the distance from the vortex core to the center plane of the plume the velocity profiles were obtained at different cross sections of the plume including x d 8 x d 20 x d 32 and x d 48 using time averaged velocity data acquired from the large eddy simulation the relative vertical velocity along the right side boundary of the left vortex y d 0 decreased in horizontal direction i e the normalized vertical velocity along the center plane was around 0 76 at x d 8 which decreased to 0 51 at x d 20 this behavior reveals that the vertical velocity induced by the cvp decreased as the plume moves further in the horizontal direction the width of the vortex increased as the plume moves in the horizontal direction the distance from the center of the vortex core to the right side boundary of the vortex was around 2 4d at x d 8 and 8d at x d 48 the boundaries of the shaded region at both sides of fig 19a were used to determine the maximum droplet size which is expected to be trapped within the cvp fig 19b shows the trapping function as a function of relative vertical velocity for different sized droplets the solid lines show the trapping function near the upward moving side of the vortex while the dashed ones show the trapping function near the downward moving side of the vortex the shaded regions in fig 19b represent the shaded regions in fig 19a the droplet sizes studied herein were all trapped within the vortex when located near the downward moving side of the vortex on the upward moving side the 600 μ m droplet escapes while the 50 μ m droplet remains trapped at each part of the plume as x d 48 as the plume moves further downstream and the normalized vertical velocity near the upward moving side becomes smaller than approximately 0 02 the 50 μ m droplets are expected to escape the vortex however it is not the case for x d 48 the 400 μ m droplets would not escape until the normalized vertical velocity fell below 0 5 which happened at x d 48 the 200 μ m droplets are expected to escape from the vortex following the vortex induced normalized upward velocity falls below 0 16 which should happen when x d 48 on the shaded area in fig 19b the normalized upward velocities were obtained between 0 51 corresponds to the velocity at x d 48 see fig 19a and 0 76 corresponds to the velocity at x d 8 and the corresponding maximum droplet size expected to retain in the vortex was computed to be around 400 μ m at x d 48 and 540 μ m at x d 8 by equating the trapping function in eq 17 to unity ω 1 0 this observation reveals that the droplets larger than 540 μ m will start to escape the left vortex by x d 8 and the droplets larger than 400 μ m will start to escape the left vortex by x d 48 this observation concurs with the droplet tracking investigation employed across the plume cross section at x d 48 in fig 17a in which the droplets larger than 400 μ m escaped the left vortex as stated above the vortex trapping function estimated all droplets to be trapped near the downward moving side of the vortex in the droplet tracking investigation figs 16 18 the droplets were released near the vortex core and the droplets of 600 μ m and larger escaped the vortex before reaching the downward moving side of the vortex most of the 500 μ m droplets reached the downward moving side and trapped already however although some of the 500 μ m droplets reached the downward moving side at their initial cycles they escaped the vortex later 4 conclusions the results of multiphase large eddy simulations and experiments of an oil jet in crossflow with a jet velocity around 1 5 m s in a crossflow of 0 3 m s were reported in our prior work daskiran et al 2020 in this work droplet velocity was computed based on two approaches i the kinematics approach and ii newton s second law the trajectory of different sized droplets in an oil plume in crossflow was estimated using the fluid data from the les simulation we did not observe a noticeable difference between the kinematics approach and newton s second law three hundred droplets with sizes of 50 μ m 500 μ m 1 mm and 3 mm which is based on the droplet size obtained in the experiments fig 2 were released at x d 8 the distribution of different sized droplets was investigated across the plume cross section and along the central plane figs 5 6 the droplets showed significant segregation in the vertical direction which avoids the assumption of a gaussian distribution in the vertical direction the streamlines and the trajectory of droplets across the plume cross section revealed the asymmetric counter rotating vortices large droplets started to escape the cvp from the center plane due to their higher buoyancy and higher vertical velocity near the center plane induced by the cvp droplets of 1 mm and smaller were dispersed in each direction the lateral motion induced by the cvp and the expansion of the plume cross section entrained small droplets toward the sides of the plume the influence of added mass pressure gradient and lift forces were observed to be negligible as compared to the drag and buoyancy forces figs 7 8 the vertical location of cloud centroid for various droplet sizes was compared to the trajectory of center streamline obtained from the les simulation the center streamline obtained from les followed the trajectory of 1 mm and smaller droplets with an offset around 3d in the vertical direction fig 11 the dispersion in the horizontal direction decreased as the droplet size increased figs 5 and 12 similarly the vertical dispersion of droplets was higher for smaller droplets since the movement of small droplets was dominated by the flow induced by cvp while the movement of large droplets was dominated by their buoyancy and the flow induced by cvp the lateral dispersion of the 3 mm droplets was not significantly different from that of smaller droplets since their lateral motion was also under the influence of cvp figs 6 and 14 the normalized eddy diffusivity based on eq 13 was averaged across the plume cross section at different horizontal distances from the orifice and observed to be increasing from 0 11 to 0 18 in the horizontal direction fig 15 the dispersion coefficients at different directions were also computed using the kinematics approach and compared to the eddy diffusivity from les vortex trapping of cvp was studied at the cross section of the plume by releasing droplets of various sizes from the left and right vortex cores droplets of 700 μ m and 800 μ m escaped both vortices after t 200 the 600 μ m droplets started to leave from both vortices after t 250 the 400 μ m and 500 μ m droplets were trapped in both vortices up to t 850 after which only a small number of 500 μ m escaped the left vortex the vortex trapping function proposed by friedman and katz 2002 also estimated the trapping of droplets with a diameter of 400 μ m and smaller the cvp has a significant role in the distribution of the 1 mm and smaller droplets bimodal concentration distribution with peaks near the cores of cvp vortices and minimum concentration near the central plane was observed in the lateral horizontal direction therefore the oil dsd measured in the center plane of the jets in crossflow could underestimate the number of small droplets in the whole plume credit authorship contribution

23927,understanding the trajectory of oil droplets in crossflow jets is important to estimate the pathways of hydrocarbons and to plan countermeasures we report experimental results of an oil jet with release velocity around 1 5 m s in a crossflow of 0 3 m s the hydrodynamics of the jet obtained with the large eddy simulation les were used to predict the migration of the oil droplets two lagrangian techniques were explored one with the inertia of the droplet is considered and the other that treats the droplets as massless particles with rising velocities corresponding to their size we did not note a large difference between the two approaches the droplets showed stronger segregation in the vertical direction which renders the usage of a gaussian distribution approximation in the vertical inapplicable the dispersion coefficient at each direction was computed for different sized droplets the eddy diffusivity computed based on boussinesq gradient approximation using the les data was compared with the dispersion coefficients obtained based on lagrangian tracking we also found that droplets 500 μ m and larger escape the vortex while smaller ones get trapped within the vortex a similar outcome was observed using a vortex trapping function based on inward outward force balancing at the elevation of the vortex core the counter rotating vortex pair cvp altered the distribution of droplets of 1 mm and smaller significantly and bimodal concentration distributions with peaks near the cvp vortex cores and minimum concentration near the center plane were obtained in the lateral horizontal direction therefore measurements of the oil droplet size distribution dsd in the center plane of crossflow jets could underestimate the number of small droplets in the whole plume keywords jet in crossflow lagrangian particle tracking dispersion coefficient eddy diffusivity counter rotating vortex pair vortex trapping 1 introduction the size of an oil droplet emanating from an underwater blowout is important as it determines its trajectory and fate large droplets rise faster in the water column zhao et al 2015 and dissolve and or biodegrade slower than smaller ones gros et al 2017 socolofsky et al 2019 a recent comprehensive review by boufadel et al 2020 detailed the effects of the droplet size distribution and the chemistry of oil droplets on multiphase oil plumes the interest in the droplet formation and transport increased following the deepwater horizon disaster which occurred at 1500 m depth of the gulf of mexico in 2010 reddy et al 2012 although that plume was vertical in a stratified environment there is also interest in understanding multiphase plumes in crossflow droplet transport in crossflow plumes is crucial to estimate the fate of oil droplets and has been addressed through experiments that simulated large scale 300 diameters from the orifice plume socolofsky et al 2002 in contrast to vertical plumes i e no crossflow the spatial distribution of droplets cannot be assumed axisymmetric due to the different rise velocity of droplets based on their size socolofsky et al 2002 and different hydrodynamics obtained for jets in crossflow the discrete large droplets are separated from the entrained water due to their higher individual buoyancy socolofsky et al 2002 there are several experimental works cheung 1991 socolofsky et al 2002 tian and roberts 2003 gopalan et al 2004 milanovic et al 2012 murphy et al 2016 and numerical studies yuan et al 1999 muldoon and acharya 2006 muppidi and mahesh 2007 bodart et al 2013 behzad et al 2016 for the jet in crossflow in most of the work in the literature the fluids are miscible or only single phase and do not create discrete droplets in the experimental work of cheung 1991 hot water was injected into the crossflow to create a buoyant plume and the dilution along its path was quantified based on the variation of the temperature muppidi and mahesh 2007 conducted single phase direct numerical simulation dns of a jet in crossflow and reported the turbulent kinetic energy budgets in the near and far field of the plume gopalan et al 2004 revealed the two dimensional velocity field of the jet in crossflow using particle image velocimetry piv technique at low jet to crossflow velocity ratios r between 0 5 and 2 5 different types of coherent vortical structures such as wake vortices and counter rotating vortex pair arise due to the interaction between the jet and crossflow the elongated tornado like wake vortices originate from the leeward side of the plume milanovic et al 2012 daskiran et al 2020 and move downward in the vertical direction although they resemble the vortex street behind a solid cylinder they are actually dissimilar fric and roshko 1994 since the wake vortices are located beneath the plume with a relatively smaller size with respect to cvp their role in mixing across the plume is not robust the cvp was considered as the signature of jets in crossflow becoming the only structure persisting in the far field of the plume cambonie et al 2013 mahesh 2013 the increase in velocity ratio delays the counter rotating vortex pair cvp formation smith and mungal 1998 mahesh 2013 since the jet starts to resemble a vertical jet with increasing r the cvp induces upward velocity along the centerline of the plume and downward velocity along the sides of the plume moreover it creates outward velocity near the top and inward velocity near the lower part of the plume blanchard et al 1999 investigated the evolution of the size of each vortex left and right vortices in cvp in the lateral and vertical directions and reported negligible asymmetry up to x d 20 they observed cvp near the orifice after four pipe diameters away from the orifice in crossflow direction cambonie et al 2013 compared the jet centerline trajectory to the cvp trajectories at different velocity ratios from 0 5 to 3 0 and found that the cvp trajectory scales with the jet to crossflow momentum ratio and the crossflow boundary layer thickness they also studied the influence of jet velocity jet velocity profile and crossflow velocity on cvp trajectory salewski et al 2007 conducted single and multiphase simulations for jets in crossflow for the same momentum and mass flow ratios they reported stronger cvp and weaker wake vortices for the multiphase case with droplets several models including the visjet by cheung et al 2000 the corjet by jirka 2004 and the tamoc by socolofsky et al 2015 can estimate the trajectories and dilution of plumes in crossflow based on the eulerian or lagrangian integral method however these models do not account for the cvp and hence assume self similar velocity and concentration distribution across the plume ignoring the cvp can also cause incorrect estimation of the plume dilution especially for immiscible plumes in which the dispersed phase i e bubbles or droplets is affected by the flow induced by the continuous phase recently murphy et al 2016 conducted oil jet experiments by towing the pipe horizontally to mimic the crossflow they obtained the droplet size distribution near the core of the left side vortex of the cvp through images obtained by mini holocam cameras almost all of the droplets obtained near the vortex core were smaller than 200 μ m which suggested that droplets smaller than 200 μ m were trapped inside the vortex since they also observed 3 mm to 5 mm droplets near the upper boundary of the plume in this work we conducted experiments of a vertical oil release in crossflow and we measured the oil droplet size distribution at downstream distances and we investigated the transport of individual droplets of comparable sizes to the measured values we also applied continuous release of different sized droplets from the vortex cores and monitored the number of droplets that remain trapped inside the cvp the hydrodynamics used herein was obtained in our prior work with large eddy simulation les daskiran et al 2020 to our best knowledge this is the first numerical work investigating the vortex trapping for jets in crossflow moreover we investigated the transport of oil droplets of various sizes through the lagrangian particle tracking approach the location of the droplet cloud centroid and the variance and dispersion coefficient of the droplet cloud estimated with the kinematics approach and newton s second law were compared the role of the drag buoyancy added mass pressure gradient and lift force on droplet transport were investigated the turbulent diffusion coefficient was computed based on boussinesq gradient approximation from les data and compared to the dispersion coefficient in different directions 2 methods and materials the hydrodynamics and characteristics of the oil jet in crossflow were addressed in our previous work daskiran et al 2020 in which simulated plume trajectory was compared to our experiments at ohmsett tank www ohmsett com in leonardo new jersey the oil was released from a 25 mm one inch diameter vertical orifice with a flow rate of 40 liters min the system was towed at a speed of 0 27 m s generating a relative crossflow this resulted in a jet to crossflow velocity ratio r u o i l u 5 0 and a jet to crossflow momentum ratio r m ρ o i l u o i l 2 ρ u 2 4 6 the velocity ratio is an important parameter for characterizing the flow field of jets in crossflow friedman and katz 2002 muppidi and mahesh 2007 milanovic et al 2012 mahesh 2013 a velocity ratio smaller than 10 0 represents a strong crossflow ghosh and hunt 1998 in the les simulation detailed in daskiran et al 2020 a pipe with a length of 50 cm 20d where d is the pipe diameter was placed 8d above the tank bottom similar to the experiments the pipe was placed 160d away from the crossflow inlet and 240d away from the channel outlet the orifice was 70d away from the water surface a top hat velocity profile was assigned at the pipe inlet which became sheared at the orifice and a top hat horizontal velocity profile was adopted at the crossflow inlet with a speed of 0 27 m s mimicking the towing speed in the experiments at the outlet a zero gradient condition normal to the outlet boundary was imposed for the velocity and constant gauge pressure of 0 pa atmospheric pressure was adopted a no slip condition was assigned to the inner and outer surfaces of the pipe and the bottom surface of the computational domain a zero shear condition was adopted for the side boundaries of the domain and the water free surface initially a top hat velocity profile was adopted inside the pipe filled with oil and a horizontal velocity of 0 27 m s was set in crossflow direction outside of the pipe a total of 20 million mesh elements were used in the les simulation the mesh was refined inside the oil plume region based on the snapshots from the experiments the cell size varied in the range of 2 mm to 8 mm by coarsening along the plume path the cell size outside of the oil plume was increased gradually to 32 mm and then increased to 64 mm near the domain boundaries far away from the region of interest the images of droplets near the top and bottom boundaries of the plume were taken using two shadowgraph cameras that consist of illumination and camera pods between which the droplets pass through and captured with the camera the gap between the illumination and the camera can be adjusted based on the concentration of oil for the cases with higher oil droplet concentration a smaller gap becomes favorable to avoid dark images due to back to back droplets across the gap the maximum droplet size is another parameter to determine the gap size in our experiments the gap for the top and bottom shadowgraph cameras was 3 4 cm and 2 0 cm respectively the top camera was placed at x y z 66 4d 1 6d 56 7d where the origin 0 0 0 was placed at the center of the pipe exit the bottom camera was placed at x y z 76 4d 1 2d 32d the field of view was 65 4 mm 49 1 mm for the top camera and 33 6 mm 24 6 mm for the bottom camera the speed of the top camera was higher with 24 fps while the speed of the bottom camera was 8 fps the flow parameters and properties of the oil fuel oil 2 are reported in table 1 the crossflow is in the x direction and the jet is in the z direction the origin was placed at the center of the pipe orifice

as follows 1 d x p d t u p u p d d s g s d x with an initial condition x p 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 at t 0 the unresolved velocity vector u p is determined by using eddy diffusivity in reynolds averaged navier stokes rans modeling and using sub grid eddy diffusivity d s g s in large eddy simulation les raman et al 2005 since a portion of the turbulent velocity has already been resolved the unresolved velocity vector u p u p v p w p was estimated by 2a u p r x 2 d s g s δ t δ t 2b v p r y 2 d s g s δ t δ t 2c w p r z 2 d s g s δ t δ t where r x r y and r z follow a gaussian 0 1 distribution and δ t is the time step the sub grid eddy diffusivity was estimated by assuming constant sub grid schmidt number s c s g s of 1 0 where s c s g s ν s g s d s g s and ν s g s is sub grid eddy viscosity the sub grid eddy viscosity was computed using the smagorinsky sgs model smagorinsky 1963 in les given by 3 v s g s c s δ 2 s where c s is the smagorinsky constant taken as 0 168 in the present study δ is

to obtain the velocity vector u p u p v p w p in eq 1 i kinematics approach and ii newton s second law 2 2 kinematics approach in this approach the fluid velocity components are assigned to the droplet velocity in the vertical direction the terminal rise velocity of the droplet is added to the fluid velocity vector u f u f v f w f as follows 4a u p u f 4b v p v f 4c w p w f w t where u f v f and w f are fluid velocity components in x y and z directions and w t is the terminal rise velocity of droplet due to buoyancy the terminal rise velocity of droplets of diameter d is given by white

above is defined as 7 re r ρ w u f u p d μ w here μ w is the dynamic viscosity of water and u f u p is the magnitude of the slip velocity which is the velocity resulting from the difference between the droplet velocity and the fluid velocity the influence of the droplet deformation on the drag force was investigated for the droplet sizes considered and the current method for the droplet terminal velocity eq 5 was found to be agreeing well with the prior work by clift et al 2005 and zheng and yapa 2000 see the comparison in table 2 2 2 1 newton s second law in newton s approach the droplet motion is governed by the equation of motion which is newton s second law following earlier works saffman 1965 maxey and riley 1983 eames 2008 bakhoday paskyabi 2015 the equation of motion can be

was calculated based on eqs 6 7 the buoyancy force could be upward or downward depending on the density of the fluid around the droplet upward in water for oil the added mass term results from the fact that the droplet accelerates or decelerates the surrounding fluid the pressure gradient induces motion from high pressure to low pressure zones in the flow field the lift force causes displacement of the droplet normal to the direction of the continuous phase eq 1 was solved using the fourth order runge kutta scheme hairer et al 1987 eq 8 is nonlinear and solved using the implicit picard s iterative method istok 1989 connelly and kokini 2007 the time step size used in the les was 7 10 5 s after the flow reached quasi steady behavior ensuring the courant friedrichs lewy condition cfl number less than unity the hydrodynamics from the les was saved for each 0 05 s and used herein for particle tracking the time step size used in both the kinematics and newton approaches was 2 0 10 3 s in two dimensional simulations and 2 5 10 4 s in three dimensional simulations for all droplet sizes considered since the time step size in the lagrangian approach was smaller than the frequency of the data obtained from the les linear interpolation was applied to two consecutive les data the cell size was 5 mm 0 2d in both 2d and 3d simulations 2 3 spatial moments of oil droplets the method of moments was used to compute the motion of droplet cloud centroid and the dispersion of the droplet cloud fischer et al 1979 these variables can be considered upscaled quantities of the plume and have been used in our previous studies boufadel et al 2006 2007 geng et al 2016 the moments can be computed numerically as follows 9 m c q t i 1 n m i s c i t q q 0 1 2 where n is the total

m c 0 t 2 here m i is the mass of an oil droplet which can be set to 1 0 since same sized droplets were released for each simulation and all same sized droplets are assumed to be of equal mass the dispersion coefficient in direction c is given by 12 e c t 1 2 d d t σ c 2 2 4 computation of eddy diffusivity through les simulation the eddy viscosity was extracted from the les through boussinesq gradient approximation muldoon and acharya 2006 pichler et al 2016 ling et al 2017 which was given by 13 v t i 1 3 j i 3 2 3 k δ i j s i j u i u j s i j i 1 3 j i 3 2 s i j s i j 14 where k 1 2 u i 2 here k is turbulent kinetic energy and s i j is the mean strain rate tensor which was computed using the spatial derivations of time averaged resolved velocity components the fluctuating component of the resolved velocity was computed as follows 15 u i u i u i where u i is the resolved velocity by les and u i is the time averaged resolved velocity in the computation of eddy diffusivity constant turbulent schmidt number s c t 1 0 gualtieri et al 2017 which is the ratio of eddy viscosity v t to eddy diffusivity d t was assumed 2 5 dimensionless formulation in literature the characteristic length scale for a jet in crossflow is the diameter of the pipe d and the characteristic time scale is the ratio of the pipe diameter to the crossflow speed d u muppidi and mahesh 2007 galeazzo et al 2013 the eddy diffusivity can be normalized by the product of the jet velocity at the pipe orifice and the pipe diameter u o i l d coletti et al 2013 ryan et al 2017 or by the product of the crossflow speed and the pipe diameter u d ling et al 2017 the latter was adopted herein to make the modeling results comparable to other studies with different flow parameters the flow parameters were normalized as follows 16 x x d y y d z z d t t d u u u u v v u w w u and d t d t u d 3 results fig 1a shows the oil plume from our experiments the plume was opaque near the field of the plume x d 14 and large clearances were observed at x d 14 32 42 and 54 inside the plume in the vertical direction which might be related to the variability in oil flow rate experimental errors and or the strong crossflow with a jet to crossflow velocity ratio of 5 0 two shadowgraph cameras were placed near the top and bottom boundaries of the plume to record images of droplets numerical simulations of the jet in crossflow were conducted using les simulation coupled with the mixture multiphase model daskiran et al 2020 fig 1b shows the simulated plume holdup oil content from les as a snapshot the outline of the plume observed in the experiment is also superimposed the simulated lower boundary of the plume matched well with the observations however the simulated upper boundary was below the observed one since a constant rise slip velocity was adopted in the les based on the volume median droplet size d 50 near the lower boundary of the plume which was smaller than that near the upper boundary 1 6 mm vs 4 4 mm the vertical motion of the plume was found out by comparing the plume trajectory without rise velocity and with rise velocity of 5 cm s based on the d 50 of 1 6 mm then the upper boundary of the plume was computed using the rise velocity of droplets near the upper boundary which was 11 cm s for 4 4 mm droplet size the estimated upper boundary compared well with the observations fig 1b note that the rise velocity to apply to the oil holdup does not impact the momentum equation daskiran et al 2020 fig 2 shows the oil droplet size distribution dsd obtained by analyzing the images taken by the shadowgraph cameras near the lower and upper boundaries of the plume in the experiments for the bottom camera the dsd shows a unimodal distribution with a peak at around the droplet size of 1 8 mm which is close to the d 50 of the distribution which was 1 6 mm the minimum droplet size captured was 400 μ m while the maximum droplet size obtained was 5 8 mm the dsd showed a large variability at droplets larger than 4 mm which is related to the small number of large droplets at that location fig 2b shows a unimodal dsd obtained from the top camera near the upper boundary of the plume the minimum droplet size was 1 mm and the maximum droplet size was 10 mm the dsd had a peak at around 4 mm and the d 50 was computed to be 4 4 mm by comparison to the bottom camera the oil droplets from the top camera were thus larger than those from the bottom camera fig 3 shows the oil holdup in various sections of the plume the instantaneous oil holdup at the center plane a shows that the plume was opaque up to z d 8 and beyond it was broken down to oil blobs the jet was almost vertical up to z d 3 beyond z d 3 it started to bend in crossflow direction until z d 12 then the plume continued to move with 30 to the crossflow direction higher oil holdup was obtained near the top boundary of the plume the time averaged oil holdup contours at the center plane b revealed the rapid dilution of oil from unity at the orifice to 0 1 at x d 14 and to 0 01 at x d 50 time averaged oil holdup contours are shown in fig 3c at different cross sections of the plume at x d 8 x d 20 x d 32 and x d 48 at x d 8 higher oil holdup was obtained almost in a circular region with a low oil holdup in a small region near the center bottom part of the cross section higher oil holdup was obtained near the top boundary of the plume at x d 20 the oil distribution looks like a kidney shape with higher oil holdup near the top and side boundaries of the plume the overall oil holdup decreased as compared to that at x d 8 the plume boundaries expanded in each direction at x d 32 and 48 the kidney shape of the plume did not change however the oil holdup decreased dramatically while moving downstream the non uniform kidney shaped oil distribution is related to the coherent vortical structures named counter rotating vortex pair and will be detailed next fig 4 shows the fluid velocity in different directions along various sections or cuts all velocity components were normalized by the crossflow speed fig 4a shows that the horizontal crossflow speed decreased near the top boundary of the plume increased inside the plume and decreased again near the lower boundary of the plume which is clear by following the velocity variation along the x direction at y d 0 the purely horizontal velocity vectors gained lateral components at x d 30 in fig 4b the cvp induced upward motion along the center plane at y d 0 and a smaller downward motion near the side boundaries of the plume the velocity vectors identified the recirculation cells clearly the lateral velocity contours in c reveal velocity in y direction along top right and bottom left subzones and in y direction along top left and bottom right subzones in b c it must be noted that the vertical and lateral velocities became almost zero above the cvp which is important while evaluating the motion of large droplets separated from the cvp 3 1 droplet tracking in the near field of the plume three dimensional analysis different sized oil droplets were seeded randomly with a uniform distribution from a circumscribed circular region with a diameter of 8d at x d 8 which corresponds to s d 15 where s is the direction in the jet path fig 1 shown in fig 3c the center of the circular region was placed at x d 8 and z d 10 this was done because based on our work with jets zhao et al 2014 2015 2017 the majority of oil droplets are created within 10 to 15 diameters from the orifice at each simulation oil droplets of sizes 50 μ m 500 μ m 1 mm and 3 mm were released which is based on the range of the droplet size obtained in the experiments fig 2 three hundred droplets were released for each droplet size fig 5 shows the side view of the spatial distribution of droplets with various sizes computed at consecutive times along with the instantaneous streamlines on the central plane the positions of the cameras used in the experiment are also shown the droplet trajectory was computed based on newton s second law eq 8 the streamlines were displaced in both vertical and horizontal directions due to the turbulence in the plume at t 10 8 the relatively larger spatial variation of the horizontal velocity at the location of 1 mm and smaller droplets fig 8a in daskiran et al 2020 resulted in more spatial dispersion of the small droplets this behavior might also be related to the high velocity shear at the location of the small droplets since their buoyancy is relatively small they keep staying near the oil plume water shear layer near the lower boundary of the plume at t 32 4 the cloud size in crossflow direction was 22d for the 50 μ m and 500 μ m droplets 19d for the 1 mm droplets and 17d for the 3 mm droplets which was 7d for all droplet sizes at the beginning t 5 4 at t 43 2 the maximum elevation reached was z d 28 for the 50 μ m and 500 μ m droplets z d 32 for the 1 mm droplets and z d 40 for the 3 mm droplets at t 54 0 most of the droplets reaching the bottom camera were 1 mm and smaller and only the bottom part of the 3 mm droplet cloud passed through the bottom camera based on the simulations the supplementary video video s1 shows the transient behavior of this process clearly see the video in the online version comparing to the dsd obtained in the experiments fig 2 the range of the droplet size was captured well at the location of the bottom camera however although the droplets around 1 mm to 3 mm i e the lower range of the dsd plot obtained in the experiments were captured by the top camera in the experiments the released 1 mm and 3 mm droplets did not reach the location of the top camera this could be that the 1 mm and 3 mm droplets that were observed in the experiments did not emanate from the location where we place them initially x d 8 in our simulation but at a location further downstream in the plume however we believe it is due to the fact that the les simulation and the mixture model that we considered could not capture the drag of individual droplets on the surrounding fluid as they rise which would have the effect of displacing the fluid upward which would accelerate the rise of droplets our approach is similar to that of yang et al 2016 and fabregat et al 2016 considering the drift stress term which appears in the mixture momentum equation due to the relative velocity among the phases manninen et al 1996 would allow the 1 mm and 3 mm droplets to pass through the top camera however this would alter the trajectory of the droplet cloud that passed through the bottom camera therefore it seems the only way to accurately model droplet transport in the multiphase plume is through the usage of an eulerian eulerian two fluid approach daskiran et al 2017 zhang and jiao 2018 where the size of the dispersed phase i e oil droplet size herein is provided to the model and the momentum equations are solved for both phases separately by allowing momentum exchange between the phases through the interfacial forces term the distribution of different sized droplets along the plume cross section is shown in fig 6 at consecutive times the position of the top and bottom cameras employed in the experiments is provided the instantaneous streamlines at each cross section revealed the cvp and its transient behavior at t 5 4 the overall droplet cloud expanded in the vertical direction due to the different rise velocity of different sized droplets where one notes the large droplets at the top and the small ones at the bottom the centerline of the vortex pair and the vortex cores were covered by the droplets all droplets seemed entrained upward by the vertical flow among two vortices at t 10 8 the tail of the droplet cloud for the 1 mm and smaller droplets elongated more at the bottom right side of the droplet cloud due to the instantaneous asymmetric nature of the cvp the cvp distributed droplets in the vertical and lateral directions which resulted in droplet dilution along the center leeward side of the droplet cloud the elevations of the 50 μ m and 500 μ m droplet clouds were similar at t 16 2 the size of the overall droplet cloud increased in both vertical and lateral directions the droplets with a diameter of 3 mm got closer to the top portion of cvp which improved their dispersion in the lateral direction at t 21 6 the number of the droplets and the shape of the 3 mm droplet cloud was different on both sides of the cvp due to the cvp asymmetry it was clearer to distinguish the 50 μ m and 500 μ m droplet clouds at t 27 0 kidney shaped droplet distribution was obtained for each droplet cloud similar to the oil holdup contours in fig 3 at t 32 4 and later due to higher rise velocity near the center plane the left side of the 3 mm droplet cloud elongated from z d 22 to z d 42 at t 43 2 although the central part of the 1 mm droplet cloud reached the top part of the cvp at t 48 6 the 1 mm droplets mostly rise within the cvp some of the 1 mm droplets escaped the cvp until t 64 8 the 50 μ m and 500 μ m droplets continued dispersing into both vortex bodies and mostly moved with the cvp until t 64 8 the supplementary video video s2 shows the transient behavior of this process clearly see the video in the online version it was observed from the streamlines and particle tracking analysis that the cvp was not symmetric along the central plane similarly mahesh 2013 reported the cvp is highly unstable and asymmetric instantaneously the linear stability analysis by alves et al 2007 revealed different growth rates of the cvp vortices which resulted in asymmetry in the experiments of blanchard et al 1999 lateral evolution of the left and vortices was also observed to be asymmetric after x d 20 fig 7 shows the time series of the physical forces applied to one of the droplets for each size bin in the vertical direction the physical forces were normalized with the droplet mass to present the vertical acceleration or deceleration of the droplets for each droplet size the buoyancy is constant since it only depends on the density of the droplet and the surrounding fluid the droplet diameter and the gravity which were assumed constant in the simulations for each droplet size the dominant forces were drag and buoyancy the drag force for the 50 μ m droplet varied rapidly with time which is probably due to the small inertia of the droplet as noted below the 50 μ m droplets move closely with the flow and thus would be highly impacted by the turbulence the added mass force was also negligible as compared to the drag force for all droplets except for the 50 μ m ones which became positive and negative instantly for all droplet sizes the contribution of pressure gradient force was mostly higher than the added mass force the pressure gradient force became higher than the drag force for a short time at t 5 0 for the 3 mm droplets the lift force was almost zero for droplets 1 mm and smaller for the whole time range considered herein it showed a peak with an amplitude 20 of the drag force at t 6 0 for the 3 mm droplet however it was mostly zero and considered to be negligible in this work in addition to the individual forces the sum of the normalized forces was also plotted to show the vertical acceleration of the droplet in different sizes the 50 μ m 500 μ m droplets showed higher acceleration initially due to the pressure gradient force with a peak at t 4 0 at which it started to decrease to reach small values around zero at t 8 after t 8 they experienced acceleration and deceleration in the range between 0 5 m s2 and 0 5 m s2 the 1 mm droplet accelerated until t 18 with a value of around 1 0 m s2 after t 18 it showed acceleration and deceleration with a smaller magnitude the 3 mm droplet decelerated in the range of 4 t 12 due to a sudden increase in the drag and pressure gradient forces and made a peak at t 5 with a value of 2 8 m s2 after t 12 it showed acceleration and deceleration with a smaller magnitude tracking forces exerted on a single droplet only in the vertical direction may not be sufficient to come up with a proper conclusion therefore additional droplet tracking simulations were conducted for each droplet size by excluding the added mass pressure gradient and lift forces fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of different sized droplets with and without three forces added mass pressure gradient and lift forces at t 53 4 for the 50 μ m droplets the vertical and lateral distribution of droplets were almost the same with and without these three forces there was only a slight position difference for some of the droplets the number of droplets affected by other forces increased for the droplet size of 500 μ m and 1 mm however the cumulative distribution of droplets and the outer boundary of the droplet cloud were not affected noticeably the narrowing cloud tail near the right vortex was captured well in both cases the elongated and thinning tail of the 3 mm droplet cloud near the left vortex was captured mostly with a slightly larger width in the lateral direction with the addition of other forces the m like shape of the 3 mm droplet cloud was captured well with and without the additional forces as the distribution of different sized droplets was considered across the plume cross section one can conclude that the dominant forces are the drag and buoyancy forces the influence of the added mass pressure gradient and lift forces can be neglected smith and mungal 1998 reported the concentration along the line in lateral horizontal direction for miscible fluid they normalized distance with the product of the velocity ratio r 10 and the orifice diameter and provided concentration at x rd 2 0 which corresponds to x d 10 in this work r 5 however while the plume expands 14d in the lateral direction at x rd 2 0 in the experiments where the jet reynolds number based on jet exit diameter and jet velocity was 33000 it expanded 12d in the present work with r 5 0 and re 7100 see figs 3c and 6a in the present work the lateral expansion of the 50 μ m droplet cloud became similar to the experiment 14d at x rd 6 0 i e x d 30 fig 9 compares the concentration distribution of the 50 μ m droplet cloud obtained in this work with the lagrangian approach along the lateral horizontal line across the cvp at z d 16 as the cloud centroid reached x c d 30 at t 22 to the concentration distribution obtained in the experiments of smith and mungal 1998 at z d 16 0 in the experiments of smith and mungal 1998 a miscible jet with a velocity ratio of 10 0 and a higher re number was used while an immiscible jet with a velocity ratio of 5 0 was used in this work hence the comparison in fig 9 is rather qualitative to indicate where the low and high concentrations occur the distribution of the 50 μ m droplets was selected to compare to the concentration in miscible jets since the 50 μ m droplets were considered to be following the continuous fluid due to their negligible inertia in the lagrangian approach the droplets passing through the cubic volumes with a size of d in all directions were counted for the time period of t 75 0 with increments of d in the lateral direction in this work the maximum concentration was observed with bimodal distribution closer to the cores of the cvp vortices at y d 3 and y d 4 the concentration was relatively higher near the right vortex core with a value of 0 2 as compared to the droplet concentration near the left vortex with a value of 0 13 for y d 6 and at y d 1 0 no droplets were counted a minimum number of droplets were counted at y d 0 and y d 1 0 similar to the numerical predictions the bimodal distribution of concentration was obtained across the cvp in the experiments the maximum concentration was observed at y d 6 and y d 4 with both instantaneous and mean data the maximum concentration near the left vortex was relatively higher than that near the right vortex 0 16 vs 0 1 based on the instantaneous data and 0 07 vs 0 04 based on the mean data the minimum concentration was obtained near the middle of the cvp vortices at y d 1 0 the trend of the concentration distribution across the cvp was similar in both the experiments and the numerical simulation higher near the vortex cores with peaks and lower near the middle which is induced with the cvp similar concentration distribution was reported by several researchers for the jet in crossflow such as bodart et al 2013 galeazzo et al 2013 and ruiz et al 2015 3 2 spatial moments comparison of the kinematics approach and newton s second law the horizontal centroid position of the droplet clouds obtained based on the kinematics approach and newton s second law is shown in the left panel of fig 10 as a function of the normalized time the initial position of all droplets was x d 8 the droplet motion in the horizontal direction was dominated by the crossflow speed as confirmed by the slope of 1 0 for each line for different sizes of droplets the horizontal position of the droplet cloud centroid changed slightly since the interaction between the jet and crossflow induces horizontal velocity locally higher or lower than the crossflow velocity fig 4a the similar horizontal velocity of droplet clouds with different sizes of droplets can also be revealed through the transient droplet distribution in fig 5 both the kinematics and newton approaches gave almost the same results the right panel in fig 10 shows the lateral location of the cloud centroids which slightly meandered about the center plane the centroid of the 50 μ m 500 μ m and 1 mm droplet clouds moved similarly in the lateral direction while looking downstream the centroid moved toward the right side of the center plane up to x c d 11 where it changed its direction toward the left then the centroid passed through the center plane at x c d 16 and continued moving toward the left reaching y c d 1 1 y c d 0 7 and y c d 0 6 for the 50 μ m 500 μ m and 1 mm droplet clouds respectively once each droplet cloud reached x c d 67 the lateral motion of the cloud centroid can be related to the instantaneous asymmetric behavior of the cvp mahesh 2013 it must be noted that the lateral motion of the cloud centroid is less than 1d the centroid of the 3 mm droplet cloud started to move toward the right and changed its direction to the left at x c d 20 and then to the right again at x c d 32 and reached y c d 0 35 at x c d 67 the difference between the kinematics and newton approaches for the lateral position of the cloud centroid increased with the droplet size the kinematics approach mostly estimated the lateral motion larger however considering the scale of the vertical axis on the plots the differences can be considered negligible fig 11 shows the vertical location of the cloud centroid for different droplet sizes as a function of the horizontal location of the cloud centroid each plot in fig 11 represents the trajectory of droplet clouds with different sizes of droplets in addition to the trajectories of the droplet cloud centroids with different droplet sizes the plume trajectory obtained from our les simulation based on the streamline of the mean velocity field introduced from the pipe center was presented the center streamline showed a similar trend to the droplet clouds with 1 mm and smaller droplets in the near field of the plume up to x c d 20 the centroid of the droplet clouds with 1 mm and smaller droplets was similar and the offset of their trajectory to the trajectory of the center streamline was around 3d with lower penetration of the droplet clouds to the crossflow in the far field the offset between the center streamline and the trajectory of the 1 mm droplet cloud kept almost the same at 3d but increased gradually for the 50 μ m and 500 μ m droplet clouds to 7d and 5d respectively at x c d 65 the bending of the vertical jet in crossflow direction occurred mostly just before the initial position of the droplets see fig 3 therefore the cloud centroids rise almost linear for each droplet size with only slight bending in the far field of the plume the trajectories of small droplets almost non buoyant are expected to be aligned with crossflow direction due to decay in the vertical jet momentum and decrease in the cvp strength which induces upward velocity the centroid of large sized droplets rose faster at x c d 65 the droplet clouds with 50 μ m 500 μ m 1 mm and 3 mm droplets reached the height z c d equal to 25 26 28 and 37 respectively the kinematics approach gave similar results to newton s approach for all droplet sizes considered for the 3 mm droplet cloud the kinematics approach overestimated the rise velocity slightly at x c d 60 the kinematics approach gave a centroid that is less than 1d above the centroid given by newton s approach the left panel in fig 12 shows the normalized horizontal variance of the droplet cloud for different sizes of droplets the horizontal variance becomes zero initially for each droplet size since all the droplets were released exactly from x d 8 the horizontal variance increased continuously with the time for each droplet size the horizontal variance of droplets decreased with increasing droplet size for the droplet clouds with 1 mm and 3 mm droplets the droplet size of 1 mm and smaller showed the highest dispersion in the horizontal direction with a horizontal variance of 20 d 2 at x c d 67 which corresponds to a horizontal standard deviation of 20 d 2 4 5 d see fig 5j to compare the horizontal dispersion of different sized droplets as mentioned earlier while discussing fig 5 the larger dispersion of 1 mm and smaller droplets might be related to more spatial variation of the horizontal velocity and strong shear in the location of the smaller droplets both the kinematics and newton approaches estimated the horizontal variance of the cloud similarly for droplets 1 mm and smaller the discrepancy for the dispersion of the 3 mm droplet cloud started to increase at x c d 20 and reached a standard deviation of 2d at x c d 67 the right panel in fig 12 shows the variation of the normalized horizontal dispersion coefficient of the cloud with different sizes of droplets the dispersion coefficient was obtained with the time derivative of the variance eq 12 and normalized with the product of crossflow speed and pipe diameter the normalized horizontal dispersion coefficient of the 50 μ m droplet cloud increased suddenly from zero at x c d 8 to 0 5 at x c d 20 where it decreased to reach 0 1 at x c d 30 then it varied between 0 1 and 0 2 up to x c d 67 for the 500 μ m droplets the dispersion coefficient increased suddenly from zero at x c d 8 to 0 5 at x c d 20 where it decreased to reach 0 1 at x c d 40 and varied between 0 07 and 0 17 up to x c d 67 for the 1 mm droplet cloud the horizontal dispersion coefficient trend was similar to the 50 μ m and 500 μ m droplet clouds up to x c d 38 by making a peak at x c d 20 with a value of 0 45 and then decreasing to 0 1 at x c d 38 then it varied between 0 1 and 0 15 up to x c d 46 where it decreased to reach 0 07 at x c d 50 and then increased gradually to reach 0 2 at x c d 67 for the 3 mm droplet cloud it increased from zero at x c d 8 to 0 24 at x c d 19 where it decreased to reach 0 05 at x c d 28 then it increased to reach 0 2 at x c d 42 where it decreased to reach zero at x c d 62 and kept its value at zero up to x c d 67 the kinematics approach and newton s second law estimated the horizontal dispersion coefficient similarly with small local discrepancies for all droplet clouds the normalized vertical variance of droplet clouds with different sizes of droplets is depicted in the left panel of fig 13 as mentioned earlier all the droplets were released from a circular region with a diameter of 8d at x d 8 the vertical variance was computed to be 4 d 2 at the beginning which corresponds to a vertical standard deviation of 2d once the droplets were released the vertical variance of each droplet cloud decreased up to x c d 18 and then they started to disperse in the vertical direction since the buoyancy of smaller droplets is lower their motion was under the influence of the cvp induced flow and hence they dispersed more in the vertical direction the vertical variance of the droplet cloud with 1 mm and smaller droplets was similar and kept increasing with a decreasing slope up to x c d 67 to reach a vertical variance of 16 d 2 at x c d 67 thus a vertical standard deviation of 4d the 3 mm droplets also dispersed significantly in the vertical direction due to the elongated tails of the droplet cloud in the vertical direction fig 6 the vertical variance of the 3 mm droplet cloud increased continuously after x c d 18 with varying increase rates i e the slope there was an almost linear increase up to x c d 42 and then the rate of increase decreased gradually between x c d 42 and x c d 52 and then it picked up its initial rate of increase the 3 mm droplet cloud reached a vertical standard deviation of 4 2 d at x c d 67 the kinematics approach showed small deviations from newton s second law locally for all the droplet clouds the normalized vertical dispersion coefficient for different droplet sizes is shown in the right panel of fig 13 for all droplets the vertical dispersion coefficient was below zero up to x c d 18 due to decreasing vertical variance for the 50 μ m droplet cloud it increased suddenly from zero at x c d 18 to 0 25 at x c d 24 where it decreased to reach around zero at x c d 67 for the 500 μ m droplet cloud it increased suddenly from zero at x c d 18 to 0 35 at x c d 28 where it decreased to reach 0 03 at x c d 67 for the 1 mm droplet cloud it increased suddenly from zero at x c d 18 to 0 38 at x c d 23 where it decreased to reach 0 1 at x c d 60 and then varied between 0 1 and 0 16 up to x c d 67 for the 3 mm droplet cloud it increased suddenly from zero at x c d 18 to 0 25 at x c d 22 where it decreased to reach 0 1 at x c d 46 then it increased to reach 0 28 at x c d 55 where it decreased to reach 0 1 at x c d 67 the kinematics approach estimated the vertical dispersion coefficient similar to newton s second law with increasing local discrepancies for larger droplets the kinematics approach estimated a peak at x c d 31 for the 3 mm droplet cloud which was not obtained with newton s second law the normalized lateral variance of the cloud for different sized droplets is depicted in the left panel of fig 14 for the 50 μ m droplet cloud the variance of the cloud increased linearly up to x c d 25 and then continued increasing with a smaller slope up to x c d 67 where it has a variance value of 24 d 2 for the 500 μ m droplet cloud the variance increased linearly with almost the same slope up to x c d 67 where it has a variance value of 33 d 2 for the 1 mm droplet cloud similar to that of the 500 μ m droplet cloud the lateral variance increased linearly with almost the same slope up to x c d 67 where it has a variance value of 40 d 2 for the 3 mm droplet cloud the lateral variance increased continuously with slightly varying slopes and reached a variance value of 38 d 2 at x c d 67 for all droplets the kinematics approach captured the lateral variance of the cloud with a slight discrepancy the right panel of fig 14 shows the normalized lateral dispersion coefficient as a function of the horizontal location of the cloud centroid for the 50 μ m droplet cloud the normalized lateral dispersion coefficient varied between 0 28 and 0 38 for the range of 8 x c d 20 and then started to decrease to reach 0 1 at x c d 36 and increased gradually with small fluctuations up to x c d 60 where it reached a value of 0 18 for the 500 μ m droplet cloud it varied between 0 3 and 0 38 for the range of 8 x c d 20 and then started to decrease to reach 0 24 at x c d 30 beyond x c d 30 it increased suddenly to 0 3 at x c d 32 where it decreased to reach 0 18 at x c d 43 and then increased with fluctuations to reach 0 26 at x c d 67 for the 1 mm droplet cloud the lateral dispersion coefficient increased suddenly from 0 32 at x c d 8 to 0 42 at x c d 11 where it decreased to reach 0 33 at x c d 19 then it made a peak at x c d 22 with a value of 0 4 where it decreased to reach 0 2 at x c d 37 and then increased to reach 0 32 at x c d 67 for the 3 mm droplet cloud the lateral dispersion increased suddenly from 0 3 at x c d 8 to 0 48 at x c d 10 where it decreased to reach 0 18 at x c d 23 then it increased and reached a value of 0 3 between x c d 30 and x c d 40 where it decreased to reach 0 2 at x c d 43 then it increased and made a peak at x c d 53 at a value of 0 5 where it decreased to reach 0 26 at x c d 67 the kinematics and newton approaches estimated the lateral dispersion coefficient with small differences for the droplet clouds having 1 mm and smaller droplets for the 3 mm droplet cloud the kinematics approach could not capture the peak at x c d 53 and the fall at x c d 43 fig 15 shows the normalized eddy diffusivity based on eq 13 and the normalized dispersion coefficient of the cloud in different directions eddy diffusivity was computed based on boussinesq gradient approximation using resolved and fluctuating components of the velocity from the les simulation in the computation of eddy diffusivity the contours of eddy diffusivity at different cross sections of the plume were analyzed outside of the plume the eddy diffusivity was almost zero most probably due to the no perturbation condition at the crossflow inlet to reveal the eddy diffusivity inside the plume the field of interest was obtained by removing parts of the contours having values smaller than 3 10 4 m2 s d t u d 0 044 the average eddy diffusivity was computed across the plume cross section and presented in fig 15 the eddy diffusivity was computed negative in a small portion of the cross section in the computation of the mean eddy diffusivity absolute values were used to compare the eddy diffusivity and the dispersion coefficient of droplets the dispersion coefficient of the droplet cloud was estimated for droplets moving with the flow field through the kinematics approach without slip velocity in any direction w t 0 in eq 4c the mean eddy diffusivity increased gradually in the horizontal direction the normalized eddy diffusivity varied between 0 11 and 0 18 the normalized horizontal dispersion coefficient increased from zero at x c d 8 to 0 5 at x c d 20 where it decreased to reach 0 1 at x c d 20 and then varied between 0 1 and 0 16 up to x c d 60 the normalized vertical dispersion coefficient was below zero up to x c d 17 and increased rapidly from zero x c d 17 to 0 23 at x c d 22 and then decreased gradually with fluctuations to reach 0 18 at x c d 60 the normalized lateral dispersion coefficient was around 0 3 up to x c d 16 where it increased rapidly to reach 0 38 at x c d 17 where it decreased to reach 0 07 at x c d 33 beyond x c d 33 it varies between 0 07 and 0 17 up to x c d 60 ling et al 2017 conducted a large eddy simulation of a jet in crossflow and depicted the contours of normalized eddy viscosity the velocity ratio in their work was 5 7 which is close to the velocity ratio of 5 0 in this work they also normalized the eddy viscosity by upstream velocity and pipe diameter they depicted normalized eddy viscosity at the center plane from 0 to 0 45 which covers the eddy diffusivity computed in this work from 0 11 to 0 18 recall that the eddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity become equal for the turbulent schmidt number of unity kohli and bogard 2005 performed an experimental study of an inclined jet in crossflow for film cooling applications of gas turbines the instant velocity and temperature were measured through laser doppler velocimetry ldv and cold wire techniques respectively the holes with a diameter of 11 1 mm were inclined at 35 the crossflow velocity was 10 0 m s and the jet velocity was 3 8 m s which resulted in a velocity ratio r 0 38 they studied two cases with different free stream turbulence levels as 0 6 and 20 they observed normalized eddy diffusivity in the range from 0 01 to 0 07 with low free stream turbulence level and from 0 03 to 0 6 with high free stream turbulence level along the center plane the high free stream turbulence case covers the eddy diffusivity obtained in this work in both turbulence levels the eddy diffusivity increased in the horizontal direction which concurred with our findings 3 3 droplet tracking in the cvp vortex trapping dispersed droplets are expected to be trapped by vortices relatively larger than themselves as long as the inward force applied on the droplet toward the vortex core is higher than the outward force vigolo et al 2014 observed trapping of particles at a t junction which is used to split the flow into two branches their dns simulation revealed a counter rotating vortex pair inside each branch after the t junction they observed trapping and accumulation of particles in the vortices in their experiments and the lagrangian particle tracking approach murphy et al 2016 performed an oil jet experiment by towing the pipe in the horizontal direction to mimic the crossflow they measured the droplet size inside one of the cvp vortices using a hologram camera and obtained only the droplets smaller than 200 μ m outside the cvp they observed large droplets up to 3 5 mm near the upper boundary of the plume their observation revealed the potential of cvp on vortex trapping to investigate the behavior of different sized droplets against the trapping action of cvp we released different sized droplets from the vortex cores continuously and tracked their motion across the plume cross section the transient fluid velocity which is used in the equation of motion for droplets is only available up to 20 s of the flow time from daskiran et al 2020 which is not enough to reveal vortex trapping behavior of the cvp therefore time averaged flow data was used to track the droplets across the two dimensional plume cross section at x d 48 newton s second law was adopted and the added mass pressure gradient and lift forces were not considered based on the conclusion in section 3 2 fig 16 shows the distribution of different sized droplets across the plume cross section at different times initially two droplets for each droplet diameter of 400 μ m 500 μ m 600 μ m 700 μ m and 800 μ m were released randomly from the cores of each vortex after each 1 0 s t 10 8 two more droplets were released for each droplet size from each vortex core however their positions were different from the ones released previously at t 108 the droplets inside the left and right vortices moved in northwest and northeast directions respectively the droplets crossing the red colored streamline in fig 16a was considered as escaped while others were counted as trapped we decided on the location of the streamline based on the outer boundary of the circulating trapped droplets as long as the streamline covers the circulating droplet region one can determine the droplets leaving and staying inside the streamline choosing the streamline away from the vortex core will make the time longer to count the droplets as escaped which is not important for the objective of this study the 700 μ m and 800 μ m droplets started to escape from the left vortex due to their higher buoyancy at t 216 the larger droplets continue to escape both vortices the elevation of larger droplets was observed to be higher above the left vortex which reveals the asymmetric behavior of cvp although the flow has downward velocity around y d 20 and z d 34 see the streamlines the vertical motion of the 700 μ m and 800 μ m droplets was dominated by the buoyancy forces and they kept rising at t 324 the leading droplets on the left hand side with a diameter of 600 μ m 700 μ m and 800 μ m rose about 15d 26d and 34d respectively however only a few droplets with a diameter of 600 μ m escaped the right vortex at t 432 a few of the 600 μ m droplets were observed to be leaving the right vortex while the leading 600 μ m droplet with its followers reached z d 41 at the left vortex at t 1080 the escaped droplets with 600 μ m diameter and larger showed a series of droplets in the vertical direction the path of larger droplets was closer to the centerline since they separate the vortex earlier a few droplets of 500 μ m diameter escaped both vortices all of the 400 μ m droplets were trapped in the cvp the supplementary video video s3 shows the transient behavior of this process clearly see the video in the online version to reveal the number of trapped and escaped droplets the number of trapped droplets in both vortices are plotted as a function of time in fig 17 the number of released droplets was also shown in fig 17 as a reference the plot for the number of 400 μ m droplets inside the cvp follows the same trend as the number of released droplets only a few of the 500 μ m droplets started to escape the left vortex at t 850 almost all of them were trapped in the right vortex the number of trapped droplets with a diameter of 600 μ m was 125 in the left vortex and 150 in the right vortex at t 1100 the 600 μ m droplets started to escape both vortices at around t 250 and the number of trapped droplets did not reach a plateau within t 1100 in both vortices reaching a plateau means that the number of droplets with the plateau value keeps cycling inside the vortex the behavior of 700 μ m and 800 μ m droplets was almost the same in both vortices the number of 700 μ m reached a plateau by t 400 in both vortices and kept its number around 60 in the left vortex and 70 in the right vortex up to t 1100 the 800 μ m droplets in both vortices reached a plateau value of 40 around t 200 in addition to the determination of trapped and separated droplets with different sizes the motion of different sized droplets was also tracked fig 18a shows the vertical z coordinate of a single droplet of different sizes inside the right vortex the selected droplets of 400 μ m 500 μ m and 600 μ m were trapped in the cvp while the 700 μ m and 800 μ m droplets escaped the cvp and rose continuously without cycling inside the vortex the 700 μ m and 800 μ m droplets left the domain at t 400 the oscillating vertical trajectory of 600 μ m and smaller droplets revealed their revolution inside the vortex with a period of t 220 for 400 μ m and 500 μ m droplets and t 275 for 600 μ m droplet the radius of the path followed by 400 μ m and 500 μ m droplet was similar and larger than that of 600 μ m droplet and increased with time the 600 μ m droplet gets closer to the vortex core with the time which is clear from the decreasing amplitude of z d in fig 18a the snapshot of the path of the droplets on the right hand side of the cvp at t 1000 is shown in fig 18b the supplementary video video s4 shows the transient behavior of this process clearly see the video in the online version the lateral velocity of 700 μ m and 800 μ m droplets became higher than the vertical velocity at 10 y d 13 due to the lateral velocity induced by the cvp see the velocity vectors in fig 4c for y d 13 and z d 30 the flow induced by the cvp dissipated and the droplets rose with their buoyancy the droplets smaller than 700 μ m followed the circular motion in the vortex the buoyancy of droplets was not enough to overcome the downward vertical velocity induced by the cvp for these particular droplets the path of the 400 μ m and 500 μ m droplets expanded in the radial direction while the path of the 600 μ m droplet decreased which is related to the initial position of the droplets and local variations of the flow dynamics as the motion of another droplet released from a different location is analyzed a different pattern can be observed 3 4 vortex trapping function trapping of different sized droplets within cvp was evaluated using a trapping function developed by friedman and katz 2002 by considering inward and outward forces applied on a particle the final form of the trapping function is given by 17 ω ρ d c a ρ c ρ c 1 c a 1 v q u 2 c l 1 c a v q u where ρ c and ρ d are the density of the continuous and dispersed phases respectively the term v q is the rise velocity of droplets in the quiescent continuous phase eq 5 and u is the root mean square of the turbulent component of the continuous phase velocity following murphy et al 2016 the u was replaced with the vertical velocity estimated on both sides of the vortex core the trapping function is defined as the ratio of the outward escaping force to the inward force capturing acting on a droplet placed within the flow induced by a horizontal vortex and located at the same elevation as the vortex core in eq 17 the occurs in both terms as v q has the same direction with local vortex flow whereas sign occurs as v q counters the flow induced by the vortex if ω 1 the droplet has a net outward force which leads to droplet escape and if ω 1 the inward force dominates and leads to droplet trapping the trapping function can be used to evaluate the behavior of different sized droplets within the vortex flow induced by cvp fig 19a shows normalized relative vertical velocity profile v v cvp u along a horizontal line in the lateral direction passing through the left side vortex core where y d 0 corresponds to the center of the vortex core the term v represents the vertical fluid velocity along a horizontal line from the left side of the left vortex to the right side of the left vortex passing through the vortex core at y d 0 y is the lateral coordinate centered at the core of the left vortex and moves up to the plume center plane at y d 0 the term v cvp represents the vertical fluid velocity at the vortex core at y d 0 as observed in fig 19a the relative vertical velocity v v cvp u becomes zero at the vortex core since v v cvp and has the maximum value close to the center plane of the plume the location of the y d where maximum relative vertical velocity observed increases with x d because the increase of the vortex size with x d increases the distance from the vortex core to the center plane of the plume the velocity profiles were obtained at different cross sections of the plume including x d 8 x d 20 x d 32 and x d 48 using time averaged velocity data acquired from the large eddy simulation the relative vertical velocity along the right side boundary of the left vortex y d 0 decreased in horizontal direction i e the normalized vertical velocity along the center plane was around 0 76 at x d 8 which decreased to 0 51 at x d 20 this behavior reveals that the vertical velocity induced by the cvp decreased as the plume moves further in the horizontal direction the width of the vortex increased as the plume moves in the horizontal direction the distance from the center of the vortex core to the right side boundary of the vortex was around 2 4d at x d 8 and 8d at x d 48 the boundaries of the shaded region at both sides of fig 19a were used to determine the maximum droplet size which is expected to be trapped within the cvp fig 19b shows the trapping function as a function of relative vertical velocity for different sized droplets the solid lines show the trapping function near the upward moving side of the vortex while the dashed ones show the trapping function near the downward moving side of the vortex the shaded regions in fig 19b represent the shaded regions in fig 19a the droplet sizes studied herein were all trapped within the vortex when located near the downward moving side of the vortex on the upward moving side the 600 μ m droplet escapes while the 50 μ m droplet remains trapped at each part of the plume as x d 48 as the plume moves further downstream and the normalized vertical velocity near the upward moving side becomes smaller than approximately 0 02 the 50 μ m droplets are expected to escape the vortex however it is not the case for x d 48 the 400 μ m droplets would not escape until the normalized vertical velocity fell below 0 5 which happened at x d 48 the 200 μ m droplets are expected to escape from the vortex following the vortex induced normalized upward velocity falls below 0 16 which should happen when x d 48 on the shaded area in fig 19b the normalized upward velocities were obtained between 0 51 corresponds to the velocity at x d 48 see fig 19a and 0 76 corresponds to the velocity at x d 8 and the corresponding maximum droplet size expected to retain in the vortex was computed to be around 400 μ m at x d 48 and 540 μ m at x d 8 by equating the trapping function in eq 17 to unity ω 1 0 this observation reveals that the droplets larger than 540 μ m will start to escape the left vortex by x d 8 and the droplets larger than 400 μ m will start to escape the left vortex by x d 48 this observation concurs with the droplet tracking investigation employed across the plume cross section at x d 48 in fig 17a in which the droplets larger than 400 μ m escaped the left vortex as stated above the vortex trapping function estimated all droplets to be trapped near the downward moving side of the vortex in the droplet tracking investigation figs 16 18 the droplets were released near the vortex core and the droplets of 600 μ m and larger escaped the vortex before reaching the downward moving side of the vortex most of the 500 μ m droplets reached the downward moving side and trapped already however although some of the 500 μ m droplets reached the downward moving side at their initial cycles they escaped the vortex later 4 conclusions the results of multiphase large eddy simulations and experiments of an oil jet in crossflow with a jet velocity around 1 5 m s in a crossflow of 0 3 m s were reported in our prior work daskiran et al 2020 in this work droplet velocity was computed based on two approaches i the kinematics approach and ii newton s second law the trajectory of different sized droplets in an oil plume in crossflow was estimated using the fluid data from the les simulation we did not observe a noticeable difference between the kinematics approach and newton s second law three hundred droplets with sizes of 50 μ m 500 μ m 1 mm and 3 mm which is based on the droplet size obtained in the experiments fig 2 were released at x d 8 the distribution of different sized droplets was investigated across the plume cross section and along the central plane figs 5 6 the droplets showed significant segregation in the vertical direction which avoids the assumption of a gaussian distribution in the vertical direction the streamlines and the trajectory of droplets across the plume cross section revealed the asymmetric counter rotating vortices large droplets started to escape the cvp from the center plane due to their higher buoyancy and higher vertical velocity near the center plane induced by the cvp droplets of 1 mm and smaller were dispersed in each direction the lateral motion induced by the cvp and the expansion of the plume cross section entrained small droplets toward the sides of the plume the influence of added mass pressure gradient and lift forces were observed to be negligible as compared to the drag and buoyancy forces figs 7 8 the vertical location of cloud centroid for various droplet sizes was compared to the trajectory of center streamline obtained from the les simulation the center streamline obtained from les followed the trajectory of 1 mm and smaller droplets with an offset around 3d in the vertical direction fig 11 the dispersion in the horizontal direction decreased as the droplet size increased figs 5 and 12 similarly the vertical dispersion of droplets was higher for smaller droplets since the movement of small droplets was dominated by the flow induced by cvp while the movement of large droplets was dominated by their buoyancy and the flow induced by cvp the lateral dispersion of the 3 mm droplets was not significantly different from that of smaller droplets since their lateral motion was also under the influence of cvp figs 6 and 14 the normalized eddy diffusivity based on eq 13 was averaged across the plume cross section at different horizontal distances from the orifice and observed to be increasing from 0 11 to 0 18 in the horizontal direction fig 15 the dispersion coefficients at different directions were also computed using the kinematics approach and compared to the eddy diffusivity from les vortex trapping of cvp was studied at the cross section of the plume by releasing droplets of various sizes from the left and right vortex cores droplets of 700 μ m and 800 μ m escaped both vortices after t 200 the 600 μ m droplets started to leave from both vortices after t 250 the 400 μ m and 500 μ m droplets were trapped in both vortices up to t 850 after which only a small number of 500 μ m escaped the left vortex the vortex trapping function proposed by friedman and katz 2002 also estimated the trapping of droplets with a diameter of 400 μ m and smaller the cvp has a significant role in the distribution of the 1 mm and smaller droplets bimodal concentration distribution with peaks near the cores of cvp vortices and minimum concentration near the central plane was observed in the lateral horizontal direction therefore the oil dsd measured in the center plane of the jets in crossflow could underestimate the number of small droplets in the whole plume credit authorship contribution

23928,in this work sea ice concentrations in the regions of baffin bay hudson bay the labrador sea and the gulf of st lawrence were estimated using a standalone regional configuration of los alamos sea ice model cice a sensitivity analysis of the mixed layer depth criteria that affects the predicted sea ice formation ablation has been carried out to tune the model sea ice concentration from amsr2 osisaf sea ice edge from ssmis ascat osisaf and sea surface temperature from oisst avhrr only products were then assimilated into the tuned model using a combined optimal interpolation method extending previous studies which used a constant drag formulation in their assimilation schemes we use a variable drag formulation to represent the friction associated with effective sea ice surface roughness at the ice atmosphere and ice ocean interfaces the variable drag coefficient is estimated from properties of the sea ice cover such as the ice concentration the vertical extent and area of the ridges the freeboard the floe draft the size of floes and melt ponds the new features of the assimilated model include tracers to estimate ridged ice level ice melt ponds freeboard sail height and keel depth the estimates of ice concentration from the assimilated models are then compared with the ice concentration product from the canadian ice service the results show that the updates provided to the tracers through the assimilation of sea ice products are reasonable and the model estimates of ice concentration from the assimilated models are better than the non assimilated model estimates finally the estimates of updated sea ice parameters such as ridged ice area volume and ice thickness are compared with the estimates from non assimilated models and the literature to verify the results keywords sea ice modelling variable drag data assimilation remote sensing ice concentration ice edge 1 introduction numerical ice ocean models provide valuable information on how sea ice evolves and how it affects climate well tuned numerical sea ice models may be used for short term operational forecasts one to five days for navigation in sea ice frequented regions seasonal forecasts one to three months aid in economic planning construction of offshore stations for oil explorations and logistics the models can be used to investigate weather patterns or events like the great salinity anomaly gsa belkin et al 1998 global circulation models gcms simulate the climate of the whole earth they are usually used to study the effect of global climate disruptions caused by for example an increase in carbon dioxide even a small rise in temperature can lead to more significant warming over time making the polar regions the most sensitive areas to climate change on earth and hence most gcms include sea ice models the evolution of sea ice is highly complex and can only be approximated by mathematical equations or statistical approaches that address the relevant dynamic and thermodynamic processes thermodynamic equations consider air and ocean temperatures heat fluxes and albedo that affect the formation and ablation of sea ice dynamic equations consider factors that influence sea ice motion such as winds currents and ice ocean drag due to computational complexity and sophisticated physical processes several quantities in general circulation models are included using parameterizations e g sea surface temperature or constant values e g sea ice snow density the assumptions on model physics and uncertainties associated with boundary or forcing data in the geophysical models limit the accuracy of simulation results initial conditions and external forcing are not precisely known and the physics included in the model has limitations therefore the simulation results may be different from observations data assimilation aims to optimally combine observations with the model and serves as a valuable tool for improving model estimates for a forecast observational data used for assimilation may include data from the ground satellite aircraft buoy upward looking sonar or any other remote sensing measurement in this work we use a data assimilation system to produce a better initial condition for the forecasts the system can provide information on several sea ice parameters such as sea ice concentration thickness ridged ice area and volume improving the predicted ice concentration by assimilation produces changes in ice volume thickness which then affects the frequency of ice ridging and melt pond formation see for example section 5 1 and eq 9 for ridged ice and eq 17 for melt ponds the ridging and melt pond information is hard to track using satellite measurements the data assimilation system would give more information on all model variables that are dependent on the observations data assimilation methods combine models and observations but the sophistication computational burden and the quality of results from assimilation algorithms may vary widely assimilation of highly accurate remote sensing data can produce simulation results closer to the observations reichle 2008 several data assimilation methodologies exist such as nudging probabilistic multivariate statistical methods variational methods such as the 3d variational 3d var kalman filters and ensemble filters law et al 2015 advanced data assimilation methods such as extended and ensemble kalman filters as well as 4d variational 4d var bouttier and kelly 2001 are also available the most straightforward type of data assimilation is the nudging method hoke and anthes 1976 kistler 1974 it introduces into the dynamical equations of the model an additional term that is proportional to the difference between the calculated model variable and the observed value the nudging method continuously relaxes the model values towards the observations wang et al 2013 lindsay and zhang 2006 hunke et al 2015 hedström 2009 the gain matrix in the nudging method is usually prescribed apriori rather than deriving it from the observation and model errors variations of nudging such as back and forth nudging lakshmivarahan and lewis 2013 also exist one of the powerful assimilation methods used in various weather prediction models is the optimal interpolation oi method oi is more computationally expensive than nudging and uses a least squares method for data assimilation in which the weights for the observations are assigned according to some known or estimated error statistics deutch 1965 variations of oi have also been applied to sea ice models to assimilate ice concentration see for example lindsay and zhang 2006 and wang et al 2013 both methodologies showed improvement in the assimilated model results when compared with the non assimilated model estimates many other data assimilation procedures exist in ice ocean modelling literature sayed et al 2002 dzierzbicka glowacka et al 2012 lindsay and zhang 2006 wang et al 2013 sayed et al 1999 caya et al 2006 2010 stark et al 2008 cheng et al 2012 yang et al 2014 lemieux et al 2016 these procedures have been used to assimilate ice concentration ice thickness and ice motion here we use a combination of the boot strap algorithm nudging and optimal interpolation to estimate ice parameters from a data assimilated model the data assimilation algorithms which use an optimal interpolation approach are computationally inexpensive oke et al 2010 choukulkar et al 2012 and show improvement in assimilated model results lindsay and zhang 2006 wang et al 2013 a feature to track ridged ice area volume and melt ponds has been included in the cice hunke et al 2015 model version 5 1 2 though the feature has to this point not been explored in any of the data assimilation studies prasad et al 2015 discussed the implementation of the sea ice model cice on a high resolution regional domain with open boundaries prasad et al 2018 extended that study by assimilating the model with oisst avhrr only and ice concentration from amsre and amsr2 with ssmis product from osi saf the model estimated ice thickness was compared with the thickness data from soil moisture and ocean salinity and the estimated freeboard was compared with the freeboard measurements from cryosat 2 the authors also explored ways to compare the sail and keel measurements with the in situ data derived from upward looking sonar uls though the results of ice concentration ice thickness and freeboard estimates from the model were promising ssmis smos and cryosat 2 measurements had high uncertainty and hence it was hard to understand the full capability of the model also the assimilation of the ice concentration and sea surface temperature sst did not consider the temporally and spatially varying observational uncertainty instead a constant value estimated from a long term standard deviation was used hence the model estimates were prone to a long term accumulation of the observation error all the work referenced above except prasad et al 2018 used a constant drag formulation in their assimilation model and hence do not provide assimilation updates to tracers such as ridged ice level ice and melt ponds in this work we use a variable drag formulation in the non assimilated and assimilated models to reflect the friction associated with an effective sea ice surface roughness at the ice atmosphere and ice ocean interfaces the formulation is also used to calculate the net downward heat flux from the ice to the ocean the advantage of a variable drag formulation is that its application results in more realistic atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients which might influence the modelled sea ice drift it also produces more realistic estimates of sea ice parameters such as sail height and keel depth in the arctic tsamados et al 2014 the non assimilated sea ice model cice hunke et al 2015 using the variable drag formulation reproduces the temporal and spatial patterns of observed ice concentration ice thickness and ice drift over the arctic region as shown in tsamados et al 2014 prasad et al 2018 discussed the use of a variable drag formulation in an assimilated model however the strategy on how the updates are made to the state variables used in the formulation were not discussed in this paper we provide the details of a variable drag formulation which allows the realistic estimates of parameters such as the ice concentration ridged ice area volume and melt ponds in the assimilation scheme see also prasad 2018 in this work we also include the observation uncertainty in the assimilation scheme to make the assimilation more reliable caya et al 2010 wang et al 2013 lindsay and zhang 2006 lemieux et al 2016 unlike the previous work in the literature here we also include the sea ice edge information from the ssmis ascat sea ice edge product in addition we compare the estimated ice concentration from the non assimilated and assimilated models with the ice concentration product from the canadian ice service cis this comparison provides more reliable information on the quality of the model estimates from this comparison we observe that the sequential assimilation of each product ice concentration ice edge and sst improves the model estimates of ice concentration with the addition of oisst avhrr only having the greatest effect 2 model configuration the sea ice model used in this study is cice model version 5 1 2 hunke et al 2015 the model comes with default global grids with resolution of 1 and 3 and cyclic boundary conditions the regional model domain in this work is configured for the region of baffin bay the labrador sea hudson bay and the gulf of st lawrence fig 1 all lateral boundaries are assumed to be open and are achieved via restoring the non land halo cells along the grid edges to initial values hunke et al 2015 instead of coupling with an ocean model a slab ocean mixed layer model is used to simulate the evolution of the sea surface temperature sst which then determines the growth melt potential of sea ice hunke et al 2015 the main equation that is resolved by the model is the ice thickness distribution itd eq 1 that evolves due to the thermodynamic growth and melt and dynamic ice velocities advection and redistribution processes 1 g t g u h f g ψ l here u is the horizontal ice velocity x y ψ is the ridging redistribution function f is the rate of thermodynamic ice growth melt l is the lateral melt and g is the ice thickness distribution function the quantity g x h t d h is the fractional area covered by ice in the thickness range h h d h at a given time and location eq 1 is solved in several stages by operator splitting and by partitioning the ice pack in each grid cell into discrete thickness categories hunke et al 2015 the integral of g d h for h 0 gives the ice area fraction or ice concentration while the default model uses five thickness categories and a single category for open water the model configuration considered here uses ten thickness categories and a single category for the open water to approximate the ice thickness distribution we have used the same number of thickness categories and thickness lower bounds as in regional ice prediction system rips lemieux et al 2016 the lower bounds of each category are shown in table 1 the velocity fields are obtained by solving the momentum equations given by 2 m u t σ τ a τ w k ˆ m f u m g h o where m is the combined mass of ice and snow per unit area τ a and τ w are wind and ocean stresses respectively σ is the ice internal stress f is the coriolis force g is the acceleration due to gravity and h o is the sea surface slope the rheology of ice is given by an additional relationship between the ice stress and strain rate hibler iii 1979 the ice strength is based on an elliptical yield curve and a normal flow rule and is estimated by using a physically realistic formulation by rothrock 1975 the momentum equations are solved by using the elastic viscous plastic approach hunke and dukowicz 1997 the surface currents are used to compute the sea surface slope h o which determines the ice ocean stress and then the ice velocity hunke et al 2015 the ocean stress is given by 3 τ w d w ρ w u w u u w u cos θ k ˆ u w u sin θ where d w is the ocean drag coefficient ρ w is the sea water density u w is the velocity of the surface currents u is the ice velocity and θ is the turning angle the experiments by hunke 2010 used turning angle of 25 and the nonzero currents produced an increase in ice thickness since coarse resolution ocean currents are used in the present configuration we chose a turning angle θ of 15 when the ocean currents are missing so that ice thickness does not increase too much the wind stress τ a is determined from 4 τ a ρ a u 2 u a u a where ρ a is the air density u a is the wind component and u is the friction velocity andreas et al 2004 moreover a relative atmosphere ice velocity u a u is used to compute turbulent fluxes in the atmospheric boundary layer hunke et al 2015 the default cice configuration uses a constant drag formulation since our aim was to derive all the possible sea ice products and use the model to the full capacity we activated the variable drag formulation by tsamados et al 2014 the drag coefficient d w is estimated from properties of the sea ice cover such as ice concentration vertical extent and area of the ridges and floe size lu et al 2011 as 5 d w d w r d g d w f l o e d w s k i n where d w r d g is the contribution from the keels d w f l o e is the contribution from the floe edges and d w s k i n is the contribution from the ice ocean boundary for more details about the role of ridged ice area and volume on eq 5 please see tsamados et al 2014 the variable drag coefficient neutral drag coefficient in eq 5 has also been used to calculate the net downward heat flux from the ice to the ocean hunke et al 2015 the atmospheric drag coefficient given by eq 6 lüpkes et al 2012 is used to estimate the friction velocity in eq 4 6 d a d a r d g d a f l o e d a s k i n d a p n d where d a r d g is the contribution from the sails d a f l o e is the contribution from the floe edges d a s k i n is the contribution from the atmosphere ice boundary and d a p n d is the contribution from the melt ponds for more details about the role of ridged ice area and volume meltpond area and volume on eq 6 please see tsamados et al 2014 the thermodynamic model computes the snow ice temperature profile in the vertical direction by solving a heat diffusion equation five ice layers and one snow layer per ice category is used the net heat flux from the atmosphere provides the upper boundary condition and the heat flux from the ocean to the ice gives the lower boundary condition the various heat fluxes are the latent sensible incoming and outgoing long wave and short wave radiations the delta eddington scheme briegleb and light 2007 has been used to calculate the albedo and the attenuation of the absorbed short wave radiation the sea ice is assumed to have a fixed salinity profile bitz and lipscomb 1999 s i k in each ice layer is given by 7 s i k 1 2 s m a x 1 c o s π z a z b where z k 1 2 n i s m a x 3 2 ppt a 0 407 and b 0 573 schwarzacher 1959 bitz and lipscomb 1999 based on the salinity and temperature profile and the boundary conditions the ice growth or melt is calculated lateral melting is estimated based on the approach of steele 1992 the bubbly brine conductivity model by pringle et al 2007 has been used to compute the thermal conductivity of ice a default constant snow thermal conductivity of 30 w m deg was used a linear liquidus approximation was used to compute the freezing temperature t f μ s where s is the seawater salinity and μ 0 057 is the ratio of the freezing temperature of brine to its salinity table b 8 in appendix b shows the key name list variables parameters that have been activated in our model configuration the cice version 5 1 2 has options to track ridged ice area and volume since the previously ridged ice may ridge once again and the ridged ice is spread among different thickness categories it is difficult to track ridged ice hunke et al 2015 hence the actual model tracers used are the level undeformed ice area and volume tracers see eq 8 level ice area fraction and volume increase with new ice formation and decrease steadily via ridging processes hunke et al 2013 the conservation equation for the level ice is given by 8 a l v l a n t a l v l a n u δ a i a l v l a i δ t ψ l v l where δ a i and δ a i represent new ice growth and lateral melting respectively and ψ l v l is the area of level ice destroyed by deformation hunke et al 2013 the level ice area is a l v l a l v l a i the ridged ice area and volume is then computed using the relationship 9 a r d g a i a l v l v r d g v i v l v l where a l v l is the level ice area fraction a r d g is the ridged ice area fraction a i is the total ice area fraction v l v l is the volume of level ice v l v l is the volume of the ridged ice and v i is the total volume the model configuration also uses the level ice melt pond tracer which depends on the level ice tracer the ice concentration and the ice volume with a pond refreezing parametrization as used in cesm hunke et al 2015 the conservation equations for the melt ponds hunke et al 2013 are given by 10 a p n d a l v l a i t a p n d a l v l a i u 0 h p n d a p n d a l v l a n t h p n d a p n d a l v l a n u 0 where a l v l a n is the level ice area fraction a p n d a l v l a n is the pond ice fraction and h p n d a p n d a l v l a n is the pond volume see hunke et al 2013 for more details the options that are used for activating tracers such as level ridged ice and melt ponds are given in table b 8 the parameter values that have been used for ice and snow densities and the parameters used for the estimation of neutral drag coefficients are given in table b 9 one of the main motivations for using the ridged ice melt pond tracers and variable drag is that we can generate additional sea ice products such as ridged ice area volume melt ponds sail height keel depth and freeboard which are difficult to track using satellite derived products and would be beneficial for many applications 2 1 model forcing the default model uses the atmospheric forcing from a global grid with resolution of 1 2006 to 2009 and with a resolution of 3 1997 in this paper atmospheric forcing values were derived from a high resolution climate data set the north american regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 the narr was obtained from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis data provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa oar esrl psd see appendix c for data sources the atmospheric forcing data includes air density zonal wind speed meridional wind speed air temperature specific humidity precipitation cloud fraction and incoming short wave radiation the narr data is of high temporal resolution eight times daily and 0 3 0 3 spatial resolution ocean currents were obtained from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr climatology data see appendix c for the data source the salinity profile was derived from monthly climatology data provided by world ocean atlas woa 2013 version 2 levitus et al 2013 the woa 2013 data has a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 monthly climatology of sst is derived from high resolution data provided by noaa oar esrl psd reynolds et al 2007 see appendix c for data source the ocean data were processed to be consistent with the masking used for the high resolution model a 3 point average replaced the missing values near coastal areas the annual mixed layer depth mld is calculated from woa 2013 climatology data using a fixed threshold density criteria see section 4 if the mixed layer depth is greater than the bathymetry then the mixed layer depth is relaxed to the bathymetry value at the grid cell the mixed layer heat flux is assumed to be zero 3 data used for assimilation and validation 3 1 ice concentration assimilation using amsr 2 the sea ice product derived from a dual polarized conically scanning advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr 2 instrument is used for the assimilation of ice concentration lavelle et al 2016 the product osi 408 version 1 1 is processed by sea ice algorithms used at osi saf hybrid dynamic oshd and at the technical university of denmark tud lavelle et al 2016 to estimate the ice concentration the numerical weather prediction nwp data from ecmwf are used for the correction of the brightness temperatures before the estimation of ice concentration lavelle et al 2016 19 ghz vertical polarization 37 ghz vertical and horizontal polarization and 89 ghz vertical and horizontal polarization channels with resolutions of 22 km 14 km 12 km 7 km and 5 km 3 km are used to estimate the ice concentration lavelle et al 2016 the final product is available on a 10 km polar stereographic grid along with the total uncertainty these uncertainties arise from the inherent uncertainty of the algorithm and re sampling process lavelle et al 2016 only those data with a standard deviation between 0 20 were used for the assimilation a snapshot of the uncertainty of amsr 2 is shown in fig 2 the uncertainty may vary spatially and temporally 3 2 ssmis ascat for ice edge assimilation the sea ice edge is provided for different classes open water open ice and closed ice the classes are defined using the ice concentration thresholds of less than 30 between 30 70 and 70 respectively see table 2 the first column in table 2 shows the flags used to differentiate between no ice open ice and closed ice respectively the second column shows the description for each flag and the third column shows the values of ice concentration for each flag value from the first column the regions of known ice classes are used in the sea ice edge product to define the border between sea ice and open water we consider open water as the region where ice concentration is less than 10 environment climate change canada 2016 the value of 10 was found to be optimal as it does not produce too much ice in ice free areas and does not produce too low of an ice concentration in ice infested areas the sea ice edge product from osi saf is derived from three sources special sensor microwave imager sounder ssmis a conically scanning radiometer with constant incidence angle around 50 and a swath width of about 1700 km amsr2 and advanced scatterometer ascat the product si 402 c osi 403 c version 2 3 has been used for the ice edge assimilation the ascat onboard metop a and metop b consists of two sets of three antennas which are oriented at 45 90 and 135 with respect to the satellite s flight direction the beams cover 550 km wide swaths as the satellite moves along its orbit the system s antenna generates radar beams and measures backscatter from the sea surface the backscatter is sampled on a 12 5 km grid both scatterometer data and passive microwave data signatures are utilized to detect and classify sea ice a bayesian inverse method approach is used to combine various data sources the quality flags are also provided with the product and shown in table 3 the model estimated ice concentration is then used to estimate the ice concentration from the ice edge product see table 4 in table 4 a is the model ice concentration and a e is the ice concentration determined from the ice edge values the uncertainty measurements were chosen as 0 5 excellent 2 0 good 15 0 acceptable and 38 0 unreliable 3 3 combined ice concentration and ice edge the ice concentration and ice edge data is then combined using the bootstrap method james et al 2013 which can be used to quantify the uncertainty associated with the estimates the data is combined using a linear combination 11 a o c 1 a a m s r 2 c 2 a e where a a m s r 2 is the ice concentration from amsr2 and a e is the ice concentration estimated using a combination of ice edge product and the model estimate the constants c 1 and c 2 are given by c 1 σ e 2 c o v a a m s r 2 a e σ a m s r 2 2 σ e 2 2 c o v a a m s r 2 a e 12 c 2 σ a m s r 2 2 c o v a a m s r 2 a e σ a m s r 2

ice edge data for the present study we assume that the data is uncorrelated the covariance may be determined using the correlation coefficient ρ if known between amsr2 and ice edge given by 13 c o v a a m s r 2 a e ρ σ e σ a m s r 2 the combined product a 0 was then used in the ice concentration assimilation scheme the combined standard deviation is given by 14 σ a o c 1 2 σ a m s r 2 2 c 2 2 σ e 2 3 4 avhrr sea surface temperature measurements derived from avhrr only oisst analysis banzon et al 2016 reynolds et al 2007 were used for sst assimilation sst data products are generated using a combination of satellite and in situ observations from buoy and ship observations and are available on a 0 25 0 25 resolution the avhrr only oisst analysis product estimates sst from ice concentration only in regions where ice concentration is greater than 50 otherwise satellite data are used to retrieve sst values banzon et al 2016 reynolds et al 2007 in the present study the sst is assimilated only in the regions where the observed ice concentration is zero in the regions where ice concentration was greater than 98 the sst was set to 1 8 c 3 5 cis product for ice concentration comparison validation the ice concentration from the canadian ice service cis is used for validation and comparison of sea ice concentration estimates from the model service 2009 the data are available in sigrid 3 format joint et al 2004 the look up table from sigrid 3 converts the ice codes into meaningful sea ice characteristics joint et al 2004 there is no inherent spatial resolution as the data set is provided as vector shapefiles the temporal resolution is weekly starting from 02 jan 2017 data in the southern canadian waters are not available during summer the cis takes data from various sources such as satellites aerial reconnaissance local ice climatology weather oceanographic information and ship reports aerial reconnaissance includes the use of airborne imaging radar side looking airborne radar slar synthetic aperture radar sar and airborne radiation thermometer manice 2005 satellite imagery is collected over several days in order to have complete coverage local ice climatology provides knowledge of some ice types and features that are possible in any given location corrections are made to the regional analyses and charts after the issue date if significant additional information becomes available or if errors are found within the analyses in cases where ice type cannot be identified only partial observations are made cis ice charts do not provide an absolute reference but they do represent the best report on ice conditions based on all available information the weekly ice chart is used here which means the data may be a mosaic or represent averaged conditions in certain regions ice analysts use data collected for at least 72 h to process the information for the ice charts manice 2005 note that it is typical to have missing data both in time and in space due to the issues with the interpretation of satellite images during freeze up and melt season issues due to snow cover and lack of airborne observations or measurements collected from ships some error occurs due to the conversions used in the ice codes e g 3 10 to 4 10 manice 2005 ice is represented by code 34 in sigrid 3 joint et al 2004 and 3 10 to 5 10 manice 2005 ice is represented by code 35 in sigrid 3 joint et al 2004 see appendix a and tables a 6 and a 7 for the full representation of sigrid 3 codes joint et al 2004 and ice concentration values used for the model assessment 4 mixed layer criteria before performing assimilation we tuned the model by experimenting with various mixed layer criteria the default model had a fixed mixed layer depth of 20 m which was replaced by a density based criteria as it was shown to provide better estimates of sea ice parameters in prasad et al 2015 the mixed layer criteria for the model eq 15 was revised by selecting the value for the density that minimized the average bias absolute error and root mean squared error rmse between model estimated ice concentration and the cis ice concentration product 15 h m i x depth where σ θ σ θ 10 0 05 kg m3 5 assimilation of ice concentration and ice edge products the combined product given in section 3 3 a o is assimilated into the model using a combined optimal interpolation and nudging wang et al 2013 according to 16 a a a b k τ a o a b where a a is the analysis a b is the background a o is the observation and k is the weight for assimilation given by k a o a b 2 a o a b 2 σ a o 2 the quantity τ is given by τ τ 0 e α a o a b where τ 0 is the basic time scale for nudging the exponential part represents the spatial temporal variations wang et al 2013 α 2 5 and σ a o is the standard deviation of the observed ice concentration if the grid cell sst is greater than 4 c then the cell is assumed to have no ice the assimilation is done every day and the model variables were interpolated to the observation space before assimilation and then mapped back to the model space after assimilation the analysis then serves as initial condition for the next time step 5 1 assimilation updates the ice volume is increased or decreased by including the changes in the ice concentration if in a grid cell no ice was present the new ice areas are introduced by assigning a specified ice thickness of 0 05 m in the grid cell in the assimilated model once the updates have been made to the ice concentration and corresponding changes made to ice volume the other tracer updates are completed it is difficult to track ridged ice area and presently no information on the ridged ice area fraction is available hence we assume the model ridged ice area to be an accurate representation and update the level ice area fraction using eq 9 in case the grid cell has only ridged ice area fraction and the level ice area fraction is zero then the assimilation updates only the ridged ice area fraction the level ice volume is updated using a similar strategy if new ice areas are introduced while assimilating the ice concentration then all newly introduced ice is considered to be level ice once the update has been made to the ridged level ice area and volume the melt ponds are updated as 17 a p n d a p n d a l v l a i a l v l a i where a l v l a i is updated level ice area fraction all new ice areas that are introduced during assimilation are considered to have no melt ponds the pond height is then updated by preserving the volume of the melt pond the analysis a l v l and a p n d serves as the initial conditions for the level ice tracers and melt pond tracers for the next time step the ice temperature is restored back to the surface temperature by assuming a linear temperature profile hunke et al 2015 and fixed salinity profile see eq 7 hunke et al 2015 the ice salinity and snow enthalpies are re initialized only when a new ice cell is added the updated tracers are then used in the variable drag formulation to compute the freeboard draft sail and keel depth in the next timestep please refer to tsamados et al 2014 or prasad et al 2018 for the full set of equations that are used to model the freeboard draft sail and keel depth 5 2 assimilation of sst for the assimilation of sst a procedure similar to the assimilation of ice concentration was used the sst was assimilated only in regions where the observed ice concentration is zero and in those grid cells where observed ice concentration was greater than 98 the model sst was reset to a value below the freezing point in eq 16 a a would now represent the analysis values of sst a b is the background value of sst a o is the observed sst note that while assimilating sst the observations are not heavily weighted normalized values were used to capture the temporal spatial variations 6 results and discussions 6 1 ice concentration in this section we discuss the results from four models m0 the non assimilated model m1 the model assimilated only with amsr2 ice concentration m2 the model assimilated with amsr2 ice concentration and ssmis ascat ice edge product and m3 the model assimilated with amsr2 ice concentration ssmis ascat ice edge product and avhrr only oisst analysis the simulations were completed to understand the improvement in the ice concentration estimates of the model as compared to the cis ice concentration with the addition of each product used in the assimilation scheme the bias and rmse between the model m0 m1 m2 m3 and the cis ice concentration are shown in fig 3 there is a persistent negative bias and a large rmse between the ice concentration data from amsr2 and cis see fig 4 use of only excellent and good data from amsr2 for the assimilation slightly improves the m1 model results see fig 3 and table 5 from table 5 we see that the average bias absolute error and rmse decreases with the addition of each data product the improvement in m1 m2 is very slight and this is due to the bias in the observation data amsr2 used for assimilation see fig 4 in model m1 and m2 the estimates of ice concentration deteriorate at some temporal points which is due to the accumulation of the error from the previously assimilated data further assimilating sst data from avhrr only oisst analysis brings a significant improvement in the estimates of ice concentration in model m3 see fig 3 and table 5 a significant improvement in the estimates of ice concentration from model m3 occurs during the melt season see fig 3 the annually averaged bias and rmse values are shown in table 5 which demonstrates that model m3 gives better estimates of ice concentration thus the assimilation of all three products amsr2 ice concentration ice edge and sst improves the model estimates of ice concentration fig 5 shows the difference between the models m1 m2 m3 and m0 in the figure we observe that the models m1 m2 and m3 produce changes in the ice concentration from january 2017 to the beginning of may 2017 model m3 shows the most significant changes during june july i e sst assimilation introduces substantial changes in the ice concentration after august 2017 the changes introduced by the assimilation are insignificant for rips lemieux et al 2016 the maximum bias is 15 and rmse is between 25 and 35 compared with the ice concentration from cis the model bias in the present study is better between 12 12 and 3 1 and the rmse is between 3 26 and 27 5 a direct comparison with rips is difficult however one of the major differences between rips and the present study is that the rips is configured for the entire arctic region while the present model is configured for a smaller region moreover rips based on cice version 4 0 uses a 3d var scheme to assimilate ice concentration retrieved from passive microwave ssmis advanced scatterometer data and the manually produced sea ice charts from cis fig 6 illustrates the ice concentration from the models m0 m1 m2 m3 and the cis sea ice concentration product for 24 july 2017 which is a weekly mosaic the cis product is obtained from the weekly ice chart and the model values are averaged over the week since the ice product from the cis is a weekly mosaic and the model values are weekly averaged long term or seasonal averages are not shown fig 6 shows locally improved estimates of the sea ice concentration with the addition of each product note that model m1 assimilated with amsr2 shows slight improvement of ice concentration at the nares strait and lancaster sound region model m2 assimilated with amsr2 and ice edges also shows slight improvement in ice concentration at the baffin bay region in addition to the slight improvements for nares strait and lancaster sound region the ice concentration values from the model m3 assimilated with ice concentration ice edge and sst show significant improvement in the region of baffin bay and lancaster sound also the ice concentration values from m3 show the best match with the values from the cis product the white area in the figures indicates the regions where observation data were not available at that time 6 2 ridged and level ice tracers as mentioned in eq 9 the total ice concentration and the total volume is represented as the sum of the level ice area and ridged ice area fractions and volume a strategy to include the level and ridged ice tracers in the data assimilation methodology has not been discussed in the literature to this point in section 5 1 a strategy was presented to include these tracers in the data assimilation updates of total ice concentration since it is practically difficult to track the ridged ice area and volume the validation is still a challenge the annual averages of the estimates of ridged level ice area and volume from all the models are illustrated in fig 7 the yearly averages show that there are not significant variations in the ridged or level ice fractions in the model estimates the assimilation of ice concentration and ice edge does indeed change the ridged ice area fractions but only by a small quantity the ridged level ice area and volume fraction changes are significant in the model assimilated with both the ice products and avhrr only oisst analysis this is likely caused by the addition of more ice cells due to the restoration of sst to values below the freezing point the domain of interest is mostly occupied by first year ice the thickness of which varies from 0 3 to 2 m and the average values of ice thickness from our assimilated models fall within this range note here that the ice volume and area are represented as the sum of level and ridged ice volume and area and hence the thickness will be affected by the changes in these parameters the annual maximum values of the level and ridged ice fractions of ice concentration are shown in figs 8 and 9 the model m3 shows an increased presence of ridged ice fractions in the area of the baffin bay and hudson bay the model assimilated with ice concentration and ice edge model m2 does not show significant variations in these values similarly no extreme values are observed in the ridged and level ice volumes estimates from the assimilated models especially models m1 and m2 shown in figs 10 and 11 hence we reason that the assimilation updates on the tracers of level ice and ridged ice are sensible and also produce better estimates of modelled ice concentration moreover compared with the estimates from non assimilated model we argue that the estimates of these tracers from our model are reasonable moreover this work presents a strategy to update the tracers such as ridged and level ice in the assimilation schemes when these tracers or the variable drag formulation are activated in the model configuration assimilation of additional satellite data such as sar and optical images would further improve the results this is because image based sea ice products are better than microwave radiometers during months when ice and the snow on top of ice are melting 6 3 ice thickness in prasad et al 2018 we provided a comparison of ice thickness estimates from the model with the ice thickness measurements from smos and freeboard measurements from cryosat2 both of which had high uncertainty prasad et al 2018 showed that the model thickness estimates fell within the uncertainty range of the observations from january to february of each year in this section a comparison of the ice thickness estimates from our models is made with the values obtained from the literature the comparison is made to understand if the thickness range generated by our models are reasonable please refer to fig 1 for the regions and stations discussed in this section stewart and howland 2009 indicate that the maximum extent of ice occurs during april or early may and the maximum ice thickness in the region of hudson bay increases from south to north due to the temperature gradient across hudson bay the model results are consistent with these observations model m3 shows clearly that the ice thickness increases from north to south with low ice thickness in the james bay and increasing towards the foxe basin see fig 12 the ice thickness also increases from west to east due to the transport of ice to the eastern side of hudson bay under the prevailing westerly winds gagnon and gough 2006 this is also demonstrated by the model results with the model m3 showing higher ice thickness in the centre of hudson bay fig 12 illustrates the yearly maximum values of ice thickness in metres stewart and lockhart 2005 report an ice thickness of 1 6 m in hudson bay stewart and howland 2009 reported that the maximum ice thickness in the hudson complex ranged from about 1 m in southern james bay moosonee 71 1 30 m to 2 m in northern foxe basin yearly maximum values of ice thickness are shown in fig 13 gagnon and gough 2006 analysed the weekly ice thickness measurements at seven locations and found that maximum ice thickness averaged 1 75 m the ice thickness values from our models also fell within the range of estimates reported in the study by stewart and howland 2009 the model m3 replicates ice thickness estimates above 1 25 m in ungava bay in the hudson strait as mentioned in stewart and howland 2009 the study by hu et al 2018 used the new ice thickness program data at first year landfast ice sites the weekly data from 2002 to 2016 were issued by the environment and climate change canada eccc and was used to validate the nemo lim2 sea ice simulations at both 1 4 and 1 12 horizontal resolution the eccc thickness data hu et al 2018 reports maximum ice thickness at the coral harbour from 2004 to 2016 varying between 1 5 and 1 8 m approximately our models give maximum values between 1 0 and 1 25 m the same study reports a maximum ice thickness of 2 5 m approximately between 2002 and 2006 at hall beach in the foxe basin the values from the models m0 m1 m2 and m3 give a maximum between 1 0 m and 1 5 m the field measurements used in hu et al 2018 also reports a maximum ice thickness between 1 5 and 1 8 m approximately at iqaluit our model estimates of maximum ice thickness at iqualuit is a little lower at 1 25 m the thickness estimates show some improvement with assimilation in order to understand the overall accuracy of the ice thickness estimates we have to do rigorous comparison with good quality in situ observations which are currently unavailable urrego blanco et al 2017 states that the improvement in either concentration or thickness comes at the expense of the quality of the estimate of the other this may provide a reason for the general under estimation of the thickness provided by our models 7 conclusion in this work the los alamos sea ice model cice was configured for the region of interest that includes the region of baffin bay the labrador sea hudson bay and the gulf of st lawrence the model used the variable drag formulation suggested by tsamados et al 2014 which required the use of additional tracers such as the level ice the ridged ice and melt ponds the addition of the variable drag formulation provides a wide range of information on sea ice products that can be used for risk analysis in various applications the model estimates were first compared with the cis ice concentration to estimate a best choice for the density based mixed layer depth criteria the model with the best choice of mixed layer depth criteria was then assimilated with the ice concentration product from amsr2 ice edge from ssmis ascat and sst data from avhrr only oisst the comparison of the non assimilated and assimilated models with cis ice concentration product shows that the estimates of ice concentration improve with the addition of each product especially during the summer months the best estimates are obtained with model m3 assimilated with all the three products ice concentration ice edge and sst a significant improvement in the ice concentration estimates is noticed during the melt period in model m3 the annual averages of level ridged ice tracers from the models show that the updates of these tracers were reasonable for the models assimilated with ice concentration and ice edge though an increased ridging was observed in the model that was assimilated with sst ice concentration and ice edge products the increased variation in the ridged ice area and volume was not significant when compared to the estimates from non assimilated model also comparing the estimates of ridged ice area and volume from assimilated model with the estimates from non assimilated model we argue that the estimates of these tracers from our model are reasonable moreover this work presents a strategy to update the tracers such as ridged and level ice in the assimilation schemes when these tracers and the variable drag formulation are activated in the model configuration assimilation of additional satellite data such as sar and optical images would further improve results because image based sea ice products are better than microwave radiometers during months when ice and the snow on top of ice are melting the model estimates of thickness were compared with station values obtained from the literature the exact data for 2017 were not available and hence the thickness values available from the literature in 2012 to 2016 were used to understand whether the model estimated annual maximums of ice thickness were reasonable the spatial variation of thickness in the hudson bay complex and the values at specific stations in the hudson bay complex were found to compare well with those mentioned in the literature credit authorship contribution statement siva prasad conceptualization methodology software writing

23928,in this work sea ice concentrations in the regions of baffin bay hudson bay the labrador sea and the gulf of st lawrence were estimated using a standalone regional configuration of los alamos sea ice model cice a sensitivity analysis of the mixed layer depth criteria that affects the predicted sea ice formation ablation has been carried out to tune the model sea ice concentration from amsr2 osisaf sea ice edge from ssmis ascat osisaf and sea surface temperature from oisst avhrr only products were then assimilated into the tuned model using a combined optimal interpolation method extending previous studies which used a constant drag formulation in their assimilation schemes we use a variable drag formulation to represent the friction associated with effective sea ice surface roughness at the ice atmosphere and ice ocean interfaces the variable drag coefficient is estimated from properties of the sea ice cover such as the ice concentration the vertical extent and area of the ridges the freeboard the floe draft the size of floes and melt ponds the new features of the assimilated model include tracers to estimate ridged ice level ice melt ponds freeboard sail height and keel depth the estimates of ice concentration from the assimilated models are then compared with the ice concentration product from the canadian ice service the results show that the updates provided to the tracers through the assimilation of sea ice products are reasonable and the model estimates of ice concentration from the assimilated models are better than the non assimilated model estimates finally the estimates of updated sea ice parameters such as ridged ice area volume and ice thickness are compared with the estimates from non assimilated models and the literature to verify the results keywords sea ice modelling variable drag data assimilation remote sensing ice concentration ice edge 1 introduction numerical ice ocean models provide valuable information on how sea ice evolves and how it affects climate well tuned numerical sea ice models may be used for short term operational forecasts one to five days for navigation in sea ice frequented regions seasonal forecasts one to three months aid in economic planning construction of offshore stations for oil explorations and logistics the models can be used to investigate weather patterns or events like the great salinity anomaly gsa belkin et al 1998 global circulation models gcms simulate the climate of the whole earth they are usually used to study the effect of global climate disruptions caused by for example an increase in carbon dioxide even a small rise in temperature can lead to more significant warming over time making the polar regions the most sensitive areas to climate change on earth and hence most gcms include sea ice models the evolution of sea ice is highly complex and can only be approximated by mathematical equations or statistical approaches that address the relevant dynamic and thermodynamic processes thermodynamic equations consider air and ocean temperatures heat fluxes and albedo that affect the formation and ablation of sea ice dynamic equations consider factors that influence sea ice motion such as winds currents and ice ocean drag due to computational complexity and sophisticated physical processes several quantities in general circulation models are included using parameterizations e g sea surface temperature or constant values e g sea ice snow density the assumptions on model physics and uncertainties associated with boundary or forcing data in the geophysical models limit the accuracy of simulation results initial conditions and external forcing are not precisely known and the physics included in the model has limitations therefore the simulation results may be different from observations data assimilation aims to optimally combine observations with the model and serves as a valuable tool for improving model estimates for a forecast observational data used for assimilation may include data from the ground satellite aircraft buoy upward looking sonar or any other remote sensing measurement in this work we use a data assimilation system to produce a better initial condition for the forecasts the system can provide information on several sea ice parameters such as sea ice concentration thickness ridged ice area and volume improving the predicted ice concentration by assimilation produces changes in ice volume thickness which then affects the frequency of ice ridging and melt pond formation see for example section 5 1 and eq 9 for ridged ice and eq 17 for melt ponds the ridging and melt pond information is hard to track using satellite measurements the data assimilation system would give more information on all model variables that are dependent on the observations data assimilation methods combine models and observations but the sophistication computational burden and the quality of results from assimilation algorithms may vary widely assimilation of highly accurate remote sensing data can produce simulation results closer to the observations reichle 2008 several data assimilation methodologies exist such as nudging probabilistic multivariate statistical methods variational methods such as the 3d variational 3d var kalman filters and ensemble filters law et al 2015 advanced data assimilation methods such as extended and ensemble kalman filters as well as 4d variational 4d var bouttier and kelly 2001 are also available the most straightforward type of data assimilation is the nudging method hoke and anthes 1976 kistler 1974 it introduces into the dynamical equations of the model an additional term that is proportional to the difference between the calculated model variable and the observed value the nudging method continuously relaxes the model values towards the observations wang et al 2013 lindsay and zhang 2006 hunke et al 2015 hedström 2009 the gain matrix in the nudging method is usually prescribed apriori rather than deriving it from the observation and model errors variations of nudging such as back and forth nudging lakshmivarahan and lewis 2013 also exist one of the powerful assimilation methods used in various weather prediction models is the optimal interpolation oi method oi is more computationally expensive than nudging and uses a least squares method for data assimilation in which the weights for the observations are assigned according to some known or estimated error statistics deutch 1965 variations of oi have also been applied to sea ice models to assimilate ice concentration see for example lindsay and zhang 2006 and wang et al 2013 both methodologies showed improvement in the assimilated model results when compared with the non assimilated model estimates many other data assimilation procedures exist in ice ocean modelling literature sayed et al 2002 dzierzbicka glowacka et al 2012 lindsay and zhang 2006 wang et al 2013 sayed et al 1999 caya et al 2006 2010 stark et al 2008 cheng et al 2012 yang et al 2014 lemieux et al 2016 these procedures have been used to assimilate ice concentration ice thickness and ice motion here we use a combination of the boot strap algorithm nudging and optimal interpolation to estimate ice parameters from a data assimilated model the data assimilation algorithms which use an optimal interpolation approach are computationally inexpensive oke et al 2010 choukulkar et al 2012 and show improvement in assimilated model results lindsay and zhang 2006 wang et al 2013 a feature to track ridged ice area volume and melt ponds has been included in the cice hunke et al 2015 model version 5 1 2 though the feature has to this point not been explored in any of the data assimilation studies prasad et al 2015 discussed the implementation of the sea ice model cice on a high resolution regional domain with open boundaries prasad et al 2018 extended that study by assimilating the model with oisst avhrr only and ice concentration from amsre and amsr2 with ssmis product from osi saf the model estimated ice thickness was compared with the thickness data from soil moisture and ocean salinity and the estimated freeboard was compared with the freeboard measurements from cryosat 2 the authors also explored ways to compare the sail and keel measurements with the in situ data derived from upward looking sonar uls though the results of ice concentration ice thickness and freeboard estimates from the model were promising ssmis smos and cryosat 2 measurements had high uncertainty and hence it was hard to understand the full capability of the model also the assimilation of the ice concentration and sea surface temperature sst did not consider the temporally and spatially varying observational uncertainty instead a constant value estimated from a long term standard deviation was used hence the model estimates were prone to a long term accumulation of the observation error all the work referenced above except prasad et al 2018 used a constant drag formulation in their assimilation model and hence do not provide assimilation updates to tracers such as ridged ice level ice and melt ponds in this work we use a variable drag formulation in the non assimilated and assimilated models to reflect the friction associated with an effective sea ice surface roughness at the ice atmosphere and ice ocean interfaces the formulation is also used to calculate the net downward heat flux from the ice to the ocean the advantage of a variable drag formulation is that its application results in more realistic atmospheric and oceanic drag coefficients which might influence the modelled sea ice drift it also produces more realistic estimates of sea ice parameters such as sail height and keel depth in the arctic tsamados et al 2014 the non assimilated sea ice model cice hunke et al 2015 using the variable drag formulation reproduces the temporal and spatial patterns of observed ice concentration ice thickness and ice drift over the arctic region as shown in tsamados et al 2014 prasad et al 2018 discussed the use of a variable drag formulation in an assimilated model however the strategy on how the updates are made to the state variables used in the formulation were not discussed in this paper we provide the details of a variable drag formulation which allows the realistic estimates of parameters such as the ice concentration ridged ice area volume and melt ponds in the assimilation scheme see also prasad 2018 in this work we also include the observation uncertainty in the assimilation scheme to make the assimilation more reliable caya et al 2010 wang et al 2013 lindsay and zhang 2006 lemieux et al 2016 unlike the previous work in the literature here we also include the sea ice edge information from the ssmis ascat sea ice edge product in addition we compare the estimated ice concentration from the non assimilated and assimilated models with the ice concentration product from the canadian ice service cis this comparison provides more reliable information on the quality of the model estimates from this comparison we observe that the sequential assimilation of each product ice concentration ice edge and sst improves the model estimates of ice concentration with the addition of oisst avhrr only having the greatest effect 2 model configuration the sea ice model used in this study is cice model version 5 1 2 hunke et al 2015 the model comes with default global grids with resolution of 1 and 3 and cyclic boundary conditions the regional model domain in this work is configured for the region of baffin bay the labrador sea hudson bay and the gulf of st lawrence fig 1 all lateral boundaries are assumed to be open and are achieved via restoring the non land halo cells along the grid edges to initial values hunke et al 2015 instead of coupling with an ocean model a slab ocean mixed layer model is used to simulate the evolution of the sea surface temperature sst which then determines the growth melt potential of sea ice hunke et al 2015 the main equation that is resolved by the model is the ice thickness distribution itd eq 1 that evolves due to the thermodynamic growth and melt and dynamic ice velocities advection and redistribution processes 1 g t g u h f g ψ l here u is the horizontal ice velocity x y ψ is the ridging redistribution function f is the rate of thermodynamic ice growth melt l is the lateral melt and g is the ice thickness distribution function the quantity g x h t d h is the fractional area covered by ice in the thickness range h h d h at a given time and location eq 1 is solved in several stages by operator splitting and by partitioning the ice pack in each grid cell into discrete thickness categories hunke et al 2015 the integral of g d h for h 0 gives the ice area fraction or ice concentration while the default model uses five thickness categories and a single category for open water the model configuration considered here uses ten thickness categories and a single category for the open water to approximate the ice thickness distribution we have used the same number of thickness categories and thickness lower bounds as in regional ice prediction system rips lemieux et al 2016 the lower bounds of each category are shown in table 1 the velocity fields are obtained by solving the momentum equations given by 2 m u t σ τ a τ w k ˆ m f u m g h o where m is the combined mass of ice and snow per unit area τ a and τ w are wind and ocean stresses respectively σ is the ice internal stress f is the coriolis force g is the acceleration due to gravity and h o is the sea surface slope the rheology of ice is given by an additional relationship between the ice stress and strain rate hibler iii 1979 the ice strength is based on an elliptical yield curve and a normal flow rule and is estimated by using a physically realistic formulation by rothrock 1975 the momentum equations are solved by using the elastic viscous plastic approach hunke and dukowicz 1997 the surface currents are used to compute the sea surface slope h o which determines the ice ocean stress and then the ice velocity hunke et al 2015 the ocean stress is given by 3 τ w d w ρ w u w u u w u cos θ k ˆ u w u sin θ where d w is the ocean drag coefficient ρ w is the sea water density u w is the velocity of the surface currents u is the ice velocity and θ is the turning angle the experiments by hunke 2010 used turning angle of 25 and the nonzero currents produced an increase in ice thickness since coarse resolution ocean currents are used in the present configuration we chose a turning angle θ of 15 when the ocean currents are missing so that ice thickness does not increase too much the wind stress τ a is determined from 4 τ a ρ a u 2 u a u a where ρ a is the air density u a is the wind component and u is the friction velocity andreas et al 2004 moreover a relative atmosphere ice velocity u a u is used to compute turbulent fluxes in the atmospheric boundary layer hunke et al 2015 the default cice configuration uses a constant drag formulation since our aim was to derive all the possible sea ice products and use the model to the full capacity we activated the variable drag formulation by tsamados et al 2014 the drag coefficient d w is estimated from properties of the sea ice cover such as ice concentration vertical extent and area of the ridges and floe size lu et al 2011 as 5 d w d w r d g d w f l o e d w s k i n where d w r d g is the contribution from the keels d w f l o e is the contribution from the floe edges and d w s k i n is the contribution from the ice ocean boundary for more details about the role of ridged ice area and volume on eq 5 please see tsamados et al 2014 the variable drag coefficient neutral drag coefficient in eq 5 has also been used to calculate the net downward heat flux from the ice to the ocean hunke et al 2015 the atmospheric drag coefficient given by eq 6 lüpkes et al 2012 is used to estimate the friction velocity in eq 4 6 d a d a r d g d a f l o e d a s k i n d a p n d where d a r d g is the contribution from the sails d a f l o e is the contribution from the floe edges d a s k i n is the contribution from the atmosphere ice boundary and d a p n d is the contribution from the melt ponds for more details about the role of ridged ice area and volume meltpond area and volume on eq 6 please see tsamados et al 2014 the thermodynamic model computes the snow ice temperature profile in the vertical direction by solving a heat diffusion equation five ice layers and one snow layer per ice category is used the net heat flux from the atmosphere provides the upper boundary condition and the heat flux from the ocean to the ice gives the lower boundary condition the various heat fluxes are the latent sensible incoming and outgoing long wave and short wave radiations the delta eddington scheme briegleb and light 2007 has been used to calculate the albedo and the attenuation of the absorbed short wave radiation the sea ice is assumed to have a fixed salinity profile bitz and lipscomb 1999 s i k in each ice layer is given by 7 s i k 1 2 s m a x 1 c o s π z a z b where z k 1 2 n i s m a x 3 2 ppt a 0 407 and b 0 573 schwarzacher 1959 bitz and lipscomb 1999 based on the salinity and temperature profile and the boundary conditions the ice growth or melt is calculated lateral melting is estimated based on the approach of steele 1992 the bubbly brine conductivity model by pringle et al 2007 has been used to compute the thermal conductivity of ice a default constant snow thermal conductivity of 30 w m deg was used a linear liquidus approximation was used to compute the freezing temperature t f μ s where s is the seawater salinity and μ 0 057 is the ratio of the freezing temperature of brine to its salinity table b 8 in appendix b shows the key name list variables parameters that have been activated in our model configuration the cice version 5 1 2 has options to track ridged ice area and volume since the previously ridged ice may ridge once again and the ridged ice is spread among different thickness categories it is difficult to track ridged ice hunke et al 2015 hence the actual model tracers used are the level undeformed ice area and volume tracers see eq 8 level ice area fraction and volume increase with new ice formation and decrease steadily via ridging processes hunke et al 2013 the conservation equation for the level ice is given by 8 a l v l a n t a l v l a n u δ a i a l v l a i δ t ψ l v l where δ a i and δ a i represent new ice growth and lateral melting respectively and ψ l v l is the area of level ice destroyed by deformation hunke et al 2013 the level ice area is a l v l a l v l a i the ridged ice area and volume is then computed using the relationship 9 a r d g a i a l v l v r d g v i v l v l where a l v l is the level ice area fraction a r d g is the ridged ice area fraction a i is the total ice area fraction v l v l is the volume of level ice v l v l is the volume of the ridged ice and v i is the total volume the model configuration also uses the level ice melt pond tracer which depends on the level ice tracer the ice concentration and the ice volume with a pond refreezing parametrization as used in cesm hunke et al 2015 the conservation equations for the melt ponds hunke et al 2013 are given by 10 a p n d a l v l a i t a p n d a l v l a i u 0 h p n d a p n d a l v l a n t h p n d a p n d a l v l a n u 0 where a l v l a n is the level ice area fraction a p n d a l v l a n is the pond ice fraction and h p n d a p n d a l v l a n is the pond volume see hunke et al 2013 for more details the options that are used for activating tracers such as level ridged ice and melt ponds are given in table b 8 the parameter values that have been used for ice and snow densities and the parameters used for the estimation of neutral drag coefficients are given in table b 9 one of the main motivations for using the ridged ice melt pond tracers and variable drag is that we can generate additional sea ice products such as ridged ice area volume melt ponds sail height keel depth and freeboard which are difficult to track using satellite derived products and would be beneficial for many applications 2 1 model forcing the default model uses the atmospheric forcing from a global grid with resolution of 1 2006 to 2009 and with a resolution of 3 1997 in this paper atmospheric forcing values were derived from a high resolution climate data set the north american regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 the narr was obtained from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis data provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa oar esrl psd see appendix c for data sources the atmospheric forcing data includes air density zonal wind speed meridional wind speed air temperature specific humidity precipitation cloud fraction and incoming short wave radiation the narr data is of high temporal resolution eight times daily and 0 3 0 3 spatial resolution ocean currents were obtained from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr climatology data see appendix c for the data source the salinity profile was derived from monthly climatology data provided by world ocean atlas woa 2013 version 2 levitus et al 2013 the woa 2013 data has a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 monthly climatology of sst is derived from high resolution data provided by noaa oar esrl psd reynolds et al 2007 see appendix c for data source the ocean data were processed to be consistent with the masking used for the high resolution model a 3 point average replaced the missing values near coastal areas the annual mixed layer depth mld is calculated from woa 2013 climatology data using a fixed threshold density criteria see section 4 if the mixed layer depth is greater than the bathymetry then the mixed layer depth is relaxed to the bathymetry value at the grid cell the mixed layer heat flux is assumed to be zero 3 data used for assimilation and validation 3 1 ice concentration assimilation using amsr 2 the sea ice product derived from a dual polarized conically scanning advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr 2 instrument is used for the assimilation of ice concentration lavelle et al 2016 the product osi 408 version 1 1 is processed by sea ice algorithms used at osi saf hybrid dynamic oshd and at the technical university of denmark tud lavelle et al 2016 to estimate the ice concentration the numerical weather prediction nwp data from ecmwf are used for the correction of the brightness temperatures before the estimation of ice concentration lavelle et al 2016 19 ghz vertical polarization 37 ghz vertical and horizontal polarization and 89 ghz vertical and horizontal polarization channels with resolutions of 22 km 14 km 12 km 7 km and 5 km 3 km are used to estimate the ice concentration lavelle et al 2016 the final product is available on a 10 km polar stereographic grid along with the total uncertainty these uncertainties arise from the inherent uncertainty of the algorithm and re sampling process lavelle et al 2016 only those data with a standard deviation between 0 20 were used for the assimilation a snapshot of the uncertainty of amsr 2 is shown in fig 2 the uncertainty may vary spatially and temporally 3 2 ssmis ascat for ice edge assimilation the sea ice edge is provided for different classes open water open ice and closed ice the classes are defined using the ice concentration thresholds of less than 30 between 30 70 and 70 respectively see table 2 the first column in table 2 shows the flags used to differentiate between no ice open ice and closed ice respectively the second column shows the description for each flag and the third column shows the values of ice concentration for each flag value from the first column the regions of known ice classes are used in the sea ice edge product to define the border between sea ice and open water we consider open water as the region where ice concentration is less than 10 environment climate change canada 2016 the value of 10 was found to be optimal as it does not produce too much ice in ice free areas and does not produce too low of an ice concentration in ice infested areas the sea ice edge product from osi saf is derived from three sources special sensor microwave imager sounder ssmis a conically scanning radiometer with constant incidence angle around 50 and a swath width of about 1700 km amsr2 and advanced scatterometer ascat the product si 402 c osi 403 c version 2 3 has been used for the ice edge assimilation the ascat onboard metop a and metop b consists of two sets of three antennas which are oriented at 45 90 and 135 with respect to the satellite s flight direction the beams cover 550 km wide swaths as the satellite moves along its orbit the system s antenna generates radar beams and measures backscatter from the sea surface the backscatter is sampled on a 12 5 km grid both scatterometer data and passive microwave data signatures are utilized to detect and classify sea ice a bayesian inverse method approach is used to combine various data sources the quality flags are also provided with the product and shown in table 3 the model estimated ice concentration is then used to estimate the ice concentration from the ice edge product see table 4 in table 4 a is the model ice concentration and a e is the ice concentration determined from the ice edge values the uncertainty measurements were chosen as 0 5 excellent 2 0 good 15 0 acceptable and 38 0 unreliable 3 3 combined ice concentration and ice edge the ice concentration and ice edge data is then combined using the bootstrap method james et al 2013 which can be used to quantify the uncertainty associated with the estimates the data is combined using a linear combination 11 a o c 1 a a m s r 2 c 2 a e where a a m s r 2 is the ice concentration from amsr2 and a e is the ice concentration estimated using a combination of ice edge product and the model estimate the constants c 1 and c 2 are given by c 1 σ e 2 c o v a a m s r 2 a e σ a m s r 2 2 σ e 2 2 c o v a a m s r 2 a e 12 c 2 σ a m s r 2 2 c o v a a m s r 2 a e σ a m s r 2 2 σ e 2 2 c o v a a m s r 2 a e where σ a m s r 2 is the standard deviation of amsr2 data σ e is the standard deviation of ice edge data and c o v a a m s r 2 a e is the covariance between amsr2 and ice edge data for the present study we assume that the data is uncorrelated the covariance may be determined using the correlation coefficient ρ if known between amsr2 and ice edge given by 13 c o v a a m s r 2 a e ρ σ e σ a m s r 2 the combined product a 0 was then used in the ice concentration assimilation scheme the combined standard deviation is given by 14 σ a o c 1 2 σ a m s r 2 2 c 2 2 σ e 2 3 4 avhrr sea surface temperature measurements derived from avhrr only oisst analysis banzon et al 2016 reynolds et al 2007 were used for sst assimilation sst data products are generated using a combination of satellite and in situ observations from buoy and ship observations and are available on a 0 25 0 25 resolution the avhrr only oisst analysis product estimates sst from ice concentration only in regions where ice concentration is greater than 50 otherwise satellite data are used to retrieve sst values banzon et al 2016 reynolds et al 2007 in the present study the sst is assimilated only in the regions where the observed ice concentration is zero in the regions where ice concentration was greater than 98 the sst was set to 1 8 c 3 5 cis product for ice concentration comparison validation the ice concentration from the canadian ice service cis is used for validation and comparison of sea ice concentration estimates from the model service 2009 the data are available in sigrid 3 format joint et al 2004 the look up table from sigrid 3 converts the ice codes into meaningful sea ice characteristics joint et al 2004 there is no inherent spatial resolution as the data set is provided as vector shapefiles the temporal resolution is weekly starting from 02 jan 2017 data in the southern canadian waters are not available during summer the cis takes data from various sources such as satellites aerial reconnaissance local ice climatology weather oceanographic information and ship reports aerial reconnaissance includes the use of airborne imaging radar side looking airborne radar slar synthetic aperture radar sar and airborne radiation thermometer manice 2005 satellite imagery is collected over several days in order to have complete coverage local ice climatology provides knowledge of some ice types and features that are possible in any given location corrections are made to the regional analyses and charts after the issue date if significant additional information becomes available or if errors are found within the analyses in cases where ice type cannot be identified only partial observations are made cis ice charts do not provide an absolute reference but they do represent the best report on ice conditions based on all available information the weekly ice chart is used here which means the data may be a mosaic or represent averaged conditions in certain regions ice analysts use data collected for at least 72 h to process the information for the ice charts manice 2005 note that it is typical to have missing data both in time and in space due to the issues with the interpretation of satellite images during freeze up and melt season issues due to snow cover and lack of airborne observations or measurements collected from ships some error occurs due to the conversions used in the ice codes e g 3 10 to 4 10 manice 2005 ice is represented by code 34 in sigrid 3 joint et al 2004 and 3 10 to 5 10 manice 2005 ice is represented by code 35 in sigrid 3 joint et al 2004 see appendix a and tables a 6 and a 7 for the full representation of sigrid 3 codes joint et al 2004 and ice concentration values used for the model assessment 4 mixed layer criteria before performing assimilation we tuned the model by experimenting with various mixed layer criteria the default model had a fixed mixed layer depth of 20 m which was replaced by a density based criteria as it was shown to provide better estimates of sea ice parameters in prasad et al 2015 the mixed layer criteria for the model eq 15 was revised by selecting the value for the density that minimized the average bias absolute error and root mean squared error rmse between model estimated ice concentration and the cis ice concentration product 15 h m i x depth where σ θ σ θ 10 0 05 kg m3 5 assimilation of ice concentration and ice edge products the combined product given in section 3 3 a o is assimilated into the model using a combined optimal interpolation and nudging wang et al 2013 according to 16 a a a b k τ a o a b where a a is the analysis a b is the background a o is the observation and k is the weight for assimilation given by k a o a b 2 a o a b 2 σ a o 2 the quantity τ is given by τ τ 0 e α a o a b where τ 0 is the basic time scale for nudging the exponential part represents the spatial temporal variations wang et al 2013 α 2 5 and σ a o is the standard deviation of the observed ice concentration if the grid cell sst is greater than 4 c then the cell is assumed to have no ice the assimilation is done every day and the model variables were interpolated to the observation space before assimilation and then mapped back to the model space after assimilation the analysis then serves as initial condition for the next time step 5 1 assimilation updates the ice volume is increased or decreased by including the changes in the ice concentration if in a grid cell no ice was present the new ice areas are introduced by assigning a specified ice thickness of 0 05 m in the grid cell in the assimilated model once the updates have been made to the ice concentration and corresponding changes made to ice volume the other tracer updates are completed it is difficult to track ridged ice area and presently no information on the ridged ice area fraction is available hence we assume the model ridged ice area to be an accurate representation and update the level ice area fraction using eq 9 in case the grid cell has only ridged ice area fraction and the level ice area fraction is zero then the assimilation updates only the ridged ice area fraction the level ice volume is updated using a similar strategy if new ice areas are introduced while assimilating the ice concentration then all newly introduced ice is considered to be level ice once the update has been made to the ridged level ice area and volume the melt ponds are updated as 17 a p n d a p n d a l v l a i a l v l a i where a l v l a i is updated level ice area fraction all new ice areas that are introduced during assimilation are considered to have no melt ponds the pond height is then updated by preserving the volume of the melt pond the analysis a l v l and a p n d serves as the initial conditions for the level ice tracers and melt pond tracers for the next time step the ice temperature is restored back to the surface temperature by assuming a linear temperature profile hunke et al 2015 and fixed salinity profile see eq 7 hunke et al 2015 the ice salinity and snow enthalpies are re initialized only when a new ice cell is added the updated tracers are then used in the variable drag formulation to compute the freeboard draft sail and keel depth in the next timestep please refer to tsamados et al 2014 or prasad et al 2018 for the full set of equations that are used to model the freeboard draft sail and keel depth 5 2 assimilation of sst for the assimilation of sst a procedure similar to the assimilation of ice concentration was used the sst was assimilated only in regions where the observed ice concentration is zero and in those grid cells where observed ice concentration was greater than 98 the model sst was reset to a value below the freezing point in eq 16 a a would now represent the analysis values of sst a b is the background value of sst a o is the observed sst note that while assimilating sst the observations are not heavily weighted normalized values were used to capture the temporal spatial variations 6 results and discussions 6 1 ice concentration in this section we discuss the results from four models m0 the non assimilated model m1 the model assimilated only with amsr2 ice concentration m2 the model assimilated with amsr2 ice concentration and ssmis ascat ice edge product and m3 the model assimilated with amsr2 ice concentration ssmis ascat ice edge product and avhrr only oisst analysis the simulations were completed to understand the improvement in the ice concentration estimates of the model as compared to the cis ice concentration with the addition of each product used in the assimilation scheme the bias and rmse between the model m0 m1 m2 m3 and the cis ice concentration are shown in fig 3 there is a persistent negative bias and a large rmse between the ice concentration data from amsr2 and cis see fig 4 use of only excellent and good data from amsr2 for the assimilation slightly improves the m1 model results see fig 3 and table 5 from table 5 we see that the average bias absolute error and rmse decreases with the addition of each data product the improvement in m1 m2 is very slight and this is due to the bias in the observation data amsr2 used for assimilation see fig 4 in model m1 and m2 the estimates of ice concentration deteriorate at some temporal points which is due to the accumulation of the error from the previously assimilated data further assimilating sst data from avhrr only oisst analysis brings a significant improvement in the estimates of ice concentration in model m3 see fig 3 and table 5 a significant improvement in the estimates of ice concentration from model m3 occurs during the melt season see fig 3 the annually averaged bias and rmse values are shown in table 5 which demonstrates that model m3 gives better estimates of ice concentration thus the assimilation of all three products amsr2 ice concentration ice edge and sst improves the model estimates of ice concentration fig 5 shows the difference between the models m1 m2 m3 and m0 in the figure we observe that the models m1 m2 and m3 produce changes in the ice concentration from january 2017 to the beginning of may 2017 model m3 shows the most significant changes during june july i e sst assimilation introduces substantial changes in the ice concentration after august 2017 the changes introduced by the assimilation are insignificant for rips lemieux et al 2016 the maximum bias is 15 and rmse is between 25 and 35 compared with the ice concentration from cis the model bias in the present study is better between 12 12 and 3 1 and the rmse is between 3 26 and 27 5 a direct comparison with rips is difficult however one of the major differences between rips and the present study is that the rips is configured for the entire arctic region while the present model is configured for a smaller region moreover rips based on cice version 4 0 uses a 3d var scheme to assimilate ice concentration retrieved from passive microwave ssmis advanced scatterometer data and the manually produced sea ice charts from cis fig 6 illustrates the ice concentration from the models m0 m1 m2 m3 and the cis sea ice concentration product for 24 july 2017 which is a weekly mosaic the cis product is obtained from the weekly ice chart and the model values are averaged over the week since the ice product from the cis is a weekly mosaic and the model values are weekly averaged long term or seasonal averages are not shown fig 6 shows locally improved estimates of the sea ice concentration with the addition of each product note that model m1 assimilated with amsr2 shows slight improvement of ice concentration at the nares strait and lancaster sound region model m2 assimilated with amsr2 and ice edges also shows slight improvement in ice concentration at the baffin bay region in addition to the slight improvements for nares strait and lancaster sound region the ice concentration values from the model m3 assimilated with ice concentration ice edge and sst show significant improvement in the region of baffin bay and lancaster sound also the ice concentration values from m3 show the best match with the values from the cis product the white area in the figures indicates the regions where observation data were not available at that time 6 2 ridged and level ice tracers as mentioned in eq 9 the total ice concentration and the total volume is represented as the sum of the level ice area and ridged ice area fractions and volume a strategy to include the level and ridged ice tracers in the data assimilation methodology has not been discussed in the literature to this point in section 5 1 a strategy was presented to include these tracers in the data assimilation updates of total ice concentration since it is practically difficult to track the ridged ice area and volume the validation is still a challenge the annual averages of the estimates of ridged level ice area and volume from all the models are illustrated in fig 7 the yearly averages show that there are not significant variations in the ridged or level ice fractions in the model estimates the assimilation of ice concentration and ice edge does indeed change the ridged ice area fractions but only by a small quantity the ridged level ice area and volume fraction changes are significant in the model assimilated with both the ice products and avhrr only oisst analysis this is likely caused by the addition of more ice cells due to the restoration of sst to values below the freezing point the domain of interest is mostly occupied by first year ice the thickness of which varies from 0 3 to 2 m and the average values of ice thickness from our assimilated models fall within this range note here that the ice volume and area are represented as the sum of level and ridged ice volume and area and hence the thickness will be affected by the changes in these parameters the annual maximum values of the level and ridged ice fractions of ice concentration are shown in figs 8 and 9 the model m3 shows an increased presence of ridged ice fractions in the area of the baffin bay and hudson bay the model assimilated with ice concentration and ice edge model m2 does not show significant variations in these values similarly no extreme values are observed in the ridged and level ice volumes estimates from the assimilated models especially models m1 and m2 shown in figs 10 and 11 hence we reason that the assimilation updates on the tracers of level ice and ridged ice are sensible and also produce better estimates of modelled ice concentration moreover compared with the estimates from non assimilated model we argue that the estimates of these tracers from our model are reasonable moreover this work presents a strategy to update the tracers such as ridged and level ice in the assimilation schemes when these tracers or the variable drag formulation are activated in the model configuration assimilation of additional satellite data such as sar and optical images would further improve the results this is because image based sea ice products are better than microwave radiometers during months when ice and the snow on top of ice are melting 6 3 ice thickness in prasad et al 2018 we provided a comparison of ice thickness estimates from the model with the ice thickness measurements from smos and freeboard measurements from cryosat2 both of which had high uncertainty prasad et al 2018 showed that the model thickness estimates fell within the uncertainty range of the observations from january to february of each year in this section a comparison of the ice thickness estimates from our models is made with the values obtained from the literature the comparison is made to understand if the thickness range generated by our models are reasonable please refer to fig 1 for the regions and stations discussed in this section stewart and howland 2009 indicate that the maximum extent of ice occurs during april or early may and the maximum ice thickness in the region of hudson bay increases from south to north due to the temperature gradient across hudson bay the model results are consistent with these observations model m3 shows clearly that the ice thickness increases from north to south with low ice thickness in the james bay and increasing towards the foxe basin see fig 12 the ice thickness also increases from west to east due to the transport of ice to the eastern side of hudson bay under the prevailing westerly winds gagnon and gough 2006 this is also demonstrated by the model results with the model m3 showing higher ice thickness in the centre of hudson bay fig 12 illustrates the yearly maximum values of ice thickness in metres stewart and lockhart 2005 report an ice thickness of 1 6 m in hudson bay stewart and howland 2009 reported that the maximum ice thickness in the hudson complex ranged from about 1 m in southern james bay moosonee 71 1 30 m to 2 m in northern foxe basin yearly maximum values of ice thickness are shown in fig 13 gagnon and gough 2006 analysed the weekly ice thickness measurements at seven locations and found that maximum ice thickness averaged 1 75 m the ice thickness values from our models also fell within the range of estimates reported in the study by stewart and howland 2009 the model m3 replicates ice thickness estimates above 1 25 m in ungava bay in the hudson strait as mentioned in stewart and howland 2009 the study by hu et al 2018 used the new ice thickness program data at first year landfast ice sites the weekly data from 2002 to 2016 were issued by the environment and climate change canada eccc and was used to validate the nemo lim2 sea ice simulations at both 1 4 and 1 12 horizontal resolution the eccc thickness data hu et al 2018 reports maximum ice thickness at the coral harbour from 2004 to 2016 varying between 1 5 and 1 8 m approximately our models give maximum values between 1 0 and 1 25 m the same study reports a maximum ice thickness of 2 5 m approximately between 2002 and 2006 at hall beach in the foxe basin the values from the models m0 m1 m2 and m3 give a maximum between 1 0 m and 1 5 m the field measurements used in hu et al 2018 also reports a maximum ice thickness between 1 5 and 1 8 m approximately at iqaluit our model estimates of maximum ice thickness at iqualuit is a little lower at 1 25 m the thickness estimates show some improvement with assimilation in order to understand the overall accuracy of the ice thickness estimates we have to do rigorous comparison with good quality in situ observations which are currently unavailable urrego blanco et al 2017 states that the improvement in either concentration or thickness comes at the expense of the quality of the estimate of the other this may provide a reason for the general under estimation of the thickness provided by our models 7 conclusion in this work the los alamos sea ice model cice was configured for the region of interest that includes the region of baffin bay the labrador sea hudson bay and the gulf of st lawrence the model used the variable drag formulation suggested by tsamados et al 2014 which required the use of additional tracers such as the level ice the ridged ice and melt ponds the addition of the variable drag formulation provides a wide range of information on sea ice products that can be used for risk analysis in various applications the model estimates were first compared with the cis ice concentration to estimate a best choice for the density based mixed layer depth criteria the model with the best choice of mixed layer depth criteria was then assimilated with the ice concentration product from amsr2 ice edge from ssmis ascat and sst data from avhrr only oisst the comparison of the non assimilated and assimilated models with cis ice concentration product shows that the estimates of ice concentration improve with the addition of each product especially during the summer months the best estimates are obtained with model m3 assimilated with all the three products ice concentration ice edge and sst a significant improvement in the ice concentration estimates is noticed during the melt period in model m3 the annual averages of level ridged ice tracers from the models show that the updates of these tracers were reasonable for the models assimilated with ice concentration and ice edge though an increased ridging was observed in the model that was assimilated with sst ice concentration and ice edge products the increased variation in the ridged ice area and volume was not significant when compared to the estimates from non assimilated model also comparing the estimates of ridged ice area and volume from assimilated model with the estimates from non assimilated model we argue that the estimates of these tracers from our model are reasonable moreover this work presents a strategy to update the tracers such as ridged and level ice in the assimilation schemes when these tracers and the variable drag formulation are activated in the model configuration assimilation of additional satellite data such as sar and optical images would further improve results because image based sea ice products are better than microwave radiometers during months when ice and the snow on top of ice are melting the model estimates of thickness were compared with station values obtained from the literature the exact data for 2017 were not available and hence the thickness values available from the literature in 2012 to 2016 were used to understand whether the model estimated annual maximums of ice thickness were reasonable the spatial variation of thickness in the hudson bay complex and the values at specific stations in the hudson bay complex were found to compare well with those mentioned in the literature credit authorship contribution statement siva prasad conceptualization methodology software writing

23929,the chilean inland sea cis is an extensive estuary system with a complex topography and many fjords and channels the degrees of stratification and mixing in the cis are strongly affected by river discharges high levels of rainfall wind and tidal forces field and satellite observations have suggested that stratification and mixing fluctuate on different timescales and spatial scales but the length and resolution of this record are insufficient to resolve these trends across the entire water column we used an operational oceanographic forecasting model mosa based on the regional ocean modeling system roms to study the yearly and seasonal patterns of stratification and mixing in the cis the evaluation of the model showed a satisfactory response to the seasonal variability of temperature salinity and currents the representation of the monthly stratification degrees of the system obtained with the buoyancy frequency and the potential energy anomaly reveals a highly dynamic estuary system with heterogeneous patterns on distinct spatial and temporal scales in the cis we conclude that the cis can be classified into three zones seasonal stratification regions permanent stratification regions and permanent mixing regions our results reveal a highly dynamic system that can be studied on different timescales with an operational model such as mosa this information may be relevant for studies of decade scale fluctuations linked to climate change keywords stratification vertical mixing seasonal variability operational model chilean inland sea 1 introduction hydrodynamic models provide extensive spatial and temporal information to represent stratification and mixing in estuary systems warner et al 2005 de boer et al 2008 kerimoglu and rinke 2013 vankevich et al 2016 these mixing processes are difficult to model given that they are subject to highly nonlinear effects resulting from the interactions of multiple local and remote forcing processes operational forecast models have the advantage that they adjust their initial condition usually daily using data assimilation decreasing forecast uncertainty and avoiding a drift from the initial conditions robinson et al 2002 the south austral operational model mosa is an alternative to complement available regional oceanographic information in a region of freshwater influence such as the chilean inland sea cis 41 s to 47 s where available observations are limited and usually disconnected from each other the cis fig 1 forms part of one of the largest estuary systems in the world farmer and freeland 1983 calvete and sobarzo 2011 silva and vargas 2014 it is characterized by complex topography that includes deep fjords and channels that connect the inland sea to the pacific ocean with the guafo mouth forming the main connection pantoja et al 2011 in which ocean waters are drawn into the interior and move northward through the gulf of corcovado and southward through the moraleda channel aiken 2008 artal et al 2019 there have been a number of studies in the last two decades based on local observations notably in the chacao channel cáceres et al 2003 reloncavísound valle

most important characteristics of estuary systems which is the main influence on vertical mixing in estuaries simpson et al 1990 with significant effects on a range of physical and biological processes and properties such as residual circulation hansen and rattray 1965 balance between phytoplankton primary production and losses lucas et al 1998 dissolved oxygen levels officer et al 1984

forces pickard 1971 neshyba and fonseca 1980 calvete and sobarzo 2011 saldías et al 2019 the properties of these water bodies are modified through interaction with abrupt morphologies that allow the

patagonia and described the spatial variability of the potential energy anomaly pea as a measure of the energy necessary to mix the water column they found the lowest pea values in the guafo mouth moraleda channel and elefantes estuary 0 2 jm 3 while the highest values 100 jm 3 were in the puyuhuapi and aysén fjords which coincides with the presence of the largest rivers in this study we present the development of the operational model and a description of spatial and temporal variability of mixing and stratification patterns in the cis 2 model and method 2 1 mosa mosa is based on a regional roms agrif model debreu et al 2012 which was applied in the cis and other areas mosa has a horizontal resolution of approximately 1 km distributed over 42 vertical sigma levels that follow the bathymetry the control parameters of these coordinates are as follows θ s 7 θ b 2 and h c 200 where θ s and θ b are the surface and bottom stretching parameters and h c is a positive thickness controlling the stretching these parameter values were chosen after a sensitivity study of the entire domain with emphasis on the fjord and channel zones the bathymetry was constructed on the basis of nautical charts from the hydrographic and oceanographic service of the chilean navy shoa for the cis and the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco sandwell et al 2002 for the open ocean fig 1 this information was smoothed with use of a selective and hanning filters to avoid abrupt bathymetric changes and thus also avoid numerical instabilities in the pressure gradient shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 mosa uses field mass and velocity data from the 1 12 spatial resolution global mercator model as the boundary conditions drévillon et al 2008 these data are downloaded daily and scaled to the resolution of the model the free surface between 2015 and 2017 was forced with heat flow and wind information obtained from the global forecast system 0 5 resolution during 2018 the global forecast system product was replaced by a high resolution operational model 5 km based on the weather research and forecasting model skamarock et al 2005 powers et al 2017 mosa uses the 24 h forecast from the previous day as an initial condition mosa currently uses 33 freshwater sources which represent the most important rivers in the cis it also includes the contribution from the northern ice field via the san rafael lagoon this information was obtained from monthly climatological data published by the general water directorate of chile dga and in the case of sources without data from interpolation of water basin data provided by the dga in its hydric balance of 1987 the watersheds used were discretized from gis files derived from digital elevation models basin flows were calculated through a relationship between the source without information and the closest basin for which there is information all the interpolated sources have mean monthly flow distribution curves with magnitudes that differ from those of the basins used but with the same temporal distribution patterns the information on the amplitude and phase of the tidal harmonics used by mosa at the open boundaries of the system is calculated from the global tpxo7 tidal model with 1 8 spatial resolution egbert and erofeeva 2002 the model is forced with ten harmonic tidal components four semidiurnal m 2 s 2 n 2 and k 2 four diurnal k 1 o 1 p 1 and q 1 one long period lunar fortnightly m m and one monthly m f these tidal constituents interact with each other providing shallow water harmonics m 10 and nonlinear harmonics overtides such as m 4 and m 6 cáceres et al 2003 a quadratic bottom friction parameterization with a constant drag coefficient 3 0 1 0 4 was used mosa generates a daily forecast of temperature salinity sea level and currents with a 72 h horizon the numerical outputs are stored as hourly data and as daily averages temporal variability is studied with data from only the first 24 h of the simulations which are joined consecutively the daily operation of mosa can be summarized in five steps fig 2 obtain boundary and forcing conditions configure the model input data run the model store the simulations and show the results on the chonos website http chonos ifop cl chonos is an open access website where the mosa forecasts from the previous week and environmentally related products can be accessed the root mean square error rmse bias and correlation coefficient r were used to assess sea surface temperature behavior in mosa 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i b i 2 1 2 2 bias 1 n i 1 n s i b i 3 r cov s b σ s σ b where s is the observed data b is the modeled data and σ is the standard deviation the modeled mass field was compared with conductivity temperature depth observations through use of a temperature salinity diagram the currents were evaluated with use of data acquired with an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp in the moraleda channel 2 2 water column stratification the strength of the stratification can be estimated through the buoyancy frequency bf n 2 which is directly proportional to the force of the density gradient and describes the vertical oscillation of a particle in the pycnocline produced by buoyancy the n 2 response times are relatively slow which allows us to calculate them using daily averages of temperature and salinity throughout the water column we consider the presence of this pycnocline as a sufficient condition to establish some degree of stratification in the water column the vertical integration of buoyancy strength can be considered an effective indicator to compare local changes in the spatial distribution we propose use of the integrated bf as a method to make spatial comparisons of the bf the bf is measured in the unit of reciprocal seconds and is defined as 4 bf z η n 2 d z where 5 n 2 g ρ 0 ρ z where g is gravitational acceleration 9 8 ms 2 ρ 0 is a reference density 1023 kgm 3 z is the vertical coordinate and η is the height of the sea level the water column is well stratified for high bfs and is less stratified for low bfs the amount of energy necessary for mixing throughout the water column at a given moment is estimated by calculation of the pea simpson 1981 which is measured in joules per cubic meter and is defined as 6 pea 1 h z η g z ρ ρ d z where ρ is the average density of the water column and h is the depth the richardson number r i is used to determine the importance of stratification in water column mixing and is the relationship between stratification n 2 and vertical shear s 2 and can be defined as follows turner 1979 7 r i n 2 s 2 where 8 s 2 u z 2 v z 2 where u and v are zonal and meridional velocities the water column is well stratified if r i 1 with the possibility of turbulent mixing if r i 0 25 we used hourly r i values at arbitrary points in the cis to assess turbulent mixing tendencies in the upper layers fig 1 another method to study water column stratification in areas where density is governed by salinity is to decompose the bf n 2 t s into two functions one dependent on potential temperature and the other dependent on salinity maes 2008 maes and o kane 2014 the effect of salinity on stratification at a given depth can be assessed through the salinity component in the bf n 2 s to do this we used the difference between n 2 t s and the thermal component n 2 t following the numerical development in maes 2008 ocean salinity stratification was defined at the vertical average of n 2 s 9 n 2 t s n 2 t n 2 s where n t g α d t d z where α is the thermal expansion coefficient consequently 10 n 2 s n 2 t s n 2 t dealing with an estuary in which pycnoclines are usually around 50 m we focused on the first 100 m depth which is where most of the mixing processes in the study area occur we assessed differences in the depths of the n 2 t s and n 2 t profiles since the thickness and depth of each pycnocline define how much salinity affects stratification and its expansion in the water column the effect of salinity on stratification is represented by the positive difference of these values while negative values are associated with a destabilizing effect caused by salinity when n 2 t is attenuated this is associated with regions of density compensation maes and o kane 2014 o kane et al 2014 n 2 s is not intended to be a comparative value with respect to n 2 t because of their different expansions coefficients we used n 2 s as a qualitative value when salinity becomes important with regard to stratification 3 results 3 1 model validation the daily evolution of the sea surface temperature was compared with the daily mosa output and data obtained with the 0 25 advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr from october 2017 and june 2020 the model reproduces seasonal variability with transitions between cold and warm phases fig 3 a correlation of 0 98 and an rmse of 0 29 c were obtained between the annual cycle of the model and the avhrr data in general mosa gives warmer temperatures during spring and summer and colder temperatures during autumn and winter the errors in the spatial distribution of the modeled sea surface temperature were contrasted with the monthly visible infrared imaging radiometer suite data viirs with a 4 km resolution based on correlation maps the rmse and bias the spatial correlations in the domain ranged between 0 7 and 0 95 fig 4a the maximum correlations are concentrated in the western part of chiloé and the oceanic part of the domain the r 2 values in the cis are above 0 7 which shows that the variability of the model had a lower adjustment to the satellite data in comparison with the open ocean but these values are still significant the minimal correlations are concentrated in areas where there are more complex bathymetric and topographic configurations such as the nao strait in the reloncavísound or the desertores channel in the gulf of corcovado the rmse ranged between 0 5 and 1 5 c throughout the domain fig 4b nevertheless we found higher values within the domain with absolute maximums between 2 and 3 c in the reloncavíand aysén fjords the jacaf puyuhuapi system and the gulf of elefantes all these areas have in common that their bathymetry in mosa can differ significantly from the real bathymetry because of the depth smoothing and filtering to avoid numerical instabilities in the pressure gradient the lowest values are dominant along the western coast of chiloé in the guafo mouth and in the oceanic area with an error of less than 1 5 c these are areas that better represent the seabed and where it does not exercise significant control over the distribution of surface variables the bias shows coherence with what was previously described exhibiting values below 0 5 c in much of the oceanic zone of the domain increasing toward the cis reaching relative maximums of 1 3 c fig 4c the water mass distribution in the cis was evaluated seasonally with use of conductivity temperature depth data from fisheries development institute ifop oceanographic campaigns in chiloé in 2017 2018 and in aysén in 2018 2019 temperature salinity diagrams were prepared for these observations and mosa outputs in order to have seasonal hydrographic data on the study area these diagrams are useful to identify different water masses and to determine if the model can reproduce the large scale dynamics that govern the thermohaline structures in the area in general terms mosa can reproduce the observed thermohaline structures mainly in spring and summer fig 5 the greatest differences are observed in autumn we also observed that the model lacks low surface salinity values which is a major numerical challenge for modeling estuary systems the direction and speed of the currents were measured by an adcp deployed in the middle of the moraleda channel the instrument was set to record measurements in the first 65 m depth every 30 min during august and december of 2018 the data were broken down into orthogonal components transformed to hourly averages and integrated into the water column the axis of maximum variance in the mosa results shows a deviation of about 8 to the east with respect to the adcp measurements fig 6a in an area where currents on a north south axis predominate the model tends to overestimate the intensities of northward flows with slight adjustments to southward flows we also observed well defined spectral maximums in the diurnal and semidiurnal bands as well as frequencies close to 6 and 8 h in both the mosa measurements and the adcp measurements this highlights the importance of the tides in this area and the capacity of mosa to reproduce tidal phenomena adequately 3 2 integrated bf and pea the temporal evolution of the bf in the coastal area of the mosa domain was calculated with the hourly averaged monthly output from 2018 and integrated into the water column we observed a seasonal variability in bf with more stratification in summer than in winter fig 7 furthermore we observed low bfs in winter distributed homogeneously in the cis while there were more and less stratified areas in summer reflecting the spatial distribution of the bf in local terms the conditions in the reloncavíand comau fjords were respectively assimilated by the reloncavísound and the gulf of ancud in summer resulting in larger systems that remain stratified in the gulf of ancud the water column is well stratified only in summer while in reloncavísound it remains stratified throughout the year between autumn and mid spring the response of these systems to the mixing processes in the adjacent fjords is weak especially in the gulf of ancud and they become areas of high mixing in the guafo mouth a phase behavior is observed as happens in the moraleda channel the gulf of corcovado and the jacaf channel where there is a high degree of stratification in summer and weaker stratification between autumn and mid spring puyuhuapi fjord remains strongly stratified throughout the year with a minimum during winter the water column in the gulf of corcovado was highly mixed throughout the year giving rise to a highly homogeneous area that contrasts sharply with the variability observed in the northern and southern boundaries of the gulf of corcovado the annual cycle of the spatial distribution of the pea is similar to that of the bf patterns fig 8 preserving the characteristics of strong contrasts in summer and more homogeneity in winter nevertheless we observe some subtle differences in the guafo mouth and the moraleda channel compared with the bf distribution bfs in the guafo mouth begin to decrease gradually in april while pea values remain stable this situation is evident until october when both bfs and pea values begin to increase the situation is similar in the moraleda channel in june and september when stratification decreases and pea values remain stable in the fjord region we found a maximum value of 340 jm 3 and an annual average of 300 jm 3 the differences between the bf and pea can account for a water column that although weakly stratified resists mixing the stratification and mixing variability inside the cis can be summarized by at least three well defined zones permanent mixing regions permanent stratification regions and seasonal stratification regions in the last two cases the stratification strength also exhibits differences 3 3 the gradient richardson number and ocean stratification by salinity a focus on local aspects is required because of the heterogeneous seasonal variability of the density fronts different locations in the cis were selected to evaluate the stability of the water column and the tendency for turbulent mixing based on the spatial and temporal bf and pea distributions hourly r i profiles in the reloncavi fjord the gulf of ancud the gulf of corcovado the guafo mouth the moraleda channel northern part and the puyuhuapi fjord fig 1 were calculated the minimal critical r i values 0 25 in the reloncavíand puyuhuapi fjords indicate favorable conditions for a well stratified water column over much of the year fig 9a f the r i values in the gulf of ancud and the moraleda channel indicate a water column favorable to turbulent mixing in winter and stratification in summer fig 9b e the development of a surface layer with persistently critical values throughout the year is evident in the gulf of ancud this layer exhibits three relatively well defined periods it is concentrated in the first 5 m depth in winter deepens to approximately 30 m in autumn and reaches a maximum depth of approximately 80 m in winter and into the spring r i values in the moraleda channel vary seasonally as they do in the gulf of ancud with conditions in the water column favorable to turbulent mixing down to a depth of 90 m we observed an area in the gulf of corcovado with turbulent mixing throughout the year with periodic events in which the entire water column is subject to turbulent mixing fig 9c in the guafo mouth there is a mixed condition up to a depth of 30 m with favorable conditions for turbulent mixing permanently in winter and sporadically during the other seasons fig 9d however the r i values in the rest of the water column are greater than 0 25 indicating a fragile and potentially turbulent water column we calculated n 2 s at the same locations as used for calculating the bf in the first 100 m depth positive n 2 s values indicate the effect of salinity on stratification we observed maximum values at the surface of the reloncavífjord throughout the year fig 10a indicating how salinity governs mixing and stratification in the surface layer of the fjord which inhibits turbulent mixing in the surface layers the latter is consistent with the observed r i values meanwhile there is a layer around the pycnocline in the gulf of ancud the depth of which changes seasonally with positive differences that deepen the layer in winter and negative differences in summer fig 10b salinity has no contribution to the development of thermohaline structures in the gulf of corcovado given that n 2 s values in this area are close to zero fig 10c furthermore we observed that salinity began to play a greater role in stratification in the guafo mouth in the summer which decreased in autumn fig 10d seasonal variability in the moraleda channel was similar to what was observed in the gulf of ancud in terms of bf and r i values with the difference being the influence of salinity increased only in summer and in deeper layers with negative values at the surface in summer fig 10e the highest n 2 s values in the puyuhuapi fjord are related to critical r i values and are found below the surface layer with maximum values in winter fig 10f 4 discussion an operational model was used to provide a regional perspective of the seasonal variability of stratification and mixing patterns in the cis mosa provides new knowledge of the dynamical processes with different temporal resolution scales such as yearly and seasonal our results show an expansion of salinity fronts inside the cis leading to stable conditions that remain during the spring summer period during the autumn winter period the salinity fronts move toward the coast and mixing conditions dominate saldías et al 2019 the key role of salinity on the stratification and its capacity to inhibit mixing in the water column were also analyzed 4 1 operational model mosa the mosa salinity assessments are considered satisfactory although the model overestimates low salinity values at the surface to improve these values it is necessary to add new point sources of fresh water but it must be done with great care in order to avoid possible stability problems in the model nevertheless the seasonal variability of salinity and temperature are consistent with the observations we notice high correlations with sea surface temperature satellite data the dispersion of the orthogonal current components and energy rotatory spectra shows a good adjustment between the adcp data and the mosa model in the moraleda channel previous evaluations of sea level not shown exhibit that mosa is capable of reproducing the larger amplitudes of the tidal range in the northern section over 7 m in reloncavísound in contrast with the tidal range in the guafo mouth 2 m given the limited spatial and temporal coverage of observations and studies of the cis mosa is a valuable alternative to study the oceanographic processes of the region for example olivares et al 2015 used a model configuration similar to mosa with an old version of the grid to establish sanitary boundaries for salmon farms in the context of infectious salmon anemia virus herrera et al 2018 used this grid to feed a large eddy simulation model and study the effect of salmon cages on local oceanic circulation artal et al 2019 used a barotropic model with the same grid and bathymetry as mosa to assess tidal energy in the cis during spring and neap tides currently the mosa results are being used for different environmental studies in the area the application of mosa in the cis represents a valuable and unprecedented initiative that attempts to approximate a broad range of processes present at different temporal and spatial scales mosa is under constant development as a result of improvements in numerical computing systems data assimilation techniques and the resolution of satellite products the oceanographic forecasts provided by mosa available from the chonos website http chonos ifop cl are tools for coastal management and for understanding physical biological processes in the region on different spatial and temporal scales 4 2 seasonal variability of stratification and mixing in the cis the study of large scale dynamic patterns has been difficult because of the complex bathymetry of the cis rodrigo 2006 and because of the lack of observational data for long periods models can be useful to achieve a major spatial and temporal coverage however the persistence throughout the year of freshwater in the surface layer driving estuarine circulation through the development of horizontal salinity gradients geyer 2010 introduces a new challenge for the modeling as previously presented mosa proved to be able to develop the temperature and salinity seasonal variability which allows us to study the evolution of the mass field and how this modifies the stratification and mixing patterns the representation of the degrees of monthly stratification of the system obtained with the bf and pea points to a highly dynamic cis narváez et al 2019 described the presence of heterogeneous patterns on distinct spatial and temporal scales in the cis associated with large scale processes generated in the pacific ocean these patterns were also observed in the analyses of the bf fig 7 and pea fig 8 obtained from mosa one of the mechanisms is the warm water surface intrusion from the equator in spring and summer which modifies the entire coastal region outside the cis however interior regions of the cis disconnected from the open sea show gradual increases at the same time especially in the reloncavi sound and the moraleda channel revealing a strong local influence concurrently low surface salinity moves high buoyancy fronts from coastal regions toward the cis in spring and summer dominated by the discharge of glacial meltwater and the high levels of rainfall pickard 1971 chuecas et al 1980 neshyba and fonseca 1980 dávila et al 2002 calvete and sobarzo 2011 saldías et al 2019 the patterns of surface salinity and surface temperature emphasize the importance and implications of these processes throughout the year in the development of stratification and mixing regimes on the basis of our bf results we divided the system into three classifications of stratification and mixing regimes that concur with the findings of other studies of the area these are as follows a regimes with high levels of seasonal variability such as those in the gulf of ancud the moraleda channel pérez santos et al 2014 and to a lesser degree the guafo mouth water column stratification in this area responds to equilibrium between mixing forces and buoyancy forces as a result of the drainage of brackish water toward the guafo mouth calvete and sobarzo 2011 b a strong mixing regime throughout the year as shown in the gulf of corcovado strub et al 2019 which in winter expands spatially to the gulf of ancud in the north and to the moraleda channel and the guafo mouth in the south leading to a large homogeneous system c a regime of high stratification throughout the year with little seasonal variability subject to the upper levels can be observed in continental fjords such as the reloncavífjord castillo et al 2012 2016 and the puyuhuapi fjord calvete and sobarzo 2011 schneider et al 2014 monthly pea maps help in quantifying the level of stratification in terms of energy and temporal variability while the pea patterns look similar to those of the bf there are subtle differences in the guafo mouth and moraleda channel accounting for processes that may drive the development of highly energetic surface mixing layers calvete and sobarzo 2011 calculated the spatial distribution of the pea in the southern part of the cis using observations from oceanographic cruises in different seasons of the year the measurements of calvete and sobarzo 2011 and the mosa outputs showed that the intensity and spatial extension of the density front dominated by the pea have seasonality variability consistent with bfs they also showed that the highest pea values in the puyuhuapi and aysén fjords coincided as a result of their proximity to large rivers mosa also reproduced this pattern but with average maximum values approximately 100 jm 3 below those observations however calvete and sobarzo 2011 found low and homogeneous pea values throughout the year in the moraleda channel in contrast to mosa which showed a high degree of seasonality with higher values in summer we did not establish the source of these differences in this work which is a question that should be addressed in future studies 4 3 mixing and salinity role bfs and pea values obtained from mosa permit visualization of the displacement of density fronts on a seasonal scale our results show a strong local influence of salinity in some areas although also a strong gradient of surface temperature is observed in the cis during spring and summer silva et al 2009 saldías et al 2019 narváez et al 2019 furthermore the well known effect of the wind driven flow could affect vertical thermohaline structures allowing a three layer residual circulation valle levinson et al 2014 the richardson number was calculated at different virtual stations throughout the cis to assess the stability of the patterns observed and their sensitivity to kinetic forcing each virtual station represents a regime previously described at those same points we used the method described by maes 2008 to isolate the effect of salinity over bf as a measure of the contribution of salinity to the stratification in general terms the r i values confirm a seasonal variability of wind driven flow that alters the ocean surface layer in the area the impact of which can be attenuated by local factors such as salinity saldías et al 2019 and the complex bathymetry rodrigo 2006 strongly stratified structures are dominant throughout the year in the reloncavífjord with not significant r i values and high levels of n 2 s close to the pycnocline the situation is somewhat similar in the puyuhuapi fjord with the difference that r i values show a mixing layer confined to the first few meters of depth that may be dominated by winds in winter in this case this could be an effect of the limited role of salinity in stabilizing the thermocline depth yielding the influence of wind in winter this can be attributed to differences in winter of the mean flow between the puelo river 650 m 3 s 1 and the cisnes river 280 m 3 s 1 http www dga cl in the high energy area of the gulf of corcovado the combined effects of bathymetry and wind give rise to a water column that remains highly mixed throughout the year although it is surrounded by estuarine areas that are not capable of modifying their structures critical values of r i were observed throughout the water column while calculations of n 2 s show the null influence of salinity in this area winds seem to have a strong impact on weak thermohaline structures that appear in spring and summer since salinity generates a slight degree of stratification where the influence of the palena river plume is notable mean flow of approximately 800 m 3 s 1 http www dga cl it is remarkable how a small contribution of salinity restricts depth of r i critical values and acts as strong controller of mixing in these areas in regions with a seasonal variability of stratification such as the gulf of ancud and the moraleda channel we found a strong influence of wind driven flow in winter while salinity appears to be the motor of pycnocline stability between autumn and spring in the gulf of ancud however negative n 2 s values appear in summer in the gulf of ancud and in the first few meters of depth in the moraleda channel indicating situations where salinity will contribute to instability maes 2008 this could also mean a potential contribution of temperature in the development of stratification in the case of the gulf of ancud freshwater from the puelo river and the comau fjord contributes to the creation of a integrate stable system in summer but as summer ends the amount of freshwater decreases while the temperature remains the same there is a similar scenario in the moraleda channel which is affected by a freshwater plume from the palena river these issues will be subjects of future studies estuary systems throughout the world show complexity of mixing processes due to the spatial and temporal variability of the remote or local forces involved in the fjord and channel system of british columbia in canada strong tidal currents connect the ocean with the interior zone through the juan de fuca strait and over a series of sills through the haro and rosario straits where there is intense mixing of tides with surface freshwater from the strait of georgia soontiens and allen 2017 this significant tide induced mixing in the water column produces a marked fortnightly modulation in the estuarine circulation griffin and leblond 1990 leblond et al 1994 masson and cummins 2000 at deeper areas and in rivers such as in the strait of georgia the stratification is strong and varies according to river seasonality masson and cummins 2004 so the salinity distribution is determined mainly by river runoff and vertical mixing by tides li et al 1999 with less effect of the local wind masson and cummins 2004 changes in stratification due to seasonality in river discharge are significant in places with large rivers in the bay of bengal the intense freshwater flow from the indian summer monsoon generates a strong stratification of salinity causing a shallow and robust mixing layer li et al 2017 jana et al 2018 in general wind has been considered as a source of kinetic energy that promotes mixing eliminating the stratification of the surface layer and deepening the pycnocline this is significant in regions where low pressure atmospheric systems allow the action of intense winds garreaud et al 2013 a recent study in the puyuhuapi fjord based on observational data and numerical models indicates that mixing in the fjord is strongly related to wind variability pinilla et al 2020 the relatively stable atmospheric conditions associated with the pacific anticyclone dominate in spring and summer reducing the influence of westerly winds weaker winds in turn reduce wind driven mixing by increasing stratification in contrast in autumn and winter the westerly drift drives relatively more intense winds increasing the mixing in the upper layer pinilla et al 2020 this study describes a large scale estuary system that is highly heterogeneous in summer and in which the combination of local and remote forcing is beneficial for the development of a high degree of stratification salinity is the main restorative force acting on the stability of the water column in this system stratification gradually weakens in much of the system toward autumn and at the beginning of spring resulting in a more homogeneous and largely mixed system nevertheless continental fjords remain stratified throughout the year future studies should explore interannual variability of cis mixing and stratification patterns using mosa based climatological models finally the use of n 2 s has proved useful in showing the influence and strength of salinity in the construction of stratified vertical structures these values along with r i calculation provide a simple way to identify how salinity and wind driven flow compete in the development of stratification and mixing regimes 5 conclusions we present an operational oceanographic model for southern austral chile mosa this operational system provides daily environmental information with a 72 h projection of physical variables such as temperature salinity sea level and marine currents development of mosa began in 2015 and it has remained operational since then the results for this system are freely available from the chonos website http chonos ifop cl where visitors can view the forecasts generated over the previous 7 days using spatial maps time series profiles and transects these numerical results can be used to understand estuarine dynamics and coastal circulation in the cis region we also describe a method to study the stability of the water column based on the bf in different parts of the cis in 2018 our results allow us to characterize the cis in three main zones seasonal stratification regions permanent stratification regions and permanent mixing regions in the first case strongly seasonal bf and r i patterns were evident in the gulf of ancud with the system being highly stratified in summer and highly mixed in winter with a surface layer favorable to turbulent mixing although governed by salinity in the pycnocline the moraleda channel could be in this category because it has a similar mechanism the second case corresponds to a fjord system such as the reloncavíand puyuhuapi fjords where the salinity can inhibit mixing representing a surface barrier to the exchange of properties the capacity of salinity to inhibit turbulent mixing in the puyuhuapi fjord was limited at the surface layer with critical r i values at that level but below that was a strongly stratified layer in the reloncavi fjord salinity has total control of mixing the third case permanent mixing regions is exemplified by the gulf of corcovado where turbulent mixing was dominant throughout the year but in the guafo mouth a sufficient level of mixing fails to develop even in the presence of low salinity although there is always stratification in the guafo mouth it is weak with slight seasonality while there is enough energy to sustain mixing in the water column in the autumn months this suggests that the control that salinity exercises over stratification can decrease n 2 s values along with r i calculation can provide a simple way to identify how salinity and wind driven flow compete in the development of stratification and mixing regimes credit authorship contribution statement cristian

23929,the chilean inland sea cis is an extensive estuary system with a complex topography and many fjords and channels the degrees of stratification and mixing in the cis are strongly affected by river discharges high levels of rainfall wind and tidal forces field and satellite observations have suggested that stratification and mixing fluctuate on different timescales and spatial scales but the length and resolution of this record are insufficient to resolve these trends across the entire water column we used an operational oceanographic forecasting model mosa based on the regional ocean modeling system roms to study the yearly and seasonal patterns of stratification and mixing in the cis the evaluation of the model showed a satisfactory response to the seasonal variability of temperature salinity and currents the representation of the monthly stratification degrees of the system obtained with the buoyancy frequency and the potential energy anomaly reveals a highly dynamic estuary system with heterogeneous patterns on distinct spatial and temporal scales in the cis we conclude that the cis can be classified into three zones seasonal stratification regions permanent stratification regions and permanent mixing regions our results reveal a highly dynamic system that can be studied on different timescales with an operational model such as mosa this information may be relevant for studies of decade scale fluctuations linked to climate change keywords stratification vertical mixing seasonal variability operational model chilean inland sea 1 introduction hydrodynamic models provide extensive spatial and temporal information to represent stratification and mixing in estuary systems warner et al 2005 de boer et al 2008 kerimoglu and rinke 2013 vankevich et al 2016 these mixing processes are difficult to model given that they are subject to highly nonlinear effects resulting from the interactions of multiple local and remote forcing processes operational forecast models have the advantage that they adjust their initial condition usually daily using data assimilation decreasing forecast uncertainty and avoiding a drift from the initial conditions robinson et al 2002 the south austral operational model mosa is an alternative to complement available regional oceanographic information in a region of freshwater influence such as the chilean inland sea cis 41 s to 47 s where available observations are limited and usually disconnected from each other the cis fig 1 forms part of one of the largest estuary systems in the world farmer and freeland 1983 calvete and sobarzo 2011 silva and vargas 2014 it is characterized by complex topography that includes deep fjords and channels that connect the inland sea to the pacific ocean with the guafo mouth forming the main connection pantoja et al 2011 in which ocean waters are drawn into the interior and move northward through the gulf of corcovado and southward through the moraleda channel aiken 2008 artal et al 2019 there have been a number of studies in the last two decades based on local observations notably in the chacao channel cáceres et al 2003 reloncavísound valle

2014 temperature and salinity patterns narváez et al 2019 strub et al 2019 and stratification patterns calvete and sobarzo 2011 pérez santos et al 2014 saldías et al 2019 stratification is one of the most important characteristics of estuary systems which is the main influence on vertical mixing in estuaries simpson et al 1990 with significant effects on a range of physical and biological processes and properties such as residual circulation hansen and rattray 1965 balance between phytoplankton primary production and losses lucas et al 1998 dissolved oxygen levels officer et al 1984

forces pickard 1971 neshyba and fonseca 1980 calvete and sobarzo 2011 saldías et al 2019 the properties of these water bodies are modified through interaction with abrupt morphologies that allow the

developed under certain wind driven conditions valle levinson and blanco 2004 valle levinson et al 2014 current knowledge of variability in stratification and mixing in the cis is based on spatially and temporally limited observations calvete and sobarzo 2011 castillo et al 2012 pérez santos et al 2014 calvete and sobarzo 2011 assessed the influence of freshwater provided by the main rivers in patagonia and described the spatial variability of the potential energy anomaly pea as a measure of the energy necessary to mix the water column they found the lowest pea values in the guafo mouth moraleda channel and elefantes estuary 0 2 jm 3 while the highest values 100 jm 3 were in the puyuhuapi and aysén fjords which coincides with the presence of the largest rivers in this study we present the development of the operational model and a description of spatial and temporal variability of mixing and stratification patterns in the cis 2 model and method 2 1 mosa mosa is based on a regional roms agrif model debreu et al 2012 which was applied in the cis and other areas mosa has a horizontal resolution of approximately 1 km distributed over 42 vertical sigma levels that follow the bathymetry the control parameters of these coordinates are as follows θ s 7 θ b 2 and h c 200 where θ s and θ b are the surface and bottom stretching parameters and h c is a positive thickness controlling the stretching these parameter values were chosen after a sensitivity study of the entire domain with emphasis on the fjord and channel zones the bathymetry was constructed on the basis of nautical charts from the hydrographic and oceanographic service of the chilean navy shoa for the cis and the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco sandwell et al 2002 for the open ocean fig 1 this information was smoothed with use of a selective and hanning filters to avoid abrupt bathymetric changes and thus also avoid numerical instabilities in the pressure gradient shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 mosa uses field mass and velocity data from the 1 12 spatial resolution global mercator model as the boundary conditions drévillon et al 2008 these data are downloaded daily and scaled to the resolution of the model the free surface between 2015 and 2017 was forced with heat flow and wind information obtained from the global forecast system 0 5 resolution during 2018 the global forecast system product was replaced by a high resolution operational model 5 km based on the weather research and forecasting model skamarock et al 2005 powers et al 2017 mosa uses the 24 h forecast from the previous day as an initial condition mosa currently uses 33 freshwater sources which represent the most important rivers in the cis it also includes the contribution from the northern ice field via the san rafael lagoon this information was obtained from monthly climatological data published by the general water directorate of chile dga and in the case of sources without data from interpolation of water basin data provided by the dga in its hydric balance of 1987 the watersheds used were discretized from gis files derived from digital elevation models basin flows were calculated through a relationship between the source without information and the closest basin for which there is information all the interpolated sources have mean monthly flow distribution curves with magnitudes that differ from those of the basins used but with the same temporal distribution patterns the information on the amplitude and phase of the tidal harmonics used by mosa at the open boundaries of the system is calculated from the global tpxo7 tidal model with 1 8 spatial resolution egbert and erofeeva 2002 the model is forced with ten harmonic tidal components four semidiurnal m 2 s 2 n 2 and k 2 four diurnal k 1 o 1 p 1 and q 1 one long period lunar fortnightly m m and one monthly m f these tidal constituents interact with each other providing shallow water harmonics m 10 and nonlinear harmonics overtides such as m 4 and m 6 cáceres et al 2003 a quadratic bottom friction parameterization with a constant drag coefficient 3 0 1 0 4 was used mosa generates a daily forecast of temperature salinity sea level and currents with a 72 h horizon the numerical outputs are stored as hourly data and as daily averages temporal variability is studied with data from only the first 24 h of the simulations which are joined consecutively the daily operation of mosa can be summarized in five steps fig 2 obtain boundary and forcing conditions configure the model input data run the model store the simulations and show the results on the chonos website http chonos ifop cl chonos is an open access website where the mosa forecasts from the previous week and environmentally related products can be accessed the root mean square error rmse bias and correlation coefficient r were used to assess sea surface temperature behavior in mosa 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i b i 2 1 2 2 bias 1 n i 1 n s i b i 3 r cov s b σ s σ b where s is the observed data b is the modeled data and σ is the standard deviation the modeled mass field was compared with conductivity temperature depth observations through use of a temperature salinity diagram the currents were evaluated with use of data acquired with an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp in the moraleda channel 2 2 water column stratification the strength of the stratification can be estimated through the buoyancy frequency bf n 2 which is directly proportional to the force of the density gradient and describes the vertical oscillation of a particle in the pycnocline produced by buoyancy the n 2 response times are relatively slow which allows us to calculate them using daily averages of temperature and salinity throughout the water column we consider the presence of this pycnocline as a sufficient condition to establish some degree of stratification in the water column the vertical integration of buoyancy strength can be considered an effective indicator to compare local changes in the spatial distribution we propose use of the integrated bf as a method to make spatial comparisons of the bf the bf is measured in the unit of reciprocal seconds and is defined as 4 bf z η n 2 d z where 5 n 2 g ρ 0 ρ z where g is gravitational acceleration 9 8 ms 2 ρ 0 is a reference density 1023 kgm 3 z is the vertical coordinate and η is the height of the sea level the water column is well stratified for high bfs and is less stratified for low bfs the amount of energy necessary for mixing throughout the water column at a given moment is estimated by calculation of the pea simpson 1981 which is measured in joules per cubic meter and is defined as 6 pea 1 h z η g z ρ ρ d z where ρ is the average density of the water column and h is the depth the richardson number r i is used to determine the importance of stratification in water column mixing and is the relationship between stratification n 2 and vertical shear s 2 and can be defined as follows turner 1979 7 r i n 2 s 2 where 8 s 2 u z 2 v z 2 where u and v are zonal and meridional velocities the water column is well stratified if r i 1 with the possibility of turbulent mixing if r i 0 25 we used hourly r i values at arbitrary points in the cis to assess turbulent mixing tendencies in the upper layers fig 1 another method to study water column stratification in areas where density is governed by salinity is to decompose the bf n 2 t s into two functions one dependent on potential temperature and the other dependent on salinity maes 2008 maes and o kane 2014 the effect of salinity on stratification at a given depth can be assessed through the salinity component in the bf n 2 s to do this we used the difference between n 2 t s and the thermal component n 2 t following the numerical development in maes 2008 ocean salinity stratification was defined at the vertical average of n 2 s 9 n 2 t s n 2 t n 2 s where n t g α d t d z where α is the thermal expansion coefficient consequently 10 n 2 s n 2 t s n 2 t dealing with an estuary in which pycnoclines are usually around 50 m we focused on the first 100 m depth which is where most of the mixing processes in the study area occur we assessed differences in the depths of the n 2 t s and n 2 t profiles since the thickness and depth of each pycnocline define how much salinity affects stratification and its expansion in the water column the effect of salinity on stratification is represented by the positive difference of these values while negative values are associated with a destabilizing effect caused by salinity when n 2 t is attenuated this is associated with regions of density compensation maes and o kane 2014 o kane et al 2014 n 2 s is not intended to be a comparative value with respect to n 2 t because of their different expansions coefficients we used n 2 s as a qualitative value when salinity becomes important with regard to stratification 3 results 3 1 model validation the daily evolution of the sea surface temperature was compared with the daily mosa output and data obtained with the 0 25 advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr from october 2017 and june 2020 the model reproduces seasonal variability with transitions between cold and warm phases fig 3 a correlation of 0 98 and an rmse of 0 29 c were obtained between the annual cycle of the model and the avhrr data in general mosa gives warmer temperatures during spring and summer and colder temperatures during autumn and winter the errors in the spatial distribution of the modeled sea surface temperature were contrasted with the monthly visible infrared imaging radiometer suite data viirs with a 4 km resolution based on correlation maps the rmse and bias the spatial correlations in the domain ranged between 0 7 and 0 95 fig 4a the maximum correlations are concentrated in the western part of chiloé and the oceanic part of the domain the r 2 values in the cis are above 0 7 which shows that the variability of the model had a lower adjustment to the satellite data in comparison with the open ocean but these values are still significant the minimal correlations are concentrated in areas where there are more complex bathymetric and topographic configurations such as the nao strait in the reloncavísound or the desertores channel in the gulf of corcovado the rmse ranged between 0 5 and 1 5 c throughout the domain fig 4b nevertheless we found higher values within the domain with absolute maximums between 2 and 3 c in the reloncavíand aysén fjords the jacaf puyuhuapi system and the gulf of elefantes all these areas have in common that their bathymetry in mosa can differ significantly from the real bathymetry because of the depth smoothing and filtering to avoid numerical instabilities in the pressure gradient the lowest values are dominant along the western coast of chiloé in the guafo mouth and in the oceanic area with an error of less than 1 5 c these are areas that better represent the seabed and where it does not exercise significant control over the distribution of surface variables the bias shows coherence with what was previously described exhibiting values below 0 5 c in much of the oceanic zone of the domain increasing toward the cis reaching relative maximums of 1 3 c fig 4c the water mass distribution in the cis was evaluated seasonally with use of conductivity temperature depth data from fisheries development institute ifop oceanographic campaigns in chiloé in 2017 2018 and in aysén in 2018 2019 temperature salinity diagrams were prepared for these observations and mosa outputs in order to have seasonal hydrographic data on the study area these diagrams are useful to identify different water masses and to determine if the model can reproduce the large scale dynamics that govern the thermohaline structures in the area in general terms mosa can reproduce the observed thermohaline structures mainly in spring and summer fig 5 the greatest differences are observed in autumn we also observed that the model lacks low surface salinity values which is a major numerical challenge for modeling estuary systems the direction and speed of the currents were measured by an adcp deployed in the middle of the moraleda channel the instrument was set to record measurements in the first 65 m depth every 30 min during august and december of 2018 the data were broken down into orthogonal components transformed to hourly averages and integrated into the water column the axis of maximum variance in the mosa results shows a deviation of about 8 to the east with respect to the adcp measurements fig 6a in an area where currents on a north south axis predominate the model tends to overestimate the intensities of northward flows with slight adjustments to southward flows we also observed well defined spectral maximums in the diurnal and semidiurnal bands as well as frequencies close to 6 and 8 h in both the mosa measurements and the adcp measurements this highlights the importance of the tides in this area and the capacity of mosa to reproduce tidal phenomena adequately 3 2 integrated bf and pea the temporal evolution of the bf in the coastal area of the mosa domain was calculated with the hourly averaged monthly output from 2018 and integrated into the water column we observed a seasonal variability in bf with more stratification in summer than in winter fig 7 furthermore we observed low bfs in winter distributed homogeneously in the cis while there were more and less stratified areas in summer reflecting the spatial distribution of the bf in local terms the conditions in the reloncavíand comau fjords were respectively assimilated by the reloncavísound and the gulf of ancud in summer resulting in larger systems that remain stratified in the gulf of ancud the water column is well stratified only in summer while in reloncavísound it remains stratified throughout the year between autumn and mid spring the response of these systems to the mixing processes in the adjacent fjords is weak especially in the gulf of ancud and they become areas of high mixing in the guafo mouth a phase behavior is observed as happens in the moraleda channel the gulf of corcovado and the jacaf channel where there is a high degree of stratification in summer and weaker stratification between autumn and mid spring puyuhuapi fjord remains strongly stratified throughout the year with a minimum during winter the water column in the gulf of corcovado was highly mixed throughout the year giving rise to a highly homogeneous area that contrasts sharply with the variability observed in the northern and southern boundaries of the gulf of corcovado the annual cycle of the spatial distribution of the pea is similar to that of the bf patterns fig 8 preserving the characteristics of strong contrasts in summer and more homogeneity in winter nevertheless we observe some subtle differences in the guafo mouth and the moraleda channel compared with the bf distribution bfs in the guafo mouth begin to decrease gradually in april while pea values remain stable this situation is evident until october when both bfs and pea values begin to increase the situation is similar in the moraleda channel in june and september when stratification decreases and pea values remain stable in the fjord region we found a maximum value of 340 jm 3 and an annual average of 300 jm 3 the differences between the bf and pea can account for a water column that although weakly stratified resists mixing the stratification and mixing variability inside the cis can be summarized by at least three well defined zones permanent mixing regions permanent stratification regions and seasonal stratification regions in the last two cases the stratification strength also exhibits differences 3 3 the gradient richardson number and ocean stratification by salinity a focus on local aspects is required because of the heterogeneous seasonal variability of the density fronts different locations in the cis were selected to evaluate the stability of the water column and the tendency for turbulent mixing based on the spatial and temporal bf and pea distributions hourly r i profiles in the reloncavi fjord the gulf of ancud the gulf of corcovado the guafo mouth the moraleda channel northern part and the puyuhuapi fjord fig 1 were calculated the minimal critical r i values 0 25 in the reloncavíand puyuhuapi fjords indicate favorable conditions for a well stratified water column over much of the year fig 9a f the r i values in the gulf of ancud and the moraleda channel indicate a water column favorable to turbulent mixing in winter and stratification in summer fig 9b e the development of a surface layer with persistently critical values throughout the year is evident in the gulf of ancud this layer exhibits three relatively well defined periods it is concentrated in the first 5 m depth in winter deepens to approximately 30 m in autumn and reaches a maximum depth of approximately 80 m in winter and into the spring r i values in the moraleda channel vary seasonally as they do in the gulf of ancud with conditions in the water column favorable to turbulent mixing down to a depth of 90 m we observed an area in the gulf of corcovado with turbulent mixing throughout the year with periodic events in which the entire water column is subject to turbulent mixing fig 9c in the guafo mouth there is a mixed condition up to a depth of 30 m with favorable conditions for turbulent mixing permanently in winter and sporadically during the other seasons fig 9d however the r i values in the rest of the water column are greater than 0 25 indicating a fragile and potentially turbulent water column we calculated n 2 s at the same locations as used for calculating the bf in the first 100 m depth positive n 2 s values indicate the effect of salinity on stratification we observed maximum values at the surface of the reloncavífjord throughout the year fig 10a indicating how salinity governs mixing and stratification in the surface layer of the fjord which inhibits turbulent mixing in the surface layers the latter is consistent with the observed r i values meanwhile there is a layer around the pycnocline in the gulf of ancud the depth of which changes seasonally with positive differences that deepen the layer in winter and negative differences in summer fig 10b salinity has no contribution to the development of thermohaline structures in the gulf of corcovado given that n 2 s values in this area are close to zero fig 10c furthermore we observed that salinity began to play a greater role in stratification in the guafo mouth in the summer which decreased in autumn fig 10d seasonal variability in the moraleda channel was similar to what was observed in the gulf of ancud in terms of bf and r i values with the difference being the influence of salinity increased only in summer and in deeper layers with negative values at the surface in summer fig 10e the highest n 2 s values in the puyuhuapi fjord are related to critical r i values and are found below the surface layer with maximum values in winter fig 10f 4 discussion an operational model was used to provide a regional perspective of the seasonal variability of stratification and mixing patterns in the cis mosa provides new knowledge of the dynamical processes with different temporal resolution scales such as yearly and seasonal our results show an expansion of salinity fronts inside the cis leading to stable conditions that remain during the spring summer period during the autumn winter period the salinity fronts move toward the coast and mixing conditions dominate saldías et al 2019 the key role of salinity on the stratification and its capacity to inhibit mixing in the water column were also analyzed 4 1 operational model mosa the mosa salinity assessments are considered satisfactory although the model overestimates low salinity values at the surface to improve these values it is necessary to add new point sources of fresh water but it must be done with great care in order to avoid possible stability problems in the model nevertheless the seasonal variability of salinity and temperature are consistent with the observations we notice high correlations with sea surface temperature satellite data the dispersion of the orthogonal current components and energy rotatory spectra shows a good adjustment between the adcp data and the mosa model in the moraleda channel previous evaluations of sea level not shown exhibit that mosa is capable of reproducing the larger amplitudes of the tidal range in the northern section over 7 m in reloncavísound in contrast with the tidal range in the guafo mouth 2 m given the limited spatial and temporal coverage of observations and studies of the cis mosa is a valuable alternative to study the oceanographic processes of the region for example olivares et al 2015 used a model configuration similar to mosa with an old version of the grid to establish sanitary boundaries for salmon farms in the context of infectious salmon anemia virus herrera et al 2018 used this grid to feed a large eddy simulation model and study the effect of salmon cages on local oceanic circulation artal et al 2019 used a barotropic model with the same grid and bathymetry as mosa to assess tidal energy in the cis during spring and neap tides currently the mosa results are being used for different environmental studies in the area the application of mosa in the cis represents a valuable and unprecedented initiative that attempts to approximate a broad range of processes present at different temporal and spatial scales mosa is under constant development as a result of improvements in numerical computing systems data assimilation techniques and the resolution of satellite products the oceanographic forecasts provided by mosa available from the chonos website http chonos ifop cl are tools for coastal management and for understanding physical biological processes in the region on different spatial and temporal scales 4 2 seasonal variability of stratification and mixing in the cis the study of large scale dynamic patterns has been difficult because of the complex bathymetry of the cis rodrigo 2006 and because of the lack of observational data for long periods models can be useful to achieve a major spatial and temporal coverage however the persistence throughout the year of freshwater in the surface layer driving estuarine circulation through the development of horizontal salinity gradients geyer 2010 introduces a new challenge for the modeling as previously presented mosa proved to be able to develop the temperature and salinity seasonal variability which allows us to study the evolution of the mass field and how this modifies the stratification and mixing patterns the representation of the degrees of monthly stratification of the system obtained with the bf and pea points to a highly dynamic cis narváez et al 2019 described the presence of heterogeneous patterns on distinct spatial and temporal scales in the cis associated with large scale processes generated in the pacific ocean these patterns were also observed in the analyses of the bf fig 7 and pea fig 8 obtained from mosa one of the mechanisms is the warm water surface intrusion from the equator in spring and summer which modifies the entire coastal region outside the cis however interior regions of the cis disconnected from the open sea show gradual increases at the same time especially in the reloncavi sound and the moraleda channel revealing a strong local influence concurrently low surface salinity moves high buoyancy fronts from coastal regions toward the cis in spring and summer dominated by the discharge of glacial meltwater and the high levels of rainfall pickard 1971 chuecas et al 1980 neshyba and fonseca 1980 dávila et al 2002 calvete and sobarzo 2011 saldías et al 2019 the patterns of surface salinity and surface temperature emphasize the importance and implications of these processes throughout the year in the development of stratification and mixing regimes on the basis of our bf results we divided the system into three classifications of stratification and mixing regimes that concur with the findings of other studies of the area these are as follows a regimes with high levels of seasonal variability such as those in the gulf of ancud the moraleda channel pérez santos et al 2014 and to a lesser degree the guafo mouth water column stratification in this area responds to equilibrium between mixing forces and buoyancy forces as a result of the drainage of brackish water toward the guafo mouth calvete and sobarzo 2011 b a strong mixing regime throughout the year as shown in the gulf of corcovado strub et al 2019 which in winter expands spatially to the gulf of ancud in the north and to the moraleda channel and the guafo mouth in the south leading to a large homogeneous system c a regime of high stratification throughout the year with little seasonal variability subject to the upper levels can be observed in continental fjords such as the reloncavífjord castillo et al 2012 2016 and the puyuhuapi fjord calvete and sobarzo 2011 schneider et al 2014 monthly pea maps help in quantifying the level of stratification in terms of energy and temporal variability while the pea patterns look similar to those of the bf there are subtle differences in the guafo mouth and moraleda channel accounting for processes that may drive the development of highly energetic surface mixing layers calvete and sobarzo 2011 calculated the spatial distribution of the pea in the southern part of the cis using observations from oceanographic cruises in different seasons of the year the measurements of calvete and sobarzo 2011 and the mosa outputs showed that the intensity and spatial extension of the density front dominated by the pea have seasonality variability consistent with bfs they also showed that the highest pea values in the puyuhuapi and aysén fjords coincided as a result of their proximity to large rivers mosa also reproduced this pattern but with average maximum values approximately 100 jm 3 below those observations however calvete and sobarzo 2011 found low and homogeneous pea values throughout the year in the moraleda channel in contrast to mosa which showed a high degree of seasonality with higher values in summer we did not establish the source of these differences in this work which is a question that should be addressed in future studies 4 3 mixing and salinity role bfs and pea values obtained from mosa permit visualization of the displacement of density fronts on a seasonal scale our results show a strong local influence of salinity in some areas although also a strong gradient of surface temperature is observed in the cis during spring and summer silva et al 2009 saldías et al 2019 narváez et al 2019 furthermore the well known effect of the wind driven flow could affect vertical thermohaline structures allowing a three layer residual circulation valle levinson et al 2014 the richardson number was calculated at different virtual stations throughout the cis to assess the stability of the patterns observed and their sensitivity to kinetic forcing each virtual station represents a regime previously described at those same points we used the method described by maes 2008 to isolate the effect of salinity over bf as a measure of the contribution of salinity to the stratification in general terms the r i values confirm a seasonal variability of wind driven flow that alters the ocean surface layer in the area the impact of which can be attenuated by local factors such as salinity saldías et al 2019 and the complex bathymetry rodrigo 2006 strongly stratified structures are dominant throughout the year in the reloncavífjord with not significant r i values and high levels of n 2 s close to the pycnocline the situation is somewhat similar in the puyuhuapi fjord with the difference that r i values show a mixing layer confined to the first few meters of depth that may be dominated by winds in winter in this case this could be an effect of the limited role of salinity in stabilizing the thermocline depth yielding the influence of wind in winter this can be attributed to differences in winter of the mean flow between the puelo river 650 m 3 s 1 and the cisnes river 280 m 3 s 1 http www dga cl in the high energy area of the gulf of corcovado the combined effects of bathymetry and wind give rise to a water column that remains highly mixed throughout the year although it is surrounded by estuarine areas that are not capable of modifying their structures critical values of r i were observed throughout the water column while calculations of n 2 s show the null influence of salinity in this area winds seem to have a strong impact on weak thermohaline structures that appear in spring and summer since salinity generates a slight degree of stratification where the influence of the palena river plume is notable mean flow of approximately 800 m 3 s 1 http www dga cl it is remarkable how a small contribution of salinity restricts depth of r i critical values and acts as strong controller of mixing in these areas in regions with a seasonal variability of stratification such as the gulf of ancud and the moraleda channel we found a strong influence of wind driven flow in winter while salinity appears to be the motor of pycnocline stability between autumn and spring in the gulf of ancud however negative n 2 s values appear in summer in the gulf of ancud and in the first few meters of depth in the moraleda channel indicating situations where salinity will contribute to instability maes 2008 this could also mean a potential contribution of temperature in the development of stratification in the case of the gulf of ancud freshwater from the puelo river and the comau fjord contributes to the creation of a integrate stable system in summer but as summer ends the amount of freshwater decreases while the temperature remains the same there is a similar scenario in the moraleda channel which is affected by a freshwater plume from the palena river these issues will be subjects of future studies estuary systems throughout the world show complexity of mixing processes due to the spatial and temporal variability of the remote or local forces involved in the fjord and channel system of british columbia in canada strong tidal currents connect the ocean with the interior zone through the juan de fuca strait and over a series of sills through the haro and rosario straits where there is intense mixing of tides with surface freshwater from the strait of georgia soontiens and allen 2017 this significant tide induced mixing in the water column produces a marked fortnightly modulation in the estuarine circulation griffin and leblond 1990 leblond et al 1994 masson and cummins 2000 at deeper areas and in rivers such as in the strait of georgia the stratification is strong and varies according to river seasonality masson and cummins 2004 so the salinity distribution is determined mainly by river runoff and vertical mixing by tides li et al 1999 with less effect of the local wind masson and cummins 2004 changes in stratification due to seasonality in river discharge are significant in places with large rivers in the bay of bengal the intense freshwater flow from the indian summer monsoon generates a strong stratification of salinity causing a shallow and robust mixing layer li et al 2017 jana et al 2018 in general wind has been considered as a source of kinetic energy that promotes mixing eliminating the stratification of the surface layer and deepening the pycnocline this is significant in regions where low pressure atmospheric systems allow the action of intense winds garreaud et al 2013 a recent study in the puyuhuapi fjord based on observational data and numerical models indicates that mixing in the fjord is strongly related to wind variability pinilla et al 2020 the relatively stable atmospheric conditions associated with the pacific anticyclone dominate in spring and summer reducing the influence of westerly winds weaker winds in turn reduce wind driven mixing by increasing stratification in contrast in autumn and winter the westerly drift drives relatively more intense winds increasing the mixing in the upper layer pinilla et al 2020 this study describes a large scale estuary system that is highly heterogeneous in summer and in which the combination of local and remote forcing is beneficial for the development of a high degree of stratification salinity is the main restorative force acting on the stability of the water column in this system stratification gradually weakens in much of the system toward autumn and at the beginning of spring resulting in a more homogeneous and largely mixed system nevertheless continental fjords remain stratified throughout the year future studies should explore interannual variability of cis mixing and stratification patterns using mosa based climatological models finally the use of n 2 s has proved useful in showing the influence and strength of salinity in the construction of stratified vertical structures these values along with r i calculation provide a simple way to identify how salinity and wind driven flow compete in the development of stratification and mixing regimes 5 conclusions we present an operational oceanographic model for southern austral chile mosa this operational system provides daily environmental information with a 72 h projection of physical variables such as temperature salinity sea level and marine currents development of mosa began in 2015 and it has remained operational since then the results for this system are freely available from the chonos website http chonos ifop cl where visitors can view the forecasts generated over the previous 7 days using spatial maps time series profiles and transects these numerical results can be used to understand estuarine dynamics and coastal circulation in the cis region we also describe a method to study the stability of the water column based on the bf in different parts of the cis in 2018 our results allow us to characterize the cis in three main zones seasonal stratification regions permanent stratification regions and permanent mixing regions in the first case strongly seasonal bf and r i patterns were evident in the gulf of ancud with the system being highly stratified in summer and highly mixed in winter with a surface layer favorable to turbulent mixing although governed by salinity in the pycnocline the moraleda channel could be in this category because it has a similar mechanism the second case corresponds to a fjord system such as the reloncavíand puyuhuapi fjords where the salinity can inhibit mixing representing a surface barrier to the exchange of properties the capacity of salinity to inhibit turbulent mixing in the puyuhuapi fjord was limited at the surface layer with critical r i values at that level but below that was a strongly stratified layer in the reloncavi fjord salinity has total control of mixing the third case permanent mixing regions is exemplified by the gulf of corcovado where turbulent mixing was dominant throughout the year but in the guafo mouth a sufficient level of mixing fails to develop even in the presence of low salinity although there is always stratification in the guafo mouth it is weak with slight seasonality while there is enough energy to sustain mixing in the water column in the autumn months this suggests that the control that salinity exercises over stratification can decrease n 2 s values along with r i calculation can provide a simple way to identify how salinity and wind driven flow compete in the development of stratification and mixing regimes credit authorship contribution statement cristian
