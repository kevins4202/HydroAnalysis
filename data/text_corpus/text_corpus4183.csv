20915,previous investigations on composite materials are most based on uniform beam while solid shape of foils are usually used in ocean and marine industries to better predict the modal characteristics of composite solid foils this paper modifies analytical model based on anisotropic thin walled closed section beam theory and investigates free vibration characteristics of the composite naca0009 foil with different ply angles θ good agreement has been obtained between the predicted natural frequencies and those simulated by finite element method due to the non coincidence of the shear center and mass center the natural frequencies are not the same at opposite ply angles the modal shapes illustrate the coupling of bending and torsion modes at different ply angles for the first mode the modal shapes are mainly the first bending with first torsion shape coupled at different ply angles when θ 10 the first torsion plays a key role in the second modal shapes while when θ 10 the main modal shapes of the second mode is changing to the second bending shape compared the results with and without coupling effects considered the variation of natural frequencies may related to the change of modal shapes by mode decomposition it is shown that the percentages of uncoupling bending shapes and torsion shapes on each modal shapes with different ply angles keywords composite

stiffness to weight ratio excellent fatigue properties and reduced magnetic electric signatures arif et al 2017 sutherland 2018 jaen sola et al 2019 in aerospace field the composite materials have been applied in helicopter wing to reduce vibration and loads kumar et al 2018 the x 29a plane utilizes swept forward composite wings to control divergence and reduce bending moments near the wing root by passive deformation krone 1975 in early applications of marine industry composite materials are applied to superstructures masts or decks to reduce weight mouritz et al 2001 recently the composite material has been focused to replace metallic propellers as it can improve the performance and fuel efficiency by passive deformation of composite materials at off design conditions young et al 2016 maljaars et al 2018 kapuria and das 2018 as the corresponding deformation of composite materials is larger than that of metal the fluid structure interaction will be more significant wu et al 2018a especially in water it becomes more complex because of the different fluid properties and varying harsh marine environment spatially and temporally with cavitation lelong et al 2018 wu et al 2015 2018b müller et al 2017 therefore it s important to predict accurately the vibration characteristics of composite materials applied in marine industry as for the outstanding designability of the composite materials many researchers have investigated the effect of material design variables on the deformation and vibration characteristics of structures kramer et al 2013 conducted the modal analyses of composite plates in air and water with finite element method fem the results showed that the wet to dry frequency ratios vary with fiber angles and a crossover behavior is observed for some modal shapes zarruk et al 2014 experimentally compared composite hydrofoils with two ply angles and found that with 30 ply angle has negative twist angle under hydrodynamic forces zhang et al 2018 numerically investigated the hydrodynamic forces and deformation of composite hydrofoils with different ply angles and found that the twist angle plays a significant role in lift and drag coefficients he et al 2012 optimized the ply angles and stack sequences of composite marine propellers to reduce hub loads with unsteady wake by hydroelasticity method the structural model in above references are all based on fem with 3 d solid elements besides those blasques et al 2010 applied shell elements in fem to model composite marine propeller jones 1975 derived classical laminate theory clt based on kirchhoff assumption and got natural frequencies of laminate at certain boundaries by analytical solutions weisshaar weisshaar and foist 1985 got the relationships between force and deformation for three kind of composite beam structures by clt and analyzed the effect of ply angle upon the first three natural frequencies of a laminated beam armanios and badir 1995 derived the equations of motion of anisotropic thin walled closed section beam by a variational asymptotic approach and hamilton s principle hong and chopra 1985 analyzed aeroelastic stability of a composite rotor blade by finite element method based on beam element and each element consists of two end nodes and three internal nodes minguet 1989 developed new model capable of modeling large deflections in beams and analyzed deflections and free vibration characteristics based on new model solved by finite difference iterative solution procedure shao et al 2017 analyzed free vibration of composite laminates beams by refined shear deformation beam theory and solved by method of reverberation ray matrix samaniego et al 2020 explored the possibility of using a deep neural networks based solver for partial differential equations and applied this method to several engineering problems zenzen et al 2020 has applied artifical neural network to predict natural frequencies and offer fast prediction of damage identification of composite beams with less the number of collected data and higher accuracy to overcome the challenge of performing optimization with respect to large number of design variables and offer simple fluid structure interaction method during the preliminary design of composite structure the beam theory is a better choice however it should be noted that the objects with beam theory in above references are all composite plates with uniform thickness along width or chord which is not reasonable for marine industry where the sections of propeller are usually solid foil shapes thus the objectives of this paper are to apply modified analytical model on composite solid foils based on anisotropic thin walled closed section beam theory and analyze the free vibration characteristics of a composite naca0009 foil which is one usually used section in propellers with different ply angles based on analytical model 2 physical and analytical models the geometry of the

material density the x a and z a are distance between mass center and shear center in x direction and z direction respectively in this paper one kind of composite material is used and the fiber angles remain identical for each ply the material properties and definition of ply angle θ are shown in table 1 and fig 2 respectively both the section and ply sequence are symmetrical about x axis so z a 0 m and x a 0 0051 m the value of x a is negative because the mass center is behind shear center banerjee 1989 then the stiffness matrix components eq 4 are simplified as c 12 c 13 c 24 c 34 0 c 11 a s

and torsion are coupled because of material bending twisting coupling effects and nonzero value of x a based on finite difference method fdm the equations of motion about torsion and bending are discretized as 10 m n n ψ n n n h 0 p n n ψ q n n h 0 where n is the discretized node numbers along spanwise y direction ψ and h are vectors of twist angle and deformations about z axis in discretized nodes respectively m n p and q are all coefficient matrices whose components can be got from eq 9 and boundary conditions banerjee 2001 the detailed information about coefficient matrices can be seen in appendix a the eq 10 can also be written as 11 m n p q ψ η 0 as the ψ and h are non zero vectors the determinant of new coefficients matrix should be zero thus a range of ω values are substituted into the coefficients matrices to get determinants and the mode frequencies ω n can be obtained when the sign of determinants is changed then substitute ω n into eq 10 and delete last row of coefficients matrix then h n is chosen to be the unity and terms relating to h n are taken to right hand side the vector h and ψ can be solved 3 free vibration characteristics with different ply angles 3 1 natural frequencies of composite foils to verify the analytical model the fem has also been applied to predict the natural frequencies of the composite foil based on the acp and modal modules in ansys workbench the solid185 element is chosen to model the composite naca0009 foil as shown in fig 3 the solid 185 layered structural element is defined by eight nodes where three degrees of freedom are assigned at each node the convergence study of analytical model and fem has been studied is illustrated in table 2 where the first natural frequencies are solved with two ply angles and five node numbers n in spanwise direction for fem the number of elements in every section keeps a constant value 142 according to table 2 the selected node numbers of analytical model n 51 and the node numbers of fem n 101 for investigations in this paper fig 4 shows natural frequencies of composite foils about the first three bending torsion coupling modes with different ply angles the mode sequences are arranged based on the frequencies to verify the method the analytical results shown in solid lines are compared with those solved by fem in ansys based on solid elements which are shown in points according to fig 4 the analytical results solved by fdm show good agreement with the results by fem for different ply angles the differences are mainly located in the mode3 with negative ply angles and the maximum error is 10 6 at ply angle θ 15 which may be because the shear deformation is not considered within the beam theory it s also obvious that the frequencies of the first three modes have one two and three peaks with different ply angles respectively and any of curves for different modes are not symmetrical about zero ply angle which is due to the nonzero value of x a to investigate the peaks of natural frequencies fig 4 also shows the natural frequencies solved with the uncoupling theory by the ei and gj of local ply angles without considering k and x a which are shown in dashed lines the cross coupling parameter φ k e i g j representing the strength of coupling effects weisshaar and foist 1985 are also shown in the dash doted line from fig 4 the uncoupling bending and torsion modes have one and two peaks with different ply angles respectively which is due to the change of stiffness and the cross coupling parameter has larger absolute values in symmetrical regions from 10 to 30 and from 10 to 30 compared the number of peaks obtained from mode 2 and that from the uncoupling first torsion mode the peaks of mode 2 may relate to the torsion mode similarly those of mode 3 may dependent on both the bending and torsion modes which suggests the variation of modal shapes with different ply angles 3 2 modal shapes of composite foils to further illustrate the variation of coupling modal shapes fig 5 shows the uncoupling bending and torsion modal shapes with h and ψ set unity at tip and are dimensionless by s and s c for the first bending and torsion modes the modal shapes are both monotonous from base to tip in spanwise direction the second bending mode has one extreme point near middle of span while that of the second torsion mode locates at about 0 35s from base to study the relationship between natural frequencies and modal shapes fig 6 shows the first three modal shapes of the composite foil at θ 0 and θ 90 where the coupling stiffness k equals zero and the coupling effects only result from x ɑ it can be seen that all the modal shapes are not exactly same as those shown in fig 5 this may be due to that fact the modal shapes of the composite foils are the combination of the uncoupling modal shapes combined with fig 5 for the foil with the ply angle θ 0 the first mode is the first bending mode with slight first torsion coupled the second and third modes are the first torsion coupled with the first bending and the second bending coupled with the second torsion modes respectively as for θ 90 the first mode is similar as that with θ 0 while the second main modal shape varies from the first torsion mode to the second bending mode and the third modal shape at θ 90 is the first torsion mode with the second bending mode coupled thus it s reasonable to speculate that the frequency peaks as shown in fig 3 are dependent on the variation of modal shapes fig 7 shows the variation of the first modal shapes with different ply angles compared the foils with same absolute value of ply angles but opposite direction the torsion shapes are inverse caused by opposite ϕ but due to the nonzero of x ɑ the shapes of ψ are asymmetry compare the first modal shapes with those predicted by uncoupling theory seen in fig 5 the first mode is mainly related to the first bending mode coupled with different strength of the first torsion mode this is due to the variation of stiffness and also the strength of coupling effects as illustrated in fig 4 especially at 15 and 30 where the dimensions of ψ are more two times than that at zero ply angle fig 8 focuses on the second and third modal shapes of the composite foil from 5 to 30 and from 5 to 30 as illustrated in fig 8 when the ply angle θ 10 as shown in fig 7 a and b the main modal shapes of second mode are similar with the uncoupling first torsion shape as shown in fig 5 and the corresponding frequencies are also close to the uncoupling first torsion natural frequencies at same ply angles as illustrated in fig 4 while when the ply angle θ 10 the second modal shapes are bending modes with torsion coupled and the absolute amplitude of torsion shapes decreases with θ increasing in which the frequencies of bending modes descend so the frequencies of the second mode get peaks at about θ 10 seen in fig 4 due to the non zero value of x ɑ the trend is asymmetry about θ 0 as for the third modes shown in fig 8 the main modal shapes change from the second bending mode seen in fig 8 a d to the first torsion mode seen in fig 8 e j gradually when θ 10 the first torsion mode plays a key role thus the two peaks of the third natural frequency with ply angle θ 25 are corresponding to the peaks of the first torsion mode predicted without considering the coupling effects as shown in fig 4 while the peak of the third natural frequency with ply angle θ 0 is related to that of the second bending mode without coupling effects based on analyses above the modal shapes will be coupled at certain ply angles it may be dangerous for operation of composite structures with flow induced vibration so it s necessary to give the contribution of uncoupling modal shapes on coupled modal shapes quantitatively which can be investigated by mode decomposition method providing that the bending and torsion shapes are combination of uncoupling bending and torsion shapes respectively as shown below 12 h a i 1 w a i h u i a n d ψ a i 1 w b i ψ u i where a means the order of modal shape w means the number of chosen uncoupling modes here w 4 h u i and ψ u i mean the ith uncoupling bending and torsion modal shapes respectively ai and bi are coefficients of corresponding uncoupling bending and torsion modes respectively which can be calculated by dot product between modal shapes and corresponding uncoupling modes then the percentages of each uncoupling modes are calculated as 13 p i b e n d i n g a i i 1 w a i a n d p i t o r s i o n b i i 1 w b i fig 9 and fig 10 show the percentages of the uncoupling first three bending and torsion modes in the second and third modal shapes respectively according to fig 9 a the main contribution in the bending shapes of the second modal is changing from the first bending to the second bending with the increase of θ the slight asymmetry between opposite ply angles is due to the nonzero value of x ɑ according to fig 9 b the first torsion is almost dominant for different ply angles except for the ply angles between θ 55 and θ 75 where the percentages of the second torsion rising with the θ increasing is larger than that of the first torsion while when ply angle is between about θ 75 and θ 55 the percentages of the second torsion decrease along the increase of θ from fig 4 the cross coupling parameter ϕ are so small at these regions that the coupling effects of ϕ and x a are comparative and the ϕ have opposite values at opposite ply angles which lead to the different trend from fig 10 b the main torsion shapes change from the second torsion shape to the first torsion with the increase of θ as illustrated in fig 10 a when ply angle is between θ 45 and θ 15 the dominant bending shapes in the third mode is the second bending as for other ply angles the first bending mode has larger percentages 4 conclusions and future work the analytical model for composite solid foils has been developed based on the anisotropic thin walled closed section beam theory the natural frequencies and modal shapes of composite naca0009 foils with different ply angles are presented and compared with the results with uncoupling theory illustrating the coupling effects of composite foils the main conclusions are as below 1 good agreement has been obtained between the predicted natural frequencies of composite foils with different ply angles θ and those simulated by finite element method with solid elements due to the non coincidence of the shear center and mass center the natural frequencies are not same at opposite ply angles 2 compared natural frequencies with and without coupling effects considered the variation of natural frequencies may related to the variation of modal shapes the modal shapes at different ply angles indicate the bending twisting coupling effects of composite material for the first mode the modal shapes are mainly the first bending with different strength of the first torsion shape coupled at different ply angles as for the second mode when θ 10 the first torsion plays a key role in the second modal shapes where the coupling effects are weak the natural frequencies of second mode are closer to the frequencies of uncoupling first torsion mode while when θ 10 the main modal shapes of the second mode start changing to bending modes the corresponding natural frequencies are also gradually closer to those of second bending mode which decreases with increase of θ thus natural frequencies of second mode show two peaks the trend of the third modal shapes is opposite to that of the second mode at θ 0 the main modal shape is second bending so that natural frequencies of third mode have same peak with uncoupling second bending when θ 10 because the main modal shapes of the third mode are torsion mode the peaks of uncoupling first torsion are also observed in the third mode the peaks of uncoupling modes are due to the change of stiffness with different ply angles 3 by mode decomposition it is captured quantitatively that the percentages of uncoupling bending shapes and torsion shapes on each modal shapes with different ply angles according to these percentages the main contribution in the bending shapes of the second mode is changing from the first bending to the second bending with the increase of θ the first torsion is almost dominant for the second mode with different ply angles except for the ply angles between θ 55 and θ 75 instead of the second torsion as for the third mode the main torsion shapes change from the second torsion shape to the first torsion with the increase of θ and the dominant bending shapes are the second bending when the ply angle is between θ 45 and θ 15 and the first bending for other ply angles in this paper the maximum error is 10 6 due to shear deformation without considered on the analytical model in the future the beam or plate model with shear deformation

al 2016 maljaars et al 2018 kapuria and das 2018 as the corresponding deformation of composite materials is larger than that of metal the fluid structure interaction will be more significant wu et al

of damage identification of composite beams with less the number of collected data and higher accuracy to overcome the challenge of performing optimization with respect to large number of design variables and offer simple fluid structure interaction method during the preliminary design of composite structure the beam theory is a better choice however it should be noted that the objects with beam theory in above references are all composite plates with uniform thickness along width or chord which is not reasonable for marine industry where the sections of propeller are usually solid foil shapes thus the objectives of this paper are to apply modified analytical model on composite solid foils based on anisotropic thin walled closed section beam theory and analyze the free vibration characteristics of a composite naca0009 foil which is one usually used section in propellers with different ply angles based on analytical model 2 physical and analytical models the geometry of the

material density the x a and z a are distance between mass center and shear center in x direction and z direction respectively in this paper one kind of composite material is used and the fiber angles remain identical for each ply the material properties and definition of ply angle θ are shown in table 1 and fig 2 respectively both the section and ply sequence are symmetrical about x axis so z a 0 m and x a 0 0051 m the value of x a is negative because the mass center is behind shear center banerjee 1989 then the stiffness matrix components eq 4 are simplified as c 12 c 13 c 24 c 34 0 c 11 a s

and torsion are coupled because of material bending twisting coupling effects and nonzero value of x a based on finite difference method fdm the equations of motion about torsion and bending are discretized as 10 m n n ψ n n n h 0 p n n ψ q n n h 0 where n is the discretized node numbers along spanwise y direction ψ and h are vectors of twist angle and deformations about z axis in discretized nodes respectively m n p and q are all coefficient matrices whose components can be got from eq 9 and boundary conditions banerjee 2001 the detailed information about coefficient matrices can be seen in appendix a the eq 10 can also be written as 11 m n p q ψ η 0 as the ψ and h are non zero vectors the determinant of new coefficients matrix should be zero thus a range of ω values are substituted into the coefficients matrices to get determinants and the mode frequencies ω n can be obtained when the sign of determinants is changed then substitute ω n into eq 10 and delete last row of coefficients matrix then h n is chosen to be the unity and terms relating to h n are taken to right hand side the vector h and ψ can be solved 3 free vibration characteristics with different ply angles 3 1 natural frequencies of composite foils to verify the analytical model the fem has also been applied to predict the natural frequencies of the composite foil based on the acp and modal modules in ansys workbench the solid185 element is chosen to model the composite naca0009 foil as shown in fig 3 the solid 185 layered structural element is defined by eight nodes where three degrees of freedom are assigned at each node the convergence study of analytical model and fem has been studied is illustrated in table 2 where the first natural frequencies are solved with two ply angles and five node numbers n in spanwise direction for fem the number of elements in every section keeps a constant value 142 according to table 2 the selected node numbers of analytical model n 51 and the node numbers of fem n 101 for investigations in this paper fig 4 shows natural frequencies of composite foils about the first three bending torsion coupling modes with different ply angles the mode sequences are arranged based on the frequencies to verify the method the analytical results shown in solid lines are compared with those solved by fem in ansys based on solid elements which are shown in points according to fig 4 the analytical results solved by fdm show good agreement with the results by fem for different ply angles the differences are mainly located in the mode3 with negative ply angles and the maximum error is 10 6 at ply angle θ 15 which may be because the shear deformation is not considered within the beam theory it s also obvious that the frequencies of the first three modes have one two and three peaks with different ply angles respectively and any of curves for different modes are not symmetrical about zero ply angle which is due to the nonzero value of x a to investigate the peaks of natural frequencies fig 4 also shows the natural frequencies solved with the uncoupling theory by the ei and gj of local ply angles without considering k and x a which are shown in dashed lines the cross coupling parameter φ k e i g j representing the strength of coupling effects weisshaar and foist 1985 are also shown in the dash doted line from fig 4 the uncoupling bending and torsion modes have one and two peaks with different ply angles respectively which is due to the change of stiffness and the cross coupling parameter has larger absolute values in symmetrical regions from 10 to 30 and from 10 to 30 compared the number of peaks obtained from mode 2 and that from the uncoupling first torsion mode the peaks of mode 2 may relate to the torsion mode similarly those of mode 3 may dependent on both the bending and torsion modes which suggests the variation of modal shapes with different ply angles 3 2 modal shapes of composite foils to further illustrate the variation of coupling modal shapes fig 5 shows the uncoupling bending and torsion modal shapes with h and ψ set unity at tip and are dimensionless by s and s c for the first bending and torsion modes the modal shapes are both monotonous from base to tip in spanwise direction the second bending mode has one extreme point near middle of span while that of the second torsion mode locates at about 0 35s from base to study the relationship between natural frequencies and modal shapes fig 6 shows the first three modal shapes of the composite foil at θ 0 and θ 90 where the coupling stiffness k equals zero and the coupling effects only result from x ɑ it can be seen that all the modal shapes are not exactly same as those shown in fig 5 this may be due to that fact the modal shapes of the composite foils are the combination of the uncoupling modal shapes combined with fig 5 for the foil with the ply angle θ 0 the first mode is the first bending mode with slight first torsion coupled the second and third modes are the first torsion coupled with the first bending and the second bending coupled with the second torsion modes respectively as for θ 90 the first mode is similar as that with θ 0 while the second main modal shape varies from the first torsion mode to the second bending mode and the third modal shape at θ 90 is the first torsion mode with the second bending mode coupled thus it s reasonable to speculate that the frequency peaks as shown in fig 3 are dependent on the variation of modal shapes fig 7 shows the variation of the first modal shapes with different ply angles compared the foils with same absolute value of ply angles but opposite direction the torsion shapes are inverse caused by opposite ϕ but due to the nonzero of x ɑ the shapes of ψ are asymmetry compare the first modal shapes with those predicted by uncoupling theory seen in fig 5 the first mode is mainly related to the first bending mode coupled with different strength of the first torsion mode this is due to the variation of stiffness and also the strength of coupling effects as illustrated in fig 4 especially at 15 and 30 where the dimensions of ψ are more two times than that at zero ply angle fig 8 focuses on the second and third modal shapes of the composite foil from 5 to 30 and from 5 to 30 as illustrated in fig 8 when the ply angle θ 10 as shown in fig 7 a and b the main modal shapes of second mode are similar with the uncoupling first torsion shape as shown in fig 5 and the corresponding frequencies are also close to the uncoupling first torsion natural frequencies at same ply angles as illustrated in fig 4 while when the ply angle θ 10 the second modal shapes are bending modes with torsion coupled and the absolute amplitude of torsion shapes decreases with θ increasing in which the frequencies of bending modes descend so the frequencies of the second mode get peaks at about θ 10 seen in fig 4 due to the non zero value of x ɑ the trend is asymmetry about θ 0 as for the third modes shown in fig 8 the main modal shapes change from the second bending mode seen in fig 8 a d to the first torsion mode seen in fig 8 e j gradually when θ 10 the first torsion mode plays a key role thus the two peaks of the third natural frequency with ply angle θ 25 are corresponding to the peaks of the first torsion mode predicted without considering the coupling effects as shown in fig 4 while the peak of the third natural frequency with ply angle θ 0 is related to that of the second bending mode without coupling effects based on analyses above the modal shapes will be coupled at certain ply angles it may be dangerous for operation of composite structures with flow induced vibration so it s necessary to give the contribution of uncoupling modal shapes on coupled modal shapes quantitatively which can be investigated by mode decomposition method providing that the bending and torsion shapes are combination of uncoupling bending and torsion shapes respectively as shown below 12 h a i 1 w a i h u i a n d ψ a i 1 w b i ψ u i where a means the order of modal shape w means the number of chosen uncoupling modes here w 4 h u i and ψ u i mean the ith uncoupling bending and torsion modal shapes respectively ai and bi are coefficients of corresponding uncoupling bending and torsion modes respectively which can be calculated by dot product between modal shapes and corresponding uncoupling modes then the percentages of each uncoupling modes are calculated as 13 p i b e n d i n g a i i 1 w a i a n d p i t o r s i o n b i i 1 w b i fig 9 and fig 10 show the percentages of the uncoupling first three bending and torsion modes in the second and third modal shapes respectively according to fig 9 a the main contribution in the bending shapes of the second modal is changing from the first bending to the second bending with the increase of θ the slight asymmetry between opposite ply angles is due to the nonzero value of x ɑ according to fig 9 b the first torsion is almost dominant for different ply angles except for the ply angles between θ 55 and θ 75 where the percentages of the second torsion rising with the θ increasing is larger than that of the first torsion while when ply angle is between about θ 75 and θ 55 the percentages of the second torsion decrease along the increase of θ from fig 4 the cross coupling parameter ϕ are so small at these regions that the coupling effects of ϕ and x a are comparative and the ϕ have opposite values at opposite ply angles which lead to the different trend from fig 10 b the main torsion shapes change from the second torsion shape to the first torsion with the increase of θ as illustrated in fig 10 a when ply angle is between θ 45 and θ 15 the dominant bending shapes in the third mode is the second bending as for other ply angles the first bending mode has larger percentages 4 conclusions and future work the analytical model for composite solid foils has been developed based on the anisotropic thin walled closed section beam theory the natural frequencies and modal shapes of composite naca0009 foils with different ply angles are presented and compared with the results with uncoupling theory illustrating the coupling effects of composite foils the main conclusions are as below 1 good agreement has been obtained between the predicted natural frequencies of composite foils with different ply angles θ and those simulated by finite element method with solid elements due to the non coincidence of the shear center and mass center the natural frequencies are not same at opposite ply angles 2 compared natural frequencies with and without coupling effects considered the variation of natural frequencies may related to the variation of modal shapes the modal shapes at different ply angles indicate the bending twisting coupling effects of composite material for the first mode the modal shapes are mainly the first bending with different strength of the first torsion shape coupled at different ply angles as for the second mode when θ 10 the first torsion plays a key role in the second modal shapes where the coupling effects are weak the natural frequencies of second mode are closer to the frequencies of uncoupling first torsion mode while when θ 10 the main modal shapes of the second mode start changing to bending modes the corresponding natural frequencies are also gradually closer to those of second bending mode which decreases with increase of θ thus natural frequencies of second mode show two peaks the trend of the third modal shapes is opposite to that of the second mode at θ 0 the main modal shape is second bending so that natural frequencies of third mode have same peak with uncoupling second bending when θ 10 because the main modal shapes of the third mode are torsion mode the peaks of uncoupling first torsion are also observed in the third mode the peaks of uncoupling modes are due to the change of stiffness with different ply angles 3 by mode decomposition it is captured quantitatively that the percentages of uncoupling bending shapes and torsion shapes on each modal shapes with different ply angles according to these percentages the main contribution in the bending shapes of the second mode is changing from the first bending to the second bending with the increase of θ the first torsion is almost dominant for the second mode with different ply angles except for the ply angles between θ 55 and θ 75 instead of the second torsion as for the third mode the main torsion shapes change from the second torsion shape to the first torsion with the increase of θ and the dominant bending shapes are the second bending when the ply angle is between θ 45 and θ 15 and the first bending for other ply angles in this paper the maximum error is 10 6 due to shear deformation without considered on the analytical model in the future the beam or plate model with shear deformation

20916,renewable energy resources are considered as alternative sources of energy for future generations wells turbines can be used to convert the reciprocating energy of waves in oceans and seas into rotational energy low aerodynamic efficiency is the main drawback of wells turbines the present study showed that the addition of the guide vanes endplate or end ring to the base blade significantly enhanced the performance of wells turbines also we used anfis ga cfd for optimization of the several design variables the blade tip thickness the blade form and the input output angels of guide vanes simultaneously therefore artificial neural fuzzy networks were used to forecast the three benchmark parameters pressure drop coefficient torque coefficient and efficiency and a genetic algorithm was utilized to approximate the optimized design variables when there are maximum torque maximum efficiency and minimum pressure drop the optimal blade increased the upper limit of efficiency up to 18

climate change challenges the status quo should be quickly changed into using renewable energy resources some policies have been made in china the european union eu and the us for a rapid decrease in co2 emissions in march 2007 the eu set a target of increasing the share of renewable energies to 20 by 2020 the danish government has recently proposed the target of 30 renewable energy for 2025 the wells turbine is a machine that can be used to harvest the ocean wave energy as a renewable source of energy attracting the attention of many scientists in the past decade nevertheless the low efficiency of the wells turbine which is affected by many factors still remains a major challenge to be addressed methods of increasing efficiency have been well addressed in literature nevertheless few studies have been conducted to optimize the wells turbine performance the turbine blade s shape is a design parameter that can be optimized to enhance efficiency and raise the output power lund and mathiesen 2009 raghunathan et al 1995 evaluated the islay wells turbine performance using simple prediction techniques and compared the results with the measurements the discrepancy of results was found to be associated with the rotor entry flow being far from uniform due to the potential separation at the hub the results suggested that streamlining of the flow at the rotor inlet and outlet can be used to optimize the turbine efficiency by deferring stalling phenomenon curran and gato 1997 investigated and compared different designs of the wells turbine in terms of the overall performance they found the largest part of the losses to be related to viscous losses in the rotors and specific operational ranges to be associated with the recovery techniques compared to a monoplane turbine with guide vanes the operational range of a contra rotating turbine was similar and its efficiency was at the peak while its damping ratio was much higher and its post stalling performance much more improved setoguchi et al 2001 used numerical simulations and model testing to examine the performance of a fixed guide vane impulse turbine and an impulse turbine with self pitch controlled guide vanes they compared the results with those associated with the wells turbine they found that the impulse turbine with self pitch controlled linked guide vanes outperforms the fixed guide vane impulse turbine which in turn outperforms the wells turbine for irregular flow rates hashem et al 2018 stated that water flow is preferred to air flow as a working fluid because the generated torque by water flow is more than airflow the efficiency of hydraulic wells turbine was less dependent on the shape of airfoil compared to the kind of the working fluid and the amount of solidity the pressure drop coefficient was almost constant for every flow coefficient webster and gato 1999 studied the impact of flow type and parameters of design on the efficiency and output power of the turbine the power received by the blade was found to be higher for the suction side attached flow higher values of torque and efficiency were also found to be associated with a backward swept blade over a wider range of operation cui et al 2019 stated that the grid density close to the airfoil and the amount of y play a significant role in the amount of numerical simulation errors moreover wells turbine efficiency is very dependent on mesh quality compared to the impulse turbine kim et al 2002 investigated how the wells turbine performance is affected by geometric parameters such as blade geometry the blade shape has also been modified to alter its performance and efficiency thakker et al 2005 improved the efficiency of an impulse turbine using guide vanes they also obtained hysteric characteristics with random and sinusoidal inlet flow conditions from the empirical findings of the turbine moreover they found the turbine performance to significantly improve during the inlet flow deceleration compared to the acceleration occurring in a half cycle of the sinusoidal wave naca0015 airfoil has several advantages for wells turbine blade compared to the other constant thickness airfoils shehata et al 2016 showed that naca0015 airfoil offers less global entropy generation rate and higher efficiency compared to the other constant thickness airfoils moreover naca0015 airfoil generates more torque and efficiency and lower pressure drop takao et al 2006 experimentally tested the model under steady flow conditions they found out that the wells turbine equipped with endplates has better characteristics than those of the original wells turbine and these characteristics depend on both the position and size of the endplates kumar and samad 2019 added a gurney flap to the airfoil they showed the gurney flap produced a vortex behind the trailing edge and increased blade loading lift torque and efficiency however it raised pressure drop when the flap height was less than 1 5 chord length also kumar et al 2019 stated that the relative average power and the relative operating range of wells turbine were increased by variable thickness blade and extended trailing edge blade however the average efficiency decreased due to an increase in pressure drop the solidity of guide vanes and the rotor has been proven to improve the pneumatic performance of air turbines significantly the effects of the solidity of guide vanes and blades on the operation of the wells turbine and impulse turbine have been reflected in many reports and articles as discussed elsewhere a summary of the impacts of both the blade profile and the rotor solidity on the performance of the wells turbine was provided in under unsteady unidirectional flow conditions thakker and abdulhadi 2007 taha et al 2011 showed that the tip clearance could significantly affect the turbine operation increasing the ratio of the tip clearance to the chord length lowered the turbine peak efficiency shifted it toward higher flow coefficients and widened the stalling margin they also investigated the flow field surrounding the turbine blades and found the tip leakage flow to constitute a deciding factor of the boundary layer separation later affecting the turbine stalling the tip leakage flow produced a vortex with both a positive and a negative effect on the performance of the turbine taha et al taha and sugiyonosawada 2010 investigated the leakage flow from the blade tips as well as its effects on the turbine output with either a non uniform or uniform tip clearance halder et al 2018 investigated the role of the grooved casing sweep of the blade the accelerating flow and the decelerating flow in the wells turbine efficiency they proved the grooved casing increased the efficiency and decreased the flow separation moreover they showed that the separation phenomenon in the accelerating flow occurred more than the decelerating flow and the unsteady flow is largely dependent upon the amount of groove in comparison with the change of the blade thickness and blade profile mohamed and shaaban 2014 explored the impact of the blade pitch angle on enhancing the turbine efficiency they numerically optimized the shape of the airfoil to enhance tangential forces invented in the 1970s the axial flow wells turbine was the most commonly used self rectifying turbine in owc plants the configuration of the wells turbine has been modernized and improved in literature the three dimensional blade profile was optimized by takasaki et al 2014 they increased the maximum efficiency yet failed to prevent stalling different types of multi plane and single plane wells turbines have been examined and compared the overall performance and aerodynamic losses of these turbines were investigated by presenting two successful detailed swirl energy recovery methods the rotor of the biplane turbine was contra rotated while guide vanes were fitted into the monoplane turbine and a twin shaft biplane turbine was examined the contra rotating turbine outperformed in the post stalling area and had a much greater pressure to flow ratio compared with the monoplane turbine with guide vanes although its operational range and peak efficiency were similar to that of the other turbine gato and curran 1996 also mamun et al 2004 proved that the monoplane turbine with the hysteretic behavior is contrary to the dynamic stall of the blade for the biplane case the hysteretic behavior was similar to the monoplane at lower attack angles multi objective optimization of the blade sweep was performed by halder et al 2017 for the wells turbine the selected design variables included the blade sweep parameters at the tip and mid sections they found out that increasing efficiency is not necessarily associated with increasing the maximum torque torresi et al 2008 studied the effects of the tip leakage flow and simulated the tip clearance region they showed that the leakage flow decreases the maximum torque coefficient avoids the separation at the blade tip and improves the reliability of the computed turbine performance cui et al 2015 illustrated that the staggered turbine is better than the conventional one for the asymmetrical air flows moreover efficiency and output work in a wave period are compared with another unsymmetrical twin impulse turbine system the results show that the staggered turbine shows better performance than the twin turbine system for more than the high flow coefficient domain φ 0 7 liu et al 2016 showed that the several shapes of the duct augmentation developed the turbine performance the duct augmentation significantly increased the power and torque output moreover the elliptic shape enhanced the performance of the turbine cui and hyun 2016 investigated the effect of adding endplate and ring to airfoil on non dimensional coefficients input coefficient torque coefficient and efficiency under steady state conditions they came to the conclusion that the ring type is a better type compared to the other ones and efficiency increased up to 16 in comparison with the original case the anfis technique was developed by jang 1993 in 1993 this technique could overcome the shortcomings of the anns as well as fuzzy systems the fuzzy part of the anfis is made by input and output variables membership functions fuzzy rules and inference method the simple forms of the artificial neural networks anns cannot present any explicit knowledge or causal relationships for a system which is considered their major disadvantage mellit et al 2013 calp and hanefi calp 2019 offered their findings on the hybrid anfis ga model as well as the artificial neural network ann they obviously demonstrate that anfis model shows a high level of predictive performance with a low error level hence it is possible to easily use the hybrid approaches such as anfis ga for the purpose of predicting the complicated problems ying and pan 2008 could show that the anfis model offers a better forecasting performance in comparison with regression model artificial neural network ann model support vector machines with genetic algorithms svmg model recurrent support vector machines with genetic algorithms rsvmg model and hybrid ellipsoidal fuzzy systems for time series forecasting hefst model therefore in terms of forecasting the anfis model could be considered a promising choice the primary papers were about fuzzy neural nets where the creators summed up the mcculloch pitts model by utilizing moderate values somewhere in the range of zero and one lee and lee 1974 one of the main advantages of evolutionary computing is that it is thoughtfully straightforward and simple to utilize fogel 1997 the combination of neural nets was examined by yamakawa s fuzzy neuron the creators added fuzzy membership functions to the perceptron keller and hunt 1985 looking for the intelligible cooperative energy between the preparation limit of artificial neural networks and the chance of illustrating the issues models that utilize the better of the two ideas to frame hybrid models are called fuzzy neural networks or neuro fuzzy models lin and lee 1996 these models have been available in the writing since the 1960s and have been acting progressively and proficiently in tackling different issues in our general public buckley and hayashi 1994 civelek 2020 studied on the fuzzy controller for nonlinearities systems that were appropriate for the controls of the wind turbine blade he designed a fuzzy controller and optimized it with a genetic algorithm for the pitch angle of the blade and wind speeds were to obtain the optimal operation and the output power of the wind turbines zhang and tao 2017 utilized the takagi sugeno t s type fuzzy and a genetic algorithm creates changes in the model design farag et al 1998 utilized a trained neuro fuzzy methodology with genetic algorithms for demonstrating and controlling the dynamic frameworks hsiao and tsai 2005 made the fuzzy neural organization model utilizing genetic algorithms in training the fundamental qualities in the network of hsiao and hung cheng different models can be seen in the audit completed by cordon et al 2001 because of unforeseen changes in the speed of wind and the need for a quick response from the controller they had to use the sugeno takagi method instead of mamdani moreover the speed of data analysis was faster in the sugeno takagi method compared to the mamdani the sugeno takagi regulator coefficients can be gotten better utilizing anfis nonetheless an enhancement pattern is required for situations where yields are not referred to heretofore as in wind turbine pitch point control utilizing genetic algorithm in optimization it would be possible to use the great capacity of genetic algorithm for various variables applied simultaneously nonetheless distributed writing about the enhancement of the regulators dependent on the problem prerequisites being the second significant thing following the regulator plan is restricted inside this restricted writing taher et al 2013 enhanced direct quadratic gaussian lqg regulator utilizing differential development de calculation the estimation is very significant to save time and money in a mining task which is studied as a test for the geologists to conquer this issue artificial neural networks ann and fuzzy logic fl have been utilized with different structures and a genetic algorithm ga is used to optimize the parameters for solving this complex optimization issue the results showed that the mix method reduced errors tahmasebi and hezarkhani 2012 this study has investigated the effect of adding guide vanes endplate and end ring to reduce the leakage flow vortex generation and separation consequently the wells turbine characteristics associated with simple blades b blades with fixed guide vanes gv blades with fixed guide vanes and an end ring on the blade tip gver and blade with fixed guide vanes and an endplate on the blade tip gvep are simulated and evaluated by the benchmark parameters then considering four design variables airfoil tip thickness guide vanes input and output angles and the kind of airfoil three artificial neural fuzzy networks were used to forecast three benchmark pentameters efficiency torque coefficient and pressure drop coefficient and a genetic algorithm was utilized to optimize the cost function in order to gain the most optimal state of design based on the benchmark parameters thus the investigation of the results showed that the optimal state the gver with the special blade ring thickness and unique input and output angles of guide vanes increased the efficiency and torque coefficients and reduced the pressure drop coefficient significantly moreover flow separation was delayed see fig 1 2 turbine geometry table 1 presents the characteristics of the reference turbine geometry and fig 3 shows the schematic of the wells turbine according to fig 4 a single blade profile and fixed gv domains cause a decrease in computational costs and time the guide vanes were added to the original turbine to improve the attack angle and enhance the efficiency of the turbine to reduce the negative effects of the leakage flow on the tip blade endplate or end ring were installed on the tip of rotor blade fig 5 also shows the turbine with the simple blade and guide vanes gv guide vanes and endplate gvep as well as guide vanes and end ring gver the reference geometry of the wells turbine with eight rotor blades with without fixed guide vanes was shown based on a study by curran and gato 1997 the reference geometry comprises naca0015 airfoil as the base blade profile see table 2 see fig 2 3 numerical simulation in numerical simulations adding end ring endplate and guide vanes were performed to decrease the negative impacts of leakage flow on the tip region of wells turbines the present research completed all the calculations in steady state conditions by computational fluid dynamics cfd complex adverse pressure gradient flows and separated flows were properly calculated using the realizable k ε turbulence model based on the finite volume techniques coupled method needs greater ram memory compared to the simple method and all the three airfoil models of this study are 3d therefore the coupled method increases the computational cost a lot and it uses more memory in comparison with the segregated solver simple is a classic segregated solution method which is utilized for incompressible flows moreover simple algorithm enhances the accuracy of the numerical simulations especially when large time steps are being used in a moving mesh falcão and henriques 2016 patankar and spalding 1983 fig 9 and fig 10 show the high accuracy of validations among numerical and experimental data in this study furthermore the simplec scheme with a higher rate of convergence compared to that of the simple model was selected for the pressure velocity coupling and a second order upwind model for the spatial discretization numerical simulations were performed by dividing the calculation domain into five areas namely ring plates endplates downstream guide vanes upstream guide vanes and rotor blades the mass imbalance was below 0 001 and the turbulent intensity was 5 domains of ring plates endplates and rotor blades were assumed to revolve at a constant speed whereas the domain of guide vanes was assumed to be stationary according to fig 6 the entire domain is extended for eight times the chord length of blade along the downstream direction and for four times along the upstream direction to ensure the adequate development of airflow the inlet velocity of the computational domain was considered uniform whereas the boundary condition of the outlet pressure was used at the outlet domain no slip wall conditions were also considered for the shroud blades and hub surfaces a periodical rotation was assumed for the turbine airflow to avoid an enormous burden of calculations resulting from modelling all the guide vanes and blades periodic rotational boundaries were considered to develop the model with two symmetrical guide vanes and a blade to ensure an adequate distance between the wall and the cells y y μ ρ a τ w was used as a non dimensional parameter to locate the cells lying adjacent to the wall y which depends on the reynolds number and the mesh resolution was considered approximately equal to one on the blade surface in the numerical simulations according to fig 7 three blades passages were meshed to minimize calculation costs moreover a periodic boundary condition was set on radial boundaries the structured mesh was also utilized all over the domain 4 grid study the passage of a blade with endplate gvep was meshed in computational domains in order to minimize the computational cost see fig 8 the structured mesh which was produced over the whole computational domain allows for adding the blade tip clearance tc 1 the fine high quality mesh was utilized in the near wall area and the blade tip was used to capture the near boundary flow physics the number of grids was increased in seven gradual steps from 532 746 to 2 130 142 cells for turbine efficiency to ensure the minimum effect of grid size on the computational results the numerical computation with a coarse grid usually has a large deviation from the experimental results the grid independence test is investigated at flow coefficient equal to 0 157 table 3 illustrates the mesh details as is clear the efficiency is independent of mesh size in a number of 1 9 million cells while maintaining the y value is less than unity the no slip conditions are applied over the solid surfaces 5 validation of the numerical model the results are validated and compared with the experimental data of gato and curran curran and gato 1997 and also compared with others numerical results by the benchmark parameters the benchmark is described in the form of three parameters which can be written as torque or power coefficient 1 t t ρ ω 2 r 5 pressure drop coefficient 2 δ p δ p 0 ρ ω 2 r 2 efficiency 3 η t ω δ p 0 q where ϕ v a u t t a n α also ρ denotes the air density t the torque produced t ω the power q the flow rate volume and δp the total pressure drop between the two sides of the turbine the angular velocity is 2000 rpm the benchmark parameters are based on three dimensionless coefficients the pressure drop coefficient torque coefficient and efficiency several well known methods are available to incorporate the effects of turbulence incompressible flows the more accurate method proposed for predicting properties of the mixed flow jet is r e a l i z a b l e k ε model this model relies on the boussinesq hypothesis which is based on an eddy viscosity assumption the advantage of this approach is the relatively low computational cost associated with the determination of the turbulent viscosity and it is suitable for industrial applications we compared the results of s t a n d a r d k ε r e a l i z a b l e k ε k ω and s s t k ω models with each other finally the results obtained by r e a l i z a b l e k ε approach were in a good agreement with experimental data of torque coefficient in stall point in order to get a precise selection in validation section a comparison is carried out between different turbulence models and the results are presented in table 4 as seen in table 4 r e a l i z a b l e k ε and s s t k ω provide more accurate predictions on the other hand with the r e a l i z a b l e k ε model less time is spent on the numerical solution process hence this model seems to be adequately accurate and economic fig 9 shows the differences between the numerical and experimental results of the last studies and the present study results in the efficiency torque coefficient and pressure drop coefficient charts although the results of shaban and hafiz shaaban and hafiz 2012 were very good in stall point they did not calculate the after stall point properly on the other hand toressi et al torresi et al 2004 predicted the after stall ϕ 0 25 very well but they could not forecast stall point correctly halder et al 2015 and nazeryan and lakzian 2018 did not figure out the whole stall point very well but we mahrooghi and lakzian estimated all of the domains in stall point and over that with the highest accuracy and lowest time of calculations especially moreover we compare our numerical results with experimental results of curran and gato related to the efficiency and pressure coefficients of wells turbine with and without guide vanes in fig 10 the high quality structured mesh with 1 932 700 cells used in the present study caused a high satisfactory coherence to be obtained between the measured and calculated data by curran and gatto with the present study results especially in the stall area the obtained varying outcomes include below 0 1 changes in the pressure drop 0 8 changes in the turbine efficiency and 0 3 changes in the turbine torque 6 the artificial neural fuzzy network anfis and genetic algorithm ga in this part the structure used for the steps of process data and output of the artificial neural fuzzy network and genetic algorithm are shown in figs 11 and 12 assume

i m i f i i m i f i i m i in the current study ga was used to obtain four optimal design variables including the blade tip thickness the blade form and the input output angles of guide vanes for wells turbines on the basis of evolution mechanisms these optimum design variables should maximize efficiency and torque coefficient and minimize pressure drop coefficient the values of efficiency torque coefficient and pressure drop coefficient are estimated and stored by anfis in the result files the optimizer checks these values using ga and becomes able to decide how to change the design variables of the wells turbine blade before starting a recent iteration iterations are done until the optimal design variables are obtained as a result of using evolutionary algorithms a remarkably robust procedure could be achieved therefore the evolution results of ga with iteration for the pressure drop coefficient torque coefficient and efficiency have been shown for the best and mean fitness in fig 14 the fitness function behavior is reported with 270 iterations that number of repetitions could be enough to reach a well optimized configuration even beginning from a random distribution 7 results and discussion in this part the simulation of flow and optimization of wells turbine are presented 7 1 simulation of flow in this section the contours of pressure and tangential velocity and streamlines pattern are discussed 7 1 1 contours of pressure on the pressure and suction surface figs 15 and 16 present the effects of the pressure distribution on the pressure and suction sides of the blades as shown in fig 15a the pressure distribution is similar in the three cases and a high pressure zone expands close to the leading edge at the stagnation point with an increase in the flow coefficient see fig 15b and c the high pressure zone of near the leading edge of gver is larger than that of gv and gvep at flow coefficients over 0 052 in other words the blade loading of gver is higher than that of the other cases on the pressure side according to fig 16a the pressure distribution is similar in the three ones and a low pressure area develops on the leading edge with an increase in the flow coefficient see fig 16b and c the low pressure region on the leading edge of gver is more enlarged in comparison with the gv and gvep 7 1 2 contours of tangential velocity on the suction surface fig 17 illustrates the tangential velocity contours in the vicinity of the leading edge at the mid chord and close to the trailing edge for four flow coefficients deep stalling condition the start of stalling maximum efficiency and a low flow coefficient according to fig 17a given the low tangential velocity coefficient there is not any difference among blades but with increase in the flow coefficients the high velocity flow expanded in the leading edge especially for gver compared to that of gv and gvep because the low pressure zone on the suction side leading edge for gver is larger than gv and gvep on the other hand the high velocity of flow on leading edge prevents the leakage flow from the pressure to the suction side and also the vortex generation close to the blade tip thus the velocity flow on the suction side is higher than the other blades also gver postpones the separation more than gv and even gvep moreover the separation area gets closer to the blade tip and gets away from the hub when the flow coefficient increases see fig 17b according to fig 17c and d which are associated with stalling conditions a vortex is caused by the interaction of leakage flow with the transient flow from the suction side the leakage flow plays more significant role than the separation phenomenon in the hub in stalling conditions the effect of adding endplates and end rings at the blade tip is investigated to reduce the effect of the leakage flow as well as its interference with the fluid flow in the suction side according to fig 17b d the leakage flow and separation region close to the blade tip are clearly reduced at every constant flow coefficient for gver 7 1 3 streamlines pattern on the suction surface fig 18 shows the impacts of increasing the airflow coefficient i e a low flow coefficient of ϕ 0 052 the flow coefficient at the start of stalling ϕ 0 186 and the flow coefficient at deep stalling ϕ 0 307 as well as the effect of adding endplates gvep and end rings gver on the streamline patterns on the suction surface fig 18a shows that the streamlines on the suction surface are more uniform at a small flow coefficient compared to the other ones for three cases according to fig 18b and c the vortex region is expanded on the near tip region of the gv and gvep s suction surface compared to the gver s suction surface with an increase in the flow coefficient in addition gver more significantly reduces both the leakage flow from the pressure to the suction side and the vortex generation close to the blade tip and postpones the boundary layer separation on the suction side because the amount of pressure was reduced on the leading edge of the suction side by adding endplate and end ring therefore it caused an increase in the flow velocity on the suction side especially near the leading edge consequently it prevented the leakage flow and its interference with the fluid flow on the suction side it is extremely clear that the vortex caused on gver is very limited compared to the other blades 7 2 the optimization of wells turbine in the previous sections we investigated the effect of the tip shape on three benchmark variables consisting of the pressure drop coefficient torque coefficient and efficiency but in this section the effects of the inlet angle iag and outlet angle oag of guide vanes the end thickness of the blade etb and the kind of the blade kb on the benchmark parameters will be studied by artificial neural fuzzy inference network and genetic algorithm see fig 19 also the domain of variables is shown in table 5 every neural network is affected by four design variables of iag oag etb and kb but the output of each neural network is unique then a cost function is derived from them see fig 12 afterwards the cost function will be optimized by a genetic algorithm then the optimal amount of iag oag etb and kb will be determined by optimizing the cost function the most optimum values of design variables are presented in table 6 the comparison of the optimum state with the results of the previous sections is shown in fig 20 although adding each of the guide vanes endplate and end ring increased the performance of wells turbine blade compared to the original one we investigated the changes of benchmark parameters when the several design variables were altered simultaneously moreover the optimum design variables were obtained by ga when the pressure drop coefficient was minimum and the torque coefficient and efficiency were maximum therefore three artificial neural fuzzy networks are used to predict these parameters and ga is utilized to get the most optimal variables fig 20a illustrates the efficiency of gver is more than gv and gvep especially before the stall point but using the appropriate angles of guide vanes and the optimal thickness of the blade tip increased the upper limit of the optimized state efficiency up to 18 rather than the maximum performance of gver the optimal blade is a particular type of gver that has an optimum ring thickness fig 20b indicates that the torque coefficient of gver is more than gv and gvep in almost all domains on the other hand the optimal state boosted the amount of torque coefficient by 8 in comparison with the gver before the stall point therefore it produces the most power for wells turbine in fig 20c the graph shows that the pressure drop coefficient has been increased with the growth of the flow coefficients in all cases the optimal type with the unique tip thickness of end ring was the best and it reduced the pressure drop coefficient to almost 3 45 compared to the gver the investigation of the results indicated the fact that the optimal state increased the efficiency and torque coefficients and reduced the pressure drop coefficient significantly and it mostly delayed flow separation moreover the use of artificial neural networks and genetic algorithm changed the results of past researches enormously 8 conclusions in this study we first investigated the effect of blade deformation on wells turbine performance by conventional methods the low efficiency is the main drawback of wells turbines the structured mesh with very high quality was also utilized all over the domain the results indicated a good agreement between both experimental and numerical results also the results presented that the use of the guide vanes endplate and end ring had significant effects on the performance of wells turbine as follows adding the guide vanes endplate and end ring to the blade of wells turbine reduced the impact of leakage flow from the pressure side to the suction side and declined the vortexes close to the blade tip at the suction side the high pressure zone on the pressure side of gver was larger than gv and gvep at the high flow coefficients therefore the blade loading of gver was higher than that of the other cases the low pressure on the suction side of gver was more expanded compared to that of gv and gvep at high flow coefficients thus the flow velocity close to the leading edge of gver was more than that of gv and gvep and it prevented mixing with passing fluid flow from the suction side at a flow rate of φ 0 186 the efficiency of gver was 16 6 10 2 and 5 7 higher than the best case of gv and gvep respectively the gver wells turbine is recommended for future research based on the analysis of benchmark parameters in the last section the anfis models were trained and the levels of fitness achieved were showed then we obtained the optimal design variables by ga when the pressure drop coefficient was minimum and the torque coefficient and efficiency were maximum hence the following conclusion can be drawn the optimal blade increased the upper limit of the efficiency up to 18 rather than the maximum performance of gver the optimum state boosted the amount of torque coefficient by 8 in comparison with the gver therefore it produces the most power for the wells turbine the optimized blade reduced the pressure drop coefficient to almost 3 45 compared to the gver unexpectedly as a result the investigation of the results showed that the optimal state increased the efficiency and torque coefficients and on the other hand reduced the pressure drop coefficient significantly moreover flow separation was delayed credit

20916,renewable energy resources are considered as alternative sources of energy for future generations wells turbines can be used to convert the reciprocating energy of waves in oceans and seas into rotational energy low aerodynamic efficiency is the main drawback of wells turbines the present study showed that the addition of the guide vanes endplate or end ring to the base blade significantly enhanced the performance of wells turbines also we used anfis ga cfd for optimization of the several design variables the blade tip thickness the blade form and the input output angels of guide vanes

climate change challenges the status quo should be quickly changed into using renewable energy resources some policies have been made in china the european union eu and the us for a rapid decrease in co2 emissions in march 2007 the eu set a target of increasing the share of renewable energies to 20 by 2020 the danish government has recently proposed the target of 30 renewable energy for 2025 the wells turbine is a machine that can be used to harvest the ocean wave energy as a renewable source of energy attracting the attention of many scientists in the past decade nevertheless the low efficiency of the wells turbine which is affected by many factors still remains a major challenge to be addressed methods of increasing efficiency have been well addressed in literature nevertheless few studies have been conducted to optimize the wells turbine performance the turbine blade s shape is a design parameter that can be optimized to enhance efficiency and raise the output power lund and mathiesen 2009 raghunathan et al 1995 evaluated the islay wells turbine performance using simple prediction techniques and compared the results with the measurements the discrepancy of results was found to be associated with the rotor entry flow being far from uniform due to the potential separation at the hub the results suggested that streamlining of the flow at the rotor inlet and outlet can be used to optimize the turbine efficiency by deferring stalling phenomenon curran and gato 1997 investigated and compared different designs of the wells turbine in terms of the overall performance they found the largest part of the losses to be related to viscous losses in the rotors and specific operational ranges to be associated with the recovery techniques compared to a monoplane turbine with guide vanes the operational range of a contra rotating turbine was similar and its efficiency was at the peak while its damping ratio was much higher and its post stalling performance much more improved setoguchi et al 2001 used numerical simulations and model testing to examine the performance of a fixed guide vane impulse turbine and an impulse turbine with self pitch controlled guide vanes they compared the results with those associated with the wells turbine they found that the impulse turbine with self pitch controlled linked guide vanes outperforms the fixed guide vane impulse turbine which in turn outperforms the wells turbine for irregular flow rates hashem et al 2018 stated that water flow is preferred to air flow as a working fluid because the generated torque by water flow is more than airflow the efficiency of hydraulic wells turbine was less dependent on the shape of airfoil compared to the kind of the working fluid and the amount of solidity the pressure drop coefficient was almost constant for every flow coefficient webster and gato 1999 studied the impact of flow type and parameters of design on the efficiency and output power of the turbine the power received by the blade was found to be higher for the suction side attached flow higher values of torque and efficiency were also found to be associated with a backward swept blade over a wider range of operation cui et al 2019 stated that the grid density close to the airfoil and the amount of y play a significant role in the amount of numerical simulation errors moreover wells turbine efficiency is very dependent on mesh quality compared to the impulse turbine kim et al 2002 investigated how the wells turbine performance is affected by geometric parameters such as blade geometry the blade shape has also been modified to alter its performance and efficiency thakker et al 2005 improved the efficiency of an impulse turbine using guide vanes they also obtained hysteric characteristics with random and sinusoidal inlet flow conditions from the empirical findings of the turbine moreover they found the turbine performance to significantly improve during the inlet flow deceleration compared to the acceleration occurring in a half cycle of the sinusoidal wave naca0015 airfoil has several advantages for wells turbine blade compared to the other constant thickness airfoils shehata et al 2016 showed that naca0015 airfoil offers less global entropy generation rate and higher efficiency compared to the other constant thickness airfoils moreover naca0015 airfoil generates more torque and efficiency and lower pressure drop takao et al 2006 experimentally tested the model under steady flow conditions they found out that the wells turbine equipped with endplates has better characteristics than those of the original wells turbine and these characteristics depend on both the position and size of the endplates kumar and samad 2019 added a gurney flap to the airfoil they showed the gurney flap produced a vortex behind the trailing edge and increased blade loading lift torque and efficiency however it raised pressure drop when the flap height was less than 1 5 chord length also kumar et al 2019 stated that the relative average power and the relative operating range of wells turbine were increased by variable thickness blade and extended trailing edge blade however the average efficiency decreased due to an increase in pressure drop the solidity of guide vanes and the rotor has been proven to improve the pneumatic performance of air turbines significantly the effects of the solidity of guide vanes and blades on the operation of the wells turbine and impulse turbine have been reflected in many reports and articles as discussed elsewhere a summary of the impacts of both the blade profile and the rotor solidity on the performance of the wells turbine was provided in under unsteady unidirectional flow conditions thakker and abdulhadi 2007 taha et al 2011 showed that the tip clearance could significantly affect the turbine operation increasing the ratio of the tip clearance to the chord length lowered the turbine peak efficiency shifted it toward higher flow coefficients and widened the stalling margin they also investigated the flow field surrounding the turbine blades and found the tip leakage flow to constitute a deciding factor of the boundary layer separation later affecting the turbine stalling the tip leakage flow produced a vortex with both a positive and a negative effect on the performance of the turbine taha et al taha and sugiyonosawada 2010 investigated the leakage flow from the blade tips as well as its effects on the turbine output with either a non uniform or uniform tip clearance halder et al 2018 investigated the role of the grooved casing sweep of the blade the accelerating flow and the decelerating flow in the wells turbine efficiency they proved the grooved casing increased the efficiency and decreased the flow separation moreover they showed that the separation phenomenon in the accelerating flow occurred more than the decelerating flow and the unsteady flow is largely dependent upon the amount of groove in comparison with the change of the blade thickness and blade profile mohamed and shaaban 2014 explored the impact of the blade pitch angle on enhancing the turbine efficiency they numerically optimized the shape of the airfoil to enhance tangential forces invented in the 1970s the axial flow wells turbine was the most commonly used self rectifying turbine in owc plants the configuration of the wells turbine has been modernized and improved in literature the three dimensional blade profile was optimized by takasaki et al 2014 they increased the maximum efficiency yet failed to prevent stalling different types of multi plane and single plane wells turbines have been examined and compared the overall performance and aerodynamic losses of these turbines were investigated by presenting two successful detailed swirl energy recovery methods the rotor of the biplane turbine was contra rotated while guide vanes were fitted into the monoplane turbine and a twin shaft biplane turbine was examined the contra rotating turbine outperformed in the post stalling area and had a much greater pressure to flow ratio compared with the monoplane turbine with guide vanes although its operational range and peak efficiency were similar to that of the other turbine gato and curran 1996 also mamun et al 2004 proved that the monoplane turbine with the hysteretic behavior is contrary to the dynamic stall of the blade for the biplane case the hysteretic behavior was similar to the monoplane at lower attack angles multi objective optimization of the blade sweep was performed by halder et al 2017 for the wells turbine the selected design variables included the blade sweep parameters at the tip and mid sections they found out that increasing efficiency is not necessarily associated with increasing the maximum torque torresi et al 2008 studied the effects of the tip leakage flow and simulated the tip clearance region they showed that the leakage flow decreases the maximum torque coefficient avoids the separation at the blade tip and improves the reliability of the computed turbine performance cui et al 2015 illustrated that the staggered turbine is better than the conventional one for the asymmetrical air flows moreover efficiency and output work in a wave period are compared with another unsymmetrical twin impulse turbine system the results show that the staggered turbine shows better performance than the twin turbine system for more than the high flow coefficient domain φ 0 7 liu et al 2016 showed that the several shapes of the duct augmentation developed the turbine performance the duct augmentation significantly increased the power and torque output moreover the elliptic shape enhanced the performance of the turbine cui and hyun 2016 investigated the effect of adding endplate and ring to airfoil on non dimensional coefficients input coefficient torque coefficient and efficiency under steady state conditions they came to the conclusion that the ring type is a better type compared to the other ones and efficiency increased up to 16 in comparison with the original case the anfis technique was developed by jang 1993 in 1993 this technique could overcome the shortcomings of the anns as well as fuzzy systems the fuzzy part of the anfis is made by input and output variables membership functions fuzzy rules and inference method the simple forms of the artificial neural networks anns cannot present any explicit knowledge or causal relationships for a system which is considered their major disadvantage mellit et al 2013 calp and hanefi calp 2019 offered their findings on the hybrid anfis ga model as well as the artificial neural network ann they obviously demonstrate that anfis model shows a high level of predictive performance with a low error level hence it is possible to easily use the hybrid approaches such as anfis ga for the purpose of predicting the complicated problems ying and pan 2008 could show that the anfis model offers a better forecasting performance in comparison with regression model artificial neural network ann model support vector machines with genetic algorithms svmg model recurrent support vector machines with genetic algorithms rsvmg model and hybrid ellipsoidal fuzzy systems for time series forecasting hefst model therefore in terms of forecasting the anfis model could be considered a promising choice the primary papers were about fuzzy neural nets where the creators summed up the mcculloch pitts model by utilizing moderate values somewhere in the range of zero and one lee and lee 1974 one of the main advantages of evolutionary computing is that it is thoughtfully straightforward and simple to utilize fogel 1997 the combination of neural nets was examined by yamakawa s fuzzy neuron the creators added fuzzy membership functions to the perceptron keller and hunt 1985 looking for the intelligible cooperative energy between the preparation limit of artificial neural networks and the chance of illustrating the issues models that utilize the better of the two ideas to frame hybrid models are called fuzzy neural networks or neuro fuzzy models lin and lee 1996 these models have been available in the writing since the 1960s and have been acting progressively and proficiently in tackling different issues in our general public buckley and hayashi 1994 civelek 2020 studied on the fuzzy controller for nonlinearities systems that were appropriate for the controls of the wind turbine blade he designed a fuzzy controller and optimized it with a genetic algorithm for the pitch angle of the blade and wind speeds were to obtain the optimal operation and the output power of the wind turbines zhang and tao 2017 utilized the takagi sugeno t s type fuzzy and a genetic algorithm creates changes in the model design farag et al 1998 utilized a trained neuro fuzzy methodology with genetic algorithms for demonstrating and controlling the dynamic frameworks hsiao and tsai 2005 made the fuzzy neural organization model utilizing genetic algorithms in training the fundamental qualities in the network of hsiao and hung cheng different models can be seen in the audit completed by cordon et al 2001 because of unforeseen changes in the speed of wind and the need for a quick response from the controller they had to use the sugeno takagi method instead of mamdani moreover the speed of data analysis was faster in the sugeno takagi method compared to the mamdani the sugeno takagi regulator coefficients can be gotten better utilizing anfis nonetheless an enhancement pattern is required for situations where yields are not referred to heretofore as in wind turbine pitch point control utilizing genetic algorithm in optimization it would be possible to use the great capacity of genetic algorithm for various variables applied simultaneously nonetheless distributed writing about the enhancement of the regulators dependent on the problem prerequisites being the second significant thing following the regulator plan is restricted inside this restricted writing taher et al 2013 enhanced direct quadratic gaussian lqg regulator utilizing differential development de calculation the estimation is very significant to save time and money in a mining task which is studied as a test for the geologists to conquer this issue artificial neural networks ann and fuzzy logic fl have been utilized with different structures and a genetic algorithm ga is used to optimize the parameters for solving this complex optimization issue the results showed that the mix method reduced errors tahmasebi and hezarkhani 2012 this study has investigated the effect of adding guide vanes endplate and end ring to reduce the leakage flow vortex generation and separation consequently the wells turbine characteristics associated with simple blades b blades with fixed guide vanes gv blades with fixed guide vanes and an end ring on the blade tip gver and blade with fixed guide vanes and an endplate on the blade tip gvep are simulated and evaluated by the benchmark parameters then considering four design variables airfoil tip thickness guide vanes input and output angles and the kind of airfoil three artificial neural fuzzy networks were used to forecast three benchmark pentameters efficiency torque coefficient and pressure drop coefficient and a genetic algorithm was utilized to optimize the cost function in order to gain the most optimal state of design based on the benchmark parameters thus the investigation of the results showed that the optimal state the gver with the special blade ring thickness and unique input and output angles of guide vanes increased the efficiency and torque coefficients and reduced the pressure drop coefficient significantly moreover flow separation was delayed see fig 1 2 turbine geometry table 1 presents the characteristics of the reference turbine geometry and fig 3 shows the schematic of the wells turbine according to fig 4 a single blade profile and fixed gv domains cause a decrease in computational costs and time the guide vanes were added to the original turbine to improve the attack angle and enhance the efficiency of the turbine to reduce the negative effects of the leakage flow on the tip blade endplate or end ring were installed on the tip of rotor blade fig 5 also shows the turbine with the simple blade and guide vanes gv guide vanes and endplate gvep as well as guide vanes and end ring gver the reference geometry of the wells turbine with eight rotor blades with without fixed guide vanes was shown based on a study by curran and gato 1997 the reference geometry comprises naca0015 airfoil as the base blade profile see table 2 see fig 2 3 numerical simulation in numerical simulations adding end ring endplate and guide vanes were performed to decrease the negative impacts of leakage flow on the tip region of wells turbines the present research completed all the calculations in steady state conditions by computational fluid dynamics cfd complex adverse pressure gradient flows and separated flows were properly calculated using the realizable k ε turbulence model based on the finite volume techniques coupled method needs greater ram memory compared to the simple method and all the three airfoil models of this study are 3d therefore the coupled method increases the computational cost a lot and it uses more memory in comparison with the segregated solver simple is a classic segregated solution method which is utilized for incompressible flows moreover simple algorithm enhances the accuracy of the numerical simulations especially when large time steps are being used in a moving mesh falcão and henriques 2016 patankar and spalding 1983 fig 9 and fig 10 show the high accuracy of validations among numerical and experimental data in this study furthermore the simplec scheme with a higher rate of convergence compared to that of the simple model was selected for the pressure velocity coupling and a second order upwind model for the spatial discretization numerical simulations were performed by dividing the calculation domain into five areas namely ring plates endplates downstream guide vanes upstream guide vanes and rotor blades the mass imbalance was below 0 001 and the turbulent intensity was 5 domains of ring plates endplates and rotor blades were assumed to revolve at a constant speed whereas the domain of guide vanes was assumed to be stationary according to fig 6 the entire domain is extended for eight times the chord length of blade along the downstream direction and for four times along the upstream direction to ensure the adequate development of airflow the inlet velocity of the computational domain was considered uniform whereas the boundary condition of the outlet pressure was used at the outlet domain no slip wall conditions were also considered for the shroud blades and hub surfaces a periodical rotation was assumed for the turbine airflow to avoid an enormous burden of calculations resulting from modelling all the guide vanes and blades periodic rotational boundaries were considered to develop the model with two symmetrical guide vanes and a blade to ensure an adequate distance between the wall and the cells y y μ ρ a τ w was used as a non dimensional parameter to locate the cells lying adjacent to the wall y which depends on the reynolds number and the mesh resolution was considered approximately equal to one on the blade surface in the numerical simulations according to fig 7 three blades passages were meshed to minimize calculation costs moreover a periodic boundary condition was set on radial boundaries the structured mesh was also utilized all over the domain 4 grid study the passage of a blade with endplate gvep was meshed in computational domains in order to minimize the computational cost see fig 8 the structured mesh which was produced over the whole computational domain allows for adding the blade tip clearance tc 1 the fine high quality mesh was utilized in the near wall area and the blade tip was used to capture the near boundary flow physics the number of grids was increased in seven gradual steps from 532 746 to 2 130 142 cells for turbine efficiency to ensure the minimum effect of grid size on the computational results the numerical computation with a coarse grid usually has a large deviation from the experimental results the grid independence test is investigated at flow coefficient equal to 0 157 table 3 illustrates the mesh details as is clear the efficiency is independent of mesh size in a number of 1 9 million cells while maintaining the y value is less than unity the no slip conditions are applied over the solid surfaces 5 validation of the numerical model the results are validated and compared with the experimental data of gato and curran curran and gato 1997 and also compared with others numerical results by the benchmark parameters the benchmark is described in the form of three parameters which can be written as torque or power coefficient 1 t t ρ ω 2 r 5 pressure drop coefficient 2 δ p δ p 0 ρ ω 2 r 2 efficiency 3 η t ω δ p 0 q where ϕ v a u t t a n α also ρ denotes the air density t the torque produced t ω the power q the flow rate volume and δp the total pressure drop between the two sides of the turbine the angular velocity is 2000 rpm the benchmark parameters are based on three dimensionless coefficients the pressure drop coefficient torque coefficient and efficiency several well known methods are available to incorporate the effects of turbulence incompressible flows the more accurate method proposed for predicting properties of the mixed flow jet is r e a l i z a b l e k ε model this model relies on the boussinesq hypothesis which is based on an eddy viscosity assumption the advantage of this approach is the relatively low computational cost associated with the determination of the turbulent viscosity and it is suitable for industrial applications we compared the results of s t a n d a r d k ε r e a l i z a b l e k ε k ω and s s t k ω models with each other finally the results obtained by r e a l i z a b l e k ε approach were in a good agreement with experimental data of torque coefficient in stall point in order to get a precise selection in validation section a comparison is carried out between different turbulence models and the results are presented in table 4 as seen in table 4 r e a l i z a b l e k ε and s s t k ω provide more accurate predictions on the other hand with the r e a l i z a b l e k ε model less time is spent on the numerical solution process hence this model seems to be adequately accurate and economic fig 9 shows the differences between the numerical and experimental results of the last studies and the present study results in the efficiency torque coefficient and pressure drop coefficient charts although the results of shaban and hafiz shaaban and hafiz 2012 were very good in stall point they did not calculate the after stall point properly on the other hand toressi et al torresi et al 2004 predicted the after stall ϕ 0 25 very well but they could not forecast stall point correctly halder et al 2015 and nazeryan and lakzian 2018 did not figure out the whole stall point very well but we mahrooghi and lakzian estimated all of the domains in stall point and over that with the highest accuracy and lowest time of calculations especially moreover we compare our numerical results with experimental results of curran and gato related to the efficiency and pressure coefficients of wells turbine with and without guide vanes in fig 10 the high quality structured mesh with 1 932 700 cells used in the present study caused a high satisfactory coherence to be obtained between the measured and calculated data by curran and gatto with the present study results especially in the stall area the obtained varying outcomes include below 0 1 changes in the pressure drop 0 8 changes in the turbine efficiency and 0 3 changes in the turbine torque 6 the artificial neural fuzzy network anfis and genetic algorithm ga in this part the structure used for the steps of process data and output of the artificial neural fuzzy network and genetic algorithm are shown in figs 11 and 12 assume that there are four input variables x y z and w and one output f for a first order sugeno fuzzy model four if then fuzzy rules are defined as follows 4 rule 1 if x is a 1 y is b 1 and z is c 1 then f

i m i f i i m i f i i m i in the current study ga was used to obtain four optimal design variables including the blade tip thickness the blade form and the input output angles of guide vanes for wells turbines on the basis of evolution mechanisms these optimum design variables should maximize efficiency and torque coefficient and minimize pressure drop coefficient the values of efficiency torque coefficient and pressure drop coefficient are estimated and stored by anfis in the result files the optimizer checks these values using ga and becomes able to decide how to change the design variables of the wells turbine blade before starting a recent iteration iterations are done until the optimal design variables are obtained as a result of using evolutionary algorithms a remarkably robust procedure could be achieved therefore the evolution results of ga with iteration for the pressure drop coefficient torque coefficient and efficiency have been shown for the best and mean fitness in fig 14 the fitness function behavior is reported with 270 iterations that number of repetitions could be enough to reach a well optimized configuration even beginning from a random distribution 7 results and discussion in this part the simulation of flow and optimization of wells turbine are presented 7 1 simulation of flow in this section the contours of pressure and tangential velocity and streamlines pattern are discussed 7 1 1 contours of pressure on the pressure and suction surface figs 15 and 16 present the effects of the pressure distribution on the pressure and suction sides of the blades as shown in fig 15a the pressure distribution is similar in the three cases and a high pressure zone expands close to the leading edge at the stagnation point with an increase in the flow coefficient see fig 15b and c the high pressure zone of near the leading edge of gver is larger than that of gv and gvep at flow coefficients over 0 052 in other words the blade loading of gver is higher than that of the other cases on the pressure side according to fig 16a the pressure distribution is similar in the three ones and a low pressure area develops on the leading edge with an increase in the flow coefficient see fig 16b and c the low pressure region on the leading edge of gver is more enlarged in comparison with the gv and gvep 7 1 2 contours of tangential velocity on the suction surface fig 17 illustrates the tangential velocity contours in the vicinity of the leading edge at the mid chord and close to the trailing edge for four flow coefficients deep stalling condition the start of stalling maximum efficiency and a low flow coefficient according to fig 17a given the low tangential velocity coefficient there is not any difference among blades but with increase in the flow coefficients the high velocity flow expanded in the leading edge especially for gver compared to that of gv and gvep because the low pressure zone on the suction side leading edge for gver is larger than gv and gvep on the other hand the high velocity of flow on leading edge prevents the leakage flow from the pressure to the suction side and also the vortex generation close to the blade tip thus the velocity flow on the suction side is higher than the other blades also gver postpones the separation more than gv and even gvep moreover the separation area gets closer to the blade tip and gets away from the hub when the flow coefficient increases see fig 17b according to fig 17c and d which are associated with stalling conditions a vortex is caused by the interaction of leakage flow with the transient flow from the suction side the leakage flow plays more significant role than the separation phenomenon in the hub in stalling conditions the effect of adding endplates and end rings at the blade tip is investigated to reduce the effect of the leakage flow as well as its interference with the fluid flow in the suction side according to fig 17b d the leakage flow and separation region close to the blade tip are clearly reduced at every constant flow coefficient for gver 7 1 3 streamlines pattern on the suction surface fig 18 shows the impacts of increasing the airflow coefficient i e a low flow coefficient of ϕ 0 052 the flow coefficient at the start of stalling ϕ 0 186 and the flow coefficient at deep stalling ϕ 0 307 as well as the effect of adding endplates gvep and end rings gver on the streamline patterns on the suction surface fig 18a shows that the streamlines on the suction surface are more uniform at a small flow coefficient compared to the other ones for three cases according to fig 18b and c the vortex region is expanded on the near tip region of the gv and gvep s suction surface compared to the gver s suction surface with an increase in the flow coefficient in addition gver more significantly reduces both the leakage flow from the pressure to the suction side and the vortex generation close to the blade tip and postpones the boundary layer separation on the suction side because the amount of pressure was reduced on the leading edge of the suction side by adding endplate and end ring therefore it caused an increase in the flow velocity on the suction side especially near the leading edge consequently it prevented the leakage flow and its interference with the fluid flow on the suction side it is extremely clear that the vortex caused on gver is very limited compared to the other blades 7 2 the optimization of wells turbine in the previous sections we investigated the effect of the tip shape on three benchmark variables consisting of the pressure drop coefficient torque coefficient and efficiency but in this section the effects of the inlet angle iag and outlet angle oag of guide vanes the end thickness of the blade etb and the kind of the blade kb on the benchmark parameters will be studied by artificial neural fuzzy inference network and genetic algorithm see fig 19 also the domain of variables is shown in table 5 every neural network is affected by four design variables of iag oag etb and kb but the output of each neural network is unique then a cost function is derived from them see fig 12 afterwards the cost function will be optimized by a genetic algorithm then the optimal amount of iag oag etb and kb will be determined by optimizing the cost function the most optimum values of design variables are presented in table 6 the comparison of the optimum state with the results of the previous sections is shown in fig 20 although adding each of the guide vanes endplate and end ring increased the performance of wells turbine blade compared to the original one we investigated the changes of benchmark parameters when the several design variables were altered simultaneously moreover the optimum design variables were obtained by ga when the pressure drop coefficient was minimum and the torque coefficient and efficiency were maximum therefore three artificial neural fuzzy networks are used to predict these parameters and ga is utilized to get the most optimal variables fig 20a illustrates the efficiency of gver is more than gv and gvep especially before the stall point but using the appropriate angles of guide vanes and the optimal thickness of the blade tip increased the upper limit of the optimized state efficiency up to 18 rather than the maximum performance of gver the optimal blade is a particular type of gver that has an optimum ring thickness fig 20b indicates that the torque coefficient of gver is more than gv and gvep in almost all domains on the other hand the optimal state boosted the amount of torque coefficient by 8 in comparison with the gver before the stall point therefore it produces the most power for wells turbine in fig 20c the graph shows that the pressure drop coefficient has been increased with the growth of the flow coefficients in all cases the optimal type with the unique tip thickness of end ring was the best and it reduced the pressure drop coefficient to almost 3 45 compared to the gver the investigation of the results indicated the fact that the optimal state increased the efficiency and torque coefficients and reduced the pressure drop coefficient significantly and it mostly delayed flow separation moreover the use of artificial neural networks and genetic algorithm changed the results of past researches enormously 8 conclusions in this study we first investigated the effect of blade deformation on wells turbine performance by conventional methods the low efficiency is the main drawback of wells turbines the structured mesh with very high quality was also utilized all over the domain the results indicated a good agreement between both experimental and numerical results also the results presented that the use of the guide vanes endplate and end ring had significant effects on the performance of wells turbine as follows adding the guide vanes endplate and end ring to the blade of wells turbine reduced the impact of leakage flow from the pressure side to the suction side and declined the vortexes close to the blade tip at the suction side the high pressure zone on the pressure side of gver was larger than gv and gvep at the high flow coefficients therefore the blade loading of gver was higher than that of the other cases the low pressure on the suction side of gver was more expanded compared to that of gv and gvep at high flow coefficients thus the flow velocity close to the leading edge of gver was more than that of gv and gvep and it prevented mixing with passing fluid flow from the suction side at a flow rate of φ 0 186 the efficiency of gver was 16 6 10 2 and 5 7 higher than the best case of gv and gvep respectively the gver wells turbine is recommended for future research based on the analysis of benchmark parameters in the last section the anfis models were trained and the levels of fitness achieved were showed then we obtained the optimal design variables by ga when the pressure drop coefficient was minimum and the torque coefficient and efficiency were maximum hence the following conclusion can be drawn the optimal blade increased the upper limit of the efficiency up to 18 rather than the maximum performance of gver the optimum state boosted the amount of torque coefficient by 8 in comparison with the gver therefore it produces the most power for the wells turbine the optimized blade reduced the pressure drop coefficient to almost 3 45 compared to the gver unexpectedly as a result the investigation of the results showed that the optimal state increased the efficiency and torque coefficients and on the other hand reduced the pressure drop coefficient significantly moreover flow separation was delayed credit

paper is designed to study the water entry phenomenon of cylindrical shape bullet passing two layer immiscible liquids the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the experimental set up and experimental process section 3 introduces the experimental results of water entry section 4 introduces the theoretical model for predicting the bullet penetration distance and the results of the experimental and theoretical are compared finally section 5 provides the summary and conclusion of the study 2 experimental set up a schematic representation of the experimental set up is shown in fig 1 the experimental system mainly includes four parts the digital imaging system high speed camera and the data processing computer the guided release device the water tank transparent acrylic and the light source the frame rate of the camera nac hx 7s is up to 200 000 frames s 1 and 1500 frames s 1 is adopted in the experiment the minimum exposure time of the camera is 1 1 μs however it can be adjusted according to the need and our exposure time is 5 μs the guided release device was placed above the center of the water tank 50 cm 50 cm 100 cm and the height of the device could be changed through the height adjuster unit however the depth of the liquid was kept at 80 cm to minimize the splash of water out of the tank the dash represents the interface of silicone oil and water and the liquid above the dash line is silicone oil 10 mm two dison 100 w led lights were used as light sources the experimental process is shown in fig 2 the camera adopts the post trigger mode the bullet can release before the camera shoots and the video sequences can be downloaded to the computer for analysis in this study aluminum bullets with different nose shapes and diameters were selected to explore the water entry phenomenon the density of the bullet is ρ 2720 kg m3 the normal contact angle is θ 75 the liquid pool temperature was measured to be approximately the same as the room temperature of 26 c furthermore two different silicone oil pdms 50 and pdms 500 were adopted to study the water entry phenomenon of the bullet passing the oil and water the thickness of the oil is 10 mm the silicone oil is newtonian liquid the density of the silicone oil is lighter than water thus the silicone oil is on top of the water the key parameters of the liquids are shown in table 1 to conveniently introduce the bullet the slenderness ratio is defined s l d where d is the diameter of the bullet and l is the length of the bullet several different bullets with varying diameters lengths and nose cones are designed to investigate the water entry phenomenon the nose shapes of the bullet are shown in fig 3 the detailed data of the bullets are listed in table 2 the experiment was conducted within the impact speed range of 1 72 m s u 5 20 m s 8 5 fr 0 5 u gr 0 5 30 the two cavity seal models are as follows deep and surface seals in deep seal the first close of the cavity occurs underwater under the range of the studied froude number without generating a splash crown fig 4 b by contrast the first close of the cavity in surface seal occurs above the water fig 4 a 3 experimental results 3 1 effect of the silicone oil when the bullet impacts the water under fr 10 85 0 18 a deep seal cavity is induced by the bullet the cavity in water is smooth and continuous as shown in fig 5 a when the bullet passes through the silicone oil first and then enters the water the cavity induced by the bullet shrinks on the silicone oil and water surface and the cavity is no longer smooth and continuous fig 5 b and c this phenomenon is also captured in fig 6 d 6 mm s 7 α 60 and fr 17 32 0 26 the cavity has a significant shrinkage on the interface of silicone oil and water especially in pdms 500 fig 6 c the profile of the cavity produces ripples in silicone oil the fluctuation of the cavity is related to the type of silicone oil the cavity in pure water is smooth and no ripples occur the cavity generated in pdms 50 has slight fluctuations while the cavity profile in pdms 500 wildly fluctuates the cavity profile in fig 6 c has more obvious ripples and fluctuations compared with that in fig 5 c thereby indicating that the cavity profile is also related to the nose cone angle of the bullet fig 7 also demonstrates the phenomenon that the nose cone angle of the bullet can affect the fluctuation of the cavity the cavity induced by the flat nose bullet in fig 7 a is smooth and sleek the 120 cone nose induced slight fluctuations of the cavity profile the cavity profile around the 60 cone nose bullet is rough not smooth and with obvious fluctuations the fluctuation of the cavity is negatively related to the nose cone angle of the bullet the fluctuation of the cavity increases with the decrease in the bullet nose cone angles especially before the cavity fracture from the air liquid surface the cavities in fig 6 a and c are pitched off under the surface however the cavity induced in pdms 50 is closed above the surface at the moment 25 3 ms in fig 8 d 6 mm s 3 α 180 and fr 16 69 0 32 the water entry cavity closed models are also different the cavities in fig 8 a and b are closed above the water surface surface seal while that in c is pitched off under the water surface deep seal the cavity generated in pure water fig 8 a is closed at moment t 18 ms however the cavity in pdms 50 fig 8 b is closed at t 10 ms this phenomenon exists in all our experiments thus pdms 50 can promote the cavity surface seal and decrease the seal time however pdms 500 prevents the surface closure of the cavity although the silicone oil affects the surface seal time of the cavity it has no obvious influence on the cavity break time and position fig 9 d 6 mm s 3 α 180 and fr 10 85 0 18 shows the cavity pinch off position and time of the cavity induced by the same bullet the pinch off position is approximately 2 3 l from the air liquid surface in water and silicon oil meanwhile the pinch off time is approximately 39 33 40 ms error is 0 67 ms due to the frame rate limit the dimension of the cavity in pdms 500 is smaller than those in water and pdms 50 the cavity in the silicone oil part is almost cylindrical the shrinkage of the cavity below the silicone oil is more obvious than that in water the profile surface of the cavity is formed by silicone oil when the bullet passes the silicone oil it carries the oil into the water accompanying the motion of the bullet the silicone oil fills the liquid needed for cavity expansion to maintain the cavity profile the fluctuation of the cavity in figs 6 c and 7 can declare it the double layer jet in fig 10 can prove this discovery fig 10 shows the evolution process of the jet the double layer jet one connected with the silicone oil water interface and another connected with the silicone oil air surface is clear in fig 10 the jet in the air is significantly larger than that connected with the silicone oil air surface at moment t 69 3 ms the time when the bullet reaches the surface the two jets develop upward at moment t 141 3 ms the jet connected to the water reaches its peak and begins to fall back however the jet connected to silicone oil still moves upward when t 165 3 ms the jet of water basically falls back to the interface however the jet in the air has not yet begun to fall fig 11 explains the forming mechanism of the two layer jet after the cavity pinch off under the surface an upward and downward jet will inevitably form water is the main liquid forming the jet because the cavity pinched off in water fig 11 a the jet moves upward thus promoting the cavity shrinkage when the cavity leaves the water and enters the silicone oil the silicone oil will become the main driving component of the jet fig 11 b the water jet will gradually fall back 3 2 effect of the bullet diameter the effect of the diameter on water entry phenomenon was studied in this part according to the study the dimension of the cavity induced by the bullet increases with the increase in the bullet diameter this result is also applicable to the cavity evolution process of a bullet passing silicone oil the dimension of the cavity especially the diameter increases with the increase in the bullet diameter fig 12 fig 12 a and b are the cavity profiles at the moment of the cavity sealed after the bullet with diameters of 8 and 6 mm passes through pdms 50 respectively fig 12 c and d represent the cavity of d 8 and d 6 bullet in pure water respectively the dimension of the cavity induced by the d 8 mm bullet is larger than that of the d 6 mm bullet whether in pure water or in pdms 50 although the dimension of the bullet can affect the size of the cavity it has no effect on the seal time of the surface seal cavity the cavity seal time of fig 12 a and b is t 15 33 ms the seal times of fig 12 c and d are t 27 and 27 3 ms respectively the difference of the seal time between fig 12 a and b and fig 12 c and d indicates that pdms 50 can shorten the cavity seal time the diameter of the bullet has no effect on the deep seal cavity pinch off position except for the no effect on the cavity seal time fig 13 however the diameter of the bullet has an obvious influence on the break time of the cavity unlike silicon oil the increase in the bullet diameter leads to a delay in the break time of the cavity the break time of cavity induced by the bullet of d 6 mm is almost 40 ms while it is approximately 46 33 ms for the cavity induced by the d 8 mm bullet fig 14 the pinch off time of the cavity induced by the same diameter bullet is close whether in pure water or with the effect of the upper layer liquid this notion indicates that silicone oil has no effect on the cavity break time which is different from the effect on the closing time of the surface seal cavity the nose shape of the bullet also has no effect on the cavity break time the data in fig 14 include the break time of bullet α 180 120 and 60 according to the above research the pinch off time of the deep seal cavities is just related to the diameter of the bullet however the cone angle the impact speed deep seal of the bullet and the properties of the liquid have no effect on the pinch off time the pinch off time of the deep seal cavities can be marked by dimensionless value τ t seal g r 0 5 in this study τ is a constant which is near 2 3 fig 15 3 3 effect of nose shapes some dimensionless parameters such as froude number fr and weber number we are taken to characterize the properties of the cavity the weber number we ρu 2 r δ is often used to characterize the cavity breakup and could be used to describe the splash crown stability the splash crown is analogous to the canonical water bell or water sheet the froude number fr u gr 0 5 characterizes the macroscopic behavior of the cavity in our research the weber number is much greater than 1 therefore the effect of surface tension can be ignored according to the above study although the cone angle of the bullet has no effect on the seal time of the deep seal cavities it is one of the key characters that affect the surface seal of the water entry cavity in fig 16 a the cavity of the flathead bullet closed on the body of the bullet at 6 7 ms after it touched the water surface in the α 120 bullet the cavity closed at 8 7 ms and the bullet can just completely enter the cavitation the cavity of the α 60 bullet closed at 13 ms and the bullet is already underwater in fig 16 b the cavity of the flathead bullet closed at 10 ms in the α 120 bullet the cavity closed at 16 ms the cavity of the α 60 bullet closed at 26 ms in the surface seal cavity the seal time increases with the angle decrease regardless of the type of liquid when the bullet impacts the water it will push the water outward however the movement of the water is different due to the variation in the nose shape of the bullet fig 17 under the same impact speed u the horizontal speed of the flathead bullet is u while that of the other cone angle bullet is u cosθ where θ 0 5 180 α the backward force of the water is related to the square of the horizontal speed thus the backward force increases with the cone angle α causing the closing time 180 120 60 the relationship in pure water between the cavity seal models and the froude number under the studied weber number is shown in fig 18 in this study the critical froude numbers for α 180 120 and 60 bullets are 12 77 14 45 and 17 32 respectively the critical froude number increases with the decrease in the cone angle when the froude number is larger than the critical value the cavity will close above the surface by contrast the cavity will seal under the water surface the critical froude number is also related to the properties of the liquid except for the cone angle the critical value of the different cone angle bullets in silicone oil varies from that in pure water the critical value of the α 180 bullet is 13 28 in silicone oil 50 the critical froude numbers of α 120 and 60 bullets are 14 32 and 15 55 respectively in this study the cavities are closed under the surface deep seal when the bullet passes the silicone oil 500 liquid thus the critical froude numbers are both larger than 30 although the critical number of the α 180 bullet is larger in silicone oil 50 than that in water the seal time of silicone oil 50 is still smaller than water when the cavity closed above the surface 4 conclusions in this study the influence of a thin upper layer liquid on the cavity dynamic and the phenomena of solid bodies entering into a two layer system of immiscible liquids are experimentally studied the study is focused on a range of froude numbers fr u gr 0 5 8 5 fr 30 two types of silicone oil pdms 50 and pdms 500 were chosen as the studied upper layer liquids the study shows that the profile surface of the cavity was formed by silicone oil the upper layer immiscible liquid can induce the fluctuation of the cavity profile and the fluctuation increases with the viscosity increase of the upper layer liquid the fluctuation of the cavity is negatively related to the nose cone angle of the bullet the fluctuation of the cavity increases with the decrease in the bullet nose cone angles especially before the cavity fracture from the air liquid surface the thin upper layer silicone oil had no effect on the pinch off time and position of the deep seal cavity but it had an obvious influence on the surface seal time of the surface seal cavities the pdms 50 promoted the cavity surface seal and decreased the seal time nevertheless pdms 500 prevented the surface closure of the cavity the critical froude from deep seal to surface seal number increased with the decrease in the cone angles moreover the critical froude number was also affected by the upper layer liquids upper layer liquid pdms 50 reduced the critical number but pdms 500 increased the critical number data availability statement the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request credit authorship

20917,the influence of a thin upper layer liquid on the cavity dynamic and the phenomena of solid bodies entering into a two layer system of immiscible liquids are experimentally studied the new phenomenon is seldom documented in the literature the thin upper layer silicone oil can affect the cavity profile the seal time surface and deep and the pinch off position of the cavity the cavity dynamics and water entry phenomenon of the bullet with different diameters and head cone angles under varying upper layer liquid are studied the critical froude number from deep seal to surface seal is affected by the cone angle and the upper layer liquid the pinch off time of the deep seal cavity is affected by the diameter of the bullet but has nothing to do with the upper layer liquid and cone angles keywords water entry silicone oil pinch off surface seal two layer liquid 1 introduction the free surface impact of solid objects has been investigated for well over a century this canonical problem is influenced by many physical parameters including the geometry material properties fluid properties and impact parameters truscott et al 2014 this phenomenon is common in nature and engineering the water entry of torpedoes the skipping of boats the dip coating procedures and even the motion of some animals are associated with water entry mansoor et al 2014 when a solid object strikes a liquid surface an air cavity and a splash curtain may be created the existence of an air cavity and a splash crown has a great influence on an object s subsequent trajectory eristoff et al 2010 given the wide presence of water entry it has received interest from scientists for over a century wei and hu 2014 many researchers have conducted studies on water entry problems by using experimental numerical and theoretical methods worthington and cole 1897 first used single spark illumination photography to investigate the cavity formation from and splash characteristics produced by spheres impact onto liquid surfaces worthington and cole 1900 following their work mallock 1918 studied the sound produced by drops falling on water bell 1924 investigated the impact of solid sphere on a liquid surface the vertical water entry behavior of bullet shaped projectiles was experimentally and theoretically studied by yao et al 2014 may investigated the effect of a sphere s surface condition on a water entry cavity may 1951 and the cavity running behavior of water entry missiles may 1975 they found that the cleaner the sphere surface is the easier a cavity is to induce under the same low impact speed furthermore an increase in fluid viscosity produces a bigger cavity under the same speed glasheen et al glasheen and mcmahon 1996 studied the vertical water entry of disks at low froude numbers yan et al 2009 investigated the cavity dynamics in water entry at low froude numbers they developed a theoretical method for predicting the cavity profile fan et al 2020 performed many experiments to study the different behaviors of spheres entering water and a peo solution speirs et al 2018 studied the water entry phenomenon of a sphere into a water surfactant mixture and the effect of a bubble layer guo et al 2012 investigated the horizontal water entry behaviors of projectiles with different nose shapes wang et al experimentally studied the low speed vertical water entry phenomenon of the 90 cone shaped head elliptical head and cut cone head projectiles wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 they found that the quasi static seal shallow seal deep seal surface seal and liken surface seal are observed with the increase in the water entry velocity yan et al 2019 studied the water entry phenomenon of cylindrical projectiles with different nose shapes their experimental results demonstrated that the nose shape of the projectile has a significant influence on the jet flow the cavity diameter and the trajectory stability in the case of certain other conditions yun et al 2020a 2020b experimentally studied the water entry of two tandem spheres with vertical or oblique collision effect sun et al 2019 revealed the cavity formation mechanism induced by a thin layer of a highly viscous liquid floating on water they found that increasing the horizontal impact velocity will cause a delay in the splash closure and the vertical displacement of the sphere during the dimethicone water entry process is independent of the horizontal impact velocity the cavity dynamics and water entry phenomenon of solid bodies into single phase homogeneous liquids are well known and have been widely published in the literature owing to the extensive research over the past century however the same amount of knowledge and understanding does not exist for the corresponding entry into stratified two layer systems of immiscible liquids relatively little literature exists on such a study prior to the recent studies of tan 2016 and tan et al 2016 that show the formation of wave like instability along the cavity walls behind the steel spheres further analysis showed that these instabilities were caused by the shear between the upper and the lower layer liquids involved in the experiments following the study of tan benedict et al t bthomas 2018 investigated the influence of an upper layer liquid on the phenomena and cavity formation associated with the entry of solid spheres into a stratified two layer system of immiscible liquids the phenomenon of cylindrical shape solid objects entering the two layer immiscible liquids is seldom studied this paper is designed to study the water entry phenomenon of cylindrical shape bullet passing two layer immiscible liquids the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the experimental set up and experimental process section 3 introduces the experimental results of water entry section 4 introduces the theoretical model for predicting the bullet penetration distance and the results of the experimental and theoretical are compared finally section 5 provides the summary and conclusion of the study 2 experimental set up a schematic representation of the experimental set up is shown in fig 1 the experimental system mainly includes four parts the digital imaging system high speed camera and the data processing computer the guided release device the water tank

1 1 μs however it can be adjusted according to the need and our exposure time is 5 μs the guided release device was placed above the center of the water tank 50 cm 50 cm 100 cm and the height of the device could be changed through the height adjuster unit however the depth of the liquid was kept at 80 cm to minimize the splash of water out of the tank the dash represents the interface of silicone oil and water and the liquid above the dash line is silicone oil 10 mm two dison 100 w led lights were used as light sources the experimental process is shown in fig 2 the camera adopts the post trigger mode the bullet can release before the camera shoots and the video sequences can be downloaded to the computer for analysis in this study aluminum bullets with different nose shapes and diameters were selected to explore the water entry phenomenon the density of the bullet is ρ 2720 kg m3 the normal contact angle is θ 75 the liquid pool temperature was measured to be approximately the same as the room temperature of 26 c furthermore two different silicone oil pdms 50 and pdms 500 were adopted to study the water entry phenomenon of the bullet passing the oil and water the thickness of the oil is 10 mm the silicone oil is newtonian liquid the density of the silicone oil is lighter than water thus the silicone oil is on top of the water the key parameters of the liquids are shown in table 1 to conveniently introduce the bullet the slenderness ratio is defined s l d where d is the diameter of the bullet and l is the length of the bullet several different bullets with varying diameters lengths and nose cones are designed to investigate the water entry phenomenon the nose shapes of the bullet are shown in fig 3 the detailed data of the bullets are listed in table 2 the experiment was conducted within the impact speed range of 1 72 m s u 5 20 m s 8 5 fr 0 5 u gr 0 5 30 the two cavity seal models are as follows deep and surface seals in deep seal the first close of the cavity occurs underwater under the range of the studied froude number without generating a splash crown fig 4 b by contrast the first close of the cavity in surface seal occurs above the water fig 4 a 3 experimental results 3 1 effect of the silicone oil when the bullet impacts the water under fr 10 85 0 18 a deep seal cavity is induced by the bullet the cavity in water is smooth and continuous as shown in fig 5 a when the bullet passes through the silicone oil first and then enters the water the cavity induced by the bullet shrinks on the silicone oil and water surface and the cavity is no longer smooth and continuous fig 5 b and c this phenomenon is also captured in fig 6 d 6 mm s 7 α 60 and fr 17 32 0 26 the cavity has a significant shrinkage on the interface of silicone oil and water especially in pdms 500 fig 6 c the profile of the cavity produces ripples in silicone oil the fluctuation of the cavity is related to the type of silicone oil the cavity in pure water is smooth and no ripples occur the cavity generated in pdms 50 has slight fluctuations while the cavity profile in pdms 500 wildly fluctuates the cavity profile in fig 6 c has more obvious ripples and fluctuations compared with that in fig 5 c thereby indicating that the cavity profile is also related to the nose cone angle of the bullet fig 7 also demonstrates the phenomenon that the nose cone angle of the bullet can affect the fluctuation of the cavity the cavity induced by the flat nose bullet in fig 7 a is smooth and sleek the 120 cone nose induced slight fluctuations of the cavity profile the cavity profile around the 60 cone nose bullet is rough not smooth and with obvious fluctuations the fluctuation of the cavity is negatively related to the nose cone angle of the bullet the fluctuation of the cavity increases with the decrease in the bullet nose cone angles especially before the cavity fracture from the air liquid surface the cavities in fig 6 a and c are pitched off under the surface however the cavity induced in pdms 50 is closed above the surface at the moment 25 3 ms in fig 8 d 6 mm s 3 α 180 and fr 16 69 0 32 the water entry cavity closed models are also different the cavities in fig 8 a and b are closed above the water surface surface seal while that in c is pitched off under the water surface deep seal the cavity generated in pure water fig 8 a is closed at moment t 18 ms however the cavity in pdms 50 fig 8 b is closed at t 10 ms this phenomenon exists in all our experiments thus pdms 50 can promote the cavity surface seal and decrease the seal time however pdms 500 prevents the surface closure of the cavity although the silicone oil affects the surface seal time of the cavity it has no obvious influence on the cavity break time and position fig 9 d 6 mm s 3 α 180 and fr 10 85 0 18 shows the cavity pinch off position and time of the cavity induced by the same bullet the pinch off position is approximately 2 3 l from the air liquid surface in water and silicon oil meanwhile the pinch off time is approximately 39 33 40 ms error is 0 67 ms due to the frame rate limit the dimension of the cavity in pdms 500 is smaller than those in water and pdms 50 the cavity in the silicone oil part is almost cylindrical the shrinkage of the cavity below the silicone oil is more obvious than that in water the profile surface of the cavity is formed by silicone oil when the bullet passes the silicone oil it carries the oil into the water accompanying the motion of the bullet the silicone oil fills the liquid needed for cavity expansion to maintain the cavity profile the fluctuation of the cavity in figs 6 c and 7 can declare it the double layer jet in fig 10 can prove this discovery fig 10 shows the evolution process of the jet the double layer jet one connected with the silicone oil water interface and another connected with the silicone oil air surface is clear in fig 10 the jet in the air is significantly larger than that connected with the silicone oil air surface at moment t 69 3 ms the time when the bullet reaches the surface the two jets develop upward at moment t 141 3 ms the jet connected to the water reaches its peak and begins to fall back however the jet connected to silicone oil still moves upward when t 165 3 ms the jet of water basically falls back to the interface however the jet in the air has not yet begun to fall fig 11 explains the forming mechanism of the two layer jet after the cavity pinch off under the surface an upward and downward jet will inevitably form water is the main liquid forming the jet because the cavity pinched off in water fig 11 a the jet moves upward thus promoting the cavity shrinkage when the cavity leaves the water and enters the silicone oil the silicone oil will become the main driving component of the jet fig 11 b the water jet will gradually fall back 3 2 effect of the bullet diameter the effect of the diameter on water entry phenomenon was studied in this part according to the study the dimension of the cavity induced by the bullet increases with the increase in the bullet diameter this result is also applicable to the cavity evolution process of a bullet passing silicone oil the dimension of the cavity especially the diameter increases with the increase in the bullet diameter fig 12 fig 12 a and b are the cavity profiles at the moment of the cavity sealed after the bullet with diameters of 8 and 6 mm passes through pdms 50 respectively fig 12 c and d represent the cavity of d 8 and d 6 bullet in pure water respectively the dimension of the cavity induced by the d 8 mm bullet is larger than that of the d 6 mm bullet whether in pure water or in pdms 50 although the dimension of the bullet can affect the size of the cavity it has no effect on the seal time of the surface seal cavity the cavity seal time of fig 12 a and b is t 15 33 ms the seal times of fig 12 c and d are t 27 and 27 3 ms respectively the difference of the seal time between fig 12 a and b and fig 12 c and d indicates that pdms 50 can shorten the cavity seal time the diameter of the bullet has no effect on the deep seal cavity pinch off position except for the no effect on the cavity seal time fig 13 however the diameter of the bullet has an obvious influence on the break time of the cavity unlike silicon oil the increase in the bullet diameter leads to a delay in the break time of the cavity the break time of cavity induced by the bullet of d 6 mm is almost 40 ms while it is approximately 46 33 ms for the cavity induced by the d 8 mm bullet fig 14 the pinch off time of the cavity induced by the same diameter bullet is close whether in pure water or with the effect of the upper layer liquid this notion indicates that silicone oil has no effect on the cavity break time which is different from the effect on the closing time of the surface seal cavity the nose shape of the bullet also has no effect on the cavity break time the data in fig 14 include the break time of bullet α 180 120 and 60 according to the above research the pinch off time of the deep seal cavities is just related to the diameter of the bullet however the cone angle the impact speed deep seal of the bullet and the properties of the liquid have no effect on the pinch off time the pinch off time of the deep seal cavities can be marked by dimensionless value τ t seal g r 0 5 in this study τ is a constant which is near 2 3 fig 15 3 3 effect of nose shapes some dimensionless parameters such as froude number fr and weber number we are taken to characterize the properties of the cavity the weber number we ρu 2 r δ is often used to characterize the cavity breakup and could be used to describe the splash crown stability the splash crown is analogous to the canonical water bell or water sheet the froude number fr u gr 0 5 characterizes the macroscopic behavior of the cavity in our research the weber number is much greater than 1 therefore the effect of surface tension can be ignored according to the above study although the cone angle of the bullet has no effect on the seal time of the deep seal cavities it is one of the key characters that affect the surface seal of the water entry cavity in fig 16 a the cavity of the flathead bullet closed on the body of the bullet at 6 7 ms after it touched the water surface in the α 120 bullet the cavity closed at 8 7 ms and the bullet can just completely enter the cavitation the cavity of the α 60 bullet closed at 13 ms and the bullet is already underwater in fig 16 b the cavity of the flathead bullet closed at 10 ms in the α 120 bullet the cavity closed at 16 ms the cavity of the α 60 bullet closed at 26 ms in the surface seal cavity the seal time increases with the angle decrease regardless of the type of liquid when the bullet impacts the water it will push the water outward however the movement of the water is different due to the variation in the nose shape of the bullet fig 17 under the same impact speed u the horizontal speed of the flathead bullet is u while that of the other cone angle bullet is u cosθ where θ 0 5 180 α the backward force of the water is related to the square of the horizontal speed thus the backward force increases with the cone angle α causing the closing time 180 120 60 the relationship in pure water between the cavity seal models and the froude number under the studied weber number is shown in fig 18 in this study the critical froude numbers for α 180 120 and 60 bullets are 12 77 14 45 and 17 32 respectively the critical froude number increases with the decrease in the cone angle when the froude number is larger than the critical value the cavity will close above the surface by contrast the cavity will seal under the water surface the critical froude number is also related to the properties of the liquid except for the cone angle the critical value of the different cone angle bullets in silicone oil varies from that in pure water the critical value of the α 180 bullet is 13 28 in silicone oil 50 the critical froude numbers of α 120 and 60 bullets are 14 32 and 15 55 respectively in this study the cavities are closed under the surface deep seal when the bullet passes the silicone oil 500 liquid thus the critical froude numbers are both larger than 30 although the critical number of the α 180 bullet is larger in silicone oil 50 than that in water the seal time of silicone oil 50 is still smaller than water when the cavity closed above the surface 4 conclusions in this study the influence of a thin upper layer liquid on the cavity dynamic and the phenomena of solid bodies entering into a two layer system of immiscible liquids are experimentally studied the study is focused on a range of froude numbers fr u gr 0 5 8 5 fr 30 two types of silicone oil pdms 50 and pdms 500 were chosen as the studied upper layer liquids the study shows that the profile surface of the cavity was formed by silicone oil the upper layer immiscible liquid can induce the fluctuation of the cavity profile and the fluctuation increases with the viscosity increase of the upper layer liquid the fluctuation of the cavity is negatively related to the nose cone angle of the bullet the fluctuation of the cavity increases with the decrease in the bullet nose cone angles especially before the cavity fracture from the air

20918,resource protection of pacific bluefin tuna thunnus orientalis fish catching has become stringent over the past years meanwhile tuna farming in japan the largest consumer of this fish using a circular flexible net cage is continuously growing as a promising business a stable aquaculture production of tuna can be achieved by understanding the characteristics such as a clean environment and space in the net cage and flow inside and near the circular flexible net cage we measured the drag force cage deformation and flow field inside and around a scaled net cage model composed of different bottom weights under various incoming current speeds in a flume tank results indicated that the drag force and cage volume increased and decreased respectively with the bottom weight owing to the significant deformation of the flexible net cage a complex fluid structure interaction occurred and a strong negative correlation between the drag force and cage volume was obtained furthermore an area where the current speed was often reduced was identified the intensity of this reduction depended on the incoming current speed however in particular cases this reduction did not occur or a local acceleration of the fluid was observed in this work the depth data of several positions on the net cage were also analyzed to verify if it could be used to estimate the cage volume the findings of this study can be used to understand and design optimal flexible net cage structures which can be used for modern aquaculture keywords drag force cage volume flexible net cage fluid structure interaction flow field distribution pacific bluefin tuna 1 introduction the regulation regarding pacific bluefin tuna thunnus orientalis catches which were elaborated by resource management committees such as the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tuna has continuously tightened each year since 2018 japan has adopted the total allowable catch tac regulation for pacific bluefin tuna and introduced penal sanctions fisheries agency 2018 however japan which is the top global consumer of bluefin tuna needs to secure a stable supply of pacific bluefin tuna that considers these strict regulations therefore tuna farming has attracted attention as a promising supply alternative resulting in the continuous growth of this business fisheries agency 2019 in japan two types of circular net cages are used for tuna farming floating rope and high density polyethylene hdpe floating collar net cages furthermore the cylinder side netting bottom netting and bottom weight such as sinkers sinker ropes or lead rope which are usually attached on the bottom netting are the elements of the circular net cages in the sea the aquaculture net cage system is subjected to hydrodynamic loads which may cause damage the system the cage volume may be reduced because of the hydrodynamic loads causing injury and stress to the stocked fish in particular the infection of the epithelial scratches caused by friction and collision of the nets may be lethal to the pacific bluefin tuna which are fast swimmers therefore determining such hydrodynamic characteristics of the flexible net cages is important the hydrodynamic force and cage deformation of similar net cages have been studied in previous studies based on tank model tests cha and lee 2018 fu et al 1994 moe et al 2010 zhan et al 2006 in their work the deformation of the net cage was based on its cross section two dimensions instead of its three dimensional volume only few studies have measured the three dimensional deformation of net cage dong et al 2020 lader and enerhaug 2005 yang et al 2008 moreover with the development in technology numerical simulations have been conducted in many studies regarding the subject of this work to analyze the influence of uniform flow pure wave and current wave conditions on the net cage huang et al 2006 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 klebert and su 2013 lee et al 2008 moe føre et al 2016 shen et al 2018 tsukrov et al 2003 xu et al 2013 although the hydrodynamic forces of these numerical models were verified the cage deformation when verified was qualitatively analyzed or the cross sectional area was used instead of the cage volume in the validation of these models recently martin and bihs 2021 proposed a novel model for the simulation of non linear dynamic behavior of porous tensile structure which compared the numerical results of the cage volume reductions with that of the experimental results obtained by lader and enerhaug 2005 furthermore the flow inside and around the net cage is the basis to calculate the hydrodynamic force and cage shape nakamura 1991 used the conservation of momentum equation to calculate the drag force on a nondeformed net cage while considering the decrease in the downstream current speed the results obtained by nakamura 1991 are consistent with the experimentally determined drag force exerted on a wire netting cage lee et al 2008 numerically simulated the deformation of a circular cage with and without considering the current speed reduction ratio 15 inside a net cage and compared the results with experimental findings they determined that the simulation error is less than 5 when the shielding effect is considered an empirical formula derived by løland 1991 has been used in the numerical modeling dong et al 2020 moe føre et al 2016 shen et al 2018 but did not consider the deformation of the net in this formulation the flow field also determines the water exchange the supply of dissolved oxygen and nutrients and the removal of waste wu et al 2014 klebert and su 2020 hence it should be analyzed before evaluating the structural design and field layout of the net other researchers used computational fluid dynamics cfd to numerically investigate the flow inside and around the net cage bi et al 2014a b chen and christensen 2017 winthereig rasmussen et al 2016 yao et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 recently martin et al 2021 presented a new cfd framework for modeling the fluid structure interaction of open ocean aquaculture structures all these cfd simulations have been verified using experimental measurements performed in flume tanks and the results of full scale experiments however in the verification experiments the flow field was mainly along the flow direction hence the depth direction was not appropriately measured moreover a single measurement point inside the net cage is insufficient thus experimental measurements of the flow field inside and around net cages are still required particularly for detailed measurement of the flow field inside and around the flexible net cages several researchers have also conducted field measurements to analyze the tension force of the mooring system fredriksson et al 2003 huang et al 2010 furthermore studies conducted to measure the three dimensional shape of full scale net cages using depth or acoustic sensors decew et al 2013 dong et al 2017 klebert et al 2015 lader et al 2008 gansel et al 2018 obtained a high consistency between the calculated and measured drag forces of a full scale net cage by considering the cage deformation and current speed reduction inside the net cage for different incoming current speeds consequently the evaluation of the interaction between fluid and net is necessary to estimate the drag force the data obtained from these field studies have assisted in understanding the phenomena thereby improving numerical approaches however the data measured using the depth gauge which was used to estimate the three dimensional deformation and calculate the cage volume and drag force on the net cage have not been verified in japan to ensure that stocked tuna have sufficient swimming space the size ratio of the net structure i e the ratio of the diameter to the height of the side netting of a circular net cage is generally approximately 2 8 zhao et al 2007 reported that the size ratio significantly affects net deformation however the above studies are based on net cages with size ratios less than 2 0 and almost no studies have focused on the hydrodynamic characteristics of net cages with a size ratio greater than 2 0 a review of the current reports on aquaculture engineering shows that the hydrodynamic characteristics of marine aquaculture net cages have been extensively studied while providing valuable results the hydrodynamic characteristics of cages often depend on the cage design and therefore may not be suitable for flexible aquaculture cages used for farming pacific bluefin tuna particularly for conventional design often used by local fish farmers in this study a scaled circular flexible net cage model was designed including bottom netting based on the actual full scale flexible net cage for pacific bluefin tuna farming this model was tested in a flume tank to analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow and flexible net cage such as the drag force cage volume and flow field inside and around the flexible net cage particularly for the flow field measurements a more comprehensive measurement was taken rather than only at one or two points based on these results the fluid structure interactions of the flexible net cage were discussed we also evaluated the method using only the depth data to estimate the cage volume and drag force 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiments were conducted in a flume tank at tokyo university of marine science and technology tokyo japan the flume tank was a horizontal and circular water channel and the flow was driven by impellers the length width and water depth of the test section were 9 0 2 2 and 1 6 m respectively according to the tauti s similarity law tauti 1934 the physical model fig 1 used in the experiments was created based on a full scale net cage that was used for farming pacific bluefin tunas table 1 shows the specifications of the physical model the twine diameter and mesh size of the netting were the mean values of ten random locations measured using an abs digimatic indicator standard type 547 301 mitutoyo co japan and digital calipers super caliper 500 774 mitutoyo co japan for a full scale net cage sinker and lead ropes were installed on the bottom netting and bottom frame line to reduce the cage deformation the model net cage was simplified by replacing the ropes with sinker weights as shown in fig 1 and 48 rib lines were distributed at equal intervals on the side netting and a bottom weight a of 4 0 g was attached at the bottom of each rib line eight bottom weights b each 3 7 g and sixteen bottom weights c each 0 31 g were evenly arranged along the rib line of the bottom netting total bottom weight mass was 226 5 g which was the original designed bottom weight all rib lines comprised 1 05 mm diamter cremona strings 2 2 drag force measurement we horizontally connected the net cage with a small snap shackle attached at the end of the strut fig 2 using a fishing line 1 2 mm diameter and 2 2 m length and measured the drag force acting on the model by attaching a small submersible load cell tlp 5ks tokyo measuring instruments co ltd maximum load 49 n to tow the net cage in the experiment only the snap shackle was under water the load cells were calibrated both at the beginning and end of each experiment and linearity was confirmed a propeller type current meter kenek vo1000 measurement range of 3 0 300 cm s was installed at approximately 1 8 m upstream of the model net cage and at the same depth as the middle of the depth of the net cage the current speed for this experiment varied from 5 0 to 50 0 cm s at steps of 5 0 cm s furthermore for each incoming current speed the drag force on the net cage was measured using different bottom weights attached 226 5 470 5 586 5 and 714 4 g the sinker weights attached to the bottom netting remain unchanged and only the sinker weights attached to the bottom frame line were changed the drag force signal measured using the small submersible load cell was amplified by a dynamic strain amplifier dpm 6h afterward this signal and current speed signal which was detected using a current meter were sent to an a d converter and thereafter to a computer in the experiment we recorded the mean of 400 data points obtained at a frequency of 20 hz in 20 s the measurement was performed twice at each incoming current speed the temperature of the water during the experiments ranged from 17 2 c to 18 5 c with such a flexible net cage the cage deformation affects the drag force to evaluate the deformation effect exerted on the drag force of the flexible net cage we defined the consistency indicator k as the ratio of the measured drag force which was affected by cage deformation to the calculated drag force which does not consider the deformation of the net cage we applied the formula proposed by nakamura 1991 which is based on the conservation of momentum equation only the drag force acting on the side netting was calculated 2 3 cage deformation measurement after measuring the drag force of the flexible model net cage using different bottom weight mass 226 5 470 5 586 5 and 714 4 g we photographed the model cage from the side and bottom of the flume tank observation port using two digital cameras as indicated in fig 2 the current speed of the uniform flow varied from 5 0 to 50 0 cm s at steps of 5 0 cm s three dimensional coordinate points of the net cage were necessary to calculate the volume of the deformed model to track the cage deformation we attached small 4 mm 35 mm light weight 0 36 g and waterproof leds hiromi sangyo co ltd to the model net cage as a marker as the net cage was symmetrical we attached 25 leds on half of the glass of the tank observation port with the centerline of the net cage which was also the central axis of the flow path as the axis of symmetry as shown in fig 3 a and b 20 leds were evenly placed on the side netting in four rows and five columns and five leds were evenly placed on the bottom netting the image in fig 3 c was captured in still water after the leds were placed on the model net cage from the images captured by both digital cameras we could obtain the three dimensional position of the leds using the matlab software however the estimation of these coordinates was affected by strains in the camera lens refraction of water and parallax we mitigated the effect caused by the strains using a board with 20 cm squares thereafter we interpolated the coordinates of the points that represented the shape of the net cage thereby allowing the volume of the deformed cage to be calculated with the scalar triple product method under different current speeds decew et al 2013 to confirm the impact of the leds on the measurement results of the drag force and cage deformation of the net cage we compared the results of this experiment with those of a preliminary test that was conducted without them to study fish farming some scientists use depth sensors attached to the full scale net cage to estimate the cage deformation and thereby determine the drag force lader et al 2008 klebert et al 2015 gansel et al 2018 however the accuracy of this method remains unclear to determine the accuracy of this method we used the z coordinates of the leds obtained from measurements of net cage deformation with bottom weights of 226 5 g and estimated the cage deformation by applying the method proposed by lader et al 2008 next we calculated the cage volume from the estimated cage deformation using the scalar triple product decew et al 2013 and drag force using the netting panel method gansel et al 2018 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 furthermore we derived a quantitative relationship between cage deformation and drag force exerted by a flexible net cage the dimensionless drag force d n was obtained by dividing the drag force exerted by the cage with the bottom weight the dimensionless cage volume v n was expressed as the ratio of the volume of the deformed cage at a given current speed to the volume of the nondeformed cage in static water 2 4 flow distribution measurement in this experiment we measured the current speed on the inside and outside of the flexible net cage with a bottom weight of 470 5 g under incoming speeds ranging from 25 0 to 40 0 cm s in steps of 5 0 cm s the origin was placed 20 cm upstream from the central axis of the cage fig 4 the direction of the flow was aligned with the x axis and the direction perpendicular to the water surface was aligned with the z axis furthermore the y axis was perpendicular to the x and z axes nine measurement points were set between 20 cm from upstream and 160 cm from the downstream along the x axis meanwhile along the y axis six measurement points were set on one side of the water path within 90 cm from the central line of the cage because of the symmetry of the cage along the z axis six points were also set between 10 and 35 cm below the water surface in fig 4 the black solid dots represent the measurement points the current speed was measured at a total of 324 points using a propeller type current meter kenek vo1000 measurement range of 3 0 300 cm s the measuring system recorded a mean of 400 data points obtained at a frequency of 20 hz in 20 s two measurements were performed at each current speed owing to the deformation of the net cage however the current speed at few positions could not be measured and we chose the locations of the measurements that were as close as possible as the current speed distribution in the observation channel was not necessarily uniform we also measured the current speed without the model net cage furthermore the ratio r of the current speed without u 0 and with u the cage was calculated using eq 1 and analyzed in matlab by creating a current speed distribution map per current speed 1 r u u 0 furthermore the net deformation which influenced the flow field distribution was directly affected by the bottom weight mass thus to compare the cage deformation effect under different bottom weights 226 5 470 5 586 5 and 714 4 g on the flow field we also measured the current speed at the same nine measurement points along the x axis at y 0 and z 20 cm and at incoming current speeds of 20 25 30 and 35 cm s 3 results 3 1 influence of the leds on the drag force and cage deformation measurements fig 5 a shows the relationship between the drag force on the net cage and current speed with and without the leds for all current speeds there was an insignificant increase in the drag force because of the led the mean relative error was 5 46 fig 5 b indicates the cage deformation at an incoming current speed of 30 cm s to examine the impact of the leds on the estimation of cage deformation the red circles which represent the observed values are relatively close to the solid line which shows the outline depicted by the leds and the relative errors for the x m and z m components of the three dimensional coordinates were 7 60 and 7 57 respectively therefore the application of the leds had limited effect on the drag force and shape of the model cage in our model tests however in the absence of leds the position was obtained visually in the case of leds under the action of water flow the leds might deviate slightly from the target position due to the weak binding these might lead to experimental uncertainty notably if the number of leds is increased the influences on results may be noticeable 3 2 drag force of the flexible net cage fig 6 shows some images of the cage model with different bottom weights at different incoming current speeds during drag force measurements as indicated in fig 6 the deformation which started at the bottom netting increased with the current speed furthermore the deformation of the front net was significantly greater than that of the rear net corroborating the results obtained in other researches huang et al 2006 lee et al 2008 lader and enerhaug 2005 moe et al 2010 shen et al 2018 by increasing the bottom weight mass from 226 5 to 714 4 g a significant decrease in cage deformation was observed fig 7 a shows the relationship between the drag force and current speed for each bottom weight case under different incoming current speeds at current speed values equal to or lower than 20 0 cm s the drag force was approximately proportional to the square of the current speed for all bottom weights by contrast the drag force linearly increased with the current speed when it was higher than 20 0 cm s furthermore the drag force increased with the bottom weight attached to the bottom netting of the net cage considering the lightest bottom weight the drag force increased to 9 50 n when the current speed was 50 0 cm s maximum furthermore at this speed the drag force acting on the cage whose bottom weight was 714 4 g was 1 91 higher than that whose bottom weight was 226 5 g we applied the formula proposed by nakamura 1991 to calculate the drag force and compared the results with the present measurements at low current speeds the experimental and analytical results were similar however as the current speed increased and the bottom weight decreased discrepancies between the calculated and measured values became noticeable fig 8 shows the ratio k of the measured drag force to the calculated drag force as a function of current speed for all cases k decreased with current speed and increased with the attached bottom weight considering all incoming current speeds the averaged k values were 0 89 0 70 0 66 and 0 60 for bottom weight of 714 4 586 5 470 5 and 226 5 g respectively 3 3 cage deformation of the flexible net cage an example of net cage attached leds at different incoming current speed is illustrated in fig 9 based on the three dimensional coordinates of leds we obtained the relationship of the cage volume and current speed for each bottom sinker weight fig 7 b for all bottom weight cases a nonlinear decrease in the cage volume occurred as the current speed increased furthermore the derivate of this relation was the highest at low current speed and tended to a stable value as the current speed increased considering the scenario of the lightest bottom weight 226 5 g and highest current speed 50 0 cm s the cage volume was reduced by 74 5 by contrast the volume obtained at the maximum current speed 50 0 cm s and heaviest bottom weight 714 4 g was 2 13 times higher than that with bottom weight mass of 226 5 g 3 4 flow distribution inside and outside the flexible net cage fig 10 a d shows the results of the flow field distribution inside and outside the net cage with bottom weight 470 5 g at the x z cross section when y 0 and at the x y cross section when z 20 cm under different incoming current speeds 25 0 30 0 35 0 and 40 0 cm s respectively a significant decrease in the current speed occurred along the x direction flow direction as the incoming current speed increased the current speed inside the net cage attenuation became larger the r u u 0 values at the center inside the net cage were 0 93 0 88 0 77 and 0 78 when the incoming current speeds were 25 0 30 0 35 0 and 40 0 cm s respectively furthermore significant current speed reductions occurred behind the net cage at the downstream for all incoming speeds the reduction in current speed downstream increased with increasing incoming current speeds in the measurement range the current speed reduction area downstream from the net cage was almost as wide as the cage diameter and the length was up to 1 33 times the cage diameters along the incoming current direction the location of this area gradually approached the water surface in the z direction as the current speed increased we analyzed the variations of the current speed along the central line based on the bottom weights and for various incoming current speeds as indicated in fig 11 and fig 12 the averaged ratio of the current speed to incoming current speed inside and downstream the net cage is listed in table 2 as shown in fig 12 for each bottom weight mass the current speed profile along the incoming flow direction was different based on the incoming current speeds this result is similar to that result presented in a previous study yao et al 2016 for the lightest bottom weigh case the average current speed ratios inside the net cage were 0 89 0 62 0 72 and 0 82 for the incoming speeds of 20 0 25 0 30 0 and 35 0 cm s respectively for all cases the maximum and minimum averaged current speed ratios were 0 97 and 0 62 inside the net cage and 0 93 and 0 54 at the downstream of the net cage respectively for each incoming current speed the highest current speed reduction occurred when the bottom weight mass was 226 5 g followed by the scenarios in which the masses were 470 5 586 5 and 714 4 g fig 11 this trend was similar to that of a previous research bi et al 2014a b the increase in the fluctuation with the current speed is also observed in figs 11 and 12 particularly inside the net cage this fluctuation was amplified as the incoming current speed increased 3 5 evaluation of cage deformation measurements using only the depth information to evaluate the accuracy of the estimation method for cage deformation using only the depth sensor we compared the estimates and measurements of the drag force and cage volume of the net cage model with a bottom weight of 226 5 g as indicated in fig 13 based on the comparison between the drag forces the measured values were much larger than the estimated values especially when the current speed increased as shown in fig 13 a the overall mean relative difference was 123 7 regarding the cage volume comparison fig 13 b the difference between the measured values and estimates increased with the current speed as in the evaluation of the drag force the overall mean relative difference was 16 7 4 discussions fig 7 a shows the approximation curve of the drag force which was proportional to the current speed raised to the power of 1 21 1 72 depending on the bottom weight mass attached to the bottom netting however the drag force of the towed objects or netting panel reported in previous research was proportional to the square of the current speed tsukrov et al 2011 the cage deformation was the main reason for this discrepancy which caused a reduction in the projected area and increased the netting solidity blocking the water flow as demonstrated in fig 8 this k value is useful for correcting empirical formulas and could be applied to calculate the drag force of deformed net cages particularly when considering designs of actual marine aquaculture net cages this indicates that the drag force of the flexible net cage significantly depended on the deformation of the net cage the dimensionless drag force of flexible net cage decreased with dimensionless cage volume and the negative correlation was very strong fig 14 the dimensionless drag force could also be approximated using the following curve which agreed with the trend obtained in previous studies moe føre et al 2016 2 d n 3 22 v n 2 9 97 v n 6 77 the direct measurement of the drag force for a full scale net cage placed in the actual sea site may not be possible as an alternative a depth sensor could be used to measure the deformation of the cage thereby obtaining a cage volume estimation klebert et al 2015 lader et al 2008 which would be used in eq 2 to calculate the drag force however using depth sensors to measure the cage deformation a discrepancy occurred between the estimated and real cage volumes because of the small number of known points particularly at a high current speed and as each net part of the cage deformed in multiple directions overall the depth sensors can be qualitatively used to indicate the intensity of cage deformation a deviation in the quantitative calculation of cage volume should be expected as observed from fig 10 a reduced current speed area gradually approximated the water surface as the current speed increased and water flows inside the net cage generating flow fluctuations because of the large deformation of the upstream netting and the bottom netting was blown up owing to the large deformation of the net cage caused by a high incoming current speed the current speed inside the net cage was not always reduced and the local acceleration of the fluid was also occurred as shown in figs 11 and 12 meanwhile the averaged ratio u u in of current speed to incoming current speed inside and downstream from the net cage is plotted against normalized cage deformation v n as presented in fig 15 the changes in u u in were relatively scattered but u u in of both inside and downstream net cage generally had an increasing trend when the v n was increased therefore it can be seen that the cage deformation had an important influence on water flow through the flexible net cage additionally the u u in values inside the net cage were more scattered than downstream thus we mainly considered the turbulence generated inside the net cage due to cage deformation and local acceleration gansel et al 2012 and gansel et al 2018 also supported this conclusion as they reported that the deformation of the upstream net might block the flow path and the current might be redirected for a flexible net cage the current net deformation and drag forces continuously interact with each other resulting in a complex phenomenon the current speed reduction model is an approach to approximately estimate the flow field however it is difficult to determine the current flow fluctuation using this model moe føre et al 2016 also reported that a basic current reduction model is insufficient to illustrate the interaction between the flexible net and fluid flow in addition the turbulence or vortex flow in the net cage may damage the stocked fish due to the complex water flow in the net cage the fish may concentrate on a part of the net cage and swim resulting in wasted space inoue et al 1996 the cfd methods are expected to solve this problem and following the work of devilliers et al 2016 and chen and christensen 2017 our experimental findings help validate these methods additionally the deformation of the floating collar frame of full scale can often be seen fig 16 while we did not find the deformation visible to the naked eye in our model tests this is mainly because the experimental setting current speeds were not enough to cause frame deformation however if the current speed becomes stronger the deformation of the collar frame may occur the deformation of the collar frame is closely related to the stable production of tuna farming and it is worth conducting future research in this area 5 conclusions to understand the fluid structure interaction of a flexible net cage used to farm pacific bluefin tuna thunnus orientalis we conducted a series of tests using a cage model to measure the hydrodynamic characteristics of a flexible net cage in a uniform flow such as the drag force cage volume and flow field inside and outside the net cage based on different bottom weights attached to it the main conclusions from this study are the following a significant deformation of the flexible net cage was observed meanwhile the drag force and cage deformation respectively increased and decreased with the bottom weight mass a strong negative correlation between the drag force and cage volumes was found the fluid structure interactions between the flexible net cage and the water were relatively complex for example the reduction of the current speed inside the net cage at the downstream was significantly different depending on the bottom weights and incoming current speed however the averaged current speed ratios inside and at the downstream of the flexible net cage could be obtained the application of the depth sensors to estimate the drag force and cage volume was also evaluated our results can be used to improve and optimize the design of flexible net cage structures by suggesting that cage deformation and current speed interactions should be considered in numerical models in addition our future works will explore the effect of fish school behavior on the characteristics of the flexible net cage and flow credit authorship contribution statement shuchuang dong conceptualization methodology investigation software data curation writing original draft xinxing you investigation writing

20918,resource protection of pacific bluefin tuna thunnus orientalis fish catching has become stringent over the past years meanwhile tuna farming in japan the largest consumer of this fish using a circular flexible net cage is continuously growing as a promising business a stable aquaculture production of tuna can be achieved by understanding the characteristics such as a clean environment and space in the net cage and flow inside and near the circular flexible net cage we measured the drag force cage deformation and flow field inside and around a scaled net cage model composed of different bottom weights under various incoming current speeds in a flume tank results indicated that the drag force and cage volume increased and decreased respectively with the bottom weight owing to the significant deformation of the flexible net cage a complex fluid structure interaction occurred and a strong negative correlation between the drag force and cage volume was obtained furthermore an area where the current speed was often reduced was identified the intensity of this reduction depended on the incoming current speed however in particular cases this reduction did not occur or a local acceleration of the fluid was observed in this work the depth data of several positions on the net cage were also analyzed to verify if it could be used to estimate the cage volume the findings of this study can be used to understand and design optimal flexible net cage structures which can be used for modern aquaculture keywords drag force cage volume flexible net cage fluid structure interaction flow field distribution pacific bluefin tuna 1 introduction the regulation regarding pacific bluefin tuna thunnus orientalis catches which were elaborated by resource management committees such as the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tuna has continuously tightened each year since 2018 japan has adopted the total allowable catch tac regulation for pacific bluefin tuna and introduced penal sanctions fisheries agency 2018 however japan which is the top global consumer of bluefin tuna needs to secure a stable supply of pacific bluefin tuna that considers these strict regulations therefore tuna farming has attracted attention as a promising supply alternative resulting in the continuous growth of this business fisheries agency 2019 in japan two types of circular net cages are used for tuna farming floating rope and high density polyethylene hdpe floating collar net cages furthermore the cylinder side netting bottom netting and bottom weight such as sinkers sinker ropes or lead rope which are usually attached on the bottom netting are the elements of the circular net cages in the sea the aquaculture net cage system is subjected to hydrodynamic loads which may cause damage the system the cage volume may be reduced because of the hydrodynamic loads causing injury and stress to the stocked fish in particular the infection of the epithelial scratches caused by friction and collision of the nets may be lethal to the pacific bluefin tuna which are fast swimmers therefore determining such hydrodynamic characteristics of the flexible net cages is important the hydrodynamic force and cage deformation of similar net cages have been studied in previous studies based on tank model tests cha and lee 2018 fu et al 1994 moe et al 2010 zhan et al 2006 in their work the deformation of the net cage was based on its cross section two dimensions instead of its three dimensional volume only few studies have measured the three dimensional deformation of net cage dong et al 2020 lader and enerhaug 2005 yang et al 2008 moreover with the development in technology numerical simulations have been conducted in many studies regarding the subject of this work to analyze the influence of uniform flow pure wave and current wave conditions on the net cage huang et al 2006 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 klebert and su 2013 lee et al 2008 moe føre et al 2016 shen et al 2018 tsukrov et al 2003 xu et al 2013 although the hydrodynamic forces of these numerical models were verified the cage deformation when verified was qualitatively analyzed or the cross sectional area was used instead of the cage volume in the validation of these models recently martin and bihs 2021 proposed a novel model for the simulation of non linear dynamic behavior of porous tensile structure which compared the numerical results of the cage volume reductions with that of the experimental results obtained by lader and enerhaug 2005 furthermore the flow inside and around the net cage is the basis to calculate the hydrodynamic force and cage shape nakamura 1991 used the conservation of momentum equation to calculate the drag force on a nondeformed net cage while considering the decrease in the downstream current speed the results obtained by nakamura 1991 are consistent with the experimentally determined drag force exerted on a wire netting cage lee et al 2008 numerically simulated the deformation of a circular cage with and without considering the current speed reduction ratio 15 inside a net cage and compared the results with experimental findings they determined that the simulation error is less than 5 when the shielding effect is considered an empirical formula derived by løland 1991 has been used in the numerical modeling dong et al 2020 moe føre et al 2016 shen et al 2018 but did not consider the deformation of the net in this formulation the flow field also determines the water exchange the supply of dissolved oxygen and nutrients and the removal of waste wu et al 2014 klebert and su 2020 hence it should be analyzed before evaluating the structural design and field layout of the net other researchers used computational fluid dynamics cfd to numerically investigate the flow inside and around the net cage bi et al 2014a b chen and christensen 2017 winthereig rasmussen et al 2016 yao et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 recently martin et al 2021 presented a new cfd framework for modeling the fluid structure interaction of open ocean aquaculture structures all these cfd simulations have been verified using experimental measurements performed in flume tanks and the results of full scale experiments however in the verification experiments the flow field was mainly along the flow direction hence the depth direction was not appropriately measured moreover a single measurement point inside the net cage is insufficient thus experimental measurements of the flow field inside and around net cages are still required particularly for detailed measurement of the flow field inside and around the flexible net cages several researchers have also conducted field measurements to analyze the tension force of the mooring system fredriksson et al 2003 huang et al 2010 furthermore studies conducted to measure the three dimensional shape of full scale net cages using depth or acoustic sensors decew et al 2013 dong et al 2017 klebert et al 2015 lader et al 2008 gansel et al 2018 obtained a high consistency between the calculated and measured drag forces of a full scale net cage by considering the cage deformation and current speed reduction inside the net cage for different incoming current speeds consequently the evaluation of the interaction between fluid and net is necessary to estimate the drag force the data obtained from these field studies have assisted in understanding the phenomena thereby improving numerical approaches however the data measured using the depth gauge which was used to estimate the three dimensional deformation and calculate the cage volume and drag force on the net cage have not been verified in japan to ensure that stocked tuna have sufficient swimming space the size ratio of the net structure i e the ratio of the diameter to the height of the side netting of a circular net cage is generally approximately 2 8 zhao et al 2007 reported that the size ratio significantly affects net deformation however the above studies are based on net cages with size ratios less than 2 0 and almost no studies have focused on the hydrodynamic characteristics of net cages with a size ratio greater than 2 0 a review of the current reports on aquaculture engineering shows that the hydrodynamic characteristics of marine aquaculture net cages have been extensively studied while providing valuable results the hydrodynamic characteristics of cages often depend on the cage design and therefore may not be suitable for flexible aquaculture cages used for farming pacific bluefin tuna particularly for conventional design often used by local fish farmers in this study a scaled circular flexible net cage model was designed including bottom netting based on the actual full scale flexible net cage for pacific bluefin tuna farming this model was tested in a flume tank to analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow and flexible net cage such as the drag force cage volume and flow field inside and around the flexible net cage particularly for the flow field measurements a more comprehensive measurement was taken rather than only at one or two points based on these results the fluid structure interactions of the flexible net cage were discussed we also evaluated the method using only the depth data to estimate the cage volume and drag force 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiments were conducted in a flume tank at tokyo university of marine science and technology tokyo japan the flume tank was a horizontal and circular water channel and the flow was driven by impellers the length width and water depth of the test section were 9 0 2 2 and 1 6 m respectively according to the tauti s similarity law tauti 1934 the physical model fig 1 used in the experiments was created based on a full scale net cage that was used for farming pacific bluefin tunas table 1 shows the specifications of the physical model the twine diameter and mesh size of the netting were the mean values of ten random locations measured using an abs digimatic indicator standard type 547 301 mitutoyo co japan and digital calipers super caliper 500 774 mitutoyo co japan for a full scale net cage sinker and lead ropes were installed on the bottom netting and bottom frame line to reduce the cage deformation the model net cage was simplified by replacing the ropes with sinker weights as shown in fig 1 and 48 rib lines were distributed at equal intervals on the side netting and a bottom weight a of 4 0 g was attached at the bottom of each rib line eight bottom weights b each 3 7 g and sixteen bottom weights c each 0 31 g were evenly arranged along the rib line of the bottom netting total bottom weight mass was 226 5 g which was the original designed bottom weight all rib lines comprised 1 05 mm diamter cremona strings 2 2 drag force measurement we horizontally connected the net cage with a small snap shackle attached at the end of the strut fig 2 using a fishing line 1 2 mm diameter and 2 2 m length and measured the drag force acting on the model by attaching a small submersible load cell tlp 5ks tokyo measuring instruments co ltd maximum load 49 n to tow the net cage in the experiment only the snap shackle was under water the load cells were calibrated both at the beginning and end of each experiment and linearity was confirmed a propeller type current meter kenek vo1000 measurement range of 3 0 300 cm s was installed at approximately 1 8 m upstream of the model net cage and at the same depth as the middle of the depth of the net cage the current speed for this experiment varied from 5 0 to 50 0 cm s at steps of 5 0 cm s furthermore for each incoming current speed the drag force on the net cage was measured using different bottom weights attached 226 5 470 5 586 5 and 714 4 g the sinker weights attached to the bottom netting remain unchanged and only the sinker weights attached to the bottom frame line were changed the drag force signal measured using the small submersible load cell was amplified by a dynamic strain amplifier dpm 6h afterward this signal and current speed signal which was detected using a current meter were sent to an a d converter and thereafter to a computer in the experiment we recorded the mean of 400 data points obtained at a frequency of 20 hz in 20 s the measurement was performed twice at each incoming current speed the temperature of the water during the experiments ranged from 17 2 c to 18 5 c with such a flexible net cage the cage deformation affects the drag force to evaluate the deformation effect exerted on the drag force of the flexible net cage we defined the consistency indicator k as the ratio of the measured drag force which was affected by cage deformation to the calculated drag force which does not consider the deformation of the net cage we applied the formula proposed by nakamura 1991 which is based on the conservation of momentum equation only the drag force acting on the side netting was calculated 2 3 cage deformation measurement after measuring the drag force of the flexible model net cage using different bottom weight mass 226 5 470 5 586 5 and 714 4 g we photographed the model cage from the side and bottom of the flume tank observation port using two digital cameras as indicated in fig 2 the current speed of the uniform flow varied from 5 0 to 50 0 cm s at steps of 5 0 cm s three dimensional coordinate points of the net cage were necessary to calculate the volume of the deformed model to track the cage deformation we attached small 4 mm 35 mm light weight 0 36 g and waterproof leds hiromi sangyo co ltd to the model net cage as a marker as the net cage was symmetrical we attached 25 leds on half of the glass of the tank observation port with the centerline of the net cage which was also the central axis of the flow path as the axis of symmetry as shown in fig 3 a and b 20 leds were evenly placed on the side netting in four rows and five columns and five leds were evenly placed on the bottom netting the image in fig 3 c was captured in still water after the leds were placed on the model net cage from the images captured by both digital cameras we could obtain the three dimensional position of the leds using the matlab software however the estimation of these coordinates was affected by strains in the camera lens refraction of water and parallax we mitigated the effect caused by the strains using a board with 20 cm squares thereafter we interpolated the coordinates of the points that represented the shape of the net cage thereby allowing the volume of the deformed cage to be calculated with the scalar triple product method under different current speeds decew et al 2013 to confirm the impact of the leds on the measurement results of the drag force and cage deformation of the net cage we compared the results of this experiment with those of a preliminary test that was conducted without them to study fish farming some scientists use depth sensors attached to the full scale net cage to estimate the cage deformation and thereby determine the drag force lader et al 2008 klebert et al 2015 gansel et al 2018 however the accuracy of this method remains unclear to determine the accuracy of this method we used the z coordinates of the leds obtained from measurements of net cage deformation with bottom weights of 226 5 g and estimated the cage deformation by applying the method proposed by lader et al 2008 next we calculated the cage volume from the estimated cage deformation using the scalar triple product decew et al 2013 and drag force using the netting panel method gansel et al 2018 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 furthermore we derived a quantitative relationship between cage deformation and drag force exerted by a flexible net cage the dimensionless drag force d n was obtained by dividing the drag force exerted by the cage with the bottom weight the dimensionless cage volume v n was expressed as the ratio of the volume of the deformed cage at a given current speed to the volume of the nondeformed cage in static water 2 4 flow distribution measurement in this experiment we measured the current speed on the inside and outside of the flexible net cage with a bottom weight of 470 5 g under incoming speeds ranging from 25 0 to 40 0 cm s in steps of 5 0 cm s the origin was placed 20 cm upstream from the central axis of the cage fig 4 the direction of the flow was aligned with the x axis and the direction perpendicular to the water surface was aligned with the z axis furthermore the y axis was perpendicular to the x and z axes nine measurement points were set between 20 cm from upstream and 160 cm from the downstream along the x axis meanwhile along the y axis six measurement points were set on one side of the water path within 90 cm from the central line of the cage because of the symmetry of the cage along the z axis six points were also set between 10 and 35 cm below the water surface in fig 4 the black solid dots represent the measurement points the current speed was measured at a total of 324 points using a propeller type current meter kenek vo1000 measurement range of 3 0 300 cm s the measuring system recorded a mean of 400 data points obtained at a frequency of 20 hz in 20 s two measurements were performed at each current speed owing to the deformation of the net cage however the current speed at few positions could not be measured and we chose the locations of the measurements that were as close as possible as the current speed distribution in the observation channel was not necessarily uniform we also measured the current speed without the model net cage furthermore the ratio r of the current speed without u 0 and with u the cage was calculated using eq 1 and analyzed in matlab by creating a current speed distribution map per current speed 1 r u u 0 furthermore the net deformation which influenced the flow field distribution was directly affected by the bottom weight mass thus to compare the cage deformation effect under different bottom weights 226 5 470 5 586 5 and 714 4 g on the flow field we also measured the current speed at the same nine measurement points along the x axis at y 0 and z 20 cm and at incoming current speeds of 20 25 30 and 35 cm s 3 results 3 1 influence of the leds on the drag force and cage deformation measurements fig 5 a shows the relationship between the drag force on the net cage and current speed with and without the leds for all current speeds there was an insignificant increase in the drag force because of the led the mean relative error was 5 46 fig 5 b indicates the cage deformation at an incoming current speed of 30 cm s to examine the impact of the leds on the estimation of cage deformation the red circles which represent the observed values are relatively close to the solid line which shows the outline depicted by the leds and the relative errors for the x m and z m components of the three dimensional coordinates were 7 60 and 7 57 respectively therefore the application of the leds had limited effect on the drag force and shape of the model cage in our model tests however in the absence of leds the position was obtained visually in the case of leds under the action of water flow the leds might deviate slightly from the target position due to the weak binding these might lead to experimental uncertainty notably if the number of leds is increased the influences on results may be noticeable 3 2 drag force of the flexible net cage fig 6 shows some images of the cage model with different bottom weights at different incoming current speeds during drag force measurements as indicated in fig 6 the deformation which started at the bottom netting increased with the current speed furthermore the deformation of the front net was significantly greater than that of the rear net corroborating the results obtained in other researches huang et al 2006 lee et al 2008 lader and enerhaug 2005 moe et al 2010 shen et al 2018 by increasing the bottom weight mass from 226 5 to 714 4 g a significant decrease in cage deformation was observed fig 7 a shows the relationship between the drag force and current speed for each bottom weight case under different incoming current speeds at current speed values equal to or lower than 20 0 cm s the drag force was approximately proportional to the square of the current speed for all bottom weights by contrast the drag force linearly increased with the current speed when it was higher than 20 0 cm s furthermore the drag force increased with the bottom weight attached to the bottom netting of the net cage considering the lightest bottom weight the drag force increased to 9 50 n when the current speed was 50 0 cm s maximum furthermore at this speed the drag force acting on the cage whose bottom weight was 714 4 g was 1 91 higher than that whose bottom weight was 226 5 g we applied the formula proposed by nakamura 1991 to calculate the drag force and compared the results with the present measurements at low current speeds the experimental and analytical results were similar however as the current speed increased and the bottom weight decreased discrepancies between the calculated and measured values became noticeable fig 8 shows the ratio k of the measured drag force to the calculated drag force as a function of current speed for all cases k decreased with current speed and increased with the attached bottom weight considering all incoming current speeds the averaged k values were 0 89 0 70 0 66 and 0 60 for bottom weight of 714 4 586 5 470 5 and 226 5 g respectively 3 3 cage deformation of the flexible net cage an example of net cage attached leds at different incoming current speed is illustrated in fig 9 based on the three dimensional coordinates of leds we obtained the relationship of the cage volume and current speed for each bottom sinker weight fig 7 b for all bottom weight cases a nonlinear decrease in the cage volume occurred as the current speed increased furthermore the derivate of this relation was the highest at low current speed and tended to a stable value as the current speed increased considering the scenario of the lightest bottom weight 226 5 g and highest current speed 50 0 cm s the cage volume was reduced by 74 5 by contrast the volume obtained at the maximum current speed 50 0 cm s and heaviest bottom weight 714 4 g was 2 13 times higher than that with bottom weight mass of 226 5 g 3 4 flow distribution inside and outside the flexible net cage fig 10 a d shows the results of the flow field distribution inside and outside the net cage with bottom weight 470 5 g at the x z cross section when y 0 and at the x y cross section when z 20 cm under different incoming current speeds 25 0 30 0 35 0 and 40 0 cm s respectively a significant decrease in the current speed occurred along the x direction flow direction as the incoming current speed increased the current speed inside the net cage attenuation became larger the r u u 0 values at the center inside the net cage were 0 93 0 88 0 77 and 0 78 when the incoming current speeds were 25 0 30 0 35 0 and 40 0 cm s respectively furthermore significant current speed reductions occurred behind the net cage at the downstream for all incoming speeds the reduction in current speed downstream increased with increasing incoming current speeds in the measurement range the current speed reduction area downstream from the net cage was almost as wide as the cage diameter and the length was up to 1 33 times the cage diameters along the incoming current direction the location of this area gradually approached the water surface in the z direction as the current speed increased we analyzed the variations of the current speed along the central line based on the bottom weights and for various incoming current speeds as indicated in fig 11 and fig 12 the averaged ratio of the current speed to incoming current speed inside and downstream the net cage is listed in table 2 as shown in fig 12 for each bottom weight mass the current speed profile along the incoming flow direction was different based on the incoming current speeds this result is similar to that result presented in a previous study yao et al 2016 for the lightest bottom weigh case the average current speed ratios inside the net cage were 0 89 0 62 0 72 and 0 82 for the incoming speeds of 20 0 25 0 30 0 and 35 0 cm s respectively for all cases the maximum and minimum averaged current speed ratios were 0 97 and 0 62 inside the net cage and 0 93 and 0 54 at the downstream of the net cage respectively for each incoming current speed the highest current speed reduction occurred when the bottom weight mass was 226 5 g followed by the scenarios in which the masses were 470 5 586 5 and 714 4 g fig 11 this trend was similar to that of a previous research bi et al 2014a b the increase in the fluctuation with the current speed is also observed in figs 11 and 12 particularly inside the net cage this fluctuation was amplified as the incoming current speed increased 3 5 evaluation of cage deformation measurements using only the depth information to evaluate the accuracy of the estimation method for cage deformation using only the depth sensor we compared the estimates and measurements of the drag force and cage volume of the net cage model with a bottom weight of 226 5 g as indicated in fig 13 based on the comparison between the drag forces the measured values were much larger than the estimated values especially when the current speed increased as shown in fig 13 a the overall mean relative difference was 123 7 regarding the cage volume comparison fig 13 b the difference between the measured values and estimates increased with the current speed as in the evaluation of the drag force the overall mean relative difference was 16 7 4 discussions fig 7 a shows the approximation curve of the drag force which was proportional to the current speed raised to the power of 1 21 1 72 depending on the bottom weight mass attached to the bottom netting however the drag force of the towed objects or netting panel reported in previous research was proportional to the square of the current speed tsukrov et al 2011 the cage deformation was the main reason for this discrepancy which caused a reduction in the projected area and increased the netting solidity blocking the water flow as demonstrated in fig 8 this k value is useful for correcting empirical formulas and could be applied to calculate the drag force of deformed net cages particularly when considering designs of actual marine aquaculture net cages this indicates that the drag force of the flexible net cage significantly depended on the deformation of the net cage the dimensionless drag force of flexible net cage decreased with dimensionless cage volume and the negative correlation was very strong fig 14 the dimensionless drag force could also be approximated using the following curve which agreed with the trend obtained in previous studies moe føre et al 2016 2 d n 3 22 v n 2 9 97 v n 6 77 the direct measurement of the drag force for a full scale net cage placed in the actual sea site may not be possible as an alternative a depth sensor could be used to measure the deformation of the cage thereby obtaining a cage volume estimation klebert et al 2015 lader et al 2008 which would be used in eq 2 to calculate the drag force however using depth sensors to measure the cage deformation a discrepancy occurred between the estimated and real cage volumes because of the small number of known points particularly at a high current speed and as each net part of the cage deformed in multiple directions overall the depth sensors can be qualitatively used to indicate the intensity of cage deformation a deviation in the quantitative calculation of cage volume should be expected as observed from fig 10 a reduced current speed area gradually approximated the water surface as the current speed increased and water flows inside the net cage generating flow fluctuations because of the large deformation of the upstream netting and the bottom netting was blown up owing to the large deformation of the net cage caused by a high incoming current speed the current speed inside the net cage was not always reduced and the local acceleration of the fluid was also occurred as shown in figs 11 and 12 meanwhile the averaged ratio u u in of current speed to incoming current speed inside and downstream from the net cage is plotted against normalized cage deformation v n as presented in fig 15 the changes in u u in were relatively scattered but u u in of both inside and downstream net cage generally had an increasing trend when the v n was increased therefore it can be seen that the cage deformation had an important influence on water flow through the flexible net cage additionally the u u in values inside the net cage were more scattered than downstream thus we mainly considered the turbulence generated inside the net cage due to cage deformation and local acceleration gansel et al 2012 and gansel et al 2018 also supported this conclusion as they reported that the deformation of the upstream net might block the flow path and the current might be redirected for a flexible net cage the current net deformation and drag forces continuously interact with each other resulting in a complex phenomenon the current speed reduction model is an approach to approximately estimate the flow field however it is difficult to determine the current flow fluctuation using this model moe føre et al 2016 also reported that a basic current reduction model is insufficient to illustrate the interaction between the flexible net and fluid flow in addition the turbulence or vortex flow in the net cage may damage the stocked fish due to the complex water flow in the net cage the fish may concentrate on a part of the net cage and swim resulting in wasted space inoue et al 1996 the cfd methods are expected to solve this problem and following the work of devilliers et al 2016 and chen and christensen 2017 our experimental findings help validate these methods additionally the deformation of the floating collar frame of full scale can often be seen fig 16 while we did not find the deformation visible to the naked eye in our model tests this is mainly because the experimental setting current speeds were not enough to cause frame deformation however if the current speed becomes stronger the deformation of the collar frame may occur the deformation of the collar frame is closely related to the stable production of tuna farming and it is worth conducting future research in this area 5 conclusions to understand the fluid structure interaction of a flexible net cage used to farm pacific bluefin tuna thunnus orientalis we conducted a series of tests using a cage model to measure the hydrodynamic characteristics of a flexible net cage in a uniform flow such as the drag force cage volume and flow field inside and outside the net cage based on different bottom weights attached to it the main conclusions from this study are the following a significant deformation of the flexible net cage was observed meanwhile the drag force and cage deformation respectively increased and decreased with the bottom weight mass a strong negative correlation between the drag force and cage volumes was found the fluid structure interactions between the flexible net cage and the water were relatively complex for example the reduction of the current speed inside the net cage at the downstream was significantly different depending on the bottom weights and incoming current speed however the averaged current speed ratios inside and at the downstream of the flexible net cage could be obtained the application of the depth sensors to estimate the drag force and cage volume was also evaluated our results can be used to improve and optimize the design of flexible net cage structures by suggesting that cage deformation and current speed interactions should be considered in numerical models in addition our future works will explore the effect of fish school behavior on the characteristics of the flexible net cage and flow credit authorship contribution statement shuchuang dong conceptualization methodology investigation software data curation writing original draft xinxing you investigation writing

20919,currents may make underwater glider deviate from desirable motion trajectory seriously which will obstruct the smooth progress of underwater exploration mission this paper attempts to study an analysis method and a compensation strategy of the glider motion accuracy considering uncertain current first the dynamic model of an underwater glider is established and the model is validated by experimental data measured in the south china sea next we present an evaluation parameter of the glider motion accuracy then the motion accuracy of the glider with different control parameters values is quantitatively analyzed by monte carlo method when the uncertainty of current is considered the uncertain parameters of current include position direction intensity and action depth in addition to reconcile simulation accuracy with efficiency we install a stopping rule for monte carlo simulation mcs based on the relative error of mean estimation then to improve the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current a feedback control strategy that intermittently corrects the yaw angle is proposed finally we verify the validity of the feedback control strategy and analyze its applicable

exploration has become a worldwide research hotspot therefore various types of underwater exploration robots are developed including underwater glider the concept of underwater glider was first proposed by stommel 1989 and had attracted wide attention generally the glider is designed as a winged underwater vehicle without external propulsion the glider can change attitude by adjusting the position of movable internal mass block and it can move up and down by adjusting the net buoyancy in addition the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the wings make the glider move forward in view of the above driving mode the glider can achieve long term underwater exploration by consuming less energy thus it can be seen that underwater glider has wide application prospect at present various types of underwater gliders have been developed successfully such as slocum webb et al 2001 spray sherman et al 2001 seaglider eriksen et al 2001 petrel wang et al 2011 and sea wing yu et al 2011 in the development process of underwater glider it is important to study the glider performance and control strategy by using dynamic theory and methods in this regard many scholars have carried out relevant researches at present many methods have been applied to the dynamic modeling of the glider successfully such as newton euler method leonard and graver 2001 second lagrange equation wang et al 2006 gibbs appell equation wang and wang 2009 differential geometry method wang et al 2014 and kirchoff equation gu et al 2016 in addition yang et al 2011 established the dynamic model of the glider formation by using the kane s method though the deduction processes are different the aims of above methods are all to obtain the differential equations of the glider motion the hydrodynamic characteristics affect the glider performance directly so they need to be analyzed in advance when establishing dynamic model of the glider we need to obtain the hydrodynamic equations in advance at present the analysis methods of hydrodynamic characteristics mainly include experimental method williams et al 2008 computational fluid dynamic cfd method zhang et al 2013 and analytical method zhao et al 2016 among them the cfd method reconciles analysis accuracy with cost so it is used widely based on dynamic model and cfd method many significant researches have been carried out bhatta and leonard 2003 studied the stability control method and path following ability of the glider after simplifying dynamic equations mahmoudian et al 2010 presented approximate analytical expressions for steady turning motion of the glider yu et al 2013 and yang et al 2019 established energy consumption models of underwater gliders and presented optimization methods of motion parameters to minimize energy consumption zhao et al 2015 and niu et al 2017 gave the control parameters ranges that ensured the stable motion of underwater gliders by using the lyapunov stability theory yang et al 2016 designed an underwater glider dock whose entrance direction could be adjusted and they proposed corresponding guidance algorithm liu et al 2016 discovered the glider anti helical motion and analyzed its causes yang et al 2017 analyzed the effects of hull deformation and seawater density variation on the deep sea glider motion and designed corresponding compensation strategy petritoli et al 2019 petritoli and leccese 2018 studied the high accuracy control system of an underwater glider to promote the achievement of the glider precision operation and their research team employed the takagi sugeno fuzzy logic modelling to achieve the longitudinal control of the glider leccese et al 2019 to improve the glider hydrodynamic performance li et al 2018 and fu et al 2018 proposed the optimization methods of the glider shape to obtain the maximum advance velocity of underwater glider in finite depth water yoon and kim 2018 presented the optimization method of the glider motion trajectory zhou et al 2020 studied the vertical motion characteristics of disc type glider with zero pitch angle lyu et al 2019 analyzed the effect of winglet on the motion performance of blended wing body glider in addition to the above works there are many researches about the motion characteristics and control methods of underwater gliders in currents fan and woolsey 2014 established the dynamic model of underwater glider considering the effects of current velocity and velocity gradient then fan and woolsey 2014 designed the attitude controller of the glider in nonuniform currents by using pid algorithm based on the work of yang et al 2011 xue et al 2015 established the dynamic model of underwater glider formation considering the effect of current after carrying out dynamic simulation xue et al 2015 discovered that the current had an obvious effect on the motion trajectory of the geometry center of the glider formation based on the particle dynamic model and the differential evolution algorithm zamuda et al 2016 proposed the path planning method of underwater glider in currents through dynamic simulation gu et al 2018 studied the effect of uniform current on the glider motion parameters such as attitude angles and motion velocity su et al 2019 proposed a control method that could weaken the effect of current on the glider attitude based on reinforcement learning and active disturbance rejection control in our previous work wu et al 2021 we proposed a method to establish the dynamic model of underwater glider considering the effect of different current direction besides we analyzed the effect of currents with different directions on the glider motion accuracy by using experimental design method wu et al 2021 the previous research results illustrate that currents have an obvious effect on the glider motion however existing references have never fully considered the uncertainty of current to evaluate the glider motion accuracy and have never given the corresponding compensation strategy of motion accuracy because of the complexity and variability of the actual current it is necessary to consider the uncertainty of current to analyze the glider motion characteristics in some high accuracy exploration missions we need to let the glider move at a specific trajectory as much as possible therefore it is significant to give the compensation strategy of motion accuracy of the glider in uncertain current in view of this we will carry out the above research in this paper the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the dynamic model of an underwater glider is established and it is validated by experimental data in section 3 the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current is quantitatively analyzed by monte carlo method with a stopping rule in section 4 a compensation strategy of motion accuracy is proposed and it is validated by dynamic simulation section 5 summarizes the main contributions 2 dynamic model of underwater glider in this paper petrel ii underwater glider is taken as the research object whose whole configuration is shown in fig 1 petrel ii has a cylindrically actuated movable internal mass block therefore the glider can adjust attitude by translating and rotating the movable internal mass block in addition the glider can adjust net buoyancy by changing the external bladder volume thus the control parameters of petrel ii include the net buoyancy adjustment amount c 1 the movable internal mass block translation amount c 2 and the movable internal mass block rotation amount c 3 for convenience the state where c 1 c 2 and c 3 are all equal to 0 is defined as the original state under the original state the buoyancy and gravity of the glider are equal in value opposite and collinear in direction when the glider is placed horizontally when c 1 and c 2 are not equal to 0 but c 3 is equal to 0 the glider will glide in vertical plane in still water when c 1 c 2 and c 3 are not equal to 0 the glider will glide spirally in still water since the c 1 is generally little the volume change amount of external bladder is little therefore when establishing the dynamic model we can ignore the position change of the glider barycenter caused by changing external bladder volume besides the external bladder buoyancy center o e can be regarded as a fixed point then we divide the glider into two parts including the movable internal mass block and the glider body all parts except the movable internal mass block in this paper the above two parts are both regarded as rigid bodies the mass of movable internal mass block is denoted as m p and the mass of glider body is denoted as m b 2 1 kinematic equations first we define four rectangular coordinate frames which are the inertial frame the first glider body frame the second glider body frame and the movable internal mass block frame all coordinate frames obey the right hand rule for convenience we let x y z denote the inertial frame x b1 y b1 z b1 denote the first glider body frame x b2 y b2 z b2 denote the second glider body frame and x p y p z p denote the movable internal mass block frame as shown in fig 2 here o denotes the origin of x y z the x axis and y axis form the horizontal plane and the z axis is parallel to the direction of gravity x b1 y b1 z b1 is fixed on the glider body and its origin is the whole glider buoyancy center under the original state which is denoted as o b the x b1 axis coincides with the longitudinal axis of the glider and the z b1 axis points to the glider bottom x b2 y b2 z b2 is obtained by rotating x b1 y b1 z b1 around z b1 axis by π rad in addition x p y p z p is fixed on the movable internal mass block and its origin is the movable internal mass block barycenter which is denoted as o p under the original state the attitudes of x y z x b1 y b1 z b1 and x p y p z p are identical in addition o b and o p are taken as the motion observation points of the glider body and the movable internal mass block respectively to illustrate the cross product of vectors more clearly the operator ˆ is presented for any vector a a 1 a 2 a 3 t we have 1 a ˆ 0 a 3 a 2 a 3 0 a 1 a 2 a 1 0 for any vector η we also have 2 a ˆ η a η in x b1 y b1 z b1 we let v b u v w t denote the linear velocity of glider body and ω b p q r t denote the angular velocity of glider body in x y z we let b x y z t denote the position vector of o b relative to o in addition the attitude of x b1 y b1 z b1 relative to x y z is described by π ϕ θ ψ t here ϕ θ and ψ are called as roll angle pitch angle and yaw angle respectively the rotation matrix from x b1 y b1 z b1 to x y z is given as follows 3 r be cos θ cos ψ sin ϕ sin θ cos ψ cos ϕ sin ψ cos ϕ sin θ cos ψ sin ϕ sin ψ cos θ sin ψ sin ϕ sin θ sin ψ cos ϕ cos ψ cos ϕ sin θ sin ψ sin ϕ cos ψ sin θ sin ϕ cos θ cos ϕ cos θ besides we let r eb denote r be t according to fossen 2011 we obtain the kinematic equations as follows 4 b r be v b r be r be ω ˆ b 5 ϕ θ ψ 1 sin ϕ tan θ cos ϕ tan θ 0 cos ϕ sin ϕ 0 sin ϕ sec θ cos ϕ sec θ p q r here we let e denote the distance between o p and x b1 axis under the original state the x b1 axis projection of position vector of o p relative to o b is denoted as l 0 0 t when c 2 and c 3 are not equal to 0 in x b1 y b1 z b1 the position vector of o p relative to o b is 6 r p l c 2 e sin c 3 e cos c 3 t in x b1 y b1 z b1 we let v r and ω r denote the linear velocity and angular velocity of the movable internal mass block relative to the glider body respectively the kinematic relationship gives 7 v r c 2 0 0 t ω r r p ω r c 3 0 0 t in addition the rotation matrix from x p y p z p to x b1 y b1 z b1 is 8 r pb 1 0 0 0 cos c 3 sin c 3 0 sin c 3 cos c 3 here we let r bp denote r pb t in x b1 y b1 z b1 we let v pb and ω pb denote the linear velocity and angular velocity of the movable internal mass block relative to inertial space respectively the kinematic relationship gives 9 v pb v b v r ω b r p ω pb ω b ω r therefore in x p y p z p the linear velocity and angular velocity of the movable internal mass block relative to inertial space are 10 v pp r bp v pb ω pp r bp ω pb in x y z the linear velocity of current is denoted as v c in this paper v c is regarded as the continuous function relative to position and time then we have 11 v c f b t g b t h b t t where f g and h denote three continuous functions furthermore we can obtain 12 φ d v c d b t f x f y f z g x g y g z h x h y h z here the equivalent angular velocity of current is denoted as ω c according to thomasson 2000 we have 13 ω ˆ c φ φ t in x b1 y b1 z b1 we let v bc and ω bc denote the linear velocity and angular velocity of the glider body relative to current respectively the kinematic relationship gives 14 v

and ω bc relative to time we obtain 15 v bc v b r eb v c ω ˆ b t r eb v c ω bc ω b r eb ω c ω ˆ b t r eb ω c 2 2 force analysis for convenience we let r e denote the position vector of external bladder buoyancy center o e relative to o b besides we let r h denote the position vector of glider body barycenter o h relative to o b r e and r h are both represented in x b1 y b1 z b1 if there is no especial explanation all forces exerted on the glider are represented in x b1 y b1 z b1 to facilitate the subsequent deduction we move all forces to o b under the original state the whole glider buoyancy can be regarded as a concentrated force exerted on o b the above force is denoted as b 0 and its value is equal to whole glider gravity value then we have 16 b 0 r eb 0 0 m b m p g 0 t where g 0 denotes the gravitational acceleration after buoyancy adjustment the whole glider net buoyancy can be regarded as a concentrated force exerted on o e the above force is denoted as δb when δb is moved to o b the additional moment m e is generated the expressions of δb and m e are 17 δ b m e r eb 0 0 c 1 t r e δ b then we let g b denote the gravity of glider body and g p denote the gravity of movable internal mass block when g b is moved to o b the additional moment m b is generated when g p is moved to o b the additional moment m p is generated the expressions of g b g p m b and m p are 18 g b m b r eb 0 0 m b g 0 t r h g b 19 g p m p r eb 0 0 m p g 0 t r p g p here the force exerted by movable internal mass block on the glider body is regarded as a concentrated force f pb when f pb is moved to o b the additional moment m pb is generated therefore the reaction force exerted on the movable internal mass block is also a concentrated force which is denoted as f bp when f bp is moved to o b the additional moment m bp is generated the newton s third law gives 20 f bp m bp f pb m pb here the inertial hydrodynamic force and moment exerted on the glider body are denoted as f m and m m respectively since the glider body is symmetrical with respect to the x b1 o b z b1 plane we have yang et al 2017 21 f m m m λ 11 0 0 0 λ 22 0 0 0 λ 33 0 0 0 0 0 λ 26 0 λ 35 0 0 0 0 0 0 λ 53 0 λ 62 0

moment the viscous hydrodynamic force and moment exerted on the glider body are denoted as f s and m s respectively in the previous work wu et al 2021 we proposed a method to establish the viscous hydrodynamic equations by sections considering the uncertainty of current direction this paper also use the above method to establish the viscous hydrodynamic equations when u bc 0 the expressions of f s and m s are 22 f s m s v bc 2 r vb k d 0 k d α v 2 k β β v k l 0 k α α v r vb k mr β v k p p bc k m0 k m α v k q q bc k my β v k r r bc where k with subscript denotes the viscous hydrodynamic

sin α v cos β v sin α v sin β v cos α v when u bc 0 f s and m s are firstly represented in x b2 y b2 z b2 and their expressions are 25 f s m s v bc 2 r vb t d 0 t d α v 2 t β β v t l 0 t α α v r vb t mr β v t p p bc t m0 t m α v t q q bc t my β v t r r bc where t with subscript denotes the viscous hydrodynamic coefficient the expression of r vb is also eq 24 but the expressions of α v and β v are changed into 26 α v arctan w bc u bc β v arcsin v bc u bc 2 v bc 2 w bc 2 for eq 25 changing the signs of x b2 axis and y b2 axis components of both f s and m s we obtain the expressions of f s and m s in x b1 y b1 z b1 in this paper all hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained by using cfd method during following dynamic simulation the viscous hydrodynamic equations can be switched automatically according to the sign of u bc 2 3 dynamic equations here we let j b denote the inertia tensor of the glider body relative to x b1 y b1 z b1 and j p denote the inertia tensor of the movable internal mass block relative to x p y p z p in x b1 y b1 z b1 we let p b and l b denote the linear momentum and angular momentum of the glider body relative to o b respectively in x p y p z p we let p pp and l pp denote the linear momentum and angular momentum of the movable internal mass block relative to o p respectively the kinematic relationship gives 27 p b m b v b ω b r h l b j b ω b m b r h v b 28 p

eqs 4 5 and 31 we establish the dynamic model of petrel ii the key parameters values of dynamic model are given in the appendix in this paper the dynamic model is solved by adams bashforth moulton method abmm whose output step size δt is 0 01s the abmm is a typical multi step iteration algorithm which is usually used for solving ordinary differential equations besides the abmm used by us has variable order and its calculation process is achieved in the matlab software in addition the initial values of v b ω b b and π are 0 2 4 model validation to validate the dynamic model we carried out the underwater motion experiment of petrel ii in the south china sea longitude 117 88 latitude 19 39 the experiment setup is shown in fig 3 in fact it is difficult to measure the velocity of current accurately therefore there are inevitable deviations between experimental data and dynamic simulation results if the glider glides in still water and keeps its control parameters values eventually it will achieve the motion state where u v w p q r ϕ and θ remain constant the above ideal motion state is called as steady state motion if the glider can achieve steady state motion approximately we can conclude that the velocity of current is little therefore we choose experimental data of approximate steady state motion to validate the dynamic model which can avoid some measurement errors as much as possible in the experiment process we let c 1 be equal to 2 23 n c 2 be equal to 0 017 m and c 3 be equal to π 18 rad under the above control conditions the glider will make the spiral motion in theory which can validate the hydrodynamic equations of the dynamic model more fully meanwhile sensors were used for measuring the motion depth and attitude angles of the glider in real time then the above control parameters values were fed into the dynamic model and v c was set to 0 after dynamic simulation we obtained the simulation results of motion depth and attitude angles of the glider after comparing experimental data with simulation results we obtained the results shown in fig 4 fig 4 shows that the glider started approximate steady state motion at a depth of 623 8 m the above moment is regarded as the initial time we compare the two sources of data and discover that the maximum errors of motion depth ϕ θ and ψ are 19 5 m 0 0676 rad 0 0640 rad and 0 0611 rad respectively the above errors may be caused by the signal acquisition errors of sensors and the uncertain environmental factors on the whole the simulation curves coincide well with the experimental curves therefore the dynamic model is reliable and can be used for subsequent research 3 motion accuracy analysis considering uncertain current in this section we will analyze the effect of uncertain current on the glider motion accuracy combining dynamic model and monte carlo method the uncertain parameters of current include position direction intensity and action depth to reconcile simulation accuracy with efficiency we install a stopping rule for monte carlo simulation mcs based on the relative error of mean estimation because of the length limitation of this paper we only analyze the accuracy of diving motion besides the total motion time is set to 2000 s and the ranges of control parameters values are shown in table 1 however all methods proposed are also suitable for analyzing the motion accuracy under other conditions 3 1 current models to reduce the complexity of calculation we mainly consider two types of current models whose linear velocities are denoted as v c1 and v c2 respectively besides v c1 and v c2 do not change over time in x y z the expressions of v c1 and v c2 are 32 v c 1 τ y c y x x c 0 t 2 π x x c 2 y y c 2 z 2 33 x c d c cos χ y c d c sin χ 34 v c 2 κ κ z 2 h d 2 cos γ sin γ 0 t z h d 0 z h d according to fan 2013 v c1 and v c2 are used for simulating whirlpool and wind driven current respectively the whirlpool and wind driven current are both common current forms in eqs 32 34 there are six parameters that determine the specific expressions of current models namely τ χ d c κ γ and h d here the above six parameters are uniformly called as current parameters among them τ reflects the whirlpool intensity χ denotes the direction of whirlpool center and d c denotes the distance between whirlpool center and o besides κ reflects the wind driven current intensity γ denotes the wind driven current direction and h d denotes the action depth of wind driven current the geometric meanings of χ d c γ and h d are shown in fig 5 to study the effect of uncertain current on the glider motion all current parameters are regarded as random variables the values of random variables are extracted from the ranges shown in table 2 with equal probability when all current parameters values are determined we can obtain v c by adding v c1 to v c2 linearly after the v c is fed into the dynamic model we can simulate the glider motion in currents 3 2 evaluation parameter of motion accuracy in some exploration missions we need to let the glider move at a specific trajectory when designing motion trajectory we generally assume that the glider moves in still water in fact the current will make the glider deviate from desirable motion trajectory namely the current will reduce the glider motion accuracy to analyze the glider motion accuracy quantitatively we need to define the evaluation parameter of motion accuracy first in this paper the dynamic model is solved by abmm whose output step size is δt the i th output of abmm includes the glider position coordinate at i δt time here the glider position coordinate at i δt time is denoted as x i y i z i t and the total number of abmm output is denoted as n after all calculations are completed we can obtain the matrix d that consists of all x i y i z i t then d can be used for indicating the glider motion trajectory and its expression is 35 d x 1 y 1 z 1 x n y n z n when we analyze the glider motion in still water v c 0 d is denoted as d s when we analyze the glider motion in currents d is denoted as d c if the control parameters values of above two cases are identical we can define the glider motion error caused by currents by using d s and d c here the glider motion error is denoted as d error and its expression is 36 d error d s d c f 2 n where f denotes the frobenius norm the meaning of d error is the average trajectory error of the glider in n δt time in this paper δt 0 01 s and n δt 2000 s the less the d error the higher the glider motion accuracy then d error is taken as the evaluation parameter of the glider motion accuracy 3 3 monte carlo method and stopping rule the flowchart of using monte carlo method to analyze the motion accuracy is shown in fig 6 first we extract control parameters values from the ranges shown in table 1 use dynamic model to simulate the glider motion in still water and calculate d s next we randomly extract current parameters values from the ranges shown in table 2 use dynamic model to simulate the glider motion in currents and calculate d c and d error then we repeat the second step until the stopping rule of mcs is satisfied finally we carry out statistical analysis for all d error in this paper the mean of d error is denoted as μ d and it is used for indicating the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current the less the μ d the higher the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current to reduce simulation number of times on the premise of ensuring mcs accuracy we install a stopping rule for mcs based on the relative error of mean estimation song and wang 2013 the deduction process of stopping rule is given as follows we use ξ to denote a random variable whose mean and variance are finite and denoted as μ and σ 2 respectively ξ i i 1 2 m denotes a set of samples of ξ then the mean and variance of the samples can be calculated by eqs 37 and 38 37 ξ m 1 m i 1 m ξ i 38 s 2 m 1 m 1 i 1 m ξ i ξ m 2 according to the moment estimation ξ m is the unbiased estimator of μ and s 2 m is the unbiased estimator of σ 2 to facilitate the subsequent deduction we use ξ m μ σ 2 and m to construct a new random variable ζ whose specific expression is given as follows 39 ζ ξ m μ σ 2 m according to the central limit theorem ζ obeys standard normal distribution when m approaches infinity the above characteristic of ζ can help us to establish the stopping rule of mcs in actual applications σ 2 is generally unknown and s 2 m is usually used for replacing σ 2 after the σ 2 of eq 39 is replaced by s 2 m we can obtain the approximate ζ which is denoted as ζ namely the expression of ζ is 40 ζ ξ m μ s 2 m m then we have 41 μ ξ m ζ s 2 m m when m is sufficiently large s 2 m is approximately equal to σ 2 and ζ obeys standard normal distribution approximately therefore after the confidence level 1 α is determined we have 42 p ζ ζ α 2 1 α where ζ α 2 denotes the upper quantile of standard normal distribution about α 2 according to eqs 41 and 42 the 100 1 α confidence interval of μ is approximately equal to 43 ξ m ζ α 2 s 2 m m ξ m ζ α 2 s 2 m m for convenience ζ α 2 s 2 m m is denoted as δ m α then eq 42 can be changed into 44 1 α p ξ m μ δ m α 1 p ξ m μ ξ m δ m α ξ m δ m α ξ m can be used for indicating the length of confidence interval the less the δ m α ξ m the higher the accuracy of the parameter estimation here δ m α ξ m is denoted as ε and ε 1 then eq 44 can be changed into 45 p ξ m μ ε ξ m 1 α according to the triangle inequality we have song and wang 2013 46 p ξ m μ ε ξ m p ξ m μ ε ξ m μ μ p ξ m μ μ ε ξ m μ μ 1 p ξ m μ μ ε 1 ε in eq 46 ξ m μ μ is called as relative error of mean estimation according to eqs 45 and 46 the probability that relative error of mean estimation is no larger than ε 1 ε is at least 1 α when we let ξ m μ μ be no larger than ε 0 ε is equal to ε 0 1 ε 0 therefore the least mcs number of times m should meet 47 δ m α ξ m ε 0 1 ε 0 when ξ is replaced by d error eq 47 is the stopping rule of mcs of analyzing the glider motion accuracy in this paper we let 1 α be equal to 0 99 and ε 0 be equal to 0 05 besides the stopping rule is verified every 30 simulations 3 4 analysis results of motion accuracy first we extract a set of control parameters values to carry out the research here c 1 is equal to 3 n c 2 is equal to 0 02 m and c 3 is equal to π 9 rad after the above control parameters values are fed into the dynamic model the mcs is carried out after 1950 simulations the stopping rule is satisfied based on the simulation results we obtain the frequency histogram of d error as shown in fig 7 fig 7 shows that μ d is equal to 50 29 m then the current parameters values that make d error approach μ d most are extracted from the above simulation results as shown in table 3 under the above current parameters values d error is equal to 50 32 m we compare the glider motion trajectory under the above current parameters values with that in still water as shown in fig 8 fig 8 intuitively illustrates that the current has an obvious effect on the glider motion accuracy to analyze the glider motion accuracy more comprehensively we extract 20 sets of control parameters values from the ranges shown in table 1 and the sampling method is the optimal latin hypercube experimental design then we carry out mcs for the above 20 sets of control parameters values and calculate corresponding μ d and the calculation results are shown in the appendix based on the above calculation results the approximate function expression between μ d and control parameters is fitted by least square method and is shown in the appendix on this basis the nephogram and isopleth of μ d are obtained as shown in fig 9 meanwhile we analyze the sensitivity of control parameters to μ d by using the monte carlo based sobol method the sobol method is a global sensitivity analysis method based on the variance analysis theory and its principle has been specifically presented by sobol 2001 because of the convenient calculation process the sobol method has been widely used for parameter sensitivity analysis of mechanical system in this paper we randomly extract 30000 sample points from the ranges shown in table 1 to calculate sensitivity coefficients based on the approximate function expression of μ d we calculate the total sensitivity coefficients of control parameters to μ d and the calculation results are shown in fig 10 the larger the sensitivity coefficient the more obvious the effect of the corresponding control parameter on μ d figs 9 and 10 illustrate that the effect of c 3 on μ d is less and the effect of c 2 on μ d is larger besides with the increase of c 2 μ d decreases first and then increases when c 2 is less with the increase of c 1 μ d has a decrease trend however when c 2 is larger with the increase of c 1 μ d has an increase trend overall to make the glider have high motion accuracy in currents c 1 should be around 3 5 n and c 2 should be around 0 03 m in actual applications we can use big data to establish the probability model of current in specific water area then the methods and flow of this section can be used for determining the suitable control parameters values of the glider to ensure the motion accuracy in specific exploration mission because of the limited experimental condition the above work is not carried out here which is regretful however we believe that our research can provide certain guidance for the realization of the glider precision operation 4 compensation strategy of motion accuracy to improve the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current we can use feedback control to weaken some motion errors because of the limitation of measurement capability the actual motion trajectory of the glider cannot be described completely in addition to save energy the net buoyancy adjustment should be avoided as much as possible and the feedback control cannot be real time fan 2013 in this section we will propose a feedback control strategy to improve the glider motion accuracy considering the above elements 4 1 feedback control strategy generally since the glider is equipped with digital compass the three attitude angles can be measured anytime among three attitude angles the yaw angle ψ affects the course of the glider directly so it has a large effect on the motion trajectory therefore the glider motion accuracy can be improved by correcting ψ according to eq 5 the yaw angular velocity of the glider is 48 ψ q sin ϕ sec θ r cos ϕ sec θ when the glider achieves steady state motion in still water ψ will remain constant yu et al 2018 and it is defined as steady state yaw angular velocity here the steady state yaw angular velocity corresponding to c 1 c 2 and c 3 is denoted as ψ 0 therefore the yaw angle at t 0 time is approximately equal to t 0 ψ 0 when the glider glides in still water for the simulation results of section 3 4 ψ 0 is a positive value which means that the direction of ψ 0 is the same as positive z axis further when c 1 and c 2 are unchanged and c 3 increases to c 3 δc 3 the steady state yaw angular velocity will be larger than ψ 0 yu et al 2018 on the contrary when c 3 decreases to c 3 δc 3 the steady state yaw angular velocity will be less than ψ 0 yu et al 2018 here the steady state yaw angular velocity corresponding to c 3 δc 3 is denoted as ψ 0 and the steady state yaw angular velocity corresponding to c 3 δc 3 is denoted as ψ 0 to correct ψ and save energy we let the glider adjust c 3 intermittently the time interval between two successive c 3 adjustments is denoted as δt c in addition the number of δt c that has passed is denoted as j the actual yaw angle at j δt c time is denoted as ψ a which is measured by digital compass then the yaw angle error at j δt c time is approximately equal to 49 e ψ ψ a j δ t c ψ 0 to offset e ψ in the next c 3 adjustment c 3 needs to be adjusted to c 3 δc 3 or c 3 δc 3 in the initial t c time according to the above content c 3 needs to be adjusted to c 3 δc 3 when e ψ 0 on the contrary c 3 needs to be adjusted to c 3 δc 3 in the rest of the time c 3 is adjusted to original value an example of c 3 adjustment is given as follows see fig 11 according to the above strategy we need to determine t c after δc 3 has been determined since the intensity and direction of current may change with the change of the glider position we cannot determine t c on the theoretical level considering the effect of current therefore we express t c as 50 t c e ψ ψ 0 ψ 0 e ψ 0 e ψ ψ 0 ψ 0 e ψ 0 eq 50 calculates t c after e ψ is regarded as the yaw angle error in still water it is clear that there is a deviation between the t c calculated by eq 50 and the ideal one however the above deviation will be weakened by repeated feedback controls in this paper we let δt c be equal to 400 s and δc 3 be equal to π 36 rad to improve the reliability of feedback control strategy and reduce the c 3 adjustment number of times two additional rules are given as follows a when t c 10 s it is regarded as 0 s b when t c 390 s it is regarded as 400 s to sum up the flowchart of feedback control strategy is shown as follows see fig 12 the feedback control strategy is simple in principle easy to be implemented and energy saving and it avoids solving dynamic model in reverse therefore it is suitable for the long term exploration missions of underwater gliders 4 2 simulation results in this paper we use dynamic simulation to verify the validity of the feedback control strategy during dynamic simulation c 3 is equal to π 30 rad s and c 3 is equal to 0 same as section 3 4 we let c 1 be equal to 3 n c 2 be equal to 0 02 m and c 3 be equal to π 9 rad first after the above control parameters values are fed into the dynamic model with feedback control the mcs is carried out after 2070 simulations the stopping rule is satisfied based on the simulation results we obtain the frequency histogram of d error as shown in fig 13 the comparison between figs 7 and 13 illustrates that μ d is less when feedback control exists therefore the feedback control strategy can improve the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current then we carry out dynamic simulation under the current parameters values of table 3 and obtain that d error is equal to 41 73 m we compare the glider motion trajectory under the above current parameters values with that in still water as shown in fig 14 in the process of feedback control the variation curve of c 3 is shown in fig 15 in addition the variation curves of ψ are shown in fig 16 the comparison between figs 8 and 14 illustrates that the motion trajectory in current is closer to the desirable one when the feedback control exists fig 16 shows that the yaw angle in current is closer to the desirable one when the feedback control exists the above results illustrate the validity of feedback control strategy intuitively to validate the feedback control strategy more comprehensively we carry out mcs for the 20 sets of control parameters values of section 3 4 by using the dynamic model with feedback control then corresponding μ d is calculated and the calculation results are shown in the appendix for convenience the μ d of this section is denoted as μ d2 and the μ d of section 3 4 is denoted as μ d1 then the relative variation of μ d is 51 δ μ d μ d 1 μ d 2 μ d 1 the larger the δμ d the more effective the feedback control strategy when δμ d 0 the feedback control strategy is ineffective the simulation results illustrate that δμ d 0 under the above 20 sets of control parameters values therefore we can conclude that the feedback control strategy is always effective under different control parameters values based on the above calculation results the approximate function expression between δμ d and control parameters is fitted by least square method and is shown in the appendix on this basis the nephogram and isopleth of δμ d are obtained as shown in fig 17 meanwhile we analyze the sensitivity of control parameters to δμ d by using the sobol method mentioned in section 3 4 here we randomly extract 30000 sample points from the ranges shown in table 1 to calculate the sensitivity coefficients based on the approximate function expression of δμ d we calculate the total sensitivity coefficients of control parameters to δμ d and the calculation results are shown in fig 18 figs 17 and 18 illustrate that the effect of c 3 on δμ d is less and the effect of c 2 on δμ d is larger besides the feedback control strategy is more effective when c 1 and c 2 are larger with the increase of c 3 the effect of feedback control strategy has a decrease trend therefore though the feedback control strategy is always effective under different control parameters values it is more suitable for the case where c 3 is less while c 1 and c 2 are larger in fact underwater gliders generally employ the motion mode of gliding in vertical plane c 3 0 to carry out the exploration missions besides c 1 and c 2 are usually not very small to ensure that the glider has adequate motion velocity according to the above results the feedback control strategy can be considered to be used for the actual exploration missions to ensure the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current the above research may be valuable for the achievement of the glider precision operation in this paper the values of δt c and δc 3 may not be the most appropriate and the usage of them is just an example to validate the feedback control strategy in the following study we can employ the optimization method to determine the optimal values of δt c and δc 3 to improve the glider motion accuracy further when the glider motion trajectory can be measured in real time and the energy consumption is not paid attention to we can consider adjusting c 1 c 2 and c 3 simultaneously to improve the glider motion accuracy further 5 conclusions in this paper the dynamic model of an underwater glider is established and the evaluation parameter of the glider motion accuracy is presented then the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current is quantitatively analyzed by monte carlo method with a stopping rule in the process of analysis the different control parameters values are considered analysis results illustrate that the current has an obvious effect on the glider motion accuracy besides the selection of movable internal mass block rotation amount has the less effect on the glider motion accuracy the selection of movable internal mass block translation amount has the larger effect on the glider motion accuracy with the increase of movable internal mass block translation amount the glider motion accuracy improves first and then decreases when the movable internal mass block translation amount is less with the increase of net buoyancy adjustment amount the glider motion accuracy will improve however when the movable internal mass block translation amount is larger with the increase of net buoyancy adjustment amount the glider motion accuracy will decrease to improve the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current a feedback control strategy that intermittently corrects the yaw angle is proposed simulation results illustrate that the feedback control strategy is always effective under different control parameters values besides the larger the net buoyancy adjustment amount and the movable internal mass block translation amount the more effective the feedback control strategy in addition with the increase of movable internal mass block rotation amount the effect of feedback control strategy has a decrease trend the research results can provide certain guidance for the realization of the glider precision operation in the future we will optimize the key parameters values of the feedback control strategy and validate the methods of this paper through experiments

exploration has become a worldwide research hotspot therefore various types of underwater exploration robots are developed including underwater glider the concept of underwater glider was first proposed by stommel 1989 and had attracted wide attention generally the glider is designed as a winged underwater vehicle without external propulsion the glider can change attitude by adjusting the position of movable internal mass block and it can move up and down by adjusting the net buoyancy in addition the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the wings make the glider move forward in view of the above driving mode the glider can achieve long term underwater exploration by consuming less energy thus it can be seen that underwater glider has wide application prospect at present various types of underwater gliders have been developed successfully such as slocum webb et al 2001 spray sherman et al 2001 seaglider eriksen et al 2001 petrel wang et al 2011 and sea wing yu et al 2011 in the development process of underwater glider it is important to study the glider performance and control strategy by using dynamic theory and methods in this regard many scholars have carried out relevant researches at present many methods have been applied to the dynamic modeling of the glider successfully such as newton euler method leonard and graver 2001 second lagrange equation wang et al 2006 gibbs appell equation wang and wang 2009 differential geometry method wang et al 2014 and kirchoff equation gu et al 2016 in addition yang et al 2011 established the dynamic model of the glider formation by using the kane s method though the deduction processes are different the aims of above methods are all to obtain the differential equations of the glider motion the hydrodynamic characteristics affect the glider performance directly so they need to be analyzed in advance when establishing dynamic model of the glider we need to obtain the hydrodynamic equations in advance at present the analysis methods of hydrodynamic characteristics mainly include experimental method williams et al 2008 computational fluid dynamic cfd method zhang et al 2013 and analytical method zhao et al 2016 among them the cfd method reconciles analysis accuracy with cost so it is used widely based on dynamic model and cfd method many significant researches have been carried out bhatta and leonard 2003 studied the stability control method and path following ability of the glider after simplifying dynamic equations mahmoudian et al 2010 presented approximate analytical expressions for steady turning motion of the glider yu et al 2013 and yang et al 2019 established energy consumption models of underwater gliders and presented optimization methods of motion parameters to minimize energy consumption zhao et al 2015 and niu et al 2017 gave the control parameters ranges that ensured the stable motion of underwater gliders by using the lyapunov stability theory yang et al 2016 designed an underwater glider dock whose entrance direction could be adjusted and they proposed corresponding guidance algorithm liu et al 2016 discovered the glider anti helical motion and analyzed its causes yang et al 2017 analyzed the effects of hull deformation and seawater density variation on the deep sea glider motion and designed corresponding compensation strategy petritoli et al 2019 petritoli and leccese 2018 studied the high accuracy control system of an underwater glider to promote the achievement of the glider precision operation and their research team employed the takagi sugeno fuzzy logic modelling to achieve the longitudinal control of the glider leccese et al 2019 to improve the glider hydrodynamic performance li et al 2018 and fu et al 2018 proposed the optimization methods of the glider shape to obtain the maximum advance velocity of underwater glider in finite depth water yoon and kim 2018 presented the optimization method of the glider motion trajectory zhou et al 2020 studied the vertical motion characteristics of disc type glider with zero pitch angle lyu et al 2019 analyzed the effect of winglet on the motion performance of blended wing body glider in addition to the above works there are many researches about the motion characteristics and control methods of underwater gliders in currents fan and woolsey 2014 established the dynamic model of underwater glider considering the effects of current velocity and velocity gradient then fan and woolsey 2014 designed the attitude controller of the glider in nonuniform currents by using pid algorithm based on the work of yang et al 2011 xue et al 2015 established the dynamic model of underwater glider formation considering the effect of current after carrying out dynamic simulation xue et al 2015 discovered that the current had an obvious effect on the motion trajectory of the geometry center of the glider formation based on the particle dynamic model and the differential evolution algorithm zamuda et al 2016 proposed the path planning method of underwater glider in currents through dynamic simulation gu et al 2018 studied the effect of uniform current on the glider motion parameters such as attitude angles and motion velocity su et al 2019 proposed a control method that could weaken the effect of current on the glider attitude based on reinforcement learning and active disturbance rejection control in our previous work wu et al 2021 we proposed a method to establish the dynamic model of underwater glider considering the effect of different current direction besides we analyzed the effect of currents with different directions on the glider motion accuracy by using experimental design method wu et al 2021 the previous research results illustrate that currents have an obvious effect on the glider motion however existing references have never fully considered the uncertainty of current to evaluate the glider motion accuracy and have never given the corresponding compensation strategy of motion accuracy because of the complexity and variability of the actual current it is necessary to consider the uncertainty of current to analyze the glider motion characteristics in some high accuracy exploration missions we need to let the glider move at a specific trajectory as much as possible therefore it is significant to give the compensation strategy of motion accuracy of the glider in uncertain current in view of this we will carry out the above research in this paper the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the dynamic model of an underwater glider is established and it is validated by experimental data in section 3 the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current is quantitatively analyzed by monte carlo method with a stopping rule in section 4 a compensation strategy of motion accuracy is proposed and it is validated by dynamic simulation section 5 summarizes the main contributions 2 dynamic model of underwater glider in this paper petrel ii underwater glider is taken as the research object whose whole configuration is shown in fig 1 petrel ii has a cylindrically actuated movable internal mass block therefore the glider can adjust attitude by translating and rotating the movable internal mass block in addition the glider can adjust net buoyancy by changing the external bladder volume thus the control parameters of petrel ii include the net buoyancy adjustment amount c 1 the movable internal mass block translation amount c 2 and the movable internal mass block rotation amount c 3 for convenience the state where c 1 c 2 and c 3 are all equal to 0 is defined as the original state under the original state the buoyancy and gravity of the glider are equal in value opposite and collinear in direction when the glider is placed horizontally when c 1 and c 2 are not equal to 0 but c 3 is equal to 0 the glider will glide in vertical plane in still water when c 1 c 2 and c 3 are not equal to 0 the glider will glide spirally in still water since the c 1 is generally little the volume change amount of external bladder is little therefore when establishing the dynamic model we can ignore the position change of the glider barycenter caused by changing external bladder volume besides the external bladder buoyancy center o e can be regarded as a fixed point then we divide the glider into two parts including the movable internal mass block and the glider body all parts except the movable internal mass block in this paper the above two parts are both regarded as rigid bodies the mass of movable internal mass block is denoted as m p and the mass of glider body is denoted as m b 2 1 kinematic equations first we define four rectangular coordinate frames which are the inertial frame the first glider body frame the second glider body frame and the movable internal mass block frame all coordinate frames obey the right hand rule for convenience we let x y z denote the inertial frame x b1 y b1 z b1 denote the first glider body frame x b2 y b2 z b2 denote the second glider body frame and x p y p z p denote the movable internal mass block frame as shown in fig 2 here o denotes the origin of x y z the x axis and y axis form the horizontal plane and the z axis is parallel to the direction of gravity x b1 y b1 z b1 is fixed on the glider body and its origin is the whole glider buoyancy center under the original state which is denoted as o b the x b1 axis coincides with the longitudinal axis of the glider and the z b1 axis points to the glider bottom x b2 y b2 z b2 is obtained by rotating x b1 y b1 z b1 around z b1 axis by π rad in addition x p y p z p is fixed on the movable internal mass block and its origin is the movable internal mass block barycenter which is denoted as o p under the original state the attitudes of x y z x b1 y b1 z b1 and x p y p z p are identical in addition o b and o p are taken as the motion observation points of the glider body and the movable internal mass block respectively to illustrate the cross product of vectors more clearly the operator ˆ is presented for any vector a a 1 a 2 a 3 t we have 1 a ˆ 0 a 3 a 2 a 3 0 a 1 a 2 a 1 0 for any vector η we also have 2 a ˆ η a η in x b1 y b1 z b1 we let v b u v w t denote the linear velocity of glider body and ω b p q r t denote the angular velocity of glider body in x y z we let b x y z t denote the position vector of o b relative to o in addition the attitude of x b1 y b1 z b1 relative to x y z is described by π ϕ θ ψ t here ϕ θ and ψ are called as roll angle pitch angle and yaw angle respectively the rotation matrix from x b1 y b1 z b1 to x y z is given as follows 3 r be cos θ cos ψ sin ϕ sin θ cos ψ cos ϕ sin ψ cos ϕ sin θ cos ψ sin ϕ sin ψ cos θ sin ψ sin ϕ sin θ sin ψ cos ϕ cos ψ cos ϕ sin θ sin ψ sin ϕ cos ψ sin θ sin ϕ cos θ cos ϕ cos θ besides we let r eb denote r be t according to fossen 2011 we obtain the kinematic equations as follows 4 b r be v b r be r be ω ˆ b 5 ϕ θ ψ 1 sin ϕ tan θ cos ϕ tan θ 0 cos ϕ sin ϕ 0 sin ϕ sec θ cos ϕ sec θ p q r here we let e denote the distance between o p and x b1 axis under the original state the x b1 axis projection of position vector of o p relative to o b is denoted as l 0 0 t when c 2 and c 3 are not equal to 0 in x b1 y b1 z b1 the position vector of o p relative to o b is 6 r p l c 2 e sin c 3 e cos c 3 t in x b1 y b1 z b1 we let v r and ω r denote the linear velocity and angular velocity of the movable internal mass block relative to the glider body respectively the kinematic relationship gives 7 v r c 2 0 0 t ω r r p ω r c 3 0 0 t in addition the rotation matrix from x p y p z p to x b1 y b1 z b1 is 8 r pb 1 0 0 0 cos c 3 sin c 3 0 sin c 3 cos c 3 here we let r bp denote r pb t in x b1 y b1 z b1 we let v pb and ω pb denote the linear velocity and angular velocity of the movable internal mass block relative to inertial space respectively the kinematic relationship gives 9 v pb v b v r ω b r p ω pb ω b ω r therefore in x p y p z p the linear velocity and angular velocity of the movable internal mass block relative to inertial space are 10 v pp r bp v pb ω pp r bp ω pb in x y z the linear velocity of current is denoted as v c in this paper v c is regarded as the continuous function relative to position and time then we have 11 v c f b t g b t h b t t where f g and h denote three continuous functions furthermore we can obtain 12 φ d v c d b t f x f y f z g x g y g z h x h y h z here the equivalent angular velocity of current is denoted as ω c according to thomasson 2000 we have 13 ω ˆ c φ φ t in x b1 y b1 z b1 we let v bc and ω bc denote the linear velocity and angular velocity of the glider body relative to current respectively the kinematic relationship gives 14 v bc v b r eb v c ω bc ω b r eb ω c to facilitate the subsequent deduction v bc and ω bc are further denoted as u bc v bc w bc t and p bc q bc r bc t respectively after calculating derivative of v bc and ω bc relative to time we obtain 15 v bc v b r eb v c ω ˆ b t r eb v c ω bc ω b r eb ω c ω ˆ b t r eb ω c 2 2 force analysis for convenience we let r e denote the position vector of external bladder buoyancy center o e relative to o b besides we let r h denote the position vector of glider body barycenter o h relative to o b r e and r h are both represented in x b1 y b1 z b1 if there is no especial explanation all forces exerted on the glider are represented in x b1 y b1 z b1 to facilitate the subsequent deduction we move all forces to o b under the original state the whole glider buoyancy can be regarded as a concentrated force exerted on o b the above force is denoted as b 0 and its value is equal to whole glider gravity value then we have 16 b 0 r eb 0 0 m b m p g 0 t where g 0 denotes the gravitational acceleration after buoyancy adjustment the whole glider net buoyancy can be regarded as a concentrated force exerted on o e the above force is denoted as δb when δb is moved to o b the additional moment m e is generated the expressions of δb and m e are 17 δ b m e r eb 0 0 c 1 t r e δ b then we let g b denote the gravity of glider body and g p denote the gravity of movable internal mass block when g b is moved to o b the additional moment m b is generated when g p is moved to o b the additional moment m p is generated the expressions of g b g p m b and m p are 18 g b m b r eb 0 0 m b g 0 t r h g b 19 g p m p r eb 0 0 m p g 0 t r p g p here the force exerted by movable internal mass block on the glider body is regarded as a concentrated force f pb when f pb is moved to o b the additional moment m pb is generated therefore the reaction force exerted on the movable internal mass block is also a concentrated force which is denoted as f bp when f bp is moved to o b the additional moment m bp is generated the newton s third law gives 20 f bp m bp f pb m pb here the inertial hydrodynamic force and moment exerted on the glider body are denoted as f m and m m respectively since the glider body is symmetrical with respect to the x b1 o b z b1 plane we have yang et al 2017 21 f m m m λ 11 0 0 0 λ 22 0 0 0 λ 33 0 0 0 0 0 λ 26 0 λ 35 0 0 0 0 0 0 λ 53 0 λ 62 0 λ 44 0 0 0 λ 55 0 0 0 λ 66 v bc ω bc where λ 11 λ 22 are λ 33 are called as added mass λ 44 λ 55 and λ 66 are called as added moment of inertia λ 26 λ 35 λ 53 and λ 62 are called as added static moment the viscous hydrodynamic force and moment exerted on the glider body are denoted as f s and m s respectively in the previous work wu et al 2021 we proposed a method to establish the viscous hydrodynamic equations by sections considering the uncertainty of current direction this paper also use the above method to establish the viscous hydrodynamic equations when u bc 0 the expressions of f s and m s are 22 f s m s v bc 2 r vb k d 0 k d α v 2 k β β v k l 0 k α α v r vb k mr β v k p p bc k m0 k m α v k q q bc k my β v k r r bc where k with subscript denotes the viscous hydrodynamic

sin α v cos β v sin α v sin β v cos α v when u bc 0 f s and m s are firstly represented in x b2 y b2 z b2 and their expressions are 25 f s m s v bc 2 r vb t d 0 t d α v 2 t β β v t l 0 t α α v r vb t mr β v t p p bc t m0 t m α v t q q bc t my β v t r r bc where t with subscript denotes the viscous hydrodynamic coefficient the expression of r vb is also eq 24 but the expressions of α v and β v are changed into 26 α v arctan w bc u bc β v arcsin v bc u bc 2 v bc 2 w bc 2 for eq 25 changing the signs of x b2 axis and y b2 axis components of both f s and m s we obtain the expressions of f s and m s in x b1 y b1 z b1 in this paper all hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained by using cfd method during following dynamic simulation the viscous hydrodynamic equations can be switched automatically according to the sign of u bc 2 3 dynamic equations here we let j b denote the inertia tensor of the glider body relative to x b1 y b1 z b1 and j p denote the inertia tensor of the movable internal mass block relative to x p y p z p in x b1 y b1 z b1 we let p b and l b denote the linear momentum and angular momentum of the glider body relative to o b respectively in x p y p z p we let p pp and l pp denote the linear momentum and angular momentum of the movable internal mass block relative to o p respectively the kinematic relationship gives 27 p b m b v b ω b r h l b j b ω b m b r h v b 28 p

eqs 4 5 and 31 we establish the dynamic model of petrel ii the key parameters values of dynamic model are given in the appendix in this paper the dynamic model is solved by adams bashforth moulton method abmm whose output step size δt is 0 01s the abmm is a typical multi step iteration algorithm which is usually used for solving ordinary differential equations besides the abmm used by us has variable order and its calculation process is achieved in the matlab software in addition the initial values of v b ω b b and π are 0 2 4 model validation to validate the dynamic model we carried out the underwater motion experiment of petrel ii in the south china sea longitude 117 88 latitude 19 39 the experiment setup is shown in fig 3 in fact it is difficult to measure the velocity of current accurately therefore there are inevitable deviations between experimental data and dynamic simulation results if the glider glides in still water and keeps its control parameters values eventually it will achieve the motion state where u v w p q r ϕ and θ remain constant the above ideal motion state is called as steady state motion if the glider can achieve steady state motion approximately we can conclude that the velocity of current is little therefore we choose experimental data of approximate steady state motion to validate the dynamic model which can avoid some measurement errors as much as possible in the experiment process we let c 1 be equal to 2 23 n c 2 be equal to 0 017 m and c 3 be equal to π 18 rad under the above control conditions the glider will make the spiral motion in theory which can validate the hydrodynamic equations of the dynamic model more fully meanwhile sensors were used for measuring the motion depth and attitude angles of the glider in real time then the above control parameters values were fed into the dynamic model and v c was set to 0 after dynamic simulation we obtained the simulation results of motion depth and attitude angles of the glider after comparing experimental data with simulation results we obtained the results shown in fig 4 fig 4 shows that the glider started approximate steady state motion at a depth of 623 8 m the above moment is regarded as the initial time we compare the two sources of data and discover that the maximum errors of motion depth ϕ θ and ψ are 19 5 m 0 0676 rad 0 0640 rad and 0 0611 rad respectively the above errors may be caused by the signal acquisition errors of sensors and the uncertain environmental factors on the whole the simulation curves coincide well with the experimental curves therefore the dynamic model is reliable and can be used for subsequent research 3 motion accuracy analysis considering uncertain current in this section we will analyze the effect of uncertain current on the glider motion accuracy combining dynamic model and monte carlo method the uncertain parameters of current include position direction intensity and action depth to reconcile simulation accuracy with efficiency we install a stopping rule for monte carlo simulation mcs based on the relative error of mean estimation because of the length limitation of this paper we only analyze the accuracy of diving motion besides the total motion time is set to 2000 s and the ranges of control parameters values are shown in table 1 however all methods proposed are also suitable for analyzing the motion accuracy under other conditions 3 1 current models to reduce the complexity of calculation we mainly consider two types of current models whose linear velocities are denoted as v c1 and v c2 respectively besides v c1 and v c2 do not change over time in x y z the expressions of v c1 and v c2 are 32 v c 1 τ y c y x x c 0 t 2 π x x c 2 y y c 2 z 2 33 x c d c cos χ y c d c sin χ 34 v c 2 κ κ z 2 h d 2 cos γ sin γ 0 t z h d 0 z h d according to fan 2013 v c1 and v c2 are used for simulating whirlpool and wind driven current respectively the whirlpool and wind driven current are both common current forms in eqs 32 34 there are six parameters that determine the specific expressions of current models namely τ χ d c κ γ and h d here the above six parameters are uniformly called as current parameters among them τ reflects the whirlpool intensity χ denotes the direction of whirlpool center and d c denotes the distance between whirlpool center and o besides κ reflects the wind driven current intensity γ denotes the wind driven current direction and h d denotes the action depth of wind driven current the geometric meanings of χ d c γ and h d are shown in fig 5 to study the effect of uncertain current on the glider motion all current parameters are regarded as random variables the values of random variables are extracted from the ranges shown in table 2 with equal probability when all current parameters values are determined we can obtain v c by adding v c1 to v c2 linearly after the v c is fed into the dynamic model we can simulate the glider motion in currents 3 2 evaluation parameter of motion accuracy in some exploration missions we need to let the glider move at a specific trajectory when designing motion trajectory we generally assume that the glider moves in still water in fact the current will make the glider deviate from desirable motion trajectory namely the current will reduce the glider motion accuracy to analyze the glider motion accuracy quantitatively we need to define the evaluation parameter of motion accuracy first in this paper the dynamic model is solved by abmm whose output step size is δt the i th output of abmm includes the glider position coordinate at i δt time here the glider position coordinate at i δt time is denoted as x i y i z i t and the total number of abmm output is denoted as n after all calculations are completed we can obtain the matrix d that consists of all x i y i z i t then d can be used for indicating the glider motion trajectory and its expression is 35 d x 1 y 1 z 1 x n y n z n when we analyze the glider motion in still water v c 0 d is denoted as d s when we analyze the glider motion in currents d is denoted as d c if the control parameters values of above two cases are identical we can define the glider motion error caused by currents by using d s and d c here the glider motion error is denoted as d error and its expression is 36 d error d s d c f 2 n where f denotes the frobenius norm the meaning of d error is the average trajectory error of the glider in n δt time in this paper δt 0 01 s and n δt 2000 s the less the d error the higher the glider motion accuracy then d error is taken as the evaluation parameter of the glider motion accuracy 3 3 monte carlo method and stopping rule the flowchart of using monte carlo method to analyze the motion accuracy is shown in fig 6 first we extract control parameters values from the ranges shown in table 1 use dynamic model to simulate the glider motion in still water and calculate d s next we randomly extract current parameters values from the ranges shown in table 2 use dynamic model to simulate the glider motion in currents and calculate d c and d error then we repeat the second step until the stopping rule of mcs is satisfied finally we carry out statistical analysis for all d error in this paper the mean of d error is denoted as μ d and it is used for indicating the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current the less the μ d the higher the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current to reduce simulation number of times on the premise of ensuring mcs accuracy we install a stopping rule for mcs based on the relative error of mean estimation song and wang 2013 the deduction process of stopping rule is given as follows we use ξ to denote a random variable whose mean and variance are finite and denoted as μ and σ 2 respectively ξ i i 1 2 m denotes a set of samples of ξ then the mean and variance of the samples can be calculated by eqs 37 and 38 37 ξ m 1 m i 1 m ξ i 38 s 2 m 1 m 1 i 1 m ξ i ξ m 2 according to the moment estimation ξ m is the unbiased estimator of μ and s 2 m is the unbiased estimator of σ 2 to facilitate the subsequent deduction we use ξ m μ σ 2 and m to construct a new random variable ζ whose specific expression is given as follows 39 ζ ξ m μ σ 2 m according to the central limit theorem ζ obeys standard normal distribution when m approaches infinity the above characteristic of ζ can help us to establish the stopping rule of mcs in actual applications σ 2 is generally unknown and s 2 m is usually used for replacing σ 2 after the σ 2 of eq 39 is replaced by s 2 m we can obtain the approximate ζ which is denoted as ζ namely the expression of ζ is 40 ζ ξ m μ s 2 m m then we have 41 μ ξ m ζ s 2 m m when m is sufficiently large s 2 m is approximately equal to σ 2 and ζ obeys standard normal distribution approximately therefore after the confidence level 1 α is determined we have 42 p ζ ζ α 2 1 α where ζ α 2 denotes the upper quantile of standard normal distribution about α 2 according to eqs 41 and 42 the 100 1 α confidence interval of μ is approximately equal to 43 ξ m ζ α 2 s 2 m m ξ m ζ α 2 s 2 m m for convenience ζ α 2 s 2 m m is denoted as δ m α then eq 42 can be changed into 44 1 α p ξ m μ δ m α 1 p ξ m μ ξ m δ m α ξ m δ m α ξ m can be used for indicating the length of confidence interval the less the δ m α ξ m the higher the accuracy of the parameter estimation here δ m α ξ m is denoted as ε and ε 1 then eq 44 can be changed into 45 p ξ m μ ε ξ m 1 α according to the triangle inequality we have song and wang 2013 46 p ξ m μ ε ξ m p ξ m μ ε ξ m μ μ p ξ m μ μ ε ξ m μ μ 1 p ξ m μ μ ε 1 ε in eq 46 ξ m μ μ is called as relative error of mean estimation according to eqs 45 and 46 the probability that relative error of mean estimation is no larger than ε 1 ε is at least 1 α when we let ξ m μ μ be no larger than ε 0 ε is equal to ε 0 1 ε 0 therefore the least mcs number of times m should meet 47 δ m α ξ m ε 0 1 ε 0 when ξ is replaced by d error eq 47 is the stopping rule of mcs of analyzing the glider motion accuracy in this paper we let 1 α be equal to 0 99 and ε 0 be equal to 0 05 besides the stopping rule is verified every 30 simulations 3 4 analysis results of motion accuracy first we extract a set of control parameters values to carry out the research here c 1 is equal to 3 n c 2 is equal to 0 02 m and c 3 is equal to π 9 rad after the above control parameters values are fed into the dynamic model the mcs is carried out after 1950 simulations the stopping rule is satisfied based on the simulation results we obtain the frequency histogram of d error as shown in fig 7 fig 7 shows that μ d is equal to 50 29 m then the current parameters values that make d error approach μ d most are extracted from the above simulation results as shown in table 3 under the above current parameters values d error is equal to 50 32 m we compare the glider motion trajectory under the above current parameters values with that in still water as shown in fig 8 fig 8 intuitively illustrates that the current has an obvious effect on the glider motion accuracy to analyze the glider motion accuracy more comprehensively we extract 20 sets of control parameters values from the ranges shown in table 1 and the sampling method is the optimal latin hypercube experimental design then we carry out mcs for the above 20 sets of control parameters values and calculate corresponding μ d and the calculation results are shown in the appendix based on the above calculation results the approximate function expression between μ d and control parameters is fitted by least square method and is shown in the appendix on this basis the nephogram and isopleth of μ d are obtained as shown in fig 9 meanwhile we analyze the sensitivity of control parameters to μ d by using the monte carlo based sobol method the sobol method is a global sensitivity analysis method based on the variance analysis theory and its principle has been specifically presented by sobol 2001 because of the convenient calculation process the sobol method has been widely used for parameter sensitivity analysis of mechanical system in this paper we randomly extract 30000 sample points from the ranges shown in table 1 to calculate sensitivity coefficients based on the approximate function expression of μ d we calculate the total sensitivity coefficients of control parameters to μ d and the calculation results are shown in fig 10 the larger the sensitivity coefficient the more obvious the effect of the corresponding control parameter on μ d figs 9 and 10 illustrate that the effect of c 3 on μ d is less and the effect of c 2 on μ d is larger besides with the increase of c 2 μ d decreases first and then increases when c 2 is less with the increase of c 1 μ d has a decrease trend however when c 2 is larger with the increase of c 1 μ d has an increase trend overall to make the glider have high motion accuracy in currents c 1 should be around 3 5 n and c 2 should be around 0 03 m in actual applications we can use big data to establish the probability model of current in specific water area then the methods and flow of this section can be used for determining the suitable control parameters values of the glider to ensure the motion accuracy in specific exploration mission because of the limited experimental condition the above work is not carried out here which is regretful however we believe that our research can provide certain guidance for the realization of the glider precision operation 4 compensation strategy of motion accuracy to improve the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current we can use feedback control to weaken some motion errors because of the limitation of measurement capability the actual motion trajectory of the glider cannot be described completely in addition to save energy the net buoyancy adjustment should be avoided as much as possible and the feedback control cannot be real time fan 2013 in this section we will propose a feedback control strategy to improve the glider motion accuracy considering the above elements 4 1 feedback control strategy generally since the glider is equipped with digital compass the three attitude angles can be measured anytime among three attitude angles the yaw angle ψ affects the course of the glider directly so it has a large effect on the motion trajectory therefore the glider motion accuracy can be improved by correcting ψ according to eq 5 the yaw angular velocity of the glider is 48 ψ q sin ϕ sec θ r cos ϕ sec θ when the glider achieves steady state motion in still water ψ will remain constant yu et al 2018 and it is defined as steady state yaw angular velocity here the steady state yaw angular velocity corresponding to c 1 c 2 and c 3 is denoted as ψ 0 therefore the yaw angle at t 0 time is approximately equal to t 0 ψ 0 when the glider glides in still water for the simulation results of section 3 4 ψ 0 is a positive value which means that the direction of ψ 0 is the same as positive z axis further when c 1 and c 2 are unchanged and c 3 increases to c 3 δc 3 the steady state yaw angular velocity will be larger than ψ 0 yu et al 2018 on the contrary when c 3 decreases to c 3 δc 3 the steady state yaw angular velocity will be less than ψ 0 yu et al 2018 here the steady state yaw angular velocity corresponding to c 3 δc 3 is denoted as ψ 0 and the steady state yaw angular velocity corresponding to c 3 δc 3 is denoted as ψ 0 to correct ψ and save energy we let the glider adjust c 3 intermittently the time interval between two successive c 3 adjustments is denoted as δt c in addition the number of δt c that has passed is denoted as j the actual yaw angle at j δt c time is denoted as ψ a which is measured by digital compass then the yaw angle error at j δt c time is approximately equal to 49 e ψ ψ a j δ t c ψ 0 to offset e ψ in the next c 3 adjustment c 3 needs to be adjusted to c 3 δc 3 or c 3 δc 3 in the initial t c time according to the above content c 3 needs to be adjusted to c 3 δc 3 when e ψ 0 on the contrary c 3 needs to be adjusted to c 3 δc 3 in the rest of the time c 3 is adjusted to original value an example of c 3 adjustment is given as follows see fig 11 according to the above strategy we need to determine t c after δc 3 has been determined since the intensity and direction of current may change with the change of the glider position we cannot determine t c on the theoretical level considering the effect of current therefore we express t c as 50 t c e ψ ψ 0 ψ 0 e ψ 0 e ψ ψ 0 ψ 0 e ψ 0 eq 50 calculates t c after e ψ is regarded as the yaw angle error in still water it is clear that there is a deviation between the t c calculated by eq 50 and the ideal one however the above deviation will be weakened by repeated feedback controls in this paper we let δt c be equal to 400 s and δc 3 be equal to π 36 rad to improve the reliability of feedback control strategy and reduce the c 3 adjustment number of times two additional rules are given as follows a when t c 10 s it is regarded as 0 s b when t c 390 s it is regarded as 400 s to sum up the flowchart of feedback control strategy is shown as follows see fig 12 the feedback control strategy is simple in principle easy to be implemented and energy saving and it avoids solving dynamic model in reverse therefore it is suitable for the long term exploration missions of underwater gliders 4 2 simulation results in this paper we use dynamic simulation to verify the validity of the feedback control strategy during dynamic simulation c 3 is equal to π 30 rad s and c 3 is equal to 0 same as section 3 4 we let c 1 be equal to 3 n c 2 be equal to 0 02 m and c 3 be equal to π 9 rad first after the above control parameters values are fed into the dynamic model with feedback control the mcs is carried out after 2070 simulations the stopping rule is satisfied based on the simulation results we obtain the frequency histogram of d error as shown in fig 13 the comparison between figs 7 and 13 illustrates that μ d is less when feedback control exists therefore the feedback control strategy can improve the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current then we carry out dynamic simulation under the current parameters values of table 3 and obtain that d error is equal to 41 73 m we compare the glider motion trajectory under the above current parameters values with that in still water as shown in fig 14 in the process of feedback control the variation curve of c 3 is shown in fig 15 in addition the variation curves of ψ are shown in fig 16 the comparison between figs 8 and 14 illustrates that the motion trajectory in current is closer to the desirable one when the feedback control exists fig 16 shows that the yaw angle in current is closer to the desirable one when the feedback control exists the above results illustrate the validity of feedback control strategy intuitively to validate the feedback control strategy more comprehensively we carry out mcs for the 20 sets of control parameters values of section 3 4 by using the dynamic model with feedback control then corresponding μ d is calculated and the calculation results are shown in the appendix for convenience the μ d of this section is denoted as μ d2 and the μ d of section 3 4 is denoted as μ d1 then the relative variation of μ d is 51 δ μ d μ d 1 μ d 2 μ d 1 the larger the δμ d the more effective the feedback control strategy when δμ d 0 the feedback control strategy is ineffective the simulation results illustrate that δμ d 0 under the above 20 sets of control parameters values therefore we can conclude that the feedback control strategy is always effective under different control parameters values based on the above calculation results the approximate function expression between δμ d and control parameters is fitted by least square method and is shown in the appendix on this basis the nephogram and isopleth of δμ d are obtained as shown in fig 17 meanwhile we analyze the sensitivity of control parameters to δμ d by using the sobol method mentioned in section 3 4 here we randomly extract 30000 sample points from the ranges shown in table 1 to calculate the sensitivity coefficients based on the approximate function expression of δμ d we calculate the total sensitivity coefficients of control parameters to δμ d and the calculation results are shown in fig 18 figs 17 and 18 illustrate that the effect of c 3 on δμ d is less and the effect of c 2 on δμ d is larger besides the feedback control strategy is more effective when c 1 and c 2 are larger with the increase of c 3 the effect of feedback control strategy has a decrease trend therefore though the feedback control strategy is always effective under different control parameters values it is more suitable for the case where c 3 is less while c 1 and c 2 are larger in fact underwater gliders generally employ the motion mode of gliding in vertical plane c 3 0 to carry out the exploration missions besides c 1 and c 2 are usually not very small to ensure that the glider has adequate motion velocity according to the above results the feedback control strategy can be considered to be used for the actual exploration missions to ensure the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current the above research may be valuable for the achievement of the glider precision operation in this paper the values of δt c and δc 3 may not be the most appropriate and the usage of them is just an example to validate the feedback control strategy in the following study we can employ the optimization method to determine the optimal values of δt c and δc 3 to improve the glider motion accuracy further when the glider motion trajectory can be measured in real time and the energy consumption is not paid attention to we can consider adjusting c 1 c 2 and c 3 simultaneously to improve the glider motion accuracy further 5 conclusions in this paper the dynamic model of an underwater glider is established and the evaluation parameter of the glider motion accuracy is presented then the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current is quantitatively analyzed by monte carlo method with a stopping rule in the process of analysis the different control parameters values are considered analysis results illustrate that the current has an obvious effect on the glider motion accuracy besides the selection of movable internal mass block rotation amount has the less effect on the glider motion accuracy the selection of movable internal mass block translation amount has the larger effect on the glider motion accuracy with the increase of movable internal mass block translation amount the glider motion accuracy improves first and then decreases when the movable internal mass block translation amount is less with the increase of net buoyancy adjustment amount the glider motion accuracy will improve however when the movable internal mass block translation amount is larger with the increase of net buoyancy adjustment amount the glider motion accuracy will decrease to improve the glider motion accuracy in uncertain current a feedback control strategy that intermittently corrects the yaw angle is proposed simulation results illustrate that the feedback control strategy is always effective under different control parameters values besides the larger the net buoyancy adjustment amount and the movable internal mass block translation amount the more effective the feedback control strategy in addition with the increase of movable internal mass block rotation amount the effect of feedback control strategy has a decrease trend the research results can provide certain guidance for the realization of the glider precision operation in the future we will optimize the key parameters values of the feedback control strategy and validate the methods of this paper through experiments
