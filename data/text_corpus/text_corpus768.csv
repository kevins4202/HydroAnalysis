3840,groundwater surface water interactions and associated water management issues are complicated by the risk of salinization along coastlines groundwater pumping can be a driving factor of streamflow depletion and allow for increased stream saltwater intrusion in this study we develop an analytical framework combining two analytical approaches to calculate the length of saltwater intrusion at high slack water and the stream depletion rate due to groundwater pumping we test this framework using data from the savannah river in southeastern u s and use it to explore saltwater intrusion in the surface water system the analytical approach produces an accurate estimate of the position of the salt front at approximately 56 km inland current pumping rates decrease streamflow by less than 1 resulting in an increase in the saltwater intrusion length of 100 m increased groundwater pumping scenarios however show a risk of extending the saltwater intrusion length up to 4 km inland in these cases effects from pumping induced saltwater intrusion would equal or exceed the impacts of sea level rise or geomorphic change salinity is a critical factor in the ecological balance of this estuarine ecosystem and this analytical approach allows for investigation of hypothetical groundwater development in the region we show for the first time the direct link between groundwater pumping and coastal stream salinity that should be an important management consideration all along developed coastlines abbreviations hws high water slack swi saltwater intrusion lsr lower savannah river keywords groundwater surface water relations salinization pumping coastal aquifers savannah river georgia usa baseflow 1 introduction in coastal areas where nearly half of the world population lives water resources are continually threatened by natural and anthropogenic stressors michael et al 2017 both surface and subsurface water reservoirs are at risk of salinization due to saltwater intrusion in estuaries increased salinization may cause adverse impacts on freshwater resources and ecological function this is particularly true under the increasing pressure of climate change and sea level rise the mouth of coastal streams is a transition zone between saline seawater and terrestrial freshwater and the location of this interface is dictated by the balance between streamflow meteorological conditions and tidal forcing conrads et al 2006 ross et al 2015 in general during periods of high streamflow seawater is prevented from intruding upstream and the freshwater saltwater interface salinity of 0 5 ppt is located relatively close to the ocean during periods of low streamflow high salinity water moves upstream shifting the freshwater saltwater interface and potentially compromising freshwater resources and ecosystems the balance between the terrestrial flow system and ocean forcing is complicated by multiple processes natural and human induced that occur across various time scales these processes include but are not limited to storms tides seasonal climatic fluctuations groundwater pumping and interannual variability the freshwater saltwater interface in coastal streams is controlled by a delicate balance between these often opposing and simultaneous forces for example coastal storms can temporarily increase the salinity in surficial water reservoirs through elevated sea level wind waves and storm surge that collectively push the freshwater saltwater interface inland huang et al 2014 simultaneously extreme high runoff events from coastal storm precipitation may increase freshwater discharge which can potentially push the transition zone seaward and reduce the overall stream salinity hagy et al 2000 lerczak et al 2009 tian 2019 furthermore spring neap tidal cycles are a major control on the vertical and horizontal distributions of salinity in estuaries ji 2008 high tidal range leads to strong vertical mixing and little stratification whereas low tides create poorly mixed highly stratified salt wedges in the stream simpson et al 1990 depending on the dominant force water in tidally mixed estuaries can change from completely fresh to saline within a tidal cycle whereas salinity in larger estuaries more controlled by seasonal freshwater inflows may show little fluctuation ji 2008 previous studies have shown that in coastal streams seasonal variations in saltwater intrusion are primarily controlled by sea surface level hong and shen 2012 whereas longer term interannual variability is largely dominated by river flow tian 2019 modeling studies have demonstrated that long term sea level rise causes shifts in estuarine salinity circulation tidal impacts and maximum extent of intrusion e g bhuiyan and dutta 2012 hilton et al 2008 hong and shen 2012 however the natural variability in local climatology and river runoff may obscure these weak trends and make them undetectable without extensive data or modeling wiseman et al 1990 although fast processes like storm surges cause greater variation long term slow processes magnify the effects of the fast processes this is of particular importance when considering the complexity of groundwater surface interactions in coastal systems groundwater interacts with surface water through infiltration and exfiltration and can significantly alter stream discharge the groundwater contribution to streamflow termed baseflow may be reduced by natural e g low precipitation and recharge or anthropogenic e g pumping groundwater depletion the streamflow is almost entirely baseflow during times of minimal rainfall priest 2004 thus for certain estuaries estimates of groundwater discharge rates might be important for a complete understanding of the coastal hydrologic system hagy et al 2000 groundwater withdrawals have been cited as a driving factor of streamflow depletion in a wide variety of aquifers including coastal plains for example the cumulative response to groundwater pumping in the northern atlantic coastal plain contributed to greater than a 20 reduction in streamflow masterson et al 2016 the ganges river india has seen large scale river dry out over the past five decades triggered by a 59 reduction in baseflow from irrigation withdrawals mukherjee et al 2018 similarly li et al 2020 calculated the streamflow depletion from groundwater pumping in two watersheds in canada and showed that depending on the site specific hydrogeology and the well location the volume of water pumped could cause an equivalent decrease in stream volume in gaining streams it is not necessary for a well to reverse flow gradients below the stream to reduce baseflow streamflow depletion occurs when the well simply captures some of the baseflow discharge before it reaches the stream chen and yin 2001 wilson 1993 it is thus clear that regardless of the level of complexity groundwater withdrawal inevitably results in depleted streamflow barlow et al 2018 numerous studies have used different forms of field based and statistical analysis e g barlow et al 2014 killian et al 2019 numerical models e g griebling and neupauer 2013 leake and pool 2010 and analytical models e g barlow and leake 2012 hunt 1999 li et al 2020 zipper et al 2019b to demonstrate the linkages between groundwater levels and streamflow the field based analysis requires extensive surface water and groundwater measurements numerical models are process based representations of the flow and can be prohibitively complex requiring time expertise and computational power to perform a site specific analysis compared to numerical models analytical models provide a simpler approach to calculate streamflow depletion for different hydrogeologic conditions analytical solutions show that streamflow reduction due to groundwater depletion is mainly controlled by the aquifer transmissivity and storativity by the streambed resistance to seepage and by the proximity of pumping wells to the stream hunt 1999 numerical simulations of real world settings showed that analytical models perform better in relatively simple hydrogeological settings while in more complex systems the errors are large li et al 2020 zipper et al 2019b overall the dynamics and trends predicted by the analytical solutions hold for both settings therefore analytical approaches appropriately demonstrate links between groundwater pumping and streamflow depletion in most watersheds where the aquifer is connected to the surficial system barlow and leake 2012 hunt 1999 killian et al 2019 li et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2018 zipper et al 2018 zipper et al 2019b in the case of coastal watersheds reduction in streamflow is expected to induce an inland migration of the salt front this mechanism has been shown and discussed extensively in several studies including field observations e g lamar 1940 yobbi and knochenmus 1989a b numerical simulations conrads et al 2006 nobi and gupta 1997 and analytical solutions cai et al 2015 yobbi and knochenmus 1989a b for example in the red river vietnam field observations and numerical modeling suggest that adding reservoirs upstream and increasing stream discharge reduces the salinity in the river across the watershed hien et al 2020 in the richmond river estuary system australia periods of low freshwater flow e g droughts excess pumping induce larger tidal excursions and an overall increase in the stream salinity throughout the estuary pierson et al 2001 the studies mentioned above establish separately two links in coastal hydrogeological systems 1 groundwater depletion streamflow reduction and 2 streamflow reduction surface water salinization however the overarching link between groundwater pumping and coastal stream salinization fig 1 has to our knowledge only been explored in one study nobi and gupta 1997 numerical modeling of an integrated aquifer stream system in coastal bangladesh showed that an increase of 30 in groundwater pumping could increase the salinity of the river and push the salt front inland across the simulated watershed nobi and gupta 1997 the timing of the sensitivity of river salinity to groundwater depletion has yet to be explored it is likely that the overarching link between pumping and salinization has been relatively understudied because of 1 the complexity of the multiple interacting processes occurring over a range of time scales and 2 the potential time lag between cause and effect for groundwater system changes it is difficult to distinguish long term trends that create small changes over long periods from fast processes that create large changes over short periods to differentiate between salinization cause and effect high resolution and long term field monitoring may be required yet even in the best data trends may be indistinguishable analytical models offer a practical solution and can produce theoretical estimates of streamflow depletion and salinization similar approaches have been used to characterize subsurface seawater intrusion processes due to pumping for over 100 years the goals of this study are to 1 observe the long term controls on stream salinization and 2 illustrate the potential impact of groundwater pumping on stream salinity using the lower savannah river ga as an example a significant number of studies have been conducted to identify the dominant factor in controlling saltwater intrusion in estuaries but no studies look at groundwater surface water interactions our hypothesis is that pumping induced groundwater depletion could be significant to saltwater intrusion despite being undetectable in most short term data in this study we constrain the extent of saltwater intrusion in the lower savannah river ga with analytical models for groundwater pumping and saltwater intrusion the savannah river is the location of multiple stream gages extensive estuary surveying and tidal monitoring that are rarely available at coastal streams allowing for the initial testing of our analytical model we use observed trends in groundwater pumping stream discharge and stream salinity to determine potential extents of impact with increased pumping and discuss the opportunity that this analytical approach provides for estimating salinization due to groundwater stream interactions in streams lacking high quality longitudinal measurements 2 analytical framework for streamflow depletion and salinization 2 1 pumping and streamflow depletion model to assess the impact of groundwater pumping on streamflow the glover model was used to calculate the relative stream discharge reduction as a function of pumping rate glover and balmer 1954 this model calculates the depletion with time in a single stream and includes the following assumptions 1 the stream and the general groundwater flow direction are perpendicular 2 the streambed has the same hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer 3 the aquifer that feeds the stream is infinite in the horizontal dimension homogeneous and isotropic and 4 the groundwater flow is horizontal additional details about model assumptions can be found in jenkins 1968 the glover equation for a given well relates the volumetric streamflow depletion at a given segment qa to the pumping rate qw using the following complementary error function erfc 1 q a q w e r f c s d 2 4 t t where d is the distance between the well and the stream t is time since pumping and s and t are the aquifer storativity and transmissivity respectively it is important to note that in steady state the entire pumped volume is accounted for by streamflow depletion meaning that q a q w 1 which can be seen in equation 1 with t changes in groundwater recharge rates from precipitation is ignored the percentage of streamflow depletion qa relative to the total streamflow qf is q a q f 100 because the depletion component in this model is solely from groundwater contribution qa can be considered equivalent to the proportion of baseflow this calculated relative depletion is used as input in the saltwater intrusion model explained in the following section 2 2 stream saltwater intrusion model an analytical model developed by savenije 2015 1993 1989 2012 for alluvial estuaries was applied to predict salinization based on stream discharge data hypothetical freshwater discharge values linked to decreased baseflow during low flow periods were used to estimate shifts in the saltwater freshwater interface according to savenije 2012 the salinity distribution can be calculated based on estuary geometry and tidal and hydrologic boundary conditions see fig s1 for an estuary diagram the saltwater intrusion length l is the distance from the estuary mouth to the point where water salinity equals the river water salinity it is described as 2 l i a l n 1 β i 1 where a is the convergence length of the cross sectional area l estuaries are generally funnel or trumpet shaped with a width that tapers upstream in an approximately exponential fashion the length scale of this exponential function is represented by the convergence length the dispersion reduction rate βi is equal to 3 β i ka q f d 0 i a 0 the subscript i refers to the boundary conditions at high water slack hws low water slack lws or the tidal average ta at hws the intrusion is at its maximum and the tidal discharge is zero this condition which is generally the condition of most interest to planners concerned with saltwater intrusion is the focus of this analysis in eq 3 the k is the unitless van der burgh s coefficient van der burgh 1972 calculated following methods described in savenije 1993 the parameter qf l3t 1 is the freshwater river discharge a0 l2 is the tidal averaged cross sectional area at the mouth and d0i l2t 1 is the tidal average dispersion coefficient a proxy for salinity dilution at the mouth of the estuary savenije 1993 solved the expression for the dispersion at the mouth and the saltwater intrusion length at hws using 4 d 0 hws v 0 e 0 1400 h 0 a n r 0 5 where h0 is the depth at the estuary mouth or constant tidal average stream depth l e0 is the tidal excursion at the estuary mouth l v0 is the tidal velocity amplitude at the estuary mouth lt 1 and nr is the estuarine richardson number derivations and additional parameter information can be found in savenije 2012 and section s9 2 for pumping scenarios river discharge qf was reduced by the estimate of stream depletion from groundwater pumping near the river section 2 1 various hypothetical streamflow depletion scenarios were also evaluated including different pumping rates and well distances 3 case study savannah river 3 1 study site the savannah river originates at the confluence of the tugaloo and seneca rivers and forms much of the state border between georgia and south carolina the lower savannah river lsr watershed encompasses approximately 27 500 km2 and ultimately discharges to the atlantic ocean near the city of savannah georgia fig 2 the river is a major water supply for both georgia and south carolina and the location of extensive freshwater tidal marshes including the savannah national wildlife refuge this estuarine system is highly sensitive to saltwater intrusion so the salinity of the lower savannah river has been closely monitored in response to streamflow and tidal action since the 1930s lamar 1940 development impacts on saltwater intrusion including channel deepening for navigational purposes tidal gate construction and the addition of a new channel have also been considered conrads et al 2006 mendelsohn et al 2000 potential increases in spatiotemporal extent of saline reaches due to a shifting of the freshwater saltwater interface would have detrimental effects on water resource and ecosystem stability 3 1 1 stream hydrology and salinity the lsr watershed provides water to the city of savannah and surrounding municipalities for drinking and other uses land use in the watershed consists of urban development in the city of savannah wetlands surrounding the river and a mix of forest pasture and cropland farther upstream provost et al 2006 wickham et al 2021 in the coastal region the system is characterized by a large estuary system that introduces multiple tributaries and meandering channels and includes the savannah national wildlife refuge which is home to ecosystems and wildlife that could be vulnerable to changes in salinity the estuary is characterized by semi diurnal tides with tidal amplitudes of approximately 5 6 ft during neap tides and 8 ft during spring tides historically streamflows on the savannah river range from 115 to 1415 m3 s conrads et al 2006 and are regulated by lake j strom thurmond dam near augusta ga the modifications to the 33 km of the lower river for the savannah harbor have greatly altered the natural river system the channel has been deepened from 4 to 4 5 m to about 13 m over the last several decades which is believed to have affected the movement of saltwater upstream conrads et al 2006 channel dredging and deepening was facilitated by controlled flows at a tide gate installed on the back river below route us 17 conrads et al 2006 while this was effective in dredging the main channel it pushed the freshwater saltwater interface inland to its current position beyond river kilometer 40 conrads et al 2010 conrads et al 2006 baseflow in the lsr watershed is approximately 62 70 of total streamflow and the proportion increases during drought periods priest and clarke 2003 baseflow is mostly discharged from the surficial aquifer but a small portion originates from the floridan system aquifers farther upstream provost et al 2006 topographically higher portions of the watershed have a greater baseflow contribution to streamflow priest and clarke 2003 priest 2004 determined that significant pumping of confined aquifers near the coast may increase inter aquifer leakage this induced leakage from the surficial aquifer to deeper aquifers could reduce discharge as baseflow thus groundwater stream interactions are connected to the surficial aquifer as well as deeper aquifers that are actively pumped despite confining or semiconfining conditions 3 1 2 hydrogeology and groundwater use the flat topography of the lower savannah river basin is underlain by the lower coastal plain aquifer system which consists primarily of a surficial aquifer and the confined floridan aquifer below fig 3 the surficial aquifer is approximately 65 ft of alluvial sands underlain by a confining unit that encompasses the discontinuous brunswick aquifer provost et al 2006 the floridan aquifer includes both an upper and lower unit that both dip toward the southeast priest 2004 provost et al 2006 paleochannel fill cutting through the confining units has been observed offshore as the upper floridan aquifer subcrops in the atlantic ocean cherry 2006 falls et al 2005 provost et al 2006 williams and kuniansky 2015 the sub cropping of confined aquifer units farther inland as well as the incision of confining units filled by paleo savannah river channel alluvium allow for interaction between the floridan and deeper aquifers and streams conrads et al 2006 in the flatter estuarine topography floridan aquifer stream exchange is only likely with longer intermediate and regional groundwater flow paths priest 2004 in the lower coastal plain with the exception of the unconfined surficial aquifers groundwater levels are largely unaffected by climatic factors and fluctuate due to groundwater pumping conrads et al 2006 groundwater withdrawals associated with pumping near the city of savannah produce pronounced drawdowns in groundwater levels that may lead to similar drawdowns in adjacent aquifers due to interaquifer leakage priest 2004 since the late 1800s the upper floridan aquifer has served as the primary source of water for the region conrads et al 2006 increasing groundwater pumping during the last century has led to subsurface saltwater intrusion this prompted development of the shallower surficial and brunswick aquifers as a water source to date the shallower aquifers are mostly used as only a source of irrigation water priest 2004 3 2 observational analysis of stream and groundwater variations streamflow stream salinity and groundwater level data were obtained from the u s geological survey usgs national water information system table s1 south carolina and georgia 2015 county level groundwater pumping rates were determined by usgs reports dieter et al 2018 table s2 stream gage trends in salinity flow and baseflow were characterized over short 1 tidal cycle and long term seasonal and multi year periods using the ecohydrology r package fuka et al 2013 a hydrograph separation to define baseflow upstream of the tidal influence was completed at site g using the lyne and hollick 1979 method alpha 0 925 which uses a recursive digital filter that separates the low frequency baseflow from the higher frequencies present in the time series lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 annual baseflow indices i e baseflow percentage of total discharge were determined from all available data summer baseflow indices were calculated for the months of june through august at each stream gage pearson correlation coefficients between salinity and flow discharge or gage height were used to assess the direct relationship between flow and salinity negative coefficients were generally expected i e as discharge decreases salinity increases despite complications from tidal signals and temporal lags a 38 hour low pass filter is used to assess non tidal trends table s6 two positive correlations were observed for gages that only had gage height measurements rather than discharge the gage height peak occurs before the discharge peak because discharge is affected by both the gage height and the flow velocity 3 3 pumping and streamflow depletion model inputs inputs and source data for the glover solution are shown in table 1 pumping rates were derived from county wide 2015 average groundwater pumping withdrawals mgal d in all use categories public supply domestic irrigation thermoelectric power industrial mining livestock and aquaculture water use for the counties intersecting the lsr watershed dieter et al 2018 fig 2 majority of domestic groundwater withdrawals came from the floridan aquifer system and irrigation withdrawals from the surficial aquifer painter 2019 since the county boundaries are beyond the boundary of the watershed scale factors for each county were determined using the ratio of the county area located within the watershed henceforth referred to as within watershed area and the total county area total county withdrawals in mgal day were multiplied by the county scale factor to establish a within watershed county specific pumping rate to determine the hypothetical well distance from the stream lines were drawn parallel to the river bisecting the within watershed area of each county fig 2 the within watershed area was divided by the length of these lines and multiplied by 0 5 to find a central location for each well the sum of all the pumping rates and average of the well distances were calculated as qw and d respectively of a single hypothetical well therefore we assume the within watershed central location for each county is representative of a random location and the pumping rate represents the average pumping withdrawals for the county in addition to this base case scenario qw and d were independently varied to test the sensitivity of the single well approach inputs to eqs 2 4 were determined for the northern channel of the savannah river based on eq 1 usgs gage data lidar digital elevation models office for coastal management 2021 nhd stream polygons u s geological survey national geospatial program 2021 and noaa bathymetry noaa national centers for environmental information 2016 table 2 by characterizing the estuary geometry on solely the northern main channel this study assumes that a negligible amount of discharge leaves the watershed through the southern channel due to its shallow depth the deeper northern channel leads to a greater saltwater intrusion extent i e greater channel depth and channel convergence is associated with greater inland tidal extent furthermore zhang et al 2011 showed that the analytical solution for individual branches in a multi channel stream or river was as effective in estimating saltwater intrusion as combining the branches as a weighted average because the main channel convergence length was calculated to be greater than the combined main channel and south channel the estuary geometry of the main channel controls the maximum extent of saltwater intrusion in funnel shaped estuaries common to the north atlantic coastal plain the width convergence length b was found to be roughly equal to the convergence length a savenije 2012 because of the similarities of the savannah river in estuary and channel geometry and depositional environment to other funnel shaped estuaries where a b the channel width is used to approximate the convergence length fig s2 to test the robustness of the analytical saltwater intrusion length estimate parameters in table 2 were independently varied and compared to the overall intrusion length a 10 uncertainty independent of parameter unit is considered to depict relative control of each parameter 4 results 4 1 observed discharge salinity relationships freshwater discharge from the savannah river measured at site g approximately 103 km upstream from the estuary mouth varies between 110 and 1637 m3 s low flows typically occur during late summer fig s3 over the past 20 years baseflow has accounted for an average of 80 of the total flow table s3 seasonal differences in baseflow result in higher proportions of groundwater in streamflow during the summer table s3 at the river mouth tidal forcing causes an oscillation between 1000 and 1000 m3 s where the negative designates flow moving inland the tidal range is approximately 3 6 m and 1 5 m during spring and neap cycles respectively correlations between discharge and salinity are complex and mirror tidal ebbs and flows in the lower savannah river fig 4 discharge is greatest in both the upstream negative value and downstream positive value direction when the tides are rising and falling respectively at high tide and low tide stream discharge is zero the maximum and minimum salinities occur when discharge is zero pairwise correlations of collocated simultaneous measurements of salinity and discharge do not show strong negative relationships e g lower discharge related to higher salinity because both the peak and trough of the salinity signal occur during slack water gage data along the savannah river show saltwater intrusion at high spring tide reaching distances greater than 51 km inland fig 5 linear trendlines show a decrease in salinity of 0 7 ppt km fig 5 assuming a saltwater freshwater gradient 0 7 ppt km the maximum saltwater intrusion length in the savannah river is between 51 and 58 km inland 4 2 results of analytical modeling of streamflow salinity relationships using eqn 2 and the parameters listed in table 2 the high slack water saltwater intrusion is calculated to be approximately 56 km in the savannah river fig 6 this is a close match to gage salinity observations fig 5 the model estimate was most sensitive to variations in tidal depth h0 convergence width a and convergence length b fig 7 convergence length has the most influence on intrusion length while also being a particularly difficult parameter to estimate this study assumes b a due to the funnel shaped estuary the saltwater intrusion length is inversely related to the discharge the lower the discharge the greater the intrusion length the saltwater intrusion length generally changes at a rate of 14 3 qf m3 s where the negative indicates the upstream movement of the intrusion as freshwater discharge qf decreases table s4 a hypothetical 25 decrease in freshwater flow will lead to 4 km 7 1 increase in saltwater intrusion length while a 25 increase in freshwater flow will lead to a 3 km 5 3 decrease in saltwater intrusion length fig 6 the glover model demonstrates a non linear relationship between streamflow depletion and pumping characteristics e g location time and rate using model inputs from table 1 and the total within watershed pumping withdrawals base scenario pumping at a rate of 88 542 m3 day at a central within watershed county location causes a 1 reduction in streamflow or a 100 m upstream shift in the salt front fig 8 the depletion was 0 26 and 0 39 of total freshwater discharge after 50 and 500 years of pumping respectively chatham county where the city of savannah is located reports groundwater pumping rates much higher than neighboring counties these pumping rates increase the average streamflow depletion estimate for the region if all counties extracted groundwater at the chatham county pumping rates then the streamflow depletion in the savannah river would be greater than 1 fig 8 in the glover model pumping rate and well to stream distance had an impact on stream depletion timing and volume fig 6 s4 table 4 s4 well to stream distance had a larger impact than pumping rate on timing to depletion effects under the base scenario there was a 210 day time lag between the model start time and a 1 m3 day depletion volume 5 discussion 5 1 impact of pumping regimes on saltwater intrusion regional studies have shown decades of subsurface saltwater intrusion from groundwater pumping and surface salinization due to stream alteration near savannah conrads et al 2006 priest 2004 provost et al 2006 efforts to mitigate saltwater intrusion have led to shifts in water conservation priorities decreases in groundwater pumping and river dredging studies conrads et al 2006 provost et al 2006 based on analytical models current pumping rates will lead to small increases in saltwater intrusion in the savannah river current pumping in the savannah watershed is a small portion of the overall flow in the river thus limiting the impact of pumping on saltwater intrusion by less than 1 100 m upstream although findings indicate that reported groundwater pumping rates have little direct impact on streamflows a consistent increase of 100 m saltwater intrusion could have an important effect on the coastal system these long term slow salinization processes increase the risk of detrimental effects of the fast salinization events such as storm surge tidal highs and drought for example during extended periods of drought the increased demands on irrigation may lead to higher pumping rates and more streamflow depletion during these droughts baseflow accounts for a higher proportion of the stream because the water level in the local flow system may be substantially decreased exfiltration comes from the intermediate and regional flow systems and deeper aquifers where pumping drawdowns are greater faye and mayer 1990 the model predicts that the lowest recorded streamflows in the savannah river 115 m3 s could allow saltwater intrusion extending up to 65 km inland while annually baseflow accounts for roughly 80 of total savannah river streamflow baseflow accounts for up to 90 of total streamflow during the summer and a reduction in baseflow during this time would have a greater impact on overall stream quantity and quality table s3 inversely if relative contribution of baseflow decreases due climatic shifts e g increase in stormwater from increased precipitation pumping induced depletion may become negligible while current pumping rates suggest minimal impact on the saltwater front in the savannah river it is likely to have a much greater effect under higher pumping regimes and in smaller watersheds if the city of savannah were to double their pumping the salt front could move 200 m inland which is equivalent to 0 8 streamflow depletion in some watersheds however irrigation wells can decrease streamflow by 10 to 25 burt et al 2002 killian et al 2019 for example in a watershed in north carolina close to the area studied here increased agricultural water needs have led to a 10 decrease in flow zipper et al 2019a in the savannah river the depletion potential fienen et al 2017 a term referring to the potential reduction in streamflow from pumping may even exceed 10 streamflow depletion during the irrigation season estimates of streamflow depletion in this study are much lower due to the yearly average approach for example reports of total irrigation groundwater withdrawals for lsr watershed counties in south carolina account for approximately 60 of annual usage from june to september monroe 2018 considering this seasonal distribution of irrigation pumping which concentrates most of the pumping during the growing season using the county specific mean as a constant underestimates the pumping rate for the summer months additional studies on the time lag between increased summer pumping and streamflow depletion are necessary to determine if these seasonal fluctuations lead to lasting saltwater intrusion impacts assuming other coastal streams experience similar or greater levels of streamflow depletion groundwater pumping may have induced undocumented stream salinization in the past and may increase risk of saltwater intrusion in the future near stream groundwater management will be essential to reduce saltwater intrusion impacts in regions with highly connected groundwater surface water resources the combined data analysis and analytical modeling approach demonstrated in this study may be applied to other coastal systems even those with limited data to better understand the management implications longitudinal field studies and numerical models may help unravel hydrologic feedbacks and site specific heterogeneity in the groundwater pumping and stream salinity relationship 5 2 ecological impacts of increased pumping with increased groundwater pumping and streamflow depletion salt will extend 100 s to 1000 s m upstream through the savannah national wildlife refuge fig 6 this protected region is the location of a large portion of the tidal freshwater marshes left in southeastern states the conditions for tidal freshwater and oligohaline marshes exist for only a few kilometers along the savannah river placing a great importance on the conservation of this reach lindgren 2010 salinity is the main designation between the marsh vegetation assemblages and distributions latham et al 1991 ecological shifts in response to a saltwater intrusion are expected to be extreme as salt tolerant vegetation communities e g scirpus validus become dominant in altered freshwater oligohaline marsh communities welch and kitchens 2007 already over half of the tidal freshwater marshes has been lost in the refuge due to upstream transgression of the salinity gradient griess 2011 the northern part of the refuge consists mostly of bottomland hardwoods and cypress gum swamp that may be periodically flooded dodd and barichivich 2017 garman and nielsen 1992 griess 2011 these regions contain small channels and an extensive number of woodland pools and creeks important for declining populations of amphibians dodd and barichivich 2017 forest dieback and saltwater intrusion could cause irreversible damage to this wildlife refuge ecosystem 5 3 model evaluation and limitations the analytical stream salinity model matches data for the savannah river well the model predicts the inland extent of saltwater intrusion at high slack water to be 56 km fig 6 which is consistent with reports of saltwater detected more than 40 km upstream with tidal water level signals reaching 64 km upstream bossart 2002 conrads et al 2006 pearlstine et al 1993 this calculation assumes the system has reached steady state and disregards any time delays between stream discharge and salinity although this would lead to an overprediction the limitations in the glover model may underpredict the impact of current pumping rates on the savannah when assessing the performance of analytical models it is important to consider the simplifying assumptions that they include for streamflow depletion the glover solution assumes a homogeneous isotropic subsurface in direct connection with a stream of constant flow glover and balmer 1954 the hydrogeological setting of the lower coastal plain does not meet these idealized conditions for example transmissivity is a large component of this model and the transmissivity of the surficial aquifer is highly variable provost et al 2006 however we expect that our estimates of streamflow depletion may be underestimated mostly due to nonlinearities in the glover solution our calculations assume that pumping rates are evenly distributed across each adjacent county based on that the sum of pumping rates is modeled as a single well located in the middle between the river and the boundary of the watershed for the adopted parameters table 1 the relationship between the stream to well distance and the depletion indeed approached linearity rapidly fig s5 which supports this simplified approach however for certain hydrologic regimes it is possible that this relationship is non linear blue curve in fig s5 and wells located closer to the river are highly impactful and distant ones are negligible this simplification is hard to resolve without further information on specific pumping rates and site specific hydrologic conditions zipper et al 2021 in cases where the impact of wells decays with distance faster than linearity modeling a single well located halfway between the river and the watershed boundary likely underestimates streamflow depletion due to greater development along the river a future analysis of unevenly distributed pumping rates may illustrate the importance of pumping distances for saltwater intrusion each parameter used in the analytical approach has uncertainty and the model parameters can coevolve for example streamflow qf will impact channel geometry e g depth mouth shape and tidal and hydrologic boundary conditions e g velocity this can lead to compounding effects of streamflow reduction and sea level rise the approach used here assumes no delay in reaching the maximum saltwater intrusion length at equilibrium however estuary systems react differently to increases versus decreases in freshwater discharge an increase in discharge propagates as a mass wave very quickly through the system however decreased discharge is gradual since fresh and saline water must mix in the channel the estimation for the maximum saltwater intrusion extent to pumping may never be reached if higher pulses of freshwater discharge i e during wet winter seasons prevent the system from reaching equilibrium 5 4 contribution of pumping vs other saltwater intrusion factors the relationship between coastal stream salinity and freshwater discharge is controlled by processes that take place simultaneously over a wide range of timescales ranging from short term storm events to long term sea level rise and precipitation changes the discussion on coastal stream salinization revolves mostly around sea level rise or channel alteration in this analysis these factors are important controls for example sea level is predicted to rise approximately 39 cm along the south carolina and georgia coastlines by the year 2100 church et al 2013 there is also indication that the tidal amplitude has exhibited long term change e g müller 2011 suggested a 2 increase per century but the impact on saltwater intrusion is not well understood calculations show that a 10 increase in tidal depth associated with sea level rise or a 10 increase in tidal amplitude may extend saltwater intrusion by another 2 km fig 7 meanwhile a slight shift in convergence width due to geomorphological alteration could push the freshwater saltwater interface significantly up to 3 km 6 conclusions we show for the first time the direct link between groundwater pumping and coastal stream salinity in the savannah river pumping induced streamflow depletion is currently limited and leads to little salinization compared to storm surge channel dredging and sea level rise increases in groundwater pumping however could increase this impact equaling or exceeding the impacts of sea level rise or geomorphic change and ultimately altering the distribution and health of the coastal ecosystems salinity is a critical factor in the ecological balance and this study allows for investigation of hypothetical development in the region the impacts of groundwater pumping on coastal stream salinity is an important management consideration for developed coastlines the combined glover and savenije models give an estimate for the position of the salt front consistent with observations glover and balmer 1954 savenije 2012 the initial testing of the validity of this method would have been difficult without the multiple stream gages extensive estuary surveying and tidal monitoring that are rarely available since there are few coastal watersheds like the savannah river with high quality longitudinal measurements of both stream and groundwater resources this analytical approach provides a means of estimating salinization due to groundwater stream interactions the parameters required for the models can be inferred from regional hydrogeology satellite imagery and basic tidal curves an extensive application of the approach would identify vulnerable coastal systems in need of careful groundwater management the complexities of groundwater surface water interactions are not well understood in regions experiencing increased water use land use change and climate change along coastlines management of these interconnected water resources is complicated by the risk of salinization by assessing the potential impact of groundwater pumping on near coast streamflow future studies concerned with stream salinization should include impacts of groundwater pumping in addition to discussions of sea level rise channel alteration and reduced precipitation reliable estimates of streamflow depletion are essential for effective water management in coastal plains 7 plain text summary the location of the freshwater saltwater interface in coastal streams is a balance between upstream river flows and downstream tidal forcing during periods of high streamflow seawater is prevented from intruding upstream and the freshwater saltwater interface is located relatively close to the ocean during periods of low streamflow high salinity water moves upstream shifting the saltwater freshwater interface coastal stream salinization may be caused by rising sea levels increasing storm intensity and prolonged drought but changes in groundwater use may also play a role we assess the impact of groundwater pumping on the salinity of savannah river ga stream measurements show that salinity reaches 51 58 km inland during high tide and low freshwater stream discharge conditions using two mathematical models one for stream saltwater intrusion and one for streamflow depletion from pumping we determine that reported groundwater pumping rates only decrease streamflow by 1 resulting in an increase in the saltwater intrusion length of 100 m however increased groundwater pumping could increase saltwater intrusion by 4 km this would have devastating impacts for freshwater ecosystems and coastal water resources overall we present a new analytical framework that can help determine vulnerable coastal systems and opportunities to better water management credit authorship contribution statement chelsea n peters conceptualization methodology

3840,groundwater surface water interactions and associated water management issues are complicated by the risk of salinization along coastlines groundwater pumping can be a driving factor of streamflow depletion and allow for increased stream saltwater intrusion in this study we develop an analytical framework combining two analytical approaches to calculate the length of saltwater intrusion at high slack water and the stream depletion rate due to groundwater pumping we test this framework using data from the savannah river in southeastern u s and use it to explore saltwater intrusion in the surface water system the analytical approach produces an accurate estimate of the position of the salt front at approximately 56 km inland current pumping rates decrease streamflow by less than 1 resulting in an increase in the saltwater intrusion length of 100 m increased groundwater pumping scenarios however show a risk of extending the saltwater intrusion length up to 4 km inland in these cases effects from pumping induced saltwater intrusion would equal or exceed the impacts of sea level rise or geomorphic change salinity is a critical factor in the ecological balance of this estuarine ecosystem and this analytical approach allows for investigation of hypothetical groundwater development in the region we show for the first time the direct link between groundwater pumping and coastal stream salinity that should be an important management consideration all along developed coastlines abbreviations hws high water slack swi saltwater intrusion lsr lower savannah river keywords groundwater surface water relations salinization pumping coastal aquifers savannah river georgia usa baseflow 1 introduction in coastal areas where nearly half of the world population lives water resources are continually threatened by natural and anthropogenic stressors michael et al 2017 both surface and subsurface water reservoirs are at risk of salinization due to saltwater intrusion in estuaries increased salinization may cause adverse impacts on freshwater resources and ecological function this is particularly true under the increasing pressure of climate change and sea level rise the mouth of coastal streams is a transition zone between saline seawater and terrestrial freshwater and the location of this interface is dictated by the balance between streamflow meteorological conditions and tidal forcing conrads et al 2006 ross et al 2015 in general during periods of high streamflow seawater is prevented from intruding upstream and the freshwater saltwater interface salinity of 0 5 ppt is located relatively close to the ocean during periods of low streamflow high salinity water moves upstream shifting the freshwater saltwater interface and potentially compromising freshwater resources and ecosystems the balance between the terrestrial flow system and ocean forcing is complicated by multiple processes natural and human induced that occur across various time scales these processes include but are not limited to storms tides seasonal climatic fluctuations groundwater pumping and interannual variability the freshwater saltwater interface in coastal streams is controlled by a delicate balance between these often opposing and simultaneous forces for example coastal storms can temporarily increase the salinity in surficial water reservoirs through elevated sea level wind waves and storm surge that collectively push the freshwater saltwater interface inland huang et al 2014 simultaneously extreme high runoff events from coastal storm precipitation may increase freshwater discharge which can potentially push the transition zone seaward and reduce the overall stream salinity hagy et al 2000 lerczak et al 2009 tian 2019 furthermore spring neap tidal cycles are a major control on the vertical and horizontal distributions of salinity in estuaries ji 2008 high tidal range leads to strong vertical mixing and little stratification whereas low tides create poorly mixed highly stratified salt wedges in the stream simpson et al 1990 depending on the dominant force water in tidally mixed estuaries can change from completely fresh to saline within a tidal cycle whereas salinity in larger estuaries more controlled by seasonal freshwater inflows may show little fluctuation ji 2008 previous studies have shown that in coastal streams seasonal variations in saltwater intrusion are primarily controlled by sea surface level hong and shen 2012 whereas longer term interannual variability is largely dominated by river flow tian 2019 modeling studies have demonstrated that long term sea level rise causes shifts in estuarine salinity circulation tidal impacts and maximum extent of intrusion e g bhuiyan and dutta 2012 hilton et al 2008 hong and shen 2012 however the natural variability in local climatology and river runoff may obscure these weak trends and make them undetectable without extensive data or modeling wiseman et al 1990 although fast processes like storm surges cause greater variation long term slow processes magnify the effects of the fast processes this is of particular importance when considering the complexity of groundwater surface interactions in coastal systems groundwater interacts with surface water through infiltration and exfiltration and can significantly alter stream discharge the groundwater contribution to streamflow termed baseflow may be reduced by natural e g low precipitation and recharge or anthropogenic e g pumping groundwater depletion the streamflow is almost entirely baseflow during times of minimal rainfall priest 2004 thus for certain estuaries estimates of groundwater discharge rates might be important for a complete understanding of the coastal hydrologic system hagy et al 2000 groundwater withdrawals have been cited as a driving factor of streamflow depletion in a wide variety of aquifers including coastal plains for example the cumulative response to groundwater pumping in the northern atlantic coastal plain contributed to greater than a 20 reduction in streamflow masterson et al 2016 the ganges river india has seen large scale river dry out over the past five decades triggered by a 59 reduction in baseflow from irrigation withdrawals mukherjee et al 2018 similarly li et al 2020 calculated the streamflow depletion from groundwater pumping in two watersheds in canada and showed that depending on the site specific hydrogeology and the well location the volume of water pumped could cause an equivalent decrease in stream volume in gaining streams it is not necessary for a well to reverse flow gradients below the stream to reduce baseflow streamflow depletion occurs when the well simply captures some of the baseflow discharge before it reaches the stream chen and yin 2001 wilson 1993 it is thus clear that regardless of the level of complexity groundwater withdrawal inevitably results in depleted streamflow barlow et al 2018 numerous studies have used different forms of field based and statistical analysis e g barlow et al 2014 killian et al 2019 numerical models e g griebling and neupauer 2013 leake and pool 2010 and analytical models e g barlow and leake 2012 hunt 1999 li et al 2020 zipper et al 2019b to demonstrate the linkages between groundwater levels and streamflow the field based analysis requires extensive surface water and groundwater measurements numerical models are process based representations of the flow and can be prohibitively complex requiring time expertise and computational power to perform a site specific analysis compared to numerical models analytical models provide a simpler approach to calculate streamflow depletion for different hydrogeologic conditions analytical solutions show that streamflow reduction due to groundwater depletion is mainly controlled by the aquifer transmissivity and storativity by the streambed resistance to seepage and by the proximity of pumping wells to the stream hunt 1999 numerical simulations of real world settings showed that analytical models perform better in relatively simple hydrogeological settings while in more complex systems the errors are large li et al 2020 zipper et al 2019b overall the dynamics and trends predicted by the analytical solutions hold for both settings therefore analytical approaches appropriately demonstrate links between groundwater pumping and streamflow depletion in most watersheds where the aquifer is connected to the surficial system barlow and leake 2012 hunt 1999 killian et al 2019 li et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2018 zipper et al 2018 zipper et al 2019b in the case of coastal watersheds reduction in streamflow is expected to induce an inland migration of the salt front this mechanism has been shown and discussed extensively in several studies including field observations e g lamar 1940 yobbi and knochenmus 1989a b numerical simulations conrads et al 2006 nobi and gupta 1997 and analytical solutions cai et al 2015 yobbi and knochenmus 1989a b for example in the red river vietnam field observations and numerical modeling suggest that adding reservoirs upstream and increasing stream discharge reduces the salinity in the river across the watershed hien et al 2020 in the richmond river estuary system australia periods of low freshwater flow e g droughts excess pumping induce larger tidal excursions and an overall increase in the stream salinity throughout the estuary pierson et al 2001 the studies mentioned above establish separately two links in coastal hydrogeological systems 1 groundwater depletion streamflow reduction and 2 streamflow reduction surface water salinization however the overarching link between groundwater pumping and coastal stream salinization fig 1 has to our knowledge only been explored in one study nobi and gupta 1997 numerical modeling of an integrated aquifer stream system in coastal bangladesh showed that an increase of 30 in groundwater pumping could increase the salinity of the river and push the salt front inland across the simulated watershed nobi and gupta 1997 the timing of the sensitivity of river salinity to groundwater depletion has yet to be explored it is likely that the overarching link between pumping and salinization has been relatively understudied because of 1 the complexity of the multiple interacting processes occurring over a range of time scales and 2 the potential time lag between cause and effect for groundwater system changes it is difficult to distinguish long term trends that create small changes over long periods from fast processes that create large changes over short periods to differentiate between salinization cause and effect high resolution and long term field monitoring may be required yet even in the best data trends may be indistinguishable analytical models offer a practical solution and can produce theoretical estimates of streamflow depletion and salinization similar approaches have been used to characterize subsurface seawater intrusion processes due to pumping for over 100 years the goals of this study are to 1 observe the long term controls on stream salinization and 2 illustrate the potential impact of groundwater pumping on stream salinity using the lower savannah river ga as an example a significant number of studies have been conducted to identify the dominant factor in controlling saltwater intrusion in estuaries but no studies look at groundwater surface water interactions our hypothesis is that pumping induced groundwater depletion could be significant to saltwater intrusion despite being undetectable in most short term data in this study we constrain the extent of saltwater intrusion in the lower savannah river ga with analytical models for groundwater pumping and saltwater intrusion the savannah river is the location of multiple stream gages extensive estuary surveying and tidal monitoring that are rarely available at coastal streams allowing for the initial testing of our analytical model we use observed trends in groundwater pumping stream discharge and stream salinity to determine potential extents of impact with increased pumping and discuss the opportunity that this analytical approach provides for estimating salinization due to groundwater stream interactions in streams lacking high quality longitudinal measurements 2 analytical framework for streamflow depletion and salinization 2 1 pumping and streamflow depletion model to assess the impact of groundwater pumping on streamflow the glover model was used to calculate the relative stream discharge reduction as a function of pumping rate glover and balmer 1954 this model calculates the depletion with time in a single stream and includes the following assumptions 1 the stream and the general groundwater flow direction are perpendicular 2 the streambed has the same hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer 3 the aquifer that feeds the stream is infinite in the horizontal dimension homogeneous and isotropic and 4 the groundwater flow is horizontal additional details about model assumptions can be found in jenkins 1968 the glover equation for a given well relates the volumetric streamflow depletion at a given segment qa to the pumping rate qw using the following complementary error function erfc 1 q a q w e r f c s d 2 4 t t where d is the distance between the well and the stream t is time since pumping and s and t are the aquifer storativity and transmissivity respectively it is important to note that in steady state the entire pumped volume is accounted for by streamflow depletion meaning that q a q w 1 which can be seen in equation 1 with t changes in groundwater recharge rates from precipitation is ignored the percentage of streamflow depletion qa relative to the total streamflow qf is q a q f 100 because the depletion component in this model is solely from groundwater contribution qa can be considered equivalent to the proportion of baseflow this calculated relative depletion is used as input in the saltwater intrusion model explained in the following section 2 2 stream saltwater intrusion model an analytical model developed by savenije 2015 1993 1989 2012 for alluvial estuaries was applied to predict salinization based on stream discharge data hypothetical freshwater discharge values linked to decreased baseflow during low flow periods were used to estimate shifts in the saltwater freshwater interface according to savenije 2012 the salinity distribution can be calculated based on estuary geometry and tidal and hydrologic boundary conditions see fig s1 for an estuary diagram the saltwater intrusion length l is the distance from the estuary mouth to the point where water salinity equals the river water salinity it is described as 2 l i a l n 1 β i 1 where a is the convergence length of the cross sectional area l estuaries are generally funnel or trumpet shaped with a width that tapers upstream in an approximately exponential fashion the length scale of this exponential function is represented by the convergence length the dispersion reduction rate βi is equal to 3 β i ka q f d 0 i a 0 the subscript i refers to the boundary conditions at high water slack hws low water slack lws or the tidal average ta at hws the intrusion is at its maximum and the tidal discharge is zero this condition which is generally the condition of most interest to planners concerned with saltwater intrusion is the focus of this analysis in eq 3 the k is the unitless van der burgh s coefficient van der burgh 1972 calculated following methods described in savenije 1993 the parameter qf l3t 1 is the freshwater river discharge a0 l2 is the tidal averaged cross sectional area at the mouth and d0i l2t 1 is the tidal average dispersion coefficient a proxy for salinity dilution at the mouth of the estuary savenije 1993 solved the expression for the dispersion at the mouth and the saltwater intrusion length at hws using 4 d 0 hws v 0 e 0 1400 h 0 a n r 0 5 where h0 is the depth at the estuary mouth or constant tidal average stream depth l e0 is the tidal excursion at the estuary mouth l v0 is the tidal velocity amplitude at the estuary mouth lt 1 and nr is the estuarine richardson number derivations and additional parameter information can be found in savenije 2012 and section s9 2 for pumping scenarios river discharge qf was reduced by the estimate of stream depletion from groundwater pumping near the river section 2 1 various hypothetical streamflow depletion scenarios were also evaluated including different pumping rates and well distances 3 case study savannah river 3 1 study site the savannah river originates at the confluence of the tugaloo and seneca rivers and forms much of the state border between georgia and south carolina the lower savannah river lsr watershed encompasses approximately 27 500 km2 and ultimately discharges to the atlantic ocean near the city of savannah georgia fig 2 the river is a major water supply for both georgia and south carolina and the location of extensive freshwater tidal marshes including the savannah national wildlife refuge this estuarine system is highly sensitive to saltwater intrusion so the salinity of the lower savannah river has been closely monitored in response to streamflow and tidal action since the 1930s lamar 1940 development impacts on saltwater intrusion including channel deepening for navigational purposes tidal gate construction and the addition of a new channel have also been considered conrads et al 2006 mendelsohn et al 2000 potential increases in spatiotemporal extent of saline reaches due to a shifting of the freshwater saltwater interface would have detrimental effects on water resource and ecosystem stability 3 1 1 stream hydrology and salinity the lsr watershed provides water to the city of savannah and surrounding municipalities for drinking and other uses land use in the watershed consists of urban development in the city of savannah wetlands surrounding the river and a mix of forest pasture and cropland farther upstream provost et al 2006 wickham et al 2021 in the coastal region the system is characterized by a large estuary system that introduces multiple tributaries and meandering channels and includes the savannah national wildlife refuge which is home to ecosystems and wildlife that could be vulnerable to changes in salinity the estuary is characterized by semi diurnal tides with tidal amplitudes of approximately 5 6 ft during neap tides and 8 ft during spring tides historically streamflows on the savannah river range from 115 to 1415 m3 s conrads et al 2006 and are regulated by lake j strom thurmond dam near augusta ga the modifications to the 33 km of the lower river for the savannah harbor have greatly altered the natural river system the channel has been deepened from 4 to 4 5 m to about 13 m over the last several decades which is believed to have affected the movement of saltwater upstream conrads et al 2006 channel dredging and deepening was facilitated by controlled flows at a tide gate installed on the back river below route us 17 conrads et al 2006 while this was effective in dredging the main channel it pushed the freshwater saltwater interface inland to its current position beyond river kilometer 40 conrads et al 2010 conrads et al 2006 baseflow in the lsr watershed is approximately 62 70 of total streamflow and the proportion increases during drought periods priest and clarke 2003 baseflow is mostly discharged from the surficial aquifer but a small portion originates from the floridan system aquifers farther upstream provost et al 2006 topographically higher portions of the watershed have a greater baseflow contribution to streamflow priest and clarke 2003 priest 2004 determined that significant pumping of confined aquifers near the coast may increase inter aquifer leakage this induced leakage from the surficial aquifer to deeper aquifers could reduce discharge as baseflow thus groundwater stream interactions are connected to the surficial aquifer as well as deeper aquifers that are actively pumped despite confining or semiconfining conditions 3 1 2 hydrogeology and groundwater use the flat topography of the lower savannah river basin is underlain by the lower coastal plain aquifer system which consists primarily of a surficial aquifer and the confined floridan aquifer below fig 3 the surficial aquifer is approximately 65 ft of alluvial sands underlain by a confining unit that encompasses the discontinuous brunswick aquifer provost et al 2006 the floridan aquifer includes both an upper and lower unit that both dip toward the southeast priest 2004 provost et al 2006 paleochannel fill cutting through the confining units has been observed offshore as the upper floridan aquifer subcrops in the atlantic ocean cherry 2006 falls et al 2005 provost et al 2006 williams and kuniansky 2015 the sub cropping of confined aquifer units farther inland as well as the incision of confining units filled by paleo savannah river channel alluvium allow for interaction between the floridan and deeper aquifers and streams conrads et al 2006 in the flatter estuarine topography floridan aquifer stream exchange is only likely with longer intermediate and regional groundwater flow paths priest 2004 in the lower coastal plain with the exception of the unconfined surficial aquifers groundwater levels are largely unaffected by climatic factors and fluctuate due to groundwater pumping conrads et al 2006 groundwater withdrawals associated with pumping near the city of savannah produce pronounced drawdowns in groundwater levels that may lead to similar drawdowns in adjacent aquifers due to interaquifer leakage priest 2004 since the late 1800s the upper floridan aquifer has served as the primary source of water for the region conrads et al 2006 increasing groundwater pumping during the last century has led to subsurface saltwater intrusion this prompted development of the shallower surficial and brunswick aquifers as a water source to date the shallower aquifers are mostly used as only a source of irrigation water priest 2004 3 2 observational analysis of stream and groundwater variations streamflow stream salinity and groundwater level data were obtained from the u s geological survey usgs national water information system table s1 south carolina and georgia 2015 county level groundwater pumping rates were determined by usgs reports dieter et al 2018 table s2 stream gage trends in salinity flow and baseflow were characterized over short 1 tidal cycle and long term seasonal and multi year periods using the ecohydrology r package fuka et al 2013 a hydrograph separation to define baseflow upstream of the tidal influence was completed at site g using the lyne and hollick 1979 method alpha 0 925 which uses a recursive digital filter that separates the low frequency baseflow from the higher frequencies present in the time series lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 annual baseflow indices i e baseflow percentage of total discharge were determined from all available data summer baseflow indices were calculated for the months of june through august at each stream gage pearson correlation coefficients between salinity and flow discharge or gage height were used to assess the direct relationship between flow and salinity negative coefficients were generally expected i e as discharge decreases salinity increases despite complications from tidal signals and temporal lags a 38 hour low pass filter is used to assess non tidal trends table s6 two positive correlations were observed for gages that only had gage height measurements rather than discharge the gage height peak occurs before the discharge peak because discharge is affected by both the gage height and the flow velocity 3 3 pumping and streamflow depletion model inputs inputs and source data for the glover solution are shown in table 1 pumping rates were derived from county wide 2015 average groundwater pumping withdrawals mgal d in all use categories public supply domestic irrigation thermoelectric power industrial mining livestock and aquaculture water use for the counties intersecting the lsr watershed dieter et al 2018 fig 2 majority of domestic groundwater withdrawals came from the floridan aquifer system and irrigation withdrawals from the surficial aquifer painter 2019 since the county boundaries are beyond the boundary of the watershed scale factors for each county were determined using the ratio of the county area located within the watershed henceforth referred to as within watershed area and the total county area total county withdrawals in mgal day were multiplied by the county scale factor to establish a within watershed county specific pumping rate to determine the hypothetical well distance from the stream lines were drawn parallel to the river bisecting the within watershed area of each county fig 2 the within watershed area was divided by the length of these lines and multiplied by 0 5 to find a central location for each well the sum of all the pumping rates and average of the well distances were calculated as qw and d respectively of a single hypothetical well therefore we assume the within watershed central location for each county is representative of a random location and the pumping rate represents the average pumping withdrawals for the county in addition to this base case scenario qw and d were independently varied to test the sensitivity of the single well approach inputs to eqs 2 4 were determined for the northern channel of the savannah river based on eq 1 usgs gage data lidar digital elevation models office for coastal management 2021 nhd stream polygons u s geological survey national geospatial program 2021 and noaa bathymetry noaa national centers for environmental information 2016 table 2 by characterizing the estuary geometry on solely the northern main channel this study assumes that a negligible amount of discharge leaves the watershed through the southern channel due to its shallow depth the deeper northern channel leads to a greater saltwater intrusion extent i e greater channel depth and channel convergence is associated with greater inland tidal extent furthermore zhang et al 2011 showed that the analytical solution for individual branches in a multi channel stream or river was as effective in estimating saltwater intrusion as combining the branches as a weighted average because the main channel convergence length was calculated to be greater than the combined main channel and south channel the estuary geometry of the main channel controls the maximum extent of saltwater intrusion in funnel shaped estuaries common to the north atlantic coastal plain the width convergence length b was found to be roughly equal to the convergence length a savenije 2012 because of the similarities of the savannah river in estuary and channel geometry and depositional environment to other funnel shaped estuaries where a b the channel width is used to approximate the convergence length fig s2 to test the robustness of the analytical saltwater intrusion length estimate parameters in table 2 were independently varied and compared to the overall intrusion length a 10 uncertainty independent of parameter unit is considered to depict relative control of each parameter 4 results 4 1 observed discharge salinity relationships freshwater discharge from the savannah river measured at site g approximately 103 km upstream from the estuary mouth varies between 110 and 1637 m3 s low flows typically occur during late summer fig s3 over the past 20 years baseflow has accounted for an average of 80 of the total flow table s3 seasonal differences in baseflow result in higher proportions of groundwater in streamflow during the summer table s3 at the river mouth tidal forcing causes an oscillation between 1000 and 1000 m3 s where the negative designates flow moving inland the tidal range is approximately 3 6 m and 1 5 m during spring and neap cycles respectively correlations between discharge and salinity are complex and mirror tidal ebbs and flows in the lower savannah river fig 4 discharge is greatest in both the upstream negative value and downstream positive value direction when the tides are rising and falling respectively at high tide and low tide stream discharge is zero the maximum and minimum salinities occur when discharge is zero pairwise correlations of collocated simultaneous measurements of salinity and discharge do not show strong negative relationships e g lower discharge related to higher salinity because both the peak and trough of the salinity signal occur during slack water gage data along the savannah river show saltwater intrusion at high spring tide reaching distances greater than 51 km inland fig 5 linear trendlines show a decrease in salinity of 0 7 ppt km fig 5 assuming a saltwater freshwater gradient 0 7 ppt km the maximum saltwater intrusion length in the savannah river is between 51 and 58 km inland 4 2 results of analytical modeling of streamflow salinity relationships using eqn 2 and the parameters listed in table 2 the high slack water saltwater intrusion is calculated to be approximately 56 km in the savannah river fig 6 this is a close match to gage salinity observations fig 5 the model estimate was most sensitive to variations in tidal depth h0 convergence width a and convergence length b fig 7 convergence length has the most influence on intrusion length while also being a particularly difficult parameter to estimate this study assumes b a due to the funnel shaped estuary the saltwater intrusion length is inversely related to the discharge the lower the discharge the greater the intrusion length the saltwater intrusion length generally changes at a rate of 14 3 qf m3 s where the negative indicates the upstream movement of the intrusion as freshwater discharge qf decreases table s4 a hypothetical 25 decrease in freshwater flow will lead to 4 km 7 1 increase in saltwater intrusion length while a 25 increase in freshwater flow will lead to a 3 km 5 3 decrease in saltwater intrusion length fig 6 the glover model demonstrates a non linear relationship between streamflow depletion and pumping characteristics e g location time and rate using model inputs from table 1 and the total within watershed pumping withdrawals base scenario pumping at a rate of 88 542 m3 day at a central within watershed county location causes a 1 reduction in streamflow or a 100 m upstream shift in the salt front fig 8 the depletion was 0 26 and 0 39 of total freshwater discharge after 50 and 500 years of pumping respectively chatham county where the city of savannah is located reports groundwater pumping rates much higher than neighboring counties these pumping rates increase the average streamflow depletion estimate for the region if all counties extracted groundwater at the chatham county pumping rates then the streamflow depletion in the savannah river would be greater than 1 fig 8 in the glover model pumping rate and well to stream distance had an impact on stream depletion timing and volume fig 6 s4 table 4 s4 well to stream distance had a larger impact than pumping rate on timing to depletion effects under the base scenario there was a 210 day time lag between the model start time and a 1 m3 day depletion volume 5 discussion 5 1 impact of pumping regimes on saltwater intrusion regional studies have shown decades of subsurface saltwater intrusion from groundwater pumping and surface salinization due to stream alteration near savannah conrads et al 2006 priest 2004 provost et al 2006 efforts to mitigate saltwater intrusion have led to shifts in water conservation priorities decreases in groundwater pumping and river dredging studies conrads et al 2006 provost et al 2006 based on analytical models current pumping rates will lead to small increases in saltwater intrusion in the savannah river current pumping in the savannah watershed is a small portion of the overall flow in the river thus limiting the impact of pumping on saltwater intrusion by less than 1 100 m upstream although findings indicate that reported groundwater pumping rates have little direct impact on streamflows a consistent increase of 100 m saltwater intrusion could have an important effect on the coastal system these long term slow salinization processes increase the risk of detrimental effects of the fast salinization events such as storm surge tidal highs and drought for example during extended periods of drought the increased demands on irrigation may lead to higher pumping rates and more streamflow depletion during these droughts baseflow accounts for a higher proportion of the stream because the water level in the local flow system may be substantially decreased exfiltration comes from the intermediate and regional flow systems and deeper aquifers where pumping drawdowns are greater faye and mayer 1990 the model predicts that the lowest recorded streamflows in the savannah river 115 m3 s could allow saltwater intrusion extending up to 65 km inland while annually baseflow accounts for roughly 80 of total savannah river streamflow baseflow accounts for up to 90 of total streamflow during the summer and a reduction in baseflow during this time would have a greater impact on overall stream quantity and quality table s3 inversely if relative contribution of baseflow decreases due climatic shifts e g increase in stormwater from increased precipitation pumping induced depletion may become negligible while current pumping rates suggest minimal impact on the saltwater front in the savannah river it is likely to have a much greater effect under higher pumping regimes and in smaller watersheds if the city of savannah were to double their pumping the salt front could move 200 m inland which is equivalent to 0 8 streamflow depletion in some watersheds however irrigation wells can decrease streamflow by 10 to 25 burt et al 2002 killian et al 2019 for example in a watershed in north carolina close to the area studied here increased agricultural water needs have led to a 10 decrease in flow zipper et al 2019a in the savannah river the depletion potential fienen et al 2017 a term referring to the potential reduction in streamflow from pumping may even exceed 10 streamflow depletion during the irrigation season estimates of streamflow depletion in this study are much lower due to the yearly average approach for example reports of total irrigation groundwater withdrawals for lsr watershed counties in south carolina account for approximately 60 of annual usage from june to september monroe 2018 considering this seasonal distribution of irrigation pumping which concentrates most of the pumping during the growing season using the county specific mean as a constant underestimates the pumping rate for the summer months additional studies on the time lag between increased summer pumping and streamflow depletion are necessary to determine if these seasonal fluctuations lead to lasting saltwater intrusion impacts assuming other coastal streams experience similar or greater levels of streamflow depletion groundwater pumping may have induced undocumented stream salinization in the past and may increase risk of saltwater intrusion in the future near stream groundwater management will be essential to reduce saltwater intrusion impacts in regions with highly connected groundwater surface water resources the combined data analysis and analytical modeling approach demonstrated in this study may be applied to other coastal systems even those with limited data to better understand the management implications longitudinal field studies and numerical models may help unravel hydrologic feedbacks and site specific heterogeneity in the groundwater pumping and stream salinity relationship 5 2 ecological impacts of increased pumping with increased groundwater pumping and streamflow depletion salt will extend 100 s to 1000 s m upstream through the savannah national wildlife refuge fig 6 this protected region is the location of a large portion of the tidal freshwater marshes left in southeastern states the conditions for tidal freshwater and oligohaline marshes exist for only a few kilometers along the savannah river placing a great importance on the conservation of this reach lindgren 2010 salinity is the main designation between the marsh vegetation assemblages and distributions latham et al 1991 ecological shifts in response to a saltwater intrusion are expected to be extreme as salt tolerant vegetation communities e g scirpus validus become dominant in altered freshwater oligohaline marsh communities welch and kitchens 2007 already over half of the tidal freshwater marshes has been lost in the refuge due to upstream transgression of the salinity gradient griess 2011 the northern part of the refuge consists mostly of bottomland hardwoods and cypress gum swamp that may be periodically flooded dodd and barichivich 2017 garman and nielsen 1992 griess 2011 these regions contain small channels and an extensive number of woodland pools and creeks important for declining populations of amphibians dodd and barichivich 2017 forest dieback and saltwater intrusion could cause irreversible damage to this wildlife refuge ecosystem 5 3 model evaluation and limitations the analytical stream salinity model matches data for the savannah river well the model predicts the inland extent of saltwater intrusion at high slack water to be 56 km fig 6 which is consistent with reports of saltwater detected more than 40 km upstream with tidal water level signals reaching 64 km upstream bossart 2002 conrads et al 2006 pearlstine et al 1993 this calculation assumes the system has reached steady state and disregards any time delays between stream discharge and salinity although this would lead to an overprediction the limitations in the glover model may underpredict the impact of current pumping rates on the savannah when assessing the performance of analytical models it is important to consider the simplifying assumptions that they include for streamflow depletion the glover solution assumes a homogeneous isotropic subsurface in direct connection with a stream of constant flow glover and balmer 1954 the hydrogeological setting of the lower coastal plain does not meet these idealized conditions for example transmissivity is a large component of this model and the transmissivity of the surficial aquifer is highly variable provost et al 2006 however we expect that our estimates of streamflow depletion may be underestimated mostly due to nonlinearities in the glover solution our calculations assume that pumping rates are evenly distributed across each adjacent county based on that the sum of pumping rates is modeled as a single well located in the middle between the river and the boundary of the watershed for the adopted parameters table 1 the relationship between the stream to well distance and the depletion indeed approached linearity rapidly fig s5 which supports this simplified approach however for certain hydrologic regimes it is possible that this relationship is non linear blue curve in fig s5 and wells located closer to the river are highly impactful and distant ones are negligible this simplification is hard to resolve without further information on specific pumping rates and site specific hydrologic conditions zipper et al 2021 in cases where the impact of wells decays with distance faster than linearity modeling a single well located halfway between the river and the watershed boundary likely underestimates streamflow depletion due to greater development along the river a future analysis of unevenly distributed pumping rates may illustrate the importance of pumping distances for saltwater intrusion each parameter used in the analytical approach has uncertainty and the model parameters can coevolve for example streamflow qf will impact channel geometry e g depth mouth shape and tidal and hydrologic boundary conditions e g velocity this can lead to compounding effects of streamflow reduction and sea level rise the approach used here assumes no delay in reaching the maximum saltwater intrusion length at equilibrium however estuary systems react differently to increases versus decreases in freshwater discharge an increase in discharge propagates as a mass wave very quickly through the system however decreased discharge is gradual since fresh and saline water must mix in the channel the estimation for the maximum saltwater intrusion extent to pumping may never be reached if higher pulses of freshwater discharge i e during wet winter seasons prevent the system from reaching equilibrium 5 4 contribution of pumping vs other saltwater intrusion factors the relationship between coastal stream salinity and freshwater discharge is controlled by processes that take place simultaneously over a wide range of timescales ranging from short term storm events to long term sea level rise and precipitation changes the discussion on coastal stream salinization revolves mostly around sea level rise or channel alteration in this analysis these factors are important controls for example sea level is predicted to rise approximately 39 cm along the south carolina and georgia coastlines by the year 2100 church et al 2013 there is also indication that the tidal amplitude has exhibited long term change e g müller 2011 suggested a 2 increase per century but the impact on saltwater intrusion is not well understood calculations show that a 10 increase in tidal depth associated with sea level rise or a 10 increase in tidal amplitude may extend saltwater intrusion by another 2 km fig 7 meanwhile a slight shift in convergence width due to geomorphological alteration could push the freshwater saltwater interface significantly up to 3 km 6 conclusions we show for the first time the direct link between groundwater pumping and coastal stream salinity in the savannah river pumping induced streamflow depletion is currently limited and leads to little salinization compared to storm surge channel dredging and sea level rise increases in groundwater pumping however could increase this impact equaling or exceeding the impacts of sea level rise or geomorphic change and ultimately altering the distribution and health of the coastal ecosystems salinity is a critical factor in the ecological balance and this study allows for investigation of hypothetical development in the region the impacts of groundwater pumping on coastal stream salinity is an important management consideration for developed coastlines the combined glover and savenije models give an estimate for the position of the salt front consistent with observations glover and balmer 1954 savenije 2012 the initial testing of the validity of this method would have been difficult without the multiple stream gages extensive estuary surveying and tidal monitoring that are rarely available since there are few coastal watersheds like the savannah river with high quality longitudinal measurements of both stream and groundwater resources this analytical approach provides a means of estimating salinization due to groundwater stream interactions the parameters required for the models can be inferred from regional hydrogeology satellite imagery and basic tidal curves an extensive application of the approach would identify vulnerable coastal systems in need of careful groundwater management the complexities of groundwater surface water interactions are not well understood in regions experiencing increased water use land use change and climate change along coastlines management of these interconnected water resources is complicated by the risk of salinization by assessing the potential impact of groundwater pumping on near coast streamflow future studies concerned with stream salinization should include impacts of groundwater pumping in addition to discussions of sea level rise channel alteration and reduced precipitation reliable estimates of streamflow depletion are essential for effective water management in coastal plains 7 plain text summary the location of the freshwater saltwater interface in coastal streams is a balance between upstream river flows and downstream tidal forcing during periods of high streamflow seawater is prevented from intruding upstream and the freshwater saltwater interface is located relatively close to the ocean during periods of low streamflow high salinity water moves upstream shifting the saltwater freshwater interface coastal stream salinization may be caused by rising sea levels increasing storm intensity and prolonged drought but changes in groundwater use may also play a role we assess the impact of groundwater pumping on the salinity of savannah river ga stream measurements show that salinity reaches 51 58 km inland during high tide and low freshwater stream discharge conditions using two mathematical models one for stream saltwater intrusion and one for streamflow depletion from pumping we determine that reported groundwater pumping rates only decrease streamflow by 1 resulting in an increase in the saltwater intrusion length of 100 m however increased groundwater pumping could increase saltwater intrusion by 4 km this would have devastating impacts for freshwater ecosystems and coastal water resources overall we present a new analytical framework that can help determine vulnerable coastal systems and opportunities to better water management credit authorship contribution statement chelsea n peters conceptualization methodology

3841,in this work the classic problem in environmental hydraulics of solute dispersion in an open channel turbulent flow is analytically investigated by gill s generalized dispersion model to account for all the basic characteristics as dispersivity skewness and kurtosis of the mean concentration evolution a complete solution is presented for the whole process and three typical time scales are determined after a convection dominated initial stage a transient stage with essential transverse diffusion effect begins at a dimensionless time scale of t 0 1 and gives way to an asymptotic stage of normal distribution of mean concentration from t 1 slowly approaching to a final stage with relative uniformity in transverse concentration distribution at t 10 two dimensional concentration distribution shows that there is a high concentration zone near the free water surface at a small time due to the small velocity gradient indicating that it is not enough to characterize the dispersion process by the mean concentration especially for the transient stage the obtained analytical solutions of concentration distribution consist well with numerical simulation results by the random displacement method rdm keywords two dimensional concentration distribution gill s generalized dispersion model skewness and kurtosis random displacement method 1 introduction maintaining the surface water quality is of great significance for humans and ecological environment costanza et al 1989 with the economic development and urbanization it is a challenging task to protect water resources due to the increasing amount of sewage and industrial wastewater released into rivers or streams zhao et al 2019 suarez et al 2019 with so many sewage outlets in the urban section of the rivers the effect of tailwater discharge from the sewage treatment plants on river water environment has been one focus of research yang et al 2019 sickman et al 2007 schwarz and mcconnell 1993 modelling the physical transport process of pollutants in rivers and flows is essential for water quality prediction formulation of pollutant discharge standards and water resources planning berestov et al 1998 study on solute transport in flows originated from taylor s work on soluble matter dispersion in a small bore tube laminar flow taylor 1953 which revealed a fantastic dispersion model i e the cross sectional mean concentration satisfies a one dimensional advection diffusion equation at the large time with an equivalent diffusivity termed as the longitudinal dispersion coefficient elder 1959 extended taylor s analyses to solute dispersion in the turbulent flow in an open channel and revealed that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient can be evaluated as 5 93 u τ h u τ is the friction velocity and h is the water depth the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in natural streams and rivers then has been widely explored seo and baek kyong 2004 suarez et al 2019 zhang 2011 fischer 1973 wang et al 2017 the one dimensional advection dispersion eq 1d ade is the most commonly used type of model for water quality assessments suarez et al 2019 fischer 1967 however the 1d ade is applicable under conditions where an equilibrium becomes established between the velocity shear and transverse diffusion processes at the large time fischer et al 1979 that is to say when a contaminant cloud is released concentration distribution of pollutants can be only predicted at the far away downstream at the large time by the asymptotic dispersion model actually predicting the concentration distribution in the initial transient stage of transport is also significant for water quality management in order to avoid the problem that pollution loads far exceed the capacity of the receiving rivers to absorb pollution whitehead and young 1979 the high concentration zones near the release source can be very important for environmental impact assessment and water quality control therefore contaminant transport and dispersion process in flows at the initial and transient stages should be quantified for the establishment of more reliable criteria for regulating the discharge of contaminants into waterways to meet river water quality standards and prevent damage to water environmental capacity fischer et al 1979 zeng et al 2011 shao et al 2014 solute dispersion process at the preasymptotic stage of taylor dispersion has been substantially investigated by various analytical methods analytical solutions for the very short time periods after the solute release were derived lighthill 1966 stokes and barton 1990 by extending taylor s dispersion model gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 proposed a generalized dispersion model with high order terms later lee and gill 1980 explored the solute dispersion in turbulent channel flows by gills s series expansion truncated after the first two terms chatwin 1970 developed a long time asymptotic expansion solution of concentration and revealed that the cross sectional mean concentration approaches to a normal distribution at the transverse diffusion time scale of r 2 d r is the radius of the tube and d is the molecular diffusion coefficient for solute dispersion in a laminar tube flow and also applied the theory to a turbulent open channel flow where the second and third order moments of mean concentration and vertical mean concentration were discussed recently guo et al 2020 studied the concentration distribution for solute dispersion in a submerged vegetated flow by means of the asymptotic expansion technique wu and chen 2014 extended the homogenization technique to characterize the initial stage of the transport process and proposed that the cross sectional concentration distribution approaches to uniformity at the dimensionless time scale of 10 r 2 d for solute dispersion in a laminar tube flow pannone 2012 obtained the dispersion coefficient and skewness through the concentration moments for solute dispersion in a turbulent wide channel flow taghizadeh et al 2020 used the course grain averaging technique to develop an upscaled equation that contains a source term accounting for the early time solute dynamics nonetheless the above mentioned analytical studies focused on the dispersion process either at the very short time period from the release of solute or at the moderate time scale for example lighthill 1966 s solution is applicable at the time as non dimensionlized by the characteristic diffusion time t 0 1 due to neglect of the wall effect chatwin s long time asymptotic expansion is qualitatively suitable at t 0 2 chatwin 1970 the homogenization technique is also largely reasonable for the large time of t 0 2 wu and chen 2014 the gap for an essential transient stage bewteen the convection dominated early stage of t 0 1 and the asymptotic stage beginning at t 1 remains to be abridged for solute dispersion in a turbulent open channel flow evolution of the concentration distribution of solute cloud from the initial transient stage of transport need to be tackled moreover the above analytical studies on solute dispersion in the open channel turbulent flows without vegetation focused on the longitudinal dispersion coefficient or the longitudinal distribution of the transverse mean concentration the spatial concentration distribution has not been explored and characterized actually the cross sectional concentration distribution can show intensive variation and be far from its mean value especially at the initial stage of transport as has been verified for cases with laminar open channel flows wang and chen 2016 wu and chen 2014 zeng et al 2015 li et al 2018 and wetland flows jiang and chen 2019 wang and huai 2018 wang and chen 2017 moreover our recent research on solute dispersion in a submerged vegetated flow showed that the vertical concentration distribution is intensively non uniform at the small time guo et al 2020 while the detailed concentration distribution in some particular submerged vegetated flow has been illustrated that in the most typical flow model of a open channel turbulent flow has not been characterized for the environmental risk assessment the location where the concentration is beyond the given standard level is sensitive to the spatial concentration distribution instead of the mean concentration distribution therefore it is of basic interest to explore the spatial concentration distribution for solute dispersion in the open channel turbulent flow in addition as a basic method the generalized dispersion model proposed by gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 which in principle features simultaneous description of both the mean and spatial concentration distributions of solute dispersion process has been widely applied to explore solute dispersion in various flows such as electrokinetic flow sadeghi et al 2020 unsteady non newtonian flow sebastian and nagarani 2018 hazra et al 1997 casson fluid flow rana and murthy 2016 nagarani et al 2008 small blood vessels rana and murthy 2017 and tube flow with a retentive and absorptive wall ng and rudraiah 2008 however the above studies all adopted the second order dispersion model to simulate the solute dispersion process with the higher order terms not touched due to the difficulty in solving the high order generalized dispersion model the second order generalized dispersion model could not reflect the asymmetry of the concentration distribution which is suitable only at the large time yu 1979 yu 1981 yu and chang 1991 actually the second order generalized dispersion model with time dependent dispersivity is a little different from taylor s classic dispersion model with an asymptotic steady dispersivity notice that at the large time the two dispersion models are the same when the longitudinal dispersion coefficient approaches to its steady value recently jiang and chen 2018 derived the solutions for the generalized dispersion model up to the fourth order for the first time to account for the other basic process properties of skewness and kurtosis and clarified the physical significances of the high order terms for solute dispersion in a laminar tube flow this provides a powerful approach for the study of solute dispersion in open channel turbulent flows we can use the high order generalized dispersion model to analyze the solute dispersion process in the turbulent channel flow at the initial transient stage of transport both the asymptotic expansion technique chatwin 1970 as adopted in the previous work guo et al 2020 and the high order generalized dispersion model contain the effects of skewness and kurtosis of concentration distribution however their manipulation of truncated series is different for the fourth order generalized dispersion model the fifth and higher order cumulants of concentration are zero while it is not true for chatwin s asymptotic expansion jiang and chen 2018 the strength of gill s generalized dispersion model is that the expansion coefficient of each term in the generalized dispersion model corresponds to the specific characteristic quantity from zeroth order to fourth order corresponding to the exchange coefficient centroid velocity longitudinal dispersion coefficient skewness and kurtosis respectively which can conveniently analyze the effect of each basic physical properties notice that the time scale for the effectiveness of the fourth order generalized dispersion model is undetermined therefore the present work aims to analytically investigate the classic problem of solute transport in an open channel turbulent flow by gill s generalized dispersion model with the high order terms a comprehensive description of both the vertical mean and spatial concentration distribution in open channel turbulent flow is to be conducted in consideration of the effects of high order terms the second to fourth order dispersion models are directly resolved the specific objectives of this study are i to illustrate the temporal evolution of the basic characteristic quantities of dispersion coefficient skewness and kurtosis ii to present the evolution of the vertical mean concentration distribution and compare the results derived from the second to fourth order dispersion models and to determine the time scale for the usability of the fourth order generalized dispersion model and discuss the concentration distribution at the very small time iii to depict and characterize the spatial concentration distribution of the solute dispersion process additionally to validate the reliability of the above analytical results comparisons of concentration distribution between the analytical solutions and numerical simulation results by the random displacement method are to be made the results and findings can contribute original knowledge to understanding the basic physical mechanism behind the turbulent dispersion phenomenon and providing concerned criteria of practical water resource applications 2 formulation consider solute transport in a fully developed turbulent flow in an open channel as shown in fig 1 a right handed cartesian coordinate system ox z is set with x standing for the longitudinal coordinate z the vertical coordinate origin o at the channel bed wall and h the water depth the advection diffusion equation for concentration is 1 c t u z c x z d z z c z where c x z t is the reynolds s mean concentration kgm 3 t is time s u z is the reynolds s mean velocity of the turbulent flow ms 1 and d z z is the eddy diffusivity in the vertical direction m 2 s 1 notice that the turbulent diffusion in the longitudinal direction is neglected comparing with the shear dispersion elder 1959 rubol et al 2016 ngo cong et al 2015 the velocity profile of the turbulent channel flow as obtained through solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans with the prandtl mixing length theory is given by the logarithmic law as elder 1959 fischer et al 1979 chatwin 1970 barton 1983 2 u z u u τ k 1 ln z h where u is the vertical mean velocity u τ is the friction velocity k is the von kármán s constant approximately equal to 0 41 elder 1959 though the above velocity profile neglects the viscous sublayer it is widely used by engineers chatwin 1970 as commonly assumed the turbulent mixing can be described by an eddy diffusivity and the reynolds s analogy holds elder 1959 fischer et al 1979 chatwin 1970 barton 1983 then the turbulent diffusion coefficient is obtained as 3 d z z kh u τ z h 1 z h for solute mass q kgm 1 uniformly released across the vertical section the initial condition is set as 4 c x z t t 0 q δ x h where δ x is the dirac delta function the non penetration conditions at the free water surface and channel bed are 5 d z c x z t z z h d z c x z t z z 0 0 since q is finite the upstream and downstream conditions are 6 c x z t x 0 we define the mean of a quantity over cross section as e g 7 u 1 h 0 h u z d z where u is the vertical mean velocity moreover the vertical mean turbulent diffusivity is 8 d z 1 h 0 h d z z d z kh u τ 6 introduce the following dimensionless parameters 9 x x u t peh z z h t d z h 2 t d z d z d z 6 z 1 z u u u u τ k 1 ln z pe u τ h k d z 6 k 2 c peh 2 q c where x is the longitudinal coordinate moving with the vertical mean

we adopt gill s generalized dispersion model as firstly proposed by gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 to solve the advection diffusion equation for solute dispersion in laminar pipe flows and then extended to laminar pipe flows with wall absorption sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 jiang and chen 2018 different from the previous studies gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 focused on the low order solutions of concentration the present work adopts the high order dispersion model to account for the effects of high order terms all the basic characteristic quantities of dispersivity skewness and kurtosis of the mean concentration distribution are to be quantified 3 1 gill s generalized dispersion model the solution of the above governing equations can be formulated as a series expansion gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 of 14 c n 0 f n z t n c x n where f n z t are the time dependent cross sectional distribution functions and c is the vertical mean concentration by vertically averaging eq 14 we obtain 15 f 0 1 16 f n 0 n 1 2 3 the boundary and initial conditions give 17 d z f n z t z z 1 d z f n z t z z 0 0 n 0 1 2 18 f 0 z t t 0 1 f n z t t 0 0 n 1 2 3 by vertically averaging eq 10 and introducing eq 14 gill s well known generalized dispersion equation can be obtained as 19 c t n 0 k n t n c x n where the dispersion coefficients k n t are 20 k n t uf n 1 n 0 1 2 with f 1 0 k n n 0 1 2 3 4 have specific physical significance which will be illustrated in section 3 4 moreover substituting eq 14 into eq 10 and with the help of eq 19 we have 21 f n t z d z f n z uf n 1 m 0 n k m f n m n 0 1 2 it is prompt to get k 0 0 and f 0 1 to determine the dispersion coefficients k n f n n 1 2 3 of the high order terms we should solve eqs 20 21 alternately 3 2 solutions of the coefficients f n and k n with f 0 1 we obtain 22 k 1 u 0 i e the mass centroid of the solute cloud travels with the mean velocity of the flow then we can solve the following equation for f 1 from eq 21 23 f 1 t z d z f 1 z u we adopt the method of separation of variables to solve eq 23 under the boundary and initial conditions of eqs 17 18 the corresponding eigenvalue problem which belongs to the sturm liouville problems is given as 24 d d z 6 z 1 z d ψ d z λ 2 ψ 25 d z d ψ z d z z 1 d z d ψ z d z z 0 0 in view of d z 6 z 1 z 0 at z 0 1 eq 25 is equivalent to barton 1983 26 ψ d ψ d z finite at z 0 1 let z 1 2 η 1 ψ η ψ z then the eqs 24 26 can be transformed into 27 d d η 1 η 2 d ψ d η λ 2 6 ψ 0 28 ψ η 1 finite which corresponds to the legendre equation the general solutions are ψ η c 1 p v η c 2 q v η where 6 v v 1 λ 2 c 1 and c 2 are two constants considering the boundary conditions eq 28 ψ η should be the legendre polynomial p n η barton 1983 thus the eigenfunctions are ψ n z p n 2 z 1 and corresponding eigenvalues λ n 2 6 n n 1 n 0 1 2 then the solution of f 1 z t can be represented by the expansion 29 f 1 z t m 0 a 1 m t ψ m z substituting the above solution into eq 23 and considering eq 24 then multiplying both sides by the eigenfunction ψ n z and integrating along the vertical direction yields an ordinary differential equation about a 1 m t which can be easily solved the solution of f 1 can be obtained as 30 f 1 z t m 1 e λ m 2 t 0 t 2 m 1 e λ m 2 t 0 1 u ψ m d z d t ψ m z with the solution of f 1 we can directly obtain k 2 by eq 20 we remark that the eigenfunctions of f n n 2 3 are the same as f 1 and the solution processes of f n n 1 2 are similar namely we can then obtain the solutions of f 2 k 3 f 3 k 4 f 4 etc successively 3 3 solutions of gill s generalized dispersion model with the solutions of k n we can obtain the vertical mean concentration c by solving gill s generalized dispersion model corresponding to eq 19 through the fourier transform for the vertical mean concentration distribution we define the fourier transform of c as 31 c ξ t c e i ξ x d x thus the fourier transform of eq 19 with regard to k 0 0 is 32 c t n 1 k n t i ξ n c and the initial condition is 33 c ξ 0 c x 0 e i ξ x d x 1 then the solution of c is 34 c ξ t exp n 1 ω n t i ξ n where 35 ω n t 0 t k n t d t n 1 2 3 finally through the inverse fourier transform defined as eq 36 we obtain the solution of c 36 c 1 2 π c ξ t e i ξ x d ξ notice that although eq 19 for gill s generalized dispersion model including a sum of an infinite series the higher order coefficients therein are successively decreased by orders of magnitude for example k 2 is more than two orders of magnitude greater than k 3 gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 just considered the first second order n 2 terms nonetheless to reflect the transitional stage of dispersion the higher order dispersion model is required to account for the skewness and kurtosis of vertical mean concentration distribution related to k 3 k 4 jiang and chen 2018 hence in the present work the first fourth order generalized dispersion model is adopted to fully reflect all the basic properties for comparison with the different order models the solutions of c from second order to fourth order dispersion models are presented based on eq 34 c ξ t from the second order to fourth order dispersion models are respectively 37 c 2 ξ t exp ω 1 t i ξ ω 2 t ξ 2 38 c 3 ξ t exp ω 1 t i ξ ω 2 t ξ 2 ω 3 t i ξ 3 39 c 4 ξ t exp ω 1 t i ξ ω 2 t ξ 2 ω 3 t i ξ 3 ω 4 t ξ 4 through the inverse fourier transform defined in eq 36 it is convenient to obtain the solution c of the second order dispersion model as 40 c 2 x t 1 4 π ω 2 t exp x ω 1 t 2 4 ω 2 t which is a gaussian distribution through the inverse fourier transform of eq 38 the solution of the third order dispersion model is 41 c 3 x t 1 3 ω 3 3 exp ω 2 3 ω 3 x ω 1 ω 2 3 ω 3 2 ω 2 3 27 ω 3 2 ai x ω 1 ω 2 2 3 ω 3 3 ω 3 3 where ai is the airy function of the first kind the solution of the fourth order dispersion model is 42 c 4 x t c 3 x t f ξ 1 exp ω 4 t ξ 4 where the notation denotes the convolution operation f ξ 1 means the inverse fourier transform detailed solution procedures of c 3 x t and c 4 x t can refer to the work of jiang and chen 2018 with the solutions of the mean concentration distribution c and f n we can obtain the two dimensional concentration distribution through eq 14 3 4 basic characteristic quantities there are several basic quantities that characterize the solute dispersion process in flows i e the overall dispersivity skewness and kurtosis of the transverse mean concentration distribution which have been intensively discussed for the cases of laminar flows through concentration moments or cumulants of concentration distribution jiang et al 2017 wang and chen 2017 the n th order cross sectional mean concentration moment is defined as aris 1956 43 m n t x n c x t d x the n th order central moment ν n can be expressed in terms of the moments m n t which are given in a cumulants κ n can be represented by the central moments and the first few expressions are guo et al 2020 44 κ 1 x g κ 2 ν 2 κ 3 ν 3 κ 4 ν 4 3 ν 2 2 actually the coefficients k n in gill s generalized dispersion model as embodied in eq 19 are closely related to the concentration moments or cumulants of concentration distribution significantly the relationship between k n and cumulants of mean concentration distribution κ n is 45 k n t 1 n n d κ n t d t n 1 2 3 as clearly clarified in jiang and chen 2018 therefore we obtain these basic quantities defined by the cumulants or moments of concentration distribution through k n for example the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d t is 46 d t 1 2 d κ 2 d t k 2 namely the coefficient k 2 is corresponding to the longitudinal dispersivity to measure the deviation from a gaussian distribution in the initial stage of transport skewness γ 1 and kurtosis γ 2 can be obtained respectively by 47 γ 1 κ 3 κ 2 3 2 3 2 0 t k 3 τ d τ 0 t k 2 τ d τ 3 2 and 48 γ 2 κ 4 κ 2 2 6 0 t k 4 τ d τ 0 t k 2 τ d τ 2 that is the coefficients k 3 and k 4 are respectively corresponding to the skewness and kurtosis of the concentration distribution overall based on the gill s generalized dispersion model the spatial concentration distribution and transverse mean concentration distribution the basic characteristic quantities of longitudinal dispersion coefficient skewness and kurtosis can be all determined which can fully describe the dispersion phenomenon related to that solute releases into the open channel turbulent flow 4 results and discussion this section will show the analytical results of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient skewness and kurtosis of mean concentration distribution vertical mean concentration distribution obtained based on different order generalized dispersion model will be compared to better understand solute dispersion process in turbulent channel flow two dimensional concentration distribution will be illustrated moreover analytical solutions of concentration distribution will be compared with the numerical simulation results by the random displacement method to validate the reliability of our analytical results three typical time scales in the dispersion process will be determined 4 1 dispersivity skewness and kurtosis the longitudinal dispersion coefficient is an important parameter that quantifies the dispersion intensity of solute cloud which is constant at a large time taylor 1953 taylor 1954 aris 1956 for solute dispersion in the open channel turbulent flow the asymptotic value of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient can be estimated by d 1 5 86 h u τ elder 1959 nonetheless the dispersion coefficient in the transitional stage has not been discussed in elder s work evolution of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient can be quantified through eq 46 the dispersion coefficient increases with time and becomes constant at a large time as illustrated in fig 2 the asymptotic steady value of the dimensionless dispersion coefficient is d t 0 067 as d t d z pe 2 d t the dimensional dispersion coefficient is obtained as d t 5 862 h u τ same as the result in elder 1959 notice that the time when the dispersion coefficient reaches its asymptotic stable value is about 0 3 for solute dispersion in the turbulent open channel flow previous works show that the time to arrive the stable value is about 0 4 for solute dispersion in the submerged vegetated flow guo et al 2020 and is about 0 5 for solute dispersion in laminar tube flow gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 and in laminar open channel flow guo et al 2018 due to the effect of turbulent diffusion stronger than the molecular diffusion the asymptotic state of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient arrives more quickly for solute dispersion in the turbulent flow it is well known that the cross sectional mean concentration distribution approaches a gaussian distribution at the large time jiang and chen 2019 chatwin 1970 the degree of deviation from the normal distribution at the transitional stage can be quantified by the skewness and kurtosis defined by the eqs 47 48 respectively the skewness decreases with time and tends to zero at a large time the value of skewness is negative which means that the mean concentration distribution is negatively skewed as depicted in fig 3 a the velocity profile of the turbulent open channel flow is logarithmic the velocity gradient in the upper layer of the flow is smaller therefore the downstream solute cloud is more concentrated the kurtosis of mean concentration distribution decreases with time and approaches zero quickly as seen in fig 3 b compared with solute dispersion in wetland flow jiang et al 2017 and laminar open channel flow wang and chen 2016 the turbulent diffusion effect stronger than the molecular diffusion effect leads to the fast decay of high order term impacts moreover different from the kurtosis in the laminar open channel flow which is negative wang and chen 2016 the kurtosis is positive in the turbulent open channel flow due to the different velocity profile the velocity gradient of the turbulent open channel flow in the upper layer is smaller than that of the laminar channel flow which is inverse near the bed layer the kurtosis in the turbulent open channel flow is similar with that in the wetland flow with denser vegetation referring to fig 4 in jiang et al 2017 actually the velocity profile in the turbulent open channel flow is analogous to that in the wetland flow with large damping factor as shown in fig 2 in the previous paper jiang et al 2017 4 2 vertical mean concentration distribution in terms of the vertical mean concentration distribution the coefficients k n in the generalized dispersion model are illustrated in fig 4 k 0 which means the exchange coefficient always equals zero due to mass conservation of the solute in flow convection coefficient k 1 is also constant and equal to zero which indicates that the centroid velocity of the solute cloud always moves at the speed of the vertical mean velocity the dispersion coefficient k 2 and higher order coefficients increase with time and then reach their steady values at a dimensionless time t 0 3 notice that k 2 is actually the longitudinal dispersion coefficient and equals to d t as indicated in the above section the values of k 3 and especially k 4 are much smaller than the value of k 2 similar to the findings in previous study of solute dispersion in laminar tube flow jiang and chen 2018 the high order coefficients k 3 and k 4 reflect the non gaussian effects related to the skewness and kurtosis of the vertical mean concentration distribution respectively it can conclude that the skewness and kurtosis of the vertical mean concentration distribution are non negligible in the initial stage of transport therefore to account for the deviation from the normal distribution the high order dispersion model is required jiang and chen 2018 a comparison of the vertical mean concentration distribution based on the different order generalized dispersion models is presented in fig 5 the vertical mean concentration distribution obtained from the second order dispersion model c 2 is a gaussian distribution the third order dispersion model includes the skewness of vertical mean concentration distribution while the fourth order dispersion model reflects both the skewness and kurtosis of mean concentration distribution the effect of high order terms third and fourth order in gill s generalized dispersion model can not be ignored at the small time as shown in fig 5 a b c d the third order dispersion model illustrates that the vertical mean concentration distribution is asymmetric and the maximum concentration appears downstream that is the concentration distribution is negative skewness the fourth order dispersion model reflects the asymmetry and kurtosis of the concentration distribution the concentration distribution is leptokurtic namely its kurtosis is positive c 3 and c 4 are distinct at small times and they are identical at the time t 0 3 as depicted in the fig 3 b kurtosis is almost vanished at time t 0 3 therefore at the large time t 0 3 the third order dispersion model is appropriate to characterize the vertical mean concentration distribution additionally as illustrated in fig 5 f g the differences between the second order dispersion model and third order dispersion model are very small indicating that the effect of high order terms become negligible at the dimensionless time scale t 1 the classical taylor s dispersion model is also included in fig 5 we can know that taylor s dispersion model overestimates the dispersion and can t reflect the asymmetry and kurtosis of concentration distribution at the small time at the large time t 2 taylor s dispersion model is applicative in other words the classical taylor s dispersion model one dimensional advection diffusion model for the vertical mean concentration is applicative at the time scale t 1 notice that the fourth order gill s generalized dispersion model is inappropriate at the very small time to determine the timescale for the application of the fourth order generalized dispersion model comparison of the vertical mean concentration distribution between analytical solutions based on the fourth order generalized dispersion model and the numerical simulation results by the random displacement method details in b is presented in fig 6 the fourth order generalized dispersion model underestimates the maximum concentration at the small time t 0 1 when t 0 3 the fourth order generalized dispersion is consistent well with the numerical simulation result hence the time scale for the application of the fourth order generalized dispersion model is t 0 1 from a physical perspective advection dominates the dispersion process at the small time and the vertical turbulent diffusion effect can be neglected gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 the time it takes for solute to move h under the effects of vertical turbulent diffusion and longitudinal advection is h 2 d z and h u respectively the ratio of time scale is h 2 d z h u u h d z pe when time t 0 1 the vertical moving distance under the effect of vertical turbulent diffusion is also less 0 1 by comparing with the water depth 1 the vertical moving distance by turbulent diffusion is negligible the vertical mean concentration distribution under the effect of advection is chatwin 1970 49 c x t 1 t exp x t 1 x t the concentration profile is initially pulled by the advection and the vertical mean concentration distribution by pure advection is illustrated in fig 6 it illustrates that the maximum concentration occurs downstream moreover compared with the numerical simulation results we can know that the mean concentration obtained by the pure advection agrees well with the numerical simulation results at the small time t 0 01 as time increases the effect of diffusion becomes strong at time t 0 1 the generalized dispersion begins that is the generalized dispersion model is applicable actually in taylor 1953 s pioneering dispersion work taylor estimated that the dispersion begins at t r 2 3 8 2 d where r is radius of the tube and d is molecular diffusion coefficient the asymmetry of the concentration distribution resulted from the advection graduates away the concentration distribution is gradually showing normal distribution 4 3 two dimensional concentration distribution above sections discuss the vertical mean concentration distribution actually in the initial stage of transport the vertical concentration difference is large wu and chen 2014 as presented in fig 7 there is a high concentration zone near the free water surface and the concentration distribution is pulled like the velocity profile at the small time t 0 1 as the velocity gradient is smaller near the free water surface the solute cloud near the water surface zone is more concentrated under the effect of advection and vertical turbulent diffusion the concentration is decreased quickly as illustrated in fig 7 f comparing with the concentration distribution of solute transport in a laminar open channel flow wang and chen 2016 we can find that the solute cloud disperses more quickly in the turbulent open channel flow the longitudinal concentration distribution at different heights is presented in fig 8 for comparison the vertical mean concentration distribution is also included as can be seen the vertical mean concentration is close to the concentration at the height of z 0 5 the concentration at the free water surface is higher than those at the bed and at the middle height in the initial stage of transport as shown in fig 8 a b at the large time the non uniformity of vertical concentration distribution is decreased greatly under the effect of vertical turbulent diffusion hence the longitudinal concentration distributions at different heights are almost identical which are all close to the vertical mean concentration distribution as seen in fig 8 d notice that the positions of the peak concentration at different heights are located in different cross sections the peak concentration is upstream in the bed while it is downstream in the free water surface furthermore the vertical concentration distribution at different locations is shown in fig 9 the vertical concentration distribution at the origin tends to be uniform the upstream vertical concentration is higher near the bed and lower at the water surface while the downstream vertical concentration is higher at the water surface and lower near the bed notice that a moving coordinate system at the vertical mean velocity is adopted in the present paper hence solute cloud near the water surface is convected to the downstream while that near the bed is convected to the upstream under the effect of vertical turbulent diffusion the vertical concentration variation decreases with time however the vertical concentration distribution is still non uniform even at a large time as illustrated in fig 9 d to quantify the evolution of the vertical concentration difference an indicator named the vertical concentration variation rate is defined as wu and chen 2014 50 c va x t max c x z t x t min c x z t x t c x z t x z 0 100 where the numerator is the maximum concentration difference across a given vertical plane and the denominator is a reference concentration wu and chen 2014 the longitudinal distribution of the vertical concentration variation rate is a bimodal distribution as shown in fig 10 the downstream maxima of the vertical concentration variation rate is larger than the upstream maxima due to the smaller velocity gradient near the water surface at the small time with the time increasing the vertical concentration variation rate is greatly reduced under the effect of vertical turbulent diffusion and the asymmetry becomes nearly unnoticeable it can be seen that the maximum variation rate is about 55 at the time t 1 about 35 at the time t 2 and about 20 at the time t 5 at the time t 10 the maximum variation rate remains over 10 and even for very long times after solute release at the time t 100 the maximum variation rate still keeps about 5 indicating that the decrease of the vertical concentration difference is a large time scale process which can be characterized by the dimensionless time scale as t 10 wu and chen 2014 for clarity the typical dimensionless time scales in the dispersion process are depicted in fig 11 namely the generalized dispersion begins at the time scale of t 0 1 before that the advection dominates the transport process the vertical mean concentration distribution tends to be gaussian at the time scale of t 1 and the vertical concentration difference can be neglected at the time scale of t 10 moreover at the time period of 0 1 t 0 3 the effects of dispersivity skewness and kurtosis all work at the time period of 0 3 t 2 the effects of dispersivity and skewness play a major role at the time period of t 2 it is sufficient to consider only the influence of dispersivity to validate the reliability of the above analytical results comparisons of concentration distribution between the analytical solutions based on gill s generalized dispersion model and numerical simulation results by the random displacement method are illustrated in b 5 summary and conclusions in the present work the classic problem in environmental hydraulics of solute dispersion in an open channel turbulent flow is analytically investigated by gill s generalized dispersion model up to the fourth order to account for all the basic properties as dispersivity skewness and kurtosis of the concentration distribution the longitudinal dispersion coefficient increases over time and asymptotically approaches its steady value well known from previous studies both the skewness and kurtosis of the vertical mean concentration distribution are non negligible in the initial stage of transport as time increases kurtosis is vanished quickly comparison of the vertical mean concentration distribution based on the different order generalized dispersion models reveals that the third order generalized dispersion model is appropriate at the dimensionless time t 0 3 when the effect of fourth order term becomes negligible at the time scale of t 1 effects of skewness and kurtosis could be neglected and the typical one dimensional dispersion model is applicable at the very small time advection dominates the dispersion process and the fourth order generalized dispersion model is suitable at t 0 1 when the effect of the vertical turbulent diffusion becomes essential that is the generalized dispersion begins at the time scale t 0 1 in terms of the vertical concentration distribution there is a high concentration zone near the free water surface at the small time due to the small velocity gradient the vertical mean concentration is close to the longitudinal concentration at the middle height of the flow while it is lower than the concentration at the water surface especially at the small time therefore the vertical concentration distribution instead of the vertical mean concentration should be adopted in some environmental and engineering applications the downstream vertical concentration is higher near the water surface and lower at the channel bed while the upstream vertical concentration is higher at the bed and lower near the water surface the vertical concentration variation rate decreases with time and can be characterized by a dimensionless time scale as t 10 the analytical results of concentration distribution consist well with the numerical simulation results by the random displacement method the above obtained results can provide the basic knowledge for related applications credit authorship contribution statement jinlan guo

3841,in this work the classic problem in environmental hydraulics of solute dispersion in an open channel turbulent flow is analytically investigated by gill s generalized dispersion model to account for all the basic characteristics as dispersivity skewness and kurtosis of the mean concentration evolution a complete solution is presented for the whole process and three typical time scales are determined after a convection dominated initial stage a transient stage with essential transverse diffusion effect begins at a dimensionless time scale of t 0 1 and gives way to an asymptotic stage of normal distribution of mean concentration from t 1 slowly approaching to a final stage with relative uniformity in transverse concentration distribution at t 10 two dimensional concentration distribution shows that there is a high concentration zone near the free water surface at a small time due to the small velocity gradient indicating that it is not enough to characterize the dispersion process by the mean concentration especially for the transient stage the obtained analytical solutions of concentration distribution consist well with numerical simulation results by the random displacement method rdm keywords two dimensional concentration distribution gill s generalized dispersion model skewness and kurtosis random displacement method 1 introduction maintaining the surface water quality is of great significance for humans and ecological environment costanza et al 1989 with the economic development and urbanization it is a challenging task to protect water resources due to the increasing amount of sewage and industrial wastewater released into rivers or streams zhao et al 2019 suarez et al 2019 with so many sewage outlets in the urban section of the rivers the effect of tailwater discharge from the sewage treatment plants on river water environment has been one focus of research yang et al 2019 sickman et al 2007 schwarz and mcconnell 1993 modelling the physical transport process of pollutants in rivers and flows is essential for water quality prediction formulation of pollutant discharge standards and water resources planning berestov et al 1998 study on solute transport in flows originated from taylor s work on soluble matter dispersion in a small bore tube laminar flow taylor 1953 which revealed a fantastic dispersion model i e the cross sectional mean concentration satisfies a one dimensional advection diffusion equation at the large time with an equivalent diffusivity termed as the longitudinal dispersion coefficient elder 1959 extended taylor s analyses to solute dispersion in the turbulent flow in an open channel and revealed that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient can be evaluated as 5 93 u τ h u τ is the friction velocity and h is the water depth the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in natural streams and rivers then has been widely explored seo and baek kyong 2004 suarez et al 2019 zhang 2011 fischer 1973 wang et al 2017 the one dimensional advection dispersion eq 1d ade is the most commonly used type of model for water quality assessments suarez et al 2019 fischer 1967 however the 1d ade is applicable under conditions where an equilibrium becomes established between the velocity shear and transverse diffusion processes at the large time fischer et al 1979 that is to say when a contaminant cloud is released concentration distribution of pollutants can be only predicted at the far away downstream at the large time by the asymptotic dispersion model actually predicting the concentration distribution in the initial transient stage of transport is also significant for water quality management in order to avoid the problem that pollution loads far exceed the capacity of the receiving rivers to absorb pollution whitehead and young 1979 the high concentration zones near the release source can be very important for environmental impact assessment and water quality control therefore contaminant transport and dispersion process in flows at the initial and transient stages should be quantified for the establishment of more reliable criteria for regulating the discharge of contaminants into waterways to meet river water quality standards and prevent damage to water environmental capacity fischer et al 1979 zeng et al 2011 shao et al 2014 solute dispersion process at the preasymptotic stage of taylor dispersion has been substantially investigated by various analytical methods analytical solutions for the very short time periods after the solute release were derived lighthill 1966 stokes and barton 1990 by extending taylor s dispersion model gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 proposed a generalized dispersion model with high order terms later lee and gill 1980 explored the solute dispersion in turbulent channel flows by gills s series expansion truncated after the first two terms chatwin 1970 developed a long time asymptotic expansion solution of concentration and revealed that the cross sectional mean concentration approaches to a normal distribution at the transverse diffusion time scale of r 2 d r is the radius of the tube and d is the molecular diffusion coefficient for solute dispersion in a laminar tube flow and also applied the theory to a turbulent open channel flow where the second and third order moments of mean concentration and vertical mean concentration were discussed recently guo et al 2020 studied the concentration distribution for solute dispersion in a submerged vegetated flow by means of the asymptotic expansion technique wu and chen 2014 extended the homogenization technique to characterize the initial stage of the transport process and proposed that the cross sectional concentration distribution approaches to uniformity at the dimensionless time scale of 10 r 2 d for solute dispersion in a laminar tube flow pannone 2012 obtained the dispersion coefficient and skewness through the concentration moments for solute dispersion in a turbulent wide channel flow taghizadeh et al 2020 used the course grain averaging technique to develop an upscaled equation that contains a source term accounting for the early time solute dynamics nonetheless the above mentioned analytical studies focused on the dispersion process either at the very short time period from the release of solute or at the moderate time scale for example lighthill 1966 s solution is applicable at the time as non dimensionlized by the characteristic diffusion time t 0 1 due to neglect of the wall effect chatwin s long time asymptotic expansion is qualitatively suitable at t 0 2 chatwin 1970 the homogenization technique is also largely reasonable for the large time of t 0 2 wu and chen 2014 the gap for an essential transient stage bewteen the convection dominated early stage of t 0 1 and the asymptotic stage beginning at t 1 remains to be abridged for solute dispersion in a turbulent open channel flow evolution of the concentration distribution of solute cloud from the initial transient stage of transport need to be tackled moreover the above analytical studies on solute dispersion in the open channel turbulent flows without vegetation focused on the longitudinal dispersion coefficient or the longitudinal distribution of the transverse mean concentration the spatial concentration distribution has not been explored and characterized actually the cross sectional concentration distribution can show intensive variation and be far from its mean value especially at the initial stage of transport as has been verified for cases with laminar open channel flows wang and chen 2016 wu and chen 2014 zeng et al 2015 li et al 2018 and wetland flows jiang and chen 2019 wang and huai 2018 wang and chen 2017 moreover our recent research on solute dispersion in a submerged vegetated flow showed that the vertical concentration distribution is intensively non uniform at the small time guo et al 2020 while the detailed concentration distribution in some particular submerged vegetated flow has been illustrated that in the most typical flow model of a open channel turbulent flow has not been characterized for the environmental risk assessment the location where the concentration is beyond the given standard level is sensitive to the spatial concentration distribution instead of the mean concentration distribution therefore it is of basic interest to explore the spatial concentration distribution for solute dispersion in the open channel turbulent flow in addition as a basic method the generalized dispersion model proposed by gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 which in principle features simultaneous description of both the mean and spatial concentration distributions of solute dispersion process has been widely applied to explore solute dispersion in various flows such as electrokinetic flow sadeghi et al 2020 unsteady non newtonian flow sebastian and nagarani 2018 hazra et al 1997 casson fluid flow rana and murthy 2016 nagarani et al 2008 small blood vessels rana and murthy 2017 and tube flow with a retentive and absorptive wall ng and rudraiah 2008 however the above studies all adopted the second order dispersion model to simulate the solute dispersion process with the higher order terms not touched due to the difficulty in solving the high order generalized dispersion model the second order generalized dispersion model could not reflect the asymmetry of the concentration distribution which is suitable only at the large time yu 1979 yu 1981 yu and chang 1991 actually the second order generalized dispersion model with time dependent dispersivity is a little different from taylor s classic dispersion model with an asymptotic steady dispersivity notice that at the large time the two dispersion models are the same when the longitudinal dispersion coefficient approaches to its steady value recently jiang and chen 2018 derived the solutions for the generalized dispersion model up to the fourth order for the first time to account for the other basic process properties of skewness and kurtosis and clarified the physical significances of the high order terms for solute dispersion in a laminar tube flow this provides a powerful approach for the study of solute dispersion in open channel turbulent flows we can use the high order generalized dispersion model to analyze the solute dispersion process in the turbulent channel flow at the initial transient stage of transport both the asymptotic expansion technique chatwin 1970 as adopted in the previous work guo et al 2020 and the high order generalized dispersion model contain the effects of skewness and kurtosis of concentration distribution however their manipulation of truncated series is different for the fourth order generalized dispersion model the fifth and higher order cumulants of concentration are zero while it is not true for chatwin s asymptotic expansion jiang and chen 2018 the strength of gill s generalized dispersion model is that the expansion coefficient of each term in the generalized dispersion model corresponds to the specific characteristic quantity from zeroth order to fourth order corresponding to the exchange coefficient centroid velocity longitudinal dispersion coefficient skewness and kurtosis respectively which can conveniently analyze the effect of each basic physical properties notice that the time scale for the effectiveness of the fourth order generalized dispersion model is undetermined therefore the present work aims to analytically investigate the classic problem of solute transport in an open channel turbulent flow by gill s generalized dispersion model with the high order terms a comprehensive description of both the vertical mean and spatial concentration distribution in open channel turbulent flow is to be conducted in consideration of the effects of high order terms the second to fourth order dispersion models are directly resolved the specific objectives of this study are i to illustrate the temporal evolution of the basic characteristic quantities of dispersion coefficient skewness and kurtosis ii to present the evolution of the vertical mean concentration distribution and compare the results derived from the second to fourth order dispersion models and to determine the time scale for the usability of the fourth order generalized dispersion model and discuss the concentration distribution at the very small time iii to depict and characterize the spatial concentration distribution of the solute dispersion process additionally to validate the reliability of the above analytical results comparisons of concentration distribution between the analytical solutions and numerical simulation results by the random displacement method are to be made the results and findings can contribute original knowledge to understanding the basic physical mechanism behind the turbulent dispersion phenomenon and providing concerned criteria of practical water resource applications 2 formulation consider solute transport in a fully developed turbulent flow in an open channel as shown in fig 1 a right handed cartesian coordinate system ox z is set with x standing for the longitudinal coordinate z the vertical coordinate origin o at the channel bed wall and h the water depth the advection diffusion equation for concentration is 1 c t u z c x z d z z c z where c x z t is the reynolds s mean concentration kgm 3 t is time s u z is the reynolds s mean velocity of the turbulent flow ms 1 and d z z is the eddy diffusivity in the vertical direction m 2 s 1 notice that the turbulent diffusion in the longitudinal direction is neglected comparing with the shear dispersion elder 1959 rubol et al 2016 ngo cong et al 2015 the velocity profile of the turbulent channel flow as obtained through solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans with the prandtl mixing length theory is given by the logarithmic law as elder 1959 fischer et al 1979 chatwin 1970 barton 1983 2 u z u u τ k 1 ln z h where u is the vertical mean velocity u τ is the friction velocity k is the von kármán s constant approximately equal to 0 41 elder 1959 though the above velocity profile neglects the viscous sublayer it is widely used by engineers chatwin 1970 as commonly assumed the turbulent mixing can be described by an eddy diffusivity and the reynolds s analogy holds elder 1959 fischer et al 1979 chatwin 1970 barton 1983 then the turbulent diffusion coefficient is obtained as 3 d z z kh u τ z h 1 z h for solute mass q kgm 1 uniformly released across the vertical section the initial condition is set as 4 c x z t t 0 q δ x h where δ x is the dirac delta function the non penetration conditions at the free water surface and channel bed are 5 d z c x z t z z h d z c x z t z z 0 0 since q is finite the upstream and downstream conditions are 6 c x z t x 0 we define the mean of a quantity over cross section as e g 7 u 1 h 0 h u z d z where u is the vertical mean velocity moreover the vertical mean turbulent diffusivity is 8 d z 1 h 0 h d z z d z kh u τ 6 introduce the following

we adopt gill s generalized dispersion model as firstly proposed by gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 to solve the advection diffusion equation for solute dispersion in laminar pipe flows and then extended to laminar pipe flows with wall absorption sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 jiang and chen 2018 different from the previous studies gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 focused on the low order solutions of concentration the present work adopts the high order dispersion model to account for the effects of high order terms all the basic characteristic quantities of dispersivity skewness and kurtosis of the mean concentration distribution are to be quantified 3 1 gill s generalized dispersion model the solution of the above governing equations can be formulated as a series expansion gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 of 14 c n 0 f n z t n c x n where f n z t are the time dependent cross sectional distribution functions and c is the vertical mean concentration by vertically averaging eq 14 we obtain 15 f 0 1 16 f n 0 n 1 2 3 the boundary and initial conditions give 17 d z f n z t z z 1 d z f n z t z z 0 0 n 0 1 2 18 f 0 z t t 0 1 f n z t t 0 0 n 1 2 3 by vertically averaging eq 10 and introducing eq 14 gill s well known generalized dispersion equation can be obtained as 19 c t n 0 k n t n c x n where the dispersion coefficients k n t are 20 k n t uf n 1 n 0 1 2 with f 1 0 k n n 0 1 2 3 4 have specific physical significance which will be illustrated in section 3 4 moreover substituting eq 14 into eq 10 and with the help of eq 19 we have 21 f n t z d z f n z uf n 1 m 0 n k m f n m n 0 1 2 it is prompt to get k 0 0 and f 0 1 to determine the dispersion coefficients k n f n n 1 2 3 of the high order terms we should solve eqs 20 21 alternately 3 2 solutions of the coefficients f n and k n with f 0 1 we obtain 22 k 1 u 0 i e the mass centroid of the solute cloud travels with the mean velocity of the flow then we can solve the following equation for f 1 from eq 21 23 f 1 t z d z f 1 z u we adopt the method of separation of variables to solve eq 23 under the boundary and initial conditions of eqs 17 18 the corresponding eigenvalue problem which belongs to the sturm liouville problems is given as 24 d d z 6 z 1 z d ψ d z λ 2 ψ 25 d z d ψ z d z z 1 d z d ψ z d z z 0 0 in view of d z 6 z 1 z 0 at z 0 1 eq 25 is equivalent to barton 1983 26 ψ d ψ d z finite at z 0 1 let z 1 2 η 1 ψ η ψ z then the eqs 24 26 can be transformed into 27 d d η 1 η 2 d ψ d η λ 2 6 ψ 0 28 ψ η 1 finite which corresponds to the legendre equation the general solutions are ψ η c 1 p v η c 2 q v η where 6 v v 1 λ 2 c 1 and c 2 are two constants considering the boundary conditions eq 28 ψ η should be the legendre polynomial p n η barton 1983 thus the eigenfunctions are ψ n z p n 2 z 1 and corresponding eigenvalues λ n 2 6 n n 1 n 0 1 2 then the solution of f 1 z t can be represented by the expansion 29 f 1 z t m 0 a 1 m t ψ m z substituting the above solution into eq 23 and considering eq 24 then multiplying both sides by the eigenfunction ψ n z and integrating along the vertical direction yields an ordinary differential equation about a 1 m t which can be easily solved the solution of f 1 can be obtained as 30 f 1 z t m 1 e λ m 2 t 0 t 2 m 1 e λ m 2 t 0 1 u ψ m d z d t ψ m z with the solution of f 1 we can directly obtain k 2 by eq 20 we remark that the eigenfunctions of f n n 2 3 are the same as f 1 and the solution processes of f n n 1 2 are similar namely we can then obtain the solutions of f 2 k 3 f 3 k 4 f 4 etc successively 3 3 solutions of gill s generalized dispersion model with the solutions of k n we can obtain the vertical mean concentration c by solving gill s generalized dispersion model corresponding to eq 19 through the fourier transform for the vertical mean concentration distribution we define the fourier transform of c as 31 c ξ t c e i ξ x d x thus the fourier transform of eq 19 with regard to k 0 0 is 32 c t n 1 k n t i ξ n c and the initial condition is 33 c ξ 0 c x 0 e i ξ x d x 1 then the solution of c is 34 c ξ t exp n 1 ω n t i ξ n where 35 ω n t 0 t k n t d t n 1 2 3 finally through the inverse fourier transform defined as eq 36 we obtain the solution of c 36 c 1 2 π c ξ t e i ξ x d ξ notice that although eq 19 for gill s generalized dispersion model including a sum of an infinite series the higher order coefficients therein are successively decreased by orders of magnitude for example k 2 is more than two orders of magnitude greater than k 3 gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 just considered the first second order n 2 terms nonetheless to reflect the transitional stage of dispersion the higher order dispersion model is required to account for the skewness and kurtosis of vertical mean concentration distribution related to k 3 k 4 jiang and chen 2018 hence in the present work the first fourth order generalized dispersion model is adopted to fully reflect all the basic properties for comparison with the different order models the solutions of c from second order to fourth order dispersion models are presented based on eq 34 c ξ t from the second order to fourth order dispersion models are respectively 37 c 2 ξ t exp ω 1 t i ξ ω 2 t ξ 2 38 c 3 ξ t exp ω 1 t i ξ ω 2 t ξ 2 ω 3 t i ξ 3 39 c 4 ξ t exp ω 1 t i ξ ω 2 t ξ 2 ω 3 t i ξ 3 ω 4 t ξ 4 through the inverse fourier transform defined in eq 36 it is convenient to obtain the solution c of the second order dispersion model as 40 c 2 x t 1 4 π ω 2 t exp x ω 1 t 2 4 ω 2 t which is a gaussian distribution through the inverse fourier transform of eq 38 the solution of the third order dispersion model is 41 c 3 x t 1 3 ω 3 3 exp ω 2 3 ω 3 x ω 1 ω 2 3 ω 3 2 ω 2 3 27 ω 3 2 ai x ω 1 ω 2 2 3 ω 3 3 ω 3 3 where ai is the airy function of the first kind the solution of the fourth order dispersion model is 42 c 4 x t c 3 x t f ξ 1 exp ω 4 t ξ 4 where the notation denotes the convolution operation f ξ 1 means the inverse fourier transform detailed solution procedures of c 3 x t and c 4 x t can refer to the work of jiang and chen 2018 with the solutions of the mean concentration distribution c and f n we can obtain the two dimensional concentration distribution through eq 14 3 4 basic characteristic quantities there are several basic quantities that characterize the solute dispersion process in flows i e the overall dispersivity skewness and kurtosis of the transverse mean concentration distribution which have been intensively discussed for the cases of laminar flows through concentration moments or cumulants of concentration distribution jiang et al 2017 wang and chen 2017 the n th order cross sectional mean concentration moment is defined as aris 1956 43 m n t x n c x t d x the n th order central moment ν n can be expressed in terms of the moments m n t which are given in a cumulants κ n can be represented by the central moments and the first few expressions are guo et al 2020 44 κ 1 x g κ 2 ν 2 κ 3 ν 3 κ 4 ν 4 3 ν 2 2 actually the coefficients k n in gill s generalized dispersion model as embodied in eq 19 are closely related to the concentration moments or cumulants of concentration distribution significantly the relationship between k n and cumulants of mean concentration distribution κ n is 45 k n t 1 n n d κ n t d t n 1 2 3 as clearly clarified in jiang and chen 2018 therefore we obtain these basic quantities defined by the cumulants or moments of concentration distribution through k n for example the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d t is 46 d t 1 2 d κ 2 d t k 2 namely the coefficient k 2 is corresponding to the longitudinal dispersivity to measure the deviation from a gaussian distribution in the initial stage of transport skewness γ 1 and kurtosis γ 2 can be obtained respectively by 47 γ 1 κ 3 κ 2 3 2 3 2 0 t k 3 τ d τ 0 t k 2 τ d τ 3 2 and 48 γ 2 κ 4 κ 2 2 6 0 t k 4 τ d τ 0 t k 2 τ d τ 2 that is the coefficients k 3 and k 4 are respectively corresponding to the skewness and kurtosis of the concentration distribution overall based on the gill s generalized dispersion model the spatial concentration distribution and transverse mean concentration distribution the basic characteristic quantities of longitudinal dispersion coefficient skewness and kurtosis can be all determined which can fully describe the dispersion phenomenon related to that solute releases into the open channel turbulent flow 4 results and discussion this section will show the analytical results of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient skewness and kurtosis of mean concentration distribution vertical mean concentration distribution obtained based on different order generalized dispersion model will be compared to better understand solute dispersion process in turbulent channel flow two dimensional concentration distribution will be illustrated moreover analytical solutions of concentration distribution will be compared with the numerical simulation results by the random displacement method to validate the reliability of our analytical results three typical time scales in the dispersion process will be determined 4 1 dispersivity skewness and kurtosis the longitudinal dispersion coefficient is an important parameter that quantifies the dispersion intensity of solute cloud which is constant at a large time taylor 1953 taylor 1954 aris 1956 for solute dispersion in the open channel turbulent flow the asymptotic value of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient can be estimated by d 1 5 86 h u τ elder 1959 nonetheless the dispersion coefficient in the transitional stage has not been discussed in elder s work evolution of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient can be quantified through eq 46 the dispersion coefficient increases with time and becomes constant at a large time as illustrated in fig 2 the asymptotic steady value of the dimensionless dispersion coefficient is d t 0 067 as d t d z pe 2 d t the dimensional dispersion coefficient is obtained as d t 5 862 h u τ same as the result in elder 1959 notice that the time when the dispersion coefficient reaches its asymptotic stable value is about 0 3 for solute dispersion in the turbulent open channel flow previous works show that the time to arrive the stable value is about 0 4 for solute dispersion in the submerged vegetated flow guo et al 2020 and is about 0 5 for solute dispersion in laminar tube flow gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 and in laminar open channel flow guo et al 2018 due to the effect of turbulent diffusion stronger than the molecular diffusion the asymptotic state of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient arrives more quickly for solute dispersion in the turbulent flow it is well known that the cross sectional mean concentration distribution approaches a gaussian distribution at the large time jiang and chen 2019 chatwin 1970 the degree of deviation from the normal distribution at the transitional stage can be quantified by the skewness and kurtosis defined by the eqs 47 48 respectively the skewness decreases with time and tends to zero at a large time the value of skewness is negative which means that the mean concentration distribution is negatively skewed as depicted in fig 3 a the velocity profile of the turbulent open channel flow is logarithmic the velocity gradient in the upper layer of the flow is smaller therefore the downstream solute cloud is more concentrated the kurtosis of mean concentration distribution decreases with time and approaches zero quickly as seen in fig 3 b compared with solute dispersion in wetland flow jiang et al 2017 and laminar open channel flow wang and chen 2016 the turbulent diffusion effect stronger than the molecular diffusion effect leads to the fast decay of high order term impacts moreover different from the kurtosis in the laminar open channel flow which is negative wang and chen 2016 the kurtosis is positive in the turbulent open channel flow due to the different velocity profile the velocity gradient of the turbulent open channel flow in the upper layer is smaller than that of the laminar channel flow which is inverse near the bed layer the kurtosis in the turbulent open channel flow is similar with that in the wetland flow with denser vegetation referring to fig 4 in jiang et al 2017 actually the velocity profile in the turbulent open channel flow is analogous to that in the wetland flow with large damping factor as shown in fig 2 in the previous paper jiang et al 2017 4 2 vertical mean concentration distribution in terms of the vertical mean concentration distribution the coefficients k n in the generalized dispersion model are illustrated in fig 4 k 0 which means the exchange coefficient always equals zero due to mass conservation of the solute in flow convection coefficient k 1 is also constant and equal to zero which indicates that the centroid velocity of the solute cloud always moves at the speed of the vertical mean velocity the dispersion coefficient k 2 and higher order coefficients increase with time and then reach their steady values at a dimensionless time t 0 3 notice that k 2 is actually the longitudinal dispersion coefficient and equals to d t as indicated in the above section the values of k 3 and especially k 4 are much smaller than the value of k 2 similar to the findings in previous study of solute dispersion in laminar tube flow jiang and chen 2018 the high order coefficients k 3 and k 4 reflect the non gaussian effects related to the skewness and kurtosis of the vertical mean concentration distribution respectively it can conclude that the skewness and kurtosis of the vertical mean concentration distribution are non negligible in the initial stage of transport therefore to account for the deviation from the normal distribution the high order dispersion model is required jiang and chen 2018 a comparison of the vertical mean concentration distribution based on the different order generalized dispersion models is presented in fig 5 the vertical mean concentration distribution obtained from the second order dispersion model c 2 is a gaussian distribution the third order dispersion model includes the skewness of vertical mean concentration distribution while the fourth order dispersion model reflects both the skewness and kurtosis of mean concentration distribution the effect of high order terms third and fourth order in gill s generalized dispersion model can not be ignored at the small time as shown in fig 5 a b c d the third order dispersion model illustrates that the vertical mean concentration distribution is asymmetric and the maximum concentration appears downstream that is the concentration distribution is negative skewness the fourth order dispersion model reflects the asymmetry and kurtosis of the concentration distribution the concentration distribution is leptokurtic namely its kurtosis is positive c 3 and c 4 are distinct at small times and they are identical at the time t 0 3 as depicted in the fig 3 b kurtosis is almost vanished at time t 0 3 therefore at the large time t 0 3 the third order dispersion model is appropriate to characterize the vertical mean concentration distribution additionally as illustrated in fig 5 f g the differences between the second order dispersion model and third order dispersion model are very small indicating that the effect of high order terms become negligible at the dimensionless time scale t 1 the classical taylor s dispersion model is also included in fig 5 we can know that taylor s dispersion model overestimates the dispersion and can t reflect the asymmetry and kurtosis of concentration distribution at the small time at the large time t 2 taylor s dispersion model is applicative in other words the classical taylor s dispersion model one dimensional advection diffusion model for the vertical mean concentration is applicative at the time scale t 1 notice that the fourth order gill s generalized dispersion model is inappropriate at the very small time to determine the timescale for the application of the fourth order generalized dispersion model comparison of the vertical mean concentration distribution between analytical solutions based on the fourth order generalized dispersion model and the numerical simulation results by the random displacement method details in b is presented in fig 6 the fourth order generalized dispersion model underestimates the maximum concentration at the small time t 0 1 when t 0 3 the fourth order generalized dispersion is consistent well with the numerical simulation result hence the time scale for the application of the fourth order generalized dispersion model is t 0 1 from a physical perspective advection dominates the dispersion process at the small time and the vertical turbulent diffusion effect can be neglected gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 the time it takes for solute to move h under the effects of vertical turbulent diffusion and longitudinal advection is h 2 d z and h u respectively the ratio of time scale is h 2 d z h u u h d z pe when time t 0 1 the vertical moving distance under the effect of vertical turbulent diffusion is also less 0 1 by comparing with the water depth 1 the vertical moving distance by turbulent diffusion is negligible the vertical mean concentration distribution under the effect of advection is chatwin 1970 49 c x t 1 t exp x t 1 x t the concentration profile is initially pulled by the advection and the vertical mean concentration distribution by pure advection is illustrated in fig 6 it illustrates that the maximum concentration occurs downstream moreover compared with the numerical simulation results we can know that the mean concentration obtained by the pure advection agrees well with the numerical simulation results at the small time t 0 01 as time increases the effect of diffusion becomes strong at time t 0 1 the generalized dispersion begins that is the generalized dispersion model is applicable actually in taylor 1953 s pioneering dispersion work taylor estimated that the dispersion begins at t r 2 3 8 2 d where r is radius of the tube and d is molecular diffusion coefficient the asymmetry of the concentration distribution resulted from the advection graduates away the concentration distribution is gradually showing normal distribution 4 3 two dimensional concentration distribution above sections discuss the vertical mean concentration distribution actually in the initial stage of transport the vertical concentration difference is large wu and chen 2014 as presented in fig 7 there is a high concentration zone near the free water surface and the concentration distribution is pulled like the velocity profile at the small time t 0 1 as the velocity gradient is smaller near the free water surface the solute cloud near the water surface zone is more concentrated under the effect of advection and vertical turbulent diffusion the concentration is decreased quickly as illustrated in fig 7 f comparing with the concentration distribution of solute transport in a laminar open channel flow wang and chen 2016 we can find that the solute cloud disperses more quickly in the turbulent open channel flow the longitudinal concentration distribution at different heights is presented in fig 8 for comparison the vertical mean concentration distribution is also included as can be seen the vertical mean concentration is close to the concentration at the height of z 0 5 the concentration at the free water surface is higher than those at the bed and at the middle height in the initial stage of transport as shown in fig 8 a b at the large time the non uniformity of vertical concentration distribution is decreased greatly under the effect of vertical turbulent diffusion hence the longitudinal concentration distributions at different heights are almost identical which are all close to the vertical mean concentration distribution as seen in fig 8 d notice that the positions of the peak concentration at different heights are located in different cross sections the peak concentration is upstream in the bed while it is downstream in the free water surface furthermore the vertical concentration distribution at different locations is shown in fig 9 the vertical concentration distribution at the origin tends to be uniform the upstream vertical concentration is higher near the bed and lower at the water surface while the downstream vertical concentration is higher at the water surface and lower near the bed notice that a moving coordinate system at the vertical mean velocity is adopted in the present paper hence solute cloud near the water surface is convected to the downstream while that near the bed is convected to the upstream under the effect of vertical turbulent diffusion the vertical concentration variation decreases with time however the vertical concentration distribution is still non uniform even at a large time as illustrated in fig 9 d to quantify the evolution of the vertical concentration difference an indicator named the vertical concentration variation rate is defined as wu and chen 2014 50 c va x t max c x z t x t min c x z t x t c x z t x z 0 100 where the numerator is the maximum concentration difference across a given vertical plane and the denominator is a reference concentration wu and chen 2014 the longitudinal distribution of the vertical concentration variation rate is a bimodal distribution as shown in fig 10 the downstream maxima of the vertical concentration variation rate is larger than the upstream maxima due to the smaller velocity gradient near the water surface at the small time with the time increasing the vertical concentration variation rate is greatly reduced under the effect of vertical turbulent diffusion and the asymmetry becomes nearly unnoticeable it can be seen that the maximum variation rate is about 55 at the time t 1 about 35 at the time t 2 and about 20 at the time t 5 at the time t 10 the maximum variation rate remains over 10 and even for very long times after solute release at the time t 100 the maximum variation rate still keeps about 5 indicating that the decrease of the vertical concentration difference is a large time scale process which can be characterized by the dimensionless time scale as t 10 wu and chen 2014 for clarity the typical dimensionless time scales in the dispersion process are depicted in fig 11 namely the generalized dispersion begins at the time scale of t 0 1 before that the advection dominates the transport process the vertical mean concentration distribution tends to be gaussian at the time scale of t 1 and the vertical concentration difference can be neglected at the time scale of t 10 moreover at the time period of 0 1 t 0 3 the effects of dispersivity skewness and kurtosis all work at the time period of 0 3 t 2 the effects of dispersivity and skewness play a major role at the time period of t 2 it is sufficient to consider only the influence of dispersivity to validate the reliability of the above analytical results comparisons of concentration distribution between the analytical solutions based on gill s generalized dispersion model and numerical simulation results by the random displacement method are illustrated in b 5 summary and conclusions in the present work the classic problem in environmental hydraulics of solute dispersion in an open channel turbulent flow is analytically investigated by gill s generalized dispersion model up to the fourth order to account for all the basic properties as dispersivity skewness and kurtosis of the concentration distribution the longitudinal dispersion coefficient increases over time and asymptotically approaches its steady value well known from previous studies both the skewness and kurtosis of the vertical mean concentration distribution are non negligible in the initial stage of transport as time increases kurtosis is vanished quickly comparison of the vertical mean concentration distribution based on the different order generalized dispersion models reveals that the third order generalized dispersion model is appropriate at the dimensionless time t 0 3 when the effect of fourth order term becomes negligible at the time scale of t 1 effects of skewness and kurtosis could be neglected and the typical one dimensional dispersion model is applicable at the very small time advection dominates the dispersion process and the fourth order generalized dispersion model is suitable at t 0 1 when the effect of the vertical turbulent diffusion becomes essential that is the generalized dispersion begins at the time scale t 0 1 in terms of the vertical concentration distribution there is a high concentration zone near the free water surface at the small time due to the small velocity gradient the vertical mean concentration is close to the longitudinal concentration at the middle height of the flow while it is lower than the concentration at the water surface especially at the small time therefore the vertical concentration distribution instead of the vertical mean concentration should be adopted in some environmental and engineering applications the downstream vertical concentration is higher near the water surface and lower at the channel bed while the upstream vertical concentration is higher at the bed and lower near the water surface the vertical concentration variation rate decreases with time and can be characterized by a dimensionless time scale as t 10 the analytical results of concentration distribution consist well with the numerical simulation results by the random displacement method the above obtained results can provide the basic knowledge for related applications credit authorship contribution statement jinlan guo

dimensional concentration distribution between analytical solutions and numerical simulation results is shown in fig 12 in more detail a comparison of the longitudinal concentration distribution at different heights between analytical solutions and numerical simulation results is illustrated in fig 13 it can be seen that the obtained analytical solutions based on gill s generalized dispersion model consist well with the numerical results 
3842,human activities such as discharging nuclear wastewater into the ocean can put coasts in the risk of being exposed to radioactive contaminations the radionuclides may potentially intrude into coastal aquifers from the ocean and endanger the groundwater resources either laterally through subsurface or vertically through land surface during ocean surge induced inundation this study attempted to investigate the temporal and spatial scales of these intrusion processes using an experimental site near bremerhaven northern germany a fully coupled surface subsurface flow and transport model was employed to simulate the groundwater flow and the transport of tds total dissolved salt 3h and 14c under conditions with or without an ocean surge event scenarios of different exposure schemes were designed by varying the exposure duration and radionuclide concentrations the intrusion and post exposure recovery were assessed via contaminated volume and area intrusion length and recovery time results show that depending on exposure duration the intrusion of 3h and 14c can cause serious contamination in the coastal aquifer with up to 18 9 km2 land area being contaminated and reaching up to 3 3 km landward from the shore 3h shows a harder intrusion easier recovery pattern due to its higher decay rate the full recovery may take up to 70 years and 217 years considering 30 years exposure for 3h and 14c respectively an ocean surge event is more likely to exacerbate the intrusion but it does not significantly change the full recovery time shorter exposure duration should be favored to minimize the influences on the coastal aquifer when the total exposure quantity is fixed this study highlights the severity of radioactive contamination in coastal aquifers and the difficulty of recovery thus cautious decision should be made concerning the possible impacts of releasing radioactive wastewater on coastal life and human beings keywords coastal aquifers radionuclides ocean surge coupled surface subsurface modelling 1 introduction coastal aquifers are important sources of fresh groundwater used for agricultural domestic and industrial purposes but they are vulnerable to the intrusion of seawater containing high salinity and other contaminants werner et al 2012 since the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident in march 2011 japan a significant amount of artificial radionuclides has been discharged into the ocean behrens et al 2012 prants 2013 prants 2015 zhao et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 smith et al 2015 meanwhile japan announced its plan to release more than 1 3 million m3 of radioactive water from the fdnpp over a duration of 30 years zhao et al 2021 these accidental or planned incidents can greatly raise the risk of coasts being exposed to radioactive contamination the radionuclides intrusion may potentially pollute the groundwater resources and coastal environment ultimately jeopardizing human health iaea 2014 therefore process understanding and assessment of the effects of radioactive contamination on groundwater resources in coastal aquifers are critical for sustainable coastal management to date many studies have investigated the consequences of radionuclides release events at oceanic or global scales most studies focused on the spread and mixing of the radionuclides plumes in oceans behrens et al 2012 prants 2013 prants 2015 or in atmosphere hong et al 2012 and the associated ecological impacts lu et al 2021 for example behrens et al 2012 simulated the spreading and dilution of 137cs in the pacific ocean considering a ten year dispersal of the 137cs from the fdnpp they concluded that the main patch would reach the coasts of north american in 5 6 years zhao et al 2021 numerically investigated the transport of tritium 3h contained in the radioactive water released from the fdnpp their simulation results suggested that depending on the releasing duration the 3h plumes might either reach north american coasts in 4 5 years or be confined to the east japan region chen et al 2021 further argued that the radionuclides from the radioactive water can spread and be redistributed by the active ocean currents and eddies to the entire pacific ocean indian ocean and atlantic ocean these studies highlighted the wide redistribution of radionuclides in oceans and the associated risk of radioactive contamination in coastal areas however the further impacts of radionuclides redistribution on coastal groundwater resources have seldom been examined seawater intrusion leads to the salinization of coastal aquifers either laterally due to the presence of higher density seawater or vertically from the surface after an extreme seawater inundation event by either way seawater intrusion may degrade the fresh groundwater resources most early studies relevant to seawater intrusion considered the total dissolved salt tds as the main contaminant in the seawater werner et al 2012 while some of them simultaneously investigated the migration solutes tracers e g nitrate erostate et al 2018 cao et al 2020 boumaiza et al 2020 kwon et al 2021 isotopes erostate et al 2018 cao et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 mao et al 2020 for example colombani et al 2015 simulated the fate of a mixture of inorganic pollutants arsenic phosphate and ammonium released into a shallow coastal aquifer showing that considering tds transport is essential for building a robust conceptual model of pollutant transport in coastal aquifers although these studies considerably improved the understanding of solute transport mechanisms in coastal aquifers they all considered land sourced solutes tracers radionuclides have been extensively used as tracers in coastal aquifers cook and herczeg 2000 mainly focusing on determining the groundwater ages sivan et al 2005 turnadge and smerdon 2014 sources bouchaou et al 2008 hagedorn et al 2011 röper et al 2012 houben et al 2014 and mixing han et al 2012 for example vogel 1967 used natural radiocarbon 13c to study flow patterns and flow rates of subterranean water bodies in different regions in the netherlands post et al 2019 quantitatively analyzed the behavior of 3he and 3h in freshwater lens and transition zone of the german island langeoog they found that 3he and 3h are useful tracers for young groundwater and for studying saltwater circulation patterns respectively yechieli et al 2019 used radioactive noble gas 81kr and 39ar to measure the ages of deep saline coastal groundwater and estimate the rate of seawater intrusion however these studies focused on determining hydrogeological conditions using the radionuclides as natural environmental tracers rather than considering radionuclides as potential contaminants numerous studies have pointed out the contaminants enriched in seawater and beach sediment which can potentially be released and migrate to coastal aquifers via seawater intrusion charlet et al 2007 puthiyasekar et al 2010 venkatramanan et al 2015 villegas et al 2018 sundar et al 2021 for example venkatramanan et al 2015 carried out groundwater sampling in busan city south korea and suggested that the groundwater contamination is partially attributed to ocean sourced metals fe mn cu cd and zn sundar et al 2021 demonstrated that the high metal concentration in sediment of southernmost india beach can endanger the groundwater resource through seawater intrusion these studies highlighted the potential environmental risks of ocean sourced contaminants to coastal aquifers focusing on identifying the sources of groundwater contamination in comparison the spatiotemporal scale of the transport of ocean sourced radionuclides in coastal aquifers has received little attention and requires further investigation the hazard of surficial ocean surge inundation to coastal aquifers is well documented ocean surges deliver a large amount of seawater onto the land surface of coastal areas when the waves are sufficiently high to wash over the inland area gingerich et al 2017 subsequently the seawater infiltrates into the subsurface and salinizes the fresh groundwater kooi et al 2000 illangasekare et al 2006 giambastiani et al 2007 anderson and lauer 2008 violette et al 2009 terry and falkland 2010 yang et al 2013 holding and allen 2015 yu et al 2016 post and houben 2017 although the inundation may only last for several hours it takes a much longer time for the salinized coastal aquifers to recover as the saltwater gradually transports seaward and gets diluted chui and terry 2012 yu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the post surge recovery is affected by various factors e g land topography heterogeneity hydraulic conductivity head gradient and recharge rates bailey 2015 holding and allen 2015 yu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the recovery time varies from months terry and falkland 2010 chui and terry 2012 bailey 2015 to decades yang et al 2013 holding and allen 2015 in our previous study yang et al 2015b an extreme ocean surge inundation event on a coastal aquifer of the german bight north sea was numerically investigated it was reported that the considered ocean surge leads to seawater ponding of approximately 5 3 km2 where the groundwater is salinized for up to 20 years however these studies focused on the salinization process and its effect on groundwater resources as the frequency and intensity of ocean surge events increase due to global climate change werner et al 2013 ipcc 2014 the inland surface is likely to be directly exposed to the seawater rich in radionuclides such a direct exposure may potentially change the spatial and temporal distributions of radionuclides in coastal aquifers nonetheless to data it is unknown how the radionuclides may intrude into coastal aquifers and the spatiotemporal scale of the intrusion given the research gap this study aims to use a 3d fully coupled surface subsurface model hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 to numerically explore the intrusion of radionuclides into coastal aquifers specifically the objectives of this study are 1 to understand the intrusion mechanism of radionuclides 3h and 14c from the ocean to the coastal aquifers under different exposure schemes and with without extreme ocean surge events 2 to evaluate the spatiotemporal influences of the radionuclides intrusion via metrics such as contaminated area intrusion lengths and recovery time the results from this study are potentially important for effective water land management of coastal regions facing the risk of radioactive contaminations this study warns of the potential impacts of releasing radioactive waste water into the ocean on coastal aquifers especially for those adjacent to the release position 2 methodology 2 1 study site fig 1 shows the studied coastal aquifer near bremerhaven northern germany contacting the north sea with its west boundary the land has a total area of 108 km2 where cities ports and agriculture including livestock farming are presented the elevation of the land surface which is quantified as meters above mean sea level masl ranges from 21 2 masl at the seafloor west fig 1a to 23 7 masl at the higher land east according to the digital elevation model of 20 m resolution for lower saxony germany laser wremen 2008 supplied by lbeg lower saxony state office for mining energy and geology the precipitation and evapotranspiration et data for this area from 1961 to 2000 is available from lib 2012 the annual mean effective groundwater recharge which was calculated by subtracting the et from the precipitation yang et al 2015a yang et al 2015b varies spatially from 107 to 311 mm yr 1 on average 275 mm yr 1 an aquitard layer clay and silt was deposited since the tertiary and miocene with extremely low hydraulic conductivity nlfb 2005 it was considered as the base of the coastal aquifer such that the elevation of aquifer bottom i e top of the aquitard ranges from 70 masl to 300 masl nlfb 2003 however the part of the aquifer below 100 masl was simply excluded in this study as it is dominated by local units of clay and silt local low permeable segments inside the aquifer nlfb 2003 a dyke of 7 3 masl height protects the inland from being flooded during high tides or ocean surges the surface water is drained out from the inland to the sea via the well developed network of canals which are mostly distributed along the borders of farmland and roads the surface water in the canals can flow through the dyke to the sea via two gates there are two reasons for selecting this coastal area to investigate the intrusion of radioactive contaminants 1 it is representative of many low lying coastal aquifers with developed drainage network where seawater inundation is more likely to occur 2 the study site is subject to intense human activities e g industry agriculture and human residence and thus quite vulnerable to radioactive contamination 2 2 numerical model the intrusion processes of both seawater and radioactive contaminants into the studies coastal aquifer were simulated in this regard there are two parts of simulations performed in current study i the transport of conservative tds which affects the flow field by changing fluid properties e g density and viscosity and ii the transport of reactive decay 3h and 14c which do not affect the flow field the simulation of part i has been successfully conducted by yang et al 2015b using the calibrated numerical model hydrogeosphere which is a 3d numerical groundwater software describing fully coupled surface subsurface variably saturated variable density flow and advective dispersive diffusive salt transport therrien et al 2010 this study based on this calibrated model further performed the simulation of part ii we provide a brief review of that model in section 2 2 1 readers may refer to yang et al 2015b for a full description of the model and calibration 2 2 1 flow and tds transport fig 2 shows the 3d conceptual model of the coastal surface canal subsurface system to be simulated by hydrogeosphere the 2d surface domain in the xy plane fig 2b was discretized into a 2d mesh of 16 748 triangles with resolution ranging from 50 m near the coast to 250 m near higher inland vertically z direction the subsurface domain between the land surface and the aquifer bottom was divided into 8 layers leading to a 3d mesh consisting of 8 16 748 133 984 prismatic elements fig 2b the 2d surface flow was modeled by solving manning s equation manning 1891 and the diffusive wave approximation of the st venant equation the 3d variably saturated variable density groundwater flow was modeled by solving the richards equation and the darcy s law the transport of tds or other solutes in surface and subsurface domains was modeled by solving the advection dispersion diffusion equation the surface and subsurface domains are numerically coupled using a dual node approach this approach assumes the surface and subsurface domains are separated by a thin layer of porous media through this layer the water exchange fluxes i e infiltration to subsurface and exfiltration from subsurface can be calculated in the form of darcy s law considering the head gradient between the surface and subsurface the salt exchange fluxes can be calculated based on the water exchange fluxes given the advective transport therrien et al 2010 the canal network of was represented by the 1d canal domain which was discretized by 4 064 1d segments fig 2b water flow and salt transport in canal domain were modeled using the same equations as for the 2d surface domain a modified dual node approach was used to couple the canal domain and the subsurface domain this approach also assumes the canal bed and the subsurface domain are separated by a thin layer of porous medium between which the water and solute exchange fluxes are calculated however to calculate the exchange fluxes the head gradients across the layer were determined using an interpolate method readers may refer to yang et al 2015b for a detailed description of the approach geological information of the aquifer was supplied by lbeg lower saxony state office for mining energy and geology who conducted the hydrostratigraphic survey for the state of lower saxony and published geological profiles the hydrostratigraphic distribution shows that several layers were formed because of sea level changes and glaciations since the miocene fig 3 a nibis kartenserver 2010 these layers consist of gravel sand silt clay and organic deposit with different permeability several property zones were created in the subsurface to represent such layered heterogeneity table 1 lists the parameters for the flow and transport simulations regarding boundary conditions specific heads were prescribed to the seaside boundary a b for the subsurface domain and ao bo for the surface domain fig 2a the prescribed heads were either time variant e g during ocean surge range 0 3 88 masl or constant 0 masl depending on the sea level temporally constant but spatially variable tds concentrations in the range of 0 366 0 602 were assigned to these boundaries according to the measured data of the year 2009 note that relative tds concentrations ranging in 0 1 were used in the simulations with 0 representing freshwater of zero salinity and 1 representing seawater with the salinity of 34 24 psu practical salinity units table 1 water density was calculated using the isothermal linear density concentration relationship where density increases from 1000 to 1025 5 kg m 3 by increasing the tds concentrations from 0 to 1 sea level and salinity data for the seaside boundary were provided by the german federal waterways and shipping administration spatially variable but temporally constant groundwater recharge precipitation et was applied to the aquifer top excluding the et from the simulations while maintaining water mass balance other boundaries of the domains were set to be impermeable for water and salt as they coincide with catchment sub catchment boundaries yang et al 2015a yang et al 2015b under temporally constant boundary conditions we first ran the model until reaching a steady state of the flow and tds transport the model was calibrated for this steady state simulation using the groundwater level measurements of the year 2009 the software pest doherty and hunt 2010 was used for the calibration pest uses marquardt method marquardt 1963 to minimize a target function by varying the values of a set of parameters e g the hydraulic conductivity k and the manning roughness coefficient n for our model until optimization criterion is reached the target function was defined to measure the error between the modeled and the measured groundwater levels pest allowed the pilot points approach to estimate the spatial distributions for k and n totally 70 pilot points were used i e 70 model parameters required estimation pest s regularization methodology known as truncated singular value decomposition was employed to improve the calibration performance note that the calibration was not performed for the tds distribution because of the lack of concentration measurements in the aquifer using the simulated steady state results hydraulic heads and tds concentrations as the initial conditions the 3d model successfully simulated the seawater intrusion under a storm surge event in yang et al 2015b we continue to use it to simulate the flow and tds transport in the coastal aquifer under different scenarios of this study described later in section 2 3 2 2 2 transport of 3h and 14c in addition to the transport of tds this study also considered the transport of 3h and 14c in the studied coastal aquifer 3h and 14c were selected because they are the two most common types of radionuclides in the nuclear wastewater and their half life periods cover a wide range from 12 43 years for 3h to 5370 years for 14c the multi solutes transport scheme of hydrogeosphere allows for simulating the advective dispersive transport of tds 3h and 14c simultaneously 3h and 14c are treated as solutes that do not affect the fluid density due to their relatively low concentrations the first order decay process continuously degrades 3h and 14c in the system using dm λ m d t where the dm and m are the degraded mass and total mass of 3h or 14c at time t λ is the degradation coefficients being 1 528 10 4 day 1 and 3 536 10 7 day 1 for 3h and 14c respectively similar to the tds the ocean is considered as the unique source of 3h and 14c represented by assigning specific concentrations csea on the seaside boundaries a b and ao bo for both 3h and 14c to simplify the definition of boundary conditions relative concentration is used csea is held constant as a specific value e g 1 when the coast is exposed to the radioactive contamination of 3h and 14c for a specific time period exposure duration csea 0 is used when the exposure is terminated the exposure schemes will be described in section 2 3 the coastal system subsurface surface canal is initially assigned a zero concentration to better observe the intrusion of 3h and 14c from the seawater to the aquifer 2 3 scenario descriptions 2 3 1 exposure schemes the exposure of the studied coast to radioactive contamination can be caused by the disposal of nuclear waste from the land to the ocean either in planned human activities or in unplanned extreme events defining the exposure scheme can be challenging because the disposal pattern is uncertain specifically although the disposal of nuclear waste can be continuous and last for a considerable long time the time duration and disposal rate are highly dependent on the decision makers the challenge also lies in the complex mixing and dilution of the nuclear waste in the ocean making it difficult to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of the radioactive contamination chen et al 2021 and the concentrations of specific contaminants note that this study focuses on the intrusion of radioactive contaminants into coastal aquifers once the coast is subject to radioactive contamination rather than on the spread of radioactive contaminants in the ocean given the challenge we design three schemes with exposure durations of 30 20 and 10 years namely s0 s1 and s2 respectively fig 4 a during each exposure the relative concentrations of 3h and 14c in seawater are held constant being 1 exposure concentration csea the relative concentrations are immediately set to 0 once the exposure is terminated post exposure note that the exposure schemes neglect the fluctuations of 3h and 14c concentrations in seawater however these simplified schemes still allow for investigating how the coastal aquifer would be contaminated by exposure with different durations and how fast the contamination may retreat after the exposure the exposure scheme s0 was selected as the base exposure scheme for interpreting the intrusion processes additionally based on the scheme of s0 30 years exposure duration and csea 1 we design another two exposure schemes s3 with 20 years exposure duration and csea 1 5 and s4 with 10 years exposure duration and csea 3 fig 4b apparently s0 s3 and s4 have the same quantity of contaminants exposure duration exposure concentration cross comparison between these three exposure schemes allows for identifying the exposure scheme with minimum impact on the coastal aquifer when the quantity of contaminants is fixed 2 3 2 ocean surge inundation yang et al 2015b has simulated the ocean surge induced seawater overtopping over the dyke for the studied area using hydrogeosphere since the height of the dyke is 7 3 masl the dyke crest is quite unlikely to be overtopped by the seawater therefore a case of partial dyke failure was assumed and simulated in their study in the present study we keep using their approach to simulate the ocean surged induced overtopping inundation under the extreme case of partial dyke failure the considered ocean surge event lasted for 8 h with a maximum surge height of 3 88 masl fig 4c sea level varies according to the surge curve during the event 0 t 8 h and drops back to normal sea level of 0 masl afterwards t 8 h it is assumed that the partial dyke failure occurs at the middle part of the dyke red dot in fig 2a four hours after the onset of the ocean surge t 4 h the dyke breaks along a length of 100 m where the dyke crest is reduced from the original 7 3 masl to 2 masl the partial dyke failure is numerically represented by lowering the elevation of the grid nodes at the location of the dyke failure while preserving all the other parts of the grid without removing any cells the dyke failure causes seawater overtopping and partial inundation of the low lying inland area depending on the amount of seawater delivered subsequently tds 3h and 14c are delivered to the inland area via the land surface and infiltrate into the subsurface the possibility of the partial dyke failure in the studied area is still unclear this assumption nonetheless allowed for the possibility of investigating the effect of ocean surge inundation on intrusion recovery of radionuclides in this sense this assumption is considered to be acceptable in this study the intrusion of 3h and 14c into the coastal aquifer can be potentially exacerbated by ocean surge because both the seaside boundaries and the land surface are exposed to the radioactive contamination to understand the effects of ocean surge we define two scenarios for each exposure scheme 1 no ocean surge and 2 the ocean surge occurs at the beginning t 0 of the exposure therefore this study simulated 10 scenarios 5 exposure schemes s0 s4 2 with without ocean surge each simulation was run for 500 years to provide the aquifer with sufficient time to recover from the radioactive contamination in the post exposure stage adaptive time step scheme was used allowing the dynamic adjustment of time step during simulations therrien et al 2010 the cpu time of each simulation was about 2 days 2 4 assessment indicators 2 4 1 contamination criteria we used the concentration of 0 01 e g 1 of the 3h or 14c concentration in seawater as the threshold above which the water is regarded as contaminated by 3h or 14c this threshold is comparable to that for tds 2 which was frequently used in seawater intrusion studies werner et al 2012 based on this threshold the contaminated volume is calculated as the total volume of aquifer regions where the 3h or 14c concentration is above 0 01 the contaminated volumes of 3h and 14c equal to zero initially and evolve during the simulations the contaminated area is defined as the area of land surface beneath which contamination can be detected above 30 masl the contaminated area indicates the severity of contamination using horizontal land area the intrusion length can be estimated by measuring the horizontal distance between the contamination front and the shoreline 2 4 2 recovery time once the exposure is terminated the contaminated aquifer can potentially recover to the initial state due to decay of the contaminants seaward flushing of the contaminants by groundwater flow and dilution by fresh groundwater through recharge for a specific point in the contaminated aquifer the term recovery from 3h or 14c contamination is defined as the situation in which the 3h or 14c concentration has dropped below 0 01 this study does not access the true recovery to initial pre exposure concentrations because that situation can only be reached asymptotically following the concept of flushing time used in yu et al 2016 we adopt the concept of recovery time rt to quantify the recovery rate for a certain point in the aquifer rt is defined as the duration from the beginning of the exposure to the recovery at that point therefore rt is a spatially distributed variable and inapplicable to areas never contaminated by the radionuclides for each scenario the recovery time pdf probability density function can be calculated by counting the incidences of rt in the coastal aquifer volume fraction associated to each possible rt value the 50th and 95th percentiles rt50 rt95 of the recovery time pdf were extracted to represent the median and full recovery time respectively note that we used rt95 to approximate the full recovery time because 100 recovery may never be reached the intrusion of 3h and 14c were accessed independently using the above mentioned indicators the assessments were only performed for the land part of the aquifer area landward beyond the shoreline that is more important for human activities the aquifer underneath the sea bed beach area submerged by seawater was excluded 3 results and discussion the seawater intrusion with and without the considered ocean surge was simulated and described in yang et al 2015b as we focus on the intrusion of radionuclides in the present study we only briefly review the seawater intrusion process with respect to the flow pattern and tds transport fig 5 a demonstrates the tds distribution without ocean surge steady state note that this distribution remains unchanged regardless of the exposure schemes s0 s4 because these scenarios only affect the boundary conditions of 3h and 14c seawater intrudes into the subsurface laterally due to the presence of higher density seawater on the seaside and lower density freshwater in the subsurface fig 5a forming a classic salt water wedge a considerable part of the aquifer is already salinized flow paths show that the seawater generally infiltrates through the seaside boundary and the sea bed flows through the aquifer landward exits the aquifer to the land surface and finally returns to the sea via canals this flow circle is formed under the interplay between the variable density groundwater flow and tds transport the density effect of tds is the key factor to form such flow circle considering the occurrence of ocean surge the simulated results suggest that about 2 million m3 of seawater is delivered into the inland area through the breakpoint of the dyke during the 2 h of overtopping right after the ocean surge stops the delivered seawater has flowed as far as 3 2 km landward from the shoreline ponds of seawater have been formed on about 5 3 km2 of the inland area with an average surface water depth of 0 4 m fig 5b shows the tds distribution seven days after the onset of the ocean surge transient state it demonstrates that the ponding water infiltrates into the subsurface and causes salinization the tds plumes percolate vertically as lobe shaped instabilities towards the fresh groundwater this lateral and vertical movement of the tds plumes has been frequently reported in previous studies kooi et al 2000 illangasekare et al 2006 anderson and lauer 2008 violette et al 2009 holding and allen 2015 yu et al 2016 3 1 intrusion processes of 3h and 14c present study focuses on the development of 3h and 14c plumes that depends on the exposure duration the exposure scheme s0 fig 4a was used for interpreting the intrusion processes fig 6 a shows the distribution of 14c plumes at different times for s0 without ocean surge event once the coast is exposed to the 14c contamination at t 0 the 14c starts infiltrating into the subsurface from the sea bed after one year a plume finger develops underneath the beach area and almost reaches the aquifer bottom fig 6a 1 as the exposure continues the plume expands horizontally and vertically filling the aquifer space underneath the beach and intruding towards the inland aquifer at the end of the exposure t 30 year fig 6a 2 contamination can be detected as far as 2 5 km landward from the shoreline reaching the inland area behind the dyke after the exposure terminates the aquifer close to the sea bed recovers from the contamination firstly however the residual 14c plumes keep expanding landwards for a time period 30 year t 60 year before shrinking due to natural remediation consequently the contaminated area reaches the maximum distance of 3 9 km from the shoreline at t 60 year fig 6a 3 it can be observed that the landward expansion of the plumes mainly occurs along the canals network which acts as preferential pathways for the landwards transport of the 14c that has exfiltrated from the subsurface into the canals in this sense the canal network promotes the intrusion of 14c at t 60 year the natural remediation continuously reduces the contamination and the seaward retreat of the plumes can be observed however this process is so slow that contamination can still be detected in the inland aquifer behind the dyke after 100 years fig 6a 4 the complete recovery from the contamination may take more than 200 years fig 6a 5 considering the occurrence of ocean surge during the exposure ponds of contaminated water has been formed on the inland area the ponding seawater with 14c will eventually either flow back to the sea via the canal flow or infiltrate vertically into the subsurface post surge infiltration of ponding water leads to the development of the 14c plume starting near the aquifer top the simulated pattern of the plume development is similar to many previous studies of coastal aquifers or islands performed for salt holding and allen 2015 yu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 obviously the ocean surge exacerbates the intrusion of 14c to the aquifer by directly exposing the inland surface to the contaminants 14c plumes reach as far as 3 9 km 3 8 km and 4 1 km landward from the shoreline after 1 year 30 years and 60 years respectively fig 6b 1 2 3 because the canal network acts as preferential flow paths for the flooding water the plumes develop preferentially underneath and near the canals the natural remediation is also slow that the contamination persists in the aquifer for more than 200 years fig 6b 4 fig 7 demonstrates that the development of the 3h and 14c plumes in the coastal aquifer when the ocean surge is not included driven by the flow circle which is formed under the interplay between the variable density groundwater flow and tds transport the 3h and 14c plumes develop from the sea bed penetrate into the aquifer along the flow paths fig 7a b in this sense the density effect of seawater caused by tds is the main driving force for the intrusion of 3h and 14c via the subsurface even though the 3h and 14c themselves do not affect the fluid density 3h and 14c plumes at the end of the exposure t 30 years exhibit similar shapes fig 7a b however the concentration mass load of 3h plumes is significantly lower due to its higher decay rate for the same reason the aquifer recovers faster from 3h contamination than from 14c contamination after the exposure ceases manifested in the 0 5 km intrusion length of 3h and 1 5 km for 14c fig 7c d the comparison suggests that a reasonable harder intrusion easier recovery pattern is associated with radionuclides of higher decay rate fig 8 shows the breakthrough curves for the contaminated aquifer volume for the exposure s0 it more quantitatively confirms the aforementioned conclusions based on the plume distributions 1 14c can cause severer contamination than 3h manifested in the larger peaks of the contaminated aquifer volume 2 ocean surge event accelerates the contamination process and significant upgrades the contamination as the contaminated volumes under the ocean surge are higher than that of no ocean surge 3 times lags exist between the end of exposure and the start of the recovery which are 13 and 14 years for 3h contamination with and without surge respectively and 38 and 50 years for 14c contamination note that this start of recovery refers to the time since when the contaminated volume shows a declining trend rather than meaning that the natural remediation only occurs since that time especially for the 3h the contaminated volume already significantly decreased after the ocean surge due to faster degradation and raised again due to the lateral intrusion from the subsurface double peaks of the red dashed line fig 8 3 2 quantity of contamination the intrusion of 3h and 14c are dynamic processes with the contaminated area varying in time and intrusion length changing in space and time this study records the maximum contaminated area and the maximum intrusion length for all the simulated scenarios by cross comparing these values between the exposure schemes with equal exposure concentration s0 s1 and s2 fig 4a the severity of the contamination in the coastal aquifer in response to the exposure duration can be quantitatively analyzed for 3h contamination without ocean surge the contaminated area increases from 5 7 km2 for 10 year exposure to 7 9 km2 for 30 year exposure fig 9 a the same trend can be observed for the intrusion length fig 9b however when the ocean surge event is included the contaminated area and intrusion length keep constant at 15 9 km2 and 2 9 km regardless of the change of the exposure scheme this is because the intrusion of the 3h is dominated by the ocean surge via surface flow rather than through the subsurface such that the most serious intrusion reaches at 20 days after the onset of the ocean surge comparing the scenarios with and without ocean surge the contaminated area and intrusion length are significantly increased by the imposed ocean surge event similar trends can be observed for 14c contamination the severity of 14c contamination generally increases with the increase of the exposure duration fig 9 the contamination can cover a maximum 18 9 km2 of land area and reach maximum 3 3 km landward from the shoreline unlike 3h the contamination is sensitive to exposure duration even when the ocean surge is included this suggests that the intrusion of 14c is dominated by the intrusion through the subsurface influenced by exposure duration rather than by the imposed ocean surge event however if the exposure duration is short enough the maximum contaminated area and intrusion length would again be controlled by the ocean surge event comparing with 3h the severity of 14c contamination is higher due to its lower decay rate regardless of the exposure duration and whether or not an ocean surge event occurs 3 3 recovery rt reveals how fast the coastal aquifer recovers from the radioactive contamination after the exposure either via subsurface or via the land surface during ocean surge inundation fig 10 using given hydrogeological conditions e g topography aquifer properties for the simulations rt is only a function of the changing boundary conditions i e ocean surge with without and exposure duration the responses of rt can be quantitatively analyzed by cross comparison between exposure schemes of different durations and the same exposure concentration s0 s1 and s2 fig 4a fig 10 illustrates the spatial rt distribution in the contaminated regions of the aquifer under the exposure scheme s0 note that it does not represent the actual 3h or 14c plumes without considering ocean surge the post exposure recovery requires up to 85 years for 3h and 499 years for the 14c spatially rt increases from 30 years near the aquifer to larger values near the aquifer bottom indicating that the aquifer generally recovers from top to bottom fig 11 a b vertical this is because the aquifer top is closer to the clean uncontaminated water either from recharge or from the sea after the exposure such that dilution effect is more pronounced the aquifer under the beach zone generally recovers faster that the inland aquifer fig 10a b horizontal this is because the beach immediately contacts the clean seawater once the exposure is terminated such that the 3h 14c can be quickly diluted and transported by the infiltrated seawater when considering ocean surge along with the exposure the recovery subsequently includes 1 the recovery from the contamination caused by seawater inundation and 2 the recovery from subsurface intrusion fig 10c demonstrates a shallow region of rt 30 years where 3h contamination is caused during the ocean surge as the ocean surge is significantly shorter than the exposure duration hours compared to 30 years the recovery of 1 may be partially or even fully completed before the exposure ends for 14c the ocean surge caused contaminated regions at inland aquifer with rt ranging between 70 and 200 years fig 10d compared with the case without ocean surge the ocean surge increases the total volume of the contaminated region that undergoes recovery however it does not significantly alter the maximum rt remaining 85 years for 3h and 499 years for 14c to more accurately describe the recovery speed we calculated the rt50 and rt95 from the spatial rt distributions the two indicators allow for the cross comparison between different scenarios fig 11 note that the aquifer underneath the sea bed is excluded from the calculation of rt50 and rt95 and only the land part of the aquifer that is more vulnerable to human activities is included the simulated rt50 ranges from 15 to 61 years for 3h contamination and from 86 to 133 years for 14c contamination both increasing with the increase of exposure duration regardless of whether or not the ocean surge is imposed fig 11a rt50 of 14c are significantly higher than that of the 3h suggesting that 14c contamination is harder to clean up due to its lower decay rate ocean surge causes lower rt50 for the 3h contamination explained by the aforementioned fact that additional 3h contamination caused by ocean surge inundation recovers earlier than the contamination by subsurface intrusion it should be noted that the ocean surge is assumed to occur at the beginning of the exposure it would increase the rt50 of 3h contamination if it is imposed at a late stage of the exposure however the ocean surge event does not significantly alter the rt50 of 14c contamination fig 11b demonstrates that the rt95 ranges from 44 to 70 years for 3h contamination and from 141 years to 217 years for 14c contaminations these values can be interpreted as for example once the coast is exposed to 3h contamination at t 0 for 10 years full recovery would at the earliest be expected at t 44 years similar to rt50 rt95 is longer with a longer exposure duration and longer for 14c than for 3h an ocean surge event does not significantly change the full recovery time only slightly increasing the rt95 for 14c contamination this indicates that the full recovery is dominated by the recovery process for subsurface intrusion previous studies have frequently reported the recovery process from the salinization tds contamination caused by ocean surge inundation with recovery times ranging from 1 year to 20 years terry and falkland 2010 chui and terry 2012 chui and terry 2013 bailey 2015 holding and allen 2015 yang et al 2018 our simulated recovery times are not comparable to that range because i the previously reported recovery times are for the recovery from the salinization caused by ocean surge inundation to the initial state where intrusion of tds already naturally exists while our recovery also considered the full clean up of intruded contaminants in the subsurface ii the recovery of 3h and 14c contamination involves the degradation by decay which is not involved in the recovery from salinization however using the previously reported recovery times as references the recovery from 3h and 14c contamination would last for relatively long times of up to 133 years rt50 these recovery times have never been reported before 3 4 exposure scheme optimization the scenarios under the exposure schemes of a fixed exposure quantity s0 s3 and s4 fig 4b provide results under different combination of exposure duration and exposure concentration cross comparison of contaminated areas and rt95 between these exposure schemes can help optimize the scheme with minimum effects on the coastal aquifer in the perspective of the severity of contamination indicated by the contaminated area fig 12 a the minimum contaminated area for 3h is found in s2 without ocean surge 7 7 km2 and in the s0 considering ocean surge 15 9 km2 however the differences between the exposure schemes are relatively small suggesting that the contaminated area for 3h is more likely to be dominated by the total exposure quantity for 14c contamination the contaminated area increases with the increase of the exposure duration either with or without ocean surge this indicates that s4 10 yr exposure scheme with exposure concentration of 3 is the best exposure scheme to minimize the severity of 14c contamination with respect to the recovery of the contaminated aquifer indicated by the rt95 fig 12b the results show that the rt95 increases with the increase of the exposure duration for both 3h and 14c contaminations irrespective of whether or not the ocean surge occurs the fastest recovery is reached when the exposure duration is the shortest s4 despite the highest exposure concentration this means that the recovery time for the contaminated coastal aquifer is sensitive to the exposure duration when the coast is exposed to contaminated seawater in summary the long term exposure generally leads to severer radioactive contaminations and prolongs the recovery time because the exposure duration may highly depend on the human activities for example planned long term disposal of nuclear waste water from land to ocean in such situations a shorter disposal duration should be favored 3 5 limitations while the numerical model provides values of indicators such as intrusion lengths recovery time to quantify the severity of contaminant intrusion it should be pointed out that these values are based on the defined contamination criteria 1 of the 3h 14c concentration in seawater the intrusion length and recovery time describe the landward immigration and the seaward retreat of the 1 iso concentration contour apparently their values would be altered when the seawater concentration changes therefore the contaminated aquifer in this study may not be contaminated with the groundwater resource being threatened by the high radioactivity additionally by defining the contamination criteria separately for 3h and 14c the assessments were performed independently for 3h and 14c in this study this neglects the fact that 3h and 14c may co exist and both of them contribute to the radioactivity these limitations in defining the contamination criteria are simplified due to the uncertainty of the 3h and 14c concentrations prescribed to the coast however these limitations are considered to be acceptable in this study because they do not adversely affect the conclusions related to understanding the general intrusion process of radionuclides and the spatiotemporal scales of the radionuclides contamination in response to different exposure schemes which are what we focus on future research should focus on the definition of more proper contamination criteria using cross comparisons between scenarios of different exposure schemes the study investigated the sensitivity of spatial intrusion scale and recovery time to the exposure duration however this study is performed for a selected coastal aquifer with specific hydro geologic conditions such as climate topography including dyke failure event and heterogeneity while variations of these conditions may influence the intrusion and recovery processes by changing the flow and transport in the subsurface hanson and nilsson 1986 michael et al 2013 werner et al 2013 and the land surface holding and allen 2015 yu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 preliminary numerical tests showed that increasing the groundwater recharge precipitation et by 10 for scenario s0 no ocean surge results in the drops of rt95 by 1 4 1 year and 3 8 8 years for 3h and 14c respectively this echoes the previous conclusion that higher recharge accelerates the flushing of contaminants in coastal aquifer due to the upgraded dilution and mobilization effects yang et al 2018 coastal aquifers with other types of heterogeneity e g low permeability layers macropores and fractures would show different intrusion and recovery patterns because heterogeneity significantly affects the flow paths and velocities simmons et al 2001 lu et al 2013 sebben et al 2015 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 this study considered a low lying topography with a well developed drainage network on the land surface which is more likely to be less affected by the ocean surge inundation than topography with depression yu et al 2016 additionally there are some limitations in the numerical implementation i the selecting of dispersivity can result in uncertainty in the modeled intrusion length and recovery time yang et al 2018 and ii the retardation of solute transport by aquifer matrix which can potentially change the time scale of intrusion and recovery processes christensen et al 2001 was neglected in the simulations while these limitations in the numerical implementation did not alter the general trends found for the radionuclides intrusion process they need to be explored with regard to the accuracy of the modeled indicators in further research despite these limitations this study still provides for the first time the response of the spatial and temporal scales of the intrusion and recovery processes when the coast aquifer is subjected to radioactive contamination 4 conclusions seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers has been widely studied and reported however when the coast is exposed to radioactive contaminations in the ocean seawater intrusion can also result in the immigration of radioactive contaminations from the ocean into the coastal aquifer investigation to this process is still missing this study used a previously calibrated fully coupled surface subsurface model to simulate the intrusion of 3h and 14c contaminants into the 3d coastal aquifer of bremerhaven north germany scenarios of various exposure schemes with without of ocean surge extreme event were simulated the intrusion and post exposure recovery were assessed in terms of contaminated volume area and length as well as the recovery times key findings from this study are 1 with the density effect of seawater being the main driving force 14c or 3h plumes develop from the sea bed to aquifer bottom and expand landward a drainage network such as canals can promote the landward intrusion ocean surge exacerbates the intrusion of the radioactive contaminants to the aquifer by directly exposing the inland surface to the contaminations recovery may become apparent only several years 13 50 years after the termination of the exposure contaminants with higher decay rates show a harder intrusion easier recovery pattern compared to those with lower decay rates 2 the intrusion of 3h and 14c causes serious contaminations in coastal aquifer with up to 18 9 km2 land area being contaminated and reaching up to 3 3 km landward from the shore the severity of 3h and 14c contamination in the coastal aquifer generally increases with the increase of the exposure duration except when the ocean surge event is imposed the severity of 3h contamination is more likely to be dominated by the ocean surge inundation the 14c intrusion causes severer contamination due to its lower decay rate 3 this recovery process of the contaminated aquifer is slow such that the full recovery may take up to 70 years and 217 years considering 30 years exposure for 3h and 14c contamination respectively the recovery generally starts from the aquifer top to the aquifer bottom because the aquifer top is closer to the uncontaminated clean water the full recovery time quantified by the rt95 increases with the increase of exposure duration an ocean surge event does not significantly change the full recovery time suggesting that the recovery is dominated by the recovery process for subsurface intrusion 4 under a fixed exposure quantity exposure duration exposure concentration the exposure scheme with a shorter exposure time and higher exposure concentration can cause smaller contaminated area and shorter full recovery time in this sense a shorter exposure duration should be favored to minimize the influences on the coastal aquifer overall this study improves the understanding of the intrusion and recovery processes of radioactive contaminations either under normal condition or encountering extreme ocean surge event the results from this study highlight the severity of radioactive contamination and the difficulty of recovery in coastal aquifers once the coast is exposed to radioactive contamination from the ocean providing warnings for potential human activities of disposing radioactive contaminants into the ocean given the limitations of this study future work should be devoted to defining more proper contamination criteria and exposure schemes and to investigating more types of coastal aquifer credit authorship contribution statement jie

3842,human activities such as discharging nuclear wastewater into the ocean can put coasts in the risk of being exposed to radioactive contaminations the radionuclides may potentially intrude into coastal aquifers from the ocean and endanger the groundwater resources either laterally through subsurface or vertically through land surface during ocean surge induced inundation this study attempted to investigate the temporal and spatial scales of these intrusion processes using an experimental site near bremerhaven northern germany a fully coupled surface subsurface flow and transport model was employed to simulate the groundwater flow and the transport of tds total dissolved salt 3h and 14c under conditions with or without an ocean surge event scenarios of different exposure schemes were designed by varying the exposure duration and radionuclide concentrations the intrusion and post exposure recovery were assessed via contaminated volume and area intrusion length and recovery time results show that depending on exposure duration the intrusion of 3h and 14c can cause serious contamination in the coastal aquifer with up to 18 9 km2 land area being contaminated and reaching up to 3 3 km landward from the shore 3h shows a harder intrusion easier recovery pattern due to its higher decay rate the full recovery may take up to 70 years and 217 years considering 30 years exposure for 3h and 14c respectively an ocean surge event is more likely to exacerbate the intrusion but it does not significantly change the full recovery time shorter exposure duration should be favored to minimize the influences on the coastal aquifer when the total exposure quantity is fixed this study highlights the severity of radioactive contamination in coastal aquifers and the difficulty of recovery thus cautious decision should be made concerning the possible impacts of releasing radioactive wastewater on coastal life and human beings keywords coastal aquifers radionuclides ocean surge coupled surface subsurface modelling 1 introduction coastal aquifers are important sources of fresh groundwater used for agricultural domestic and industrial purposes but they are vulnerable to the intrusion of seawater containing high salinity and other contaminants werner et al 2012 since the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident in march 2011 japan a significant amount of artificial radionuclides has been discharged into the ocean behrens et al 2012 prants 2013 prants 2015 zhao et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 smith et al 2015 meanwhile japan announced its plan to release more than 1 3 million m3 of radioactive water from the fdnpp over a duration of 30 years zhao et al 2021 these accidental or planned incidents can greatly raise the risk of coasts being exposed to radioactive contamination the radionuclides intrusion may potentially pollute the groundwater resources and coastal environment ultimately jeopardizing human health iaea 2014 therefore process understanding and assessment of the effects of radioactive contamination on groundwater resources in coastal aquifers are critical for sustainable coastal management to date many studies have investigated the consequences of radionuclides release events at oceanic or global scales most studies focused on the spread and mixing of the radionuclides plumes in oceans behrens et al 2012 prants 2013 prants 2015 or in atmosphere hong et al 2012 and the associated ecological impacts lu et al 2021 for example behrens et al 2012 simulated the spreading and dilution of 137cs in the pacific ocean considering a ten year dispersal of the 137cs from the fdnpp they concluded that the main patch would reach the coasts of north american in 5 6 years zhao et al 2021 numerically investigated the transport of tritium 3h contained in the radioactive water released from the fdnpp their simulation results suggested that depending on the releasing duration the 3h plumes might either reach north american coasts in 4 5 years or be confined to the east japan region chen et al 2021 further argued that the radionuclides from the radioactive water can spread and be redistributed by the active ocean currents and eddies to the entire pacific ocean indian ocean and atlantic ocean these studies highlighted the wide redistribution of radionuclides in oceans and the associated risk of radioactive contamination in coastal areas however the further impacts of radionuclides redistribution on coastal groundwater resources have seldom been examined seawater intrusion leads to the salinization of coastal aquifers either laterally due to the presence of higher density seawater or vertically from the surface after an extreme seawater inundation event by either way seawater intrusion may degrade the fresh groundwater resources most early studies relevant to seawater intrusion considered the total dissolved salt tds as the main contaminant in the seawater werner et al 2012 while some of them simultaneously investigated the migration solutes tracers e g nitrate erostate et al 2018 cao et al 2020 boumaiza et al 2020 kwon et al 2021 isotopes erostate et al 2018 cao et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 mao et al 2020 for example colombani et al 2015 simulated the fate of a mixture of inorganic pollutants arsenic phosphate and ammonium released into a shallow coastal aquifer showing that considering tds transport is essential for building a robust conceptual model of pollutant transport in coastal aquifers although these studies considerably improved the understanding of solute transport mechanisms in coastal aquifers they all considered land sourced solutes tracers radionuclides have been extensively used as tracers in coastal aquifers cook and herczeg 2000 mainly focusing on determining the groundwater ages sivan et al 2005 turnadge and smerdon 2014 sources bouchaou et al 2008 hagedorn et al 2011 röper et al 2012 houben et al 2014 and mixing han et al 2012 for example vogel 1967 used natural radiocarbon 13c to study flow patterns and flow rates of subterranean water bodies in different regions in the netherlands post et al 2019 quantitatively analyzed the behavior of 3he and 3h in freshwater lens and transition zone of the german island langeoog they found that 3he and 3h are useful tracers for young groundwater and for studying saltwater circulation patterns respectively yechieli et al 2019 used radioactive noble gas 81kr and 39ar to measure the ages of deep saline coastal groundwater and estimate the rate of seawater intrusion however these studies focused on determining hydrogeological conditions using the radionuclides as natural environmental tracers rather than considering radionuclides as potential contaminants numerous studies have pointed out the contaminants enriched in seawater and beach sediment which can potentially be released and migrate to coastal aquifers via seawater intrusion charlet et al 2007 puthiyasekar et al 2010 venkatramanan et al 2015 villegas et al 2018 sundar et al 2021 for example venkatramanan et al 2015 carried out groundwater sampling in busan city south korea and suggested that the groundwater contamination is partially attributed to ocean sourced metals fe mn cu cd and zn sundar et al 2021 demonstrated that the high metal concentration in sediment of southernmost india beach can endanger the groundwater resource through seawater intrusion these studies highlighted the potential environmental risks of ocean sourced contaminants to coastal aquifers focusing on identifying the sources of groundwater contamination in comparison the spatiotemporal scale of the transport of ocean sourced radionuclides in coastal aquifers has received little attention and requires further investigation the hazard of surficial ocean surge inundation to coastal aquifers is well documented ocean surges deliver a large amount of seawater onto the land surface of coastal areas when the waves are sufficiently high to wash over the inland area gingerich et al 2017 subsequently the seawater infiltrates into the subsurface and salinizes the fresh groundwater kooi et al 2000 illangasekare et al 2006 giambastiani et al 2007 anderson and lauer 2008 violette et al 2009 terry and falkland 2010 yang et al 2013 holding and allen 2015 yu et al 2016 post and houben 2017 although the inundation may only last for several hours it takes a much longer time for the salinized coastal aquifers to recover as the saltwater gradually transports seaward and gets diluted chui and terry 2012 yu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the post surge recovery is affected by various factors e g land topography heterogeneity hydraulic conductivity head gradient and recharge rates bailey 2015 holding and allen 2015 yu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the recovery time varies from months terry and falkland 2010 chui and terry 2012 bailey 2015 to decades yang et al 2013 holding and allen 2015 in our previous study yang et al 2015b an extreme ocean surge inundation event on a coastal aquifer of the german bight north sea was numerically investigated it was reported that the considered ocean surge leads to seawater ponding of approximately 5 3 km2 where the groundwater is salinized for up to 20 years however these studies focused on the salinization process and its effect on groundwater resources as the frequency and intensity of ocean surge events increase due to global climate change werner et al 2013 ipcc 2014 the inland surface is likely to be directly exposed to the seawater rich in radionuclides such a direct exposure may potentially change the spatial and temporal distributions of radionuclides in coastal aquifers nonetheless to data it is unknown how the radionuclides may intrude into coastal aquifers and the spatiotemporal scale of the intrusion given the research gap this study aims to use a 3d fully coupled surface subsurface model hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 to numerically explore the intrusion of radionuclides into coastal aquifers specifically the objectives of this study are 1 to understand the intrusion mechanism of radionuclides 3h and 14c from the ocean to the coastal aquifers under different exposure schemes and with without extreme ocean surge events 2 to evaluate the spatiotemporal influences of the radionuclides intrusion via metrics such as contaminated area intrusion lengths and recovery time the results from this study are potentially important for effective water land management of coastal regions facing the risk of radioactive contaminations this study warns of the potential impacts of releasing radioactive waste water into the ocean on coastal aquifers especially for those adjacent to the release position 2 methodology 2 1 study site fig 1 shows the studied coastal aquifer near bremerhaven northern germany contacting the north sea with its west boundary the land has a total area of 108 km2 where cities ports and agriculture including livestock farming are presented the elevation of the land surface which is quantified as meters above mean sea level masl ranges from 21 2 masl at the seafloor west fig 1a to 23 7 masl at the higher land east according to the digital elevation model of 20 m resolution for lower saxony germany laser wremen 2008 supplied by lbeg lower saxony state office for mining energy and geology the precipitation and evapotranspiration et data for this area from 1961 to 2000 is available from lib 2012 the annual mean effective groundwater recharge which was calculated by subtracting the et from the precipitation yang et al 2015a yang et al 2015b varies spatially from 107 to 311 mm yr 1 on average 275 mm yr 1 an aquitard layer clay and silt was deposited since the tertiary and miocene with extremely low hydraulic conductivity nlfb 2005 it was considered as the base of the coastal aquifer such that the elevation of aquifer bottom i e top of the aquitard ranges from 70 masl to 300 masl nlfb 2003 however the part of the aquifer below 100 masl was simply excluded in this study as it is dominated by local units of clay and silt local low permeable segments inside the aquifer nlfb 2003 a dyke of 7 3 masl height protects the inland from being flooded during high tides or ocean surges the surface water is drained out from the inland to the sea via the well developed network of canals which are mostly distributed along the borders of farmland and roads the surface water in the canals can flow through the dyke to the sea via two gates there are two reasons for selecting this coastal area to investigate the intrusion of radioactive contaminants 1 it is representative of many low lying coastal aquifers with developed drainage network where seawater inundation is more likely to occur 2 the study site is subject to intense human activities e g industry agriculture and human residence and thus quite vulnerable to radioactive contamination 2 2 numerical model the intrusion processes of both seawater and radioactive contaminants into the studies coastal aquifer were simulated in this regard there are two parts of simulations performed in current study i the transport of conservative tds which affects the flow field by changing fluid properties e g density and viscosity and ii the transport of reactive decay 3h and 14c which do not affect the flow field the simulation of part i has been successfully conducted by yang et al 2015b using the calibrated numerical model hydrogeosphere which is a 3d numerical groundwater software describing fully coupled surface subsurface variably saturated variable density flow and advective dispersive diffusive salt transport therrien et al 2010 this study based on this calibrated model further performed the simulation of part ii we provide a brief review of that model in section 2 2 1 readers may refer to yang et al 2015b for a full description of the model and calibration 2 2 1 flow and tds transport fig 2 shows the 3d conceptual model of the coastal surface canal subsurface system to be simulated by hydrogeosphere the 2d surface domain in the xy plane fig 2b was discretized into a 2d mesh of 16 748 triangles with resolution ranging from 50 m near the coast to 250 m near higher inland vertically z direction the subsurface domain between the land surface and the aquifer bottom was divided into 8 layers leading to a 3d mesh consisting of 8 16 748 133 984 prismatic elements fig 2b the 2d surface flow was modeled by solving manning s equation manning 1891 and the diffusive wave approximation of the st venant equation the 3d variably saturated variable density groundwater flow was modeled by solving the richards equation and the darcy s law the transport of tds or other solutes in surface and subsurface domains was modeled by solving the advection dispersion diffusion equation the surface and subsurface domains are numerically coupled using a dual node approach this approach assumes the surface and subsurface domains are separated by a thin layer of porous media through this layer the water exchange fluxes i e infiltration to subsurface and exfiltration from subsurface can be calculated in the form of darcy s law considering the head gradient between the surface and subsurface the salt exchange fluxes can be calculated based on the water exchange fluxes given the advective transport therrien et al 2010 the canal network of was represented by the 1d canal domain which was discretized by 4 064 1d segments fig 2b water flow and salt transport in canal domain were modeled using the same equations as for the 2d surface domain a modified dual node approach was used to couple the canal domain and the subsurface domain this approach also assumes the canal bed and the subsurface domain are separated by a thin layer of porous medium between which the water and solute exchange fluxes are calculated however to calculate the exchange fluxes the head gradients across the layer were determined using an interpolate method readers may refer to yang et al 2015b for a detailed description of the approach geological information of the aquifer was supplied by lbeg lower saxony state office for mining energy and geology who conducted the hydrostratigraphic survey for the state of lower saxony and published geological profiles the hydrostratigraphic distribution shows that several layers were formed because of sea level changes and glaciations since the miocene fig 3 a nibis kartenserver 2010 these layers consist of gravel sand silt clay and organic deposit with different permeability several property zones were created in the subsurface to represent such layered heterogeneity table 1 lists the parameters for the flow and transport simulations regarding boundary conditions specific heads were prescribed to the seaside boundary a b for the subsurface domain and ao bo for the surface domain fig 2a the prescribed heads were either time variant e g during ocean surge range 0 3 88 masl or constant 0 masl depending on the sea level temporally constant but spatially variable tds concentrations in the range of 0 366 0 602 were assigned to these boundaries according to the measured data of the year 2009 note that relative tds concentrations ranging in 0 1 were used in the simulations with 0 representing freshwater of zero salinity and 1 representing seawater with the salinity of 34 24 psu practical salinity units table 1 water density was calculated using the isothermal linear density concentration relationship where density increases from 1000 to 1025 5 kg m 3 by increasing the tds concentrations from 0 to 1 sea level and salinity data for the seaside boundary were provided by the german federal waterways and shipping administration spatially variable but temporally constant groundwater recharge precipitation et was applied to the aquifer top excluding the et from the simulations while maintaining water mass balance other boundaries of the domains were set to be impermeable for water and salt as they coincide with catchment sub catchment boundaries yang et al 2015a yang et al 2015b under temporally constant boundary conditions we first ran the model until reaching a steady state of the flow and tds transport the model was calibrated for this steady state simulation using the groundwater level measurements of the year 2009 the software pest doherty and hunt 2010 was used for the calibration pest uses marquardt method marquardt 1963 to minimize a target function by varying the values of a set of parameters e g the hydraulic conductivity k and the manning roughness coefficient n for our model until optimization criterion is reached the target function was defined to measure the error between the modeled and the measured groundwater levels pest allowed the pilot points approach to estimate the spatial distributions for k and n totally 70 pilot points were used i e 70 model parameters required estimation pest s regularization methodology known as truncated singular value decomposition was employed to improve the calibration performance note that the calibration was not performed for the tds distribution because of the lack of concentration measurements in the aquifer using the simulated steady state results hydraulic heads and tds concentrations as the initial conditions the 3d model successfully simulated the seawater intrusion under a storm surge event in yang et al 2015b we continue to use it to simulate the flow and tds transport in the coastal aquifer under different scenarios of this study described later in section 2 3 2 2 2 transport of 3h and 14c in addition to the transport of tds this study also considered the transport of 3h and 14c in the studied coastal aquifer 3h and 14c were selected because they are the two most common types of radionuclides in the nuclear wastewater and their half life periods cover a wide range from 12 43 years for 3h to 5370 years for 14c the multi solutes transport scheme of hydrogeosphere allows for simulating the advective dispersive transport of tds 3h and 14c simultaneously 3h and 14c are treated as solutes that do not affect the fluid density due to their relatively low concentrations the first order decay process continuously degrades 3h and 14c in the system using dm λ m d t where the dm and m are the degraded mass and total mass of 3h or 14c at time t λ is the degradation coefficients being 1 528 10 4 day 1 and 3 536 10 7 day 1 for 3h and 14c respectively similar to the tds the ocean is considered as the unique source of 3h and 14c represented by assigning specific concentrations csea on the seaside boundaries a b and ao bo for both 3h and 14c to simplify the definition of boundary conditions relative concentration is used csea is held constant as a specific value e g 1 when the coast is exposed to the radioactive contamination of 3h and 14c for a specific time period exposure duration csea 0 is used when the exposure is terminated the exposure schemes will be described in section 2 3 the coastal system subsurface surface canal is initially assigned a zero concentration to better observe the intrusion of 3h and 14c from the seawater to the aquifer 2 3 scenario descriptions 2 3 1 exposure schemes the exposure of the studied coast to radioactive contamination can be caused by the disposal of nuclear waste from the land to the ocean either in planned human activities or in unplanned extreme events defining the exposure scheme can be challenging because the disposal pattern is uncertain specifically although the disposal of nuclear waste can be continuous and last for a considerable long time the time duration and disposal rate are highly dependent on the decision makers the challenge also lies in the complex mixing and dilution of the nuclear waste in the ocean making it difficult to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of the radioactive contamination chen et al 2021 and the concentrations of specific contaminants note that this study focuses on the intrusion of radioactive contaminants into coastal aquifers once the coast is subject to radioactive contamination rather than on the spread of radioactive contaminants in the ocean given the challenge we design three schemes with exposure durations of 30 20 and 10 years namely s0 s1 and s2 respectively fig 4 a during each exposure the relative concentrations of 3h and 14c in seawater are held constant being 1 exposure concentration csea the relative concentrations are immediately set to 0 once the exposure is terminated post exposure note that the exposure schemes neglect the fluctuations of 3h and 14c concentrations in seawater however these simplified schemes still allow for investigating how the coastal aquifer would be contaminated by exposure with different durations and how fast the contamination may retreat after the exposure the exposure scheme s0 was selected as the base exposure scheme for interpreting the intrusion processes additionally based on the scheme of s0 30 years exposure duration and csea 1 we design another two exposure schemes s3 with 20 years exposure duration and csea 1 5 and s4 with 10 years exposure duration and csea 3 fig 4b apparently s0 s3 and s4 have the same quantity of contaminants exposure duration exposure concentration cross comparison between these three exposure schemes allows for identifying the exposure scheme with minimum impact on the coastal aquifer when the quantity of contaminants is fixed 2 3 2 ocean surge inundation yang et al 2015b has simulated the ocean surge induced seawater overtopping over the dyke for the studied area using hydrogeosphere since the height of the dyke is 7 3 masl the dyke crest is quite unlikely to be overtopped by the seawater therefore a case of partial dyke failure was assumed and simulated in their study in the present study we keep using their approach to simulate the ocean surged induced overtopping inundation under the extreme case of partial dyke failure the considered ocean surge event lasted for 8 h with a maximum surge height of 3 88 masl fig 4c sea level varies according to the surge curve during the event 0 t 8 h and drops back to normal sea level of 0 masl afterwards t 8 h it is assumed that the partial dyke failure occurs at the middle part of the dyke red dot in fig 2a four hours after the onset of the ocean surge t 4 h the dyke breaks along a length of 100 m where the dyke crest is reduced from the original 7 3 masl to 2 masl the partial dyke failure is numerically represented by lowering the elevation of the grid nodes at the location of the dyke failure while preserving all the other parts of the grid without removing any cells the dyke failure causes seawater overtopping and partial inundation of the low lying inland area depending on the amount of seawater delivered subsequently tds 3h and 14c are delivered to the inland area via the land surface and infiltrate into the subsurface the possibility of the partial dyke failure in the studied area is still unclear this assumption nonetheless allowed for the possibility of investigating the effect of ocean surge inundation on intrusion recovery of radionuclides in this sense this assumption is considered to be acceptable in this study the intrusion of 3h and 14c into the coastal aquifer can be potentially exacerbated by ocean surge because both the seaside boundaries and the land surface are exposed to the radioactive contamination to understand the effects of ocean surge we define two scenarios for each exposure scheme 1 no ocean surge and 2 the ocean surge occurs at the beginning t 0 of the exposure therefore this study simulated 10 scenarios 5 exposure schemes s0 s4 2 with without ocean surge each simulation was run for 500 years to provide the aquifer with sufficient time to recover from the radioactive contamination in the post exposure stage adaptive time step scheme was used allowing the dynamic adjustment of time step during simulations therrien et al 2010 the cpu time of each simulation was about 2 days 2 4 assessment indicators 2 4 1 contamination criteria we used the concentration of 0 01 e g 1 of the 3h or 14c concentration in seawater as the threshold above which the water is regarded as contaminated by 3h or 14c this threshold is comparable to that for tds 2 which was frequently used in seawater intrusion studies werner et al 2012 based on this threshold the contaminated volume is calculated as the total volume of aquifer regions where the 3h or 14c concentration is above 0 01 the contaminated volumes of 3h and 14c equal to zero initially and evolve during the simulations the contaminated area is defined as the area of land surface beneath which contamination can be detected above 30 masl the contaminated area indicates the severity of contamination using horizontal land area the intrusion length can be estimated by measuring the horizontal distance between the contamination front and the shoreline 2 4 2 recovery time once the exposure is terminated the contaminated aquifer can potentially recover to the initial state due to decay of the contaminants seaward flushing of the contaminants by groundwater flow and dilution by fresh groundwater through recharge for a specific point in the contaminated aquifer the term recovery from 3h or 14c contamination is defined as the situation in which the 3h or 14c concentration has dropped below 0 01 this study does not access the true recovery to initial pre exposure concentrations because that situation can only be reached asymptotically following the concept of flushing time used in yu et al 2016 we adopt the concept of recovery time rt to quantify the recovery rate for a certain point in the aquifer rt is defined as the duration from the beginning of the exposure to the recovery at that point therefore rt is a spatially distributed variable and inapplicable to areas never contaminated by the radionuclides for each scenario the recovery time pdf probability density function can be calculated by counting the incidences of rt in the coastal aquifer volume fraction associated to each possible rt value the 50th and 95th percentiles rt50 rt95 of the recovery time pdf were extracted to represent the median and full recovery time respectively note that we used rt95 to approximate the full recovery time because 100 recovery may never be reached the intrusion of 3h and 14c were accessed independently using the above mentioned indicators the assessments were only performed for the land part of the aquifer area landward beyond the shoreline that is more important for human activities the aquifer underneath the sea bed beach area submerged by seawater was excluded 3 results and discussion the seawater intrusion with and without the considered ocean surge was simulated and described in yang et al 2015b as we focus on the intrusion of radionuclides in the present study we only briefly review the seawater intrusion process with respect to the flow pattern and tds transport fig 5 a demonstrates the tds distribution without ocean surge steady state note that this distribution remains unchanged regardless of the exposure schemes s0 s4 because these scenarios only affect the boundary conditions of 3h and 14c seawater intrudes into the subsurface laterally due to the presence of higher density seawater on the seaside and lower density freshwater in the subsurface fig 5a forming a classic salt water wedge a considerable part of the aquifer is already salinized flow paths show that the seawater generally infiltrates through the seaside boundary and the sea bed flows through the aquifer landward exits the aquifer to the land surface and finally returns to the sea via canals this flow circle is formed under the interplay between the variable density groundwater flow and tds transport the density effect of tds is the key factor to form such flow circle considering the occurrence of ocean surge the simulated results suggest that about 2 million m3 of seawater is delivered into the inland area through the breakpoint of the dyke during the 2 h of overtopping right after the ocean surge stops the delivered seawater has flowed as far as 3 2 km landward from the shoreline ponds of seawater have been formed on about 5 3 km2 of the inland area with an average surface water depth of 0 4 m fig 5b shows the tds distribution seven days after the onset of the ocean surge transient state it demonstrates that the ponding water infiltrates into the subsurface and causes salinization the tds plumes percolate vertically as lobe shaped instabilities towards the fresh groundwater this lateral and vertical movement of the tds plumes has been frequently reported in previous studies kooi et al 2000 illangasekare et al 2006 anderson and lauer 2008 violette et al 2009 holding and allen 2015 yu et al 2016 3 1 intrusion processes of 3h and 14c present study focuses on the development of 3h and 14c plumes that depends on the exposure duration the exposure scheme s0 fig 4a was used for interpreting the intrusion processes fig 6 a shows the distribution of 14c plumes at different times for s0 without ocean surge event once the coast is exposed to the 14c contamination at t 0 the 14c starts infiltrating into the subsurface from the sea bed after one year a plume finger develops underneath the beach area and almost reaches the aquifer bottom fig 6a 1 as the exposure continues the plume expands horizontally and vertically filling the aquifer space underneath the beach and intruding towards the inland aquifer at the end of the exposure t 30 year fig 6a 2 contamination can be detected as far as 2 5 km landward from the shoreline reaching the inland area behind the dyke after the exposure terminates the aquifer close to the sea bed recovers from the contamination firstly however the residual 14c plumes keep expanding landwards for a time period 30 year t 60 year before shrinking due to natural remediation consequently the contaminated area reaches the maximum distance of 3 9 km from the shoreline at t 60 year fig 6a 3 it can be observed that the landward expansion of the plumes mainly occurs along the canals network which acts as preferential pathways for the landwards transport of the 14c that has exfiltrated from the subsurface into the canals in this sense the canal network promotes the intrusion of 14c at t 60 year the natural remediation continuously reduces the contamination and the seaward retreat of the plumes can be observed however this process is so slow that contamination can still be detected in the inland aquifer behind the dyke after 100 years fig 6a 4 the complete recovery from the contamination may take more than 200 years fig 6a 5 considering the occurrence of ocean surge during the exposure ponds of contaminated water has been formed on the inland area the ponding seawater with 14c will eventually either flow back to the sea via the canal flow or infiltrate vertically into the subsurface post surge infiltration of ponding water leads to the development of the 14c plume starting near the aquifer top the simulated pattern of the plume development is similar to many previous studies of coastal aquifers or islands performed for salt holding and allen 2015 yu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 obviously the ocean surge exacerbates the intrusion of 14c to the aquifer by directly exposing the inland surface to the contaminants 14c plumes reach as far as 3 9 km 3 8 km and 4 1 km landward from the shoreline after 1 year 30 years and 60 years respectively fig 6b 1 2 3 because the canal network acts as preferential flow paths for the flooding water the plumes develop preferentially underneath and near the canals the natural remediation is also slow that the contamination persists in the aquifer for more than 200 years fig 6b 4 fig 7 demonstrates that the development of the 3h and 14c plumes in the coastal aquifer when the ocean surge is not included driven by the flow circle which is formed under the interplay between the variable density groundwater flow and tds transport the 3h and 14c plumes develop from the sea bed penetrate into the aquifer along the flow paths fig 7a b in this sense the density effect of seawater caused by tds is the main driving force for the intrusion of 3h and 14c via the subsurface even though the 3h and 14c themselves do not affect the fluid density 3h and 14c plumes at the end of the exposure t 30 years exhibit similar shapes fig 7a b however the concentration mass load of 3h plumes is significantly lower due to its higher decay rate for the same reason the aquifer recovers faster from 3h contamination than from 14c contamination after the exposure ceases manifested in the 0 5 km intrusion length of 3h and 1 5 km for 14c fig 7c d the comparison suggests that a reasonable harder intrusion easier recovery pattern is associated with radionuclides of higher decay rate fig 8 shows the breakthrough curves for the contaminated aquifer volume for the exposure s0 it more quantitatively confirms the aforementioned conclusions based on the plume distributions 1 14c can cause severer contamination than 3h manifested in the larger peaks of the contaminated aquifer volume 2 ocean surge event accelerates the contamination process and significant upgrades the contamination as the contaminated volumes under the ocean surge are higher than that of no ocean surge 3 times lags exist between the end of exposure and the start of the recovery which are 13 and 14 years for 3h contamination with and without surge respectively and 38 and 50 years for 14c contamination note that this start of recovery refers to the time since when the contaminated volume shows a declining trend rather than meaning that the natural remediation only occurs since that time especially for the 3h the contaminated volume already significantly decreased after the ocean surge due to faster degradation and raised again due to the lateral intrusion from the subsurface double peaks of the red dashed line fig 8 3 2 quantity of contamination the intrusion of 3h and 14c are dynamic processes with the contaminated area varying in time and intrusion length changing in space and time this study records the maximum contaminated area and the maximum intrusion length for all the simulated scenarios by cross comparing these values between the exposure schemes with equal exposure concentration s0 s1 and s2 fig 4a the severity of the contamination in the coastal aquifer in response to the exposure duration can be quantitatively analyzed for 3h contamination without ocean surge the contaminated area increases from 5 7 km2 for 10 year exposure to 7 9 km2 for 30 year exposure fig 9 a the same trend can be observed for the intrusion length fig 9b however when the ocean surge event is included the contaminated area and intrusion length keep constant at 15 9 km2 and 2 9 km regardless of the change of the exposure scheme this is because the intrusion of the 3h is dominated by the ocean surge via surface flow rather than through the subsurface such that the most serious intrusion reaches at 20 days after the onset of the ocean surge comparing the scenarios with and without ocean surge the contaminated area and intrusion length are significantly increased by the imposed ocean surge event similar trends can be observed for 14c contamination the severity of 14c contamination generally increases with the increase of the exposure duration fig 9 the contamination can cover a maximum 18 9 km2 of land area and reach maximum 3 3 km landward from the shoreline unlike 3h the contamination is sensitive to exposure duration even when the ocean surge is included this suggests that the intrusion of 14c is dominated by the intrusion through the subsurface influenced by exposure duration rather than by the imposed ocean surge event however if the exposure duration is short enough the maximum contaminated area and intrusion length would again be controlled by the ocean surge event comparing with 3h the severity of 14c contamination is higher due to its lower decay rate regardless of the exposure duration and whether or not an ocean surge event occurs 3 3 recovery rt reveals how fast the coastal aquifer recovers from the radioactive contamination after the exposure either via subsurface or via the land surface during ocean surge inundation fig 10 using given hydrogeological conditions e g topography aquifer properties for the simulations rt is only a function of the changing boundary conditions i e ocean surge with without and exposure duration the responses of rt can be quantitatively analyzed by cross comparison between exposure schemes of different durations and the same exposure concentration s0 s1 and s2 fig 4a fig 10 illustrates the spatial rt distribution in the contaminated regions of the aquifer under the exposure scheme s0 note that it does not represent the actual 3h or 14c plumes without considering ocean surge the post exposure recovery requires up to 85 years for 3h and 499 years for the 14c spatially rt increases from 30 years near the aquifer to larger values near the aquifer bottom indicating that the aquifer generally recovers from top to bottom fig 11 a b vertical this is because the aquifer top is closer to the clean uncontaminated water either from recharge or from the sea after the exposure such that dilution effect is more pronounced the aquifer under the beach zone generally recovers faster that the inland aquifer fig 10a b horizontal this is because the beach immediately contacts the clean seawater once the exposure is terminated such that the 3h 14c can be quickly diluted and transported by the infiltrated seawater when considering ocean surge along with the exposure the recovery subsequently includes 1 the recovery from the contamination caused by seawater inundation and 2 the recovery from subsurface intrusion fig 10c demonstrates a shallow region of rt 30 years where 3h contamination is caused during the ocean surge as the ocean surge is significantly shorter than the exposure duration hours compared to 30 years the recovery of 1 may be partially or even fully completed before the exposure ends for 14c the ocean surge caused contaminated regions at inland aquifer with rt ranging between 70 and 200 years fig 10d compared with the case without ocean surge the ocean surge increases the total volume of the contaminated region that undergoes recovery however it does not significantly alter the maximum rt remaining 85 years for 3h and 499 years for 14c to more accurately describe the recovery speed we calculated the rt50 and rt95 from the spatial rt distributions the two indicators allow for the cross comparison between different scenarios fig 11 note that the aquifer underneath the sea bed is excluded from the calculation of rt50 and rt95 and only the land part of the aquifer that is more vulnerable to human activities is included the simulated rt50 ranges from 15 to 61 years for 3h contamination and from 86 to 133 years for 14c contamination both increasing with the increase of exposure duration regardless of whether or not the ocean surge is imposed fig 11a rt50 of 14c are significantly higher than that of the 3h suggesting that 14c contamination is harder to clean up due to its lower decay rate ocean surge causes lower rt50 for the 3h contamination explained by the aforementioned fact that additional 3h contamination caused by ocean surge inundation recovers earlier than the contamination by subsurface intrusion it should be noted that the ocean surge is assumed to occur at the beginning of the exposure it would increase the rt50 of 3h contamination if it is imposed at a late stage of the exposure however the ocean surge event does not significantly alter the rt50 of 14c contamination fig 11b demonstrates that the rt95 ranges from 44 to 70 years for 3h contamination and from 141 years to 217 years for 14c contaminations these values can be interpreted as for example once the coast is exposed to 3h contamination at t 0 for 10 years full recovery would at the earliest be expected at t 44 years similar to rt50 rt95 is longer with a longer exposure duration and longer for 14c than for 3h an ocean surge event does not significantly change the full recovery time only slightly increasing the rt95 for 14c contamination this indicates that the full recovery is dominated by the recovery process for subsurface intrusion previous studies have frequently reported the recovery process from the salinization tds contamination caused by ocean surge inundation with recovery times ranging from 1 year to 20 years terry and falkland 2010 chui and terry 2012 chui and terry 2013 bailey 2015 holding and allen 2015 yang et al 2018 our simulated recovery times are not comparable to that range because i the previously reported recovery times are for the recovery from the salinization caused by ocean surge inundation to the initial state where intrusion of tds already naturally exists while our recovery also considered the full clean up of intruded contaminants in the subsurface ii the recovery of 3h and 14c contamination involves the degradation by decay which is not involved in the recovery from salinization however using the previously reported recovery times as references the recovery from 3h and 14c contamination would last for relatively long times of up to 133 years rt50 these recovery times have never been reported before 3 4 exposure scheme optimization the scenarios under the exposure schemes of a fixed exposure quantity s0 s3 and s4 fig 4b provide results under different combination of exposure duration and exposure concentration cross comparison of contaminated areas and rt95 between these exposure schemes can help optimize the scheme with minimum effects on the coastal aquifer in the perspective of the severity of contamination indicated by the contaminated area fig 12 a the minimum contaminated area for 3h is found in s2 without ocean surge 7 7 km2 and in the s0 considering ocean surge 15 9 km2 however the differences between the exposure schemes are relatively small suggesting that the contaminated area for 3h is more likely to be dominated by the total exposure quantity for 14c contamination the contaminated area increases with the increase of the exposure duration either with or without ocean surge this indicates that s4 10 yr exposure scheme with exposure concentration of 3 is the best exposure scheme to minimize the severity of 14c contamination with respect to the recovery of the contaminated aquifer indicated by the rt95 fig 12b the results show that the rt95 increases with the increase of the exposure duration for both 3h and 14c contaminations irrespective of whether or not the ocean surge occurs the fastest recovery is reached when the exposure duration is the shortest s4 despite the highest exposure concentration this means that the recovery time for the contaminated coastal aquifer is sensitive to the exposure duration when the coast is exposed to contaminated seawater in summary the long term exposure generally leads to severer radioactive contaminations and prolongs the recovery time because the exposure duration may highly depend on the human activities for example planned long term disposal of nuclear waste water from land to ocean in such situations a shorter disposal duration should be favored 3 5 limitations while the numerical model provides values of indicators such as intrusion lengths recovery time to quantify the severity of contaminant intrusion it should be pointed out that these values are based on the defined contamination criteria 1 of the 3h 14c concentration in seawater the intrusion length and recovery time describe the landward immigration and the seaward retreat of the 1 iso concentration contour apparently their values would be altered when the seawater concentration changes therefore the contaminated aquifer in this study may not be contaminated with the groundwater resource being threatened by the high radioactivity additionally by defining the contamination criteria separately for 3h and 14c the assessments were performed independently for 3h and 14c in this study this neglects the fact that 3h and 14c may co exist and both of them contribute to the radioactivity these limitations in defining the contamination criteria are simplified due to the uncertainty of the 3h and 14c concentrations prescribed to the coast however these limitations are considered to be acceptable in this study because they do not adversely affect the conclusions related to understanding the general intrusion process of radionuclides and the spatiotemporal scales of the radionuclides contamination in response to different exposure schemes which are what we focus on future research should focus on the definition of more proper contamination criteria using cross comparisons between scenarios of different exposure schemes the study investigated the sensitivity of spatial intrusion scale and recovery time to the exposure duration however this study is performed for a selected coastal aquifer with specific hydro geologic conditions such as climate topography including dyke failure event and heterogeneity while variations of these conditions may influence the intrusion and recovery processes by changing the flow and transport in the subsurface hanson and nilsson 1986 michael et al 2013 werner et al 2013 and the land surface holding and allen 2015 yu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 preliminary numerical tests showed that increasing the groundwater recharge precipitation et by 10 for scenario s0 no ocean surge results in the drops of rt95 by 1 4 1 year and 3 8 8 years for 3h and 14c respectively this echoes the previous conclusion that higher recharge accelerates the flushing of contaminants in coastal aquifer due to the upgraded dilution and mobilization effects yang et al 2018 coastal aquifers with other types of heterogeneity e g low permeability layers macropores and fractures would show different intrusion and recovery patterns because heterogeneity significantly affects the flow paths and velocities simmons et al 2001 lu et al 2013 sebben et al 2015 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 this study considered a low lying topography with a well developed drainage network on the land surface which is more likely to be less affected by the ocean surge inundation than topography with depression yu et al 2016 additionally there are some limitations in the numerical implementation i the selecting of dispersivity can result in uncertainty in the modeled intrusion length and recovery time yang et al 2018 and ii the retardation of solute transport by aquifer matrix which can potentially change the time scale of intrusion and recovery processes christensen et al 2001 was neglected in the simulations while these limitations in the numerical implementation did not alter the general trends found for the radionuclides intrusion process they need to be explored with regard to the accuracy of the modeled indicators in further research despite these limitations this study still provides for the first time the response of the spatial and temporal scales of the intrusion and recovery processes when the coast aquifer is subjected to radioactive contamination 4 conclusions seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers has been widely studied and reported however when the coast is exposed to radioactive contaminations in the ocean seawater intrusion can also result in the immigration of radioactive contaminations from the ocean into the coastal aquifer investigation to this process is still missing this study used a previously calibrated fully coupled surface subsurface model to simulate the intrusion of 3h and 14c contaminants into the 3d coastal aquifer of bremerhaven north germany scenarios of various exposure schemes with without of ocean surge extreme event were simulated the intrusion and post exposure recovery were assessed in terms of contaminated volume area and length as well as the recovery times key findings from this study are 1 with the density effect of seawater being the main driving force 14c or 3h plumes develop from the sea bed to aquifer bottom and expand landward a drainage network such as canals can promote the landward intrusion ocean surge exacerbates the intrusion of the radioactive contaminants to the aquifer by directly exposing the inland surface to the contaminations recovery may become apparent only several years 13 50 years after the termination of the exposure contaminants with higher decay rates show a harder intrusion easier recovery pattern compared to those with lower decay rates 2 the intrusion of 3h and 14c causes serious contaminations in coastal aquifer with up to 18 9 km2 land area being contaminated and reaching up to 3 3 km landward from the shore the severity of 3h and 14c contamination in the coastal aquifer generally increases with the increase of the exposure duration except when the ocean surge event is imposed the severity of 3h contamination is more likely to be dominated by the ocean surge inundation the 14c intrusion causes severer contamination due to its lower decay rate 3 this recovery process of the contaminated aquifer is slow such that the full recovery may take up to 70 years and 217 years considering 30 years exposure for 3h and 14c contamination respectively the recovery generally starts from the aquifer top to the aquifer bottom because the aquifer top is closer to the uncontaminated clean water the full recovery time quantified by the rt95 increases with the increase of exposure duration an ocean surge event does not significantly change the full recovery time suggesting that the recovery is dominated by the recovery process for subsurface intrusion 4 under a fixed exposure quantity exposure duration exposure concentration the exposure scheme with a shorter exposure time and higher exposure concentration can cause smaller contaminated area and shorter full recovery time in this sense a shorter exposure duration should be favored to minimize the influences on the coastal aquifer overall this study improves the understanding of the intrusion and recovery processes of radioactive contaminations either under normal condition or encountering extreme ocean surge event the results from this study highlight the severity of radioactive contamination and the difficulty of recovery in coastal aquifers once the coast is exposed to radioactive contamination from the ocean providing warnings for potential human activities of disposing radioactive contaminants into the ocean given the limitations of this study future work should be devoted to defining more proper contamination criteria and exposure schemes and to investigating more types of coastal aquifer credit authorship contribution statement jie

3843,to investigate the interacting effects of rivers curvature and gravel mining pits on rivers morphology channels with different curvatures were analyzed using a 2d 3d modelling approach implemented through the code cche2d a parameter δ the maximum channel scour depth with existence of pit minus the maximum scour depth without pit was defined as the net effect of gravel mining pits the results indicated that the net effect of a pit on the maximum scour depth from a straight channel to a channel with the curvature c l of 2 38 decreases and then increases with higher degrees of curvature the study of influential parameters showed that the cause of this event is due to the simultaneous effects of two opposing phenomena while one smoothing reduces the δ the other secondary flow increases it the reducing effect smoothing stems from the asymmetry of the flow velocity in the channel bend this causes bed deformation in a way that channel experience a gradual decrease in velocity and as a result less sediment loss furthermore the boosting effect goes back to the existence of secondary flow in the bends which grows stronger as the amount of curvature increases keywords gravel mining pits river morphology maximum scour depth 2d 1 introduction accumulation of aggregates gravels and sands on river beds creates a valuable source of materials highly important in construction and hard to ignore economically however large scale extraction of these materials from riverbeds can cause severe morphological changes which might followed by many harmful impacts the most visible impact is bed deformation creation of a pit in a riverbed would lead to changes in river flow regime and imbalance in the sediment equilibrium which can cause downstream progressive bed degradation it could also increase grade slope and instability of riverbanks luo et al 2007 in addition if the pit is deep enough it creates a cascading flow the resulting erosion can turn into a backward erosion and threaten the upstream of the pit moreover mining along rivers can divert streams to their banks and initiate eroding the problems of such fluvial erosions generated by these activities can affect properties and civil works located in the vicinity of rivers and have become a severe problem stover and montgomery 2001 in some cases degradation of the river channel can affect even the stability of bridges as in helleh river it caused up to 1 27 m at the bridge foundation zolghadr et al 2021 a variety of examples of such adverse effects of gravel mining are presented in raynov et al 1986 depending on the type of river and how construction materials are extracted braided rivers could be another consequence of the existence of gravel mining pits furthermore gravel extraction leads to the suspension of sediments in the stream which will have severe negative effects on the aquatic life and environment of the rivers asaeda and sanjaya 2017 overall gravel mining could have dramatic effects on all aspects of rivers the most important of these effects are morphological changes as the consequences can be seen kilometers downstream and upstream of the extraction site calle et al 2017 arróspide et al 2018 costea 2018 studying some cases even show that between 23 and 47 years after the end of mining the side effects have still not yet fully recovered dépret et al 2021 picco et al 2017 the impact of human activities on river systems has reached a state in which they can no longer be considered to be controlled only by natural processes of the earth but also by anthropogenic forces in many regions of world zhao et al 2020 the first way to deal with gravel mining problem in rivers is to forbid any extraction from the riverbeds the consequences of such decision would be to ignore such valuable source of materials the second method deals with it by understanding the changes and their magnitude and thus help decision makers minimizing the problems in this study the most important effect the riverbed degradation will be discussed to understand this phenomenon several approaches have been developed over the years which could be classified in three general categories the first category includes empirical formulas describing the deformation of river bed level in a cross section through time the outcome of this method is generally exponential functions or formulas of decay the coefficients in these formulas should be calibrated with observed bed level simon 1989 simon and darby 2002 simon and rinaldi 2006 rascher et al 2018 the second category consists of models based on analysis of sediment budget in river reaches this approach integrates sediment transport processes in time and space and converts them into a single number as total quantity of river bed degradation collins and dunne 1989 knuuti and mccomas 2003 zhai et al 2020 however it is worth mentioning that sediment transport for streams is exceedingly variable because sediment transport is a power function of stream flow which varies significantly from year to year and depends on sediment supply which is difficult to characterize thus an annual average sediment load might be meaningless kondolf and swanson 1993 the third category includes mathematical models based on the solution of equations of water and sediment transport mathematical physical based approaches consider gravel mining in river beds as digging a pit in the bed and using experimental analytical and numerical techniques to predict movement and deformation of the pit through river bed within the context of time and place lee et al 1993 gill 1994 boillat et al 2006 teo et al 2017 yao et al 2019 few research in mathematical analysis and experimental study of the gravel mining have been done and the most important ones can be noted as follows ahmadi 1990 worked out the problem using a one dimensional model the results shows that the allowable mining amount is a maximum of about one third or a quarter of the annual bed load and the excess will cause erosion and degradation of the river bed and water level upstream and downstream to a considerable and undesirable extent in a very important study lee fu songe composed many laboratory tests of rectangular pits using uniform deposition of material and proposed a formula to predict the changes in channel after extraction of material lee et al 1993 the purpose of this study was to investigate temporal and spatial variations of rectangular pits under the actions of different flow conditions a flume with a length of 17 m and a width of 0 6 m was used with uniform deposition of sand with an average diameter of 1 4 mm to investigate in stream sand and gravel mining operations five different pit geometries and 10 different flow conditions were chosen to perform the experiments based on the experimental results a systematic procedure with empirical formulas for prediction of the shape and migration of the pits was proposed the model was verified by the experimental data with satisfactory agreements the results showed that the maximum depth of scour decreases with increasing carrying capacity and the effective length of erosion is inversely related to carrying capacity the movement of the harvest pond can be divided into two time periods a convection period and a diffusion period the velocity of pit migration is constant in each period and increases with increasing carrying capacity and effective length and is inversely related to the depth of the pit the correlation equation between the maximum scour depth and the effective length of erosion with the shape and velocity of pits has been obtained in these studies these equations were then used to predict the size shape and migration velocity of rectangular pits gill 1994 offered an approximate theoretical solution of gravel mining pits with any regular geometric shape dug in an erosive riverbed based on the works of lee et al 1993 recently research in the field of numerical simulation using computer models have been done among them works of chen et al 2008 chen and liu 2009 and chen et al 2010 can be mentioned with the development of computers and their increasing computing power several numerical methods were developed however due to the complexity of the subject many of its aspects remain unknown in the present study an attempt has been made to address one of these lesser known aspects maximum scour depth as one of the most important problems of gravel mining pits in the interaction with the river curvature in this regard experimental data are crucial to build the model and its calibration due to the type of study that different models should be created with comparability it is impractical to use field data because of natural complexities of rivers and external influencing factors thus the most appropriate data for such a study is laboratory data respectively the best study that has been done and its data has been published is the studies of lee et al as described above therefore based on the physical model made in the studies of lee et al an accurate computer model was created and calibrated using cche2d afterwards without any changes in any other parameter different models were constructed and simulated just by changing the amount of the curvature the results of these simulations were then extracted and put together for comparison finally an attempt was made to identify the trend of changes and the reasons behind this process this paper is aimed to investigate the interacting effects of rivers curvature and gravel mining pits on rivers morphology channels with different curvatures using a 2d 3d modelling approach implemented through the code cche2d 2 materials and methods 2 1 cche2d model cche2d is a general model for two dimensional simulation and analysis of river flows dam break flows non uniform sediment transport morphologic processes coastal processes pollutant transport and water quality these processes are solved with the depth integrated reynolds equations mass transport equations sediment sorting equation bed load and bed deformation equations this model is based on efficient element method a collocation approach of the weighted residual method the numerical scheme can handle subcritical supercritical flows and their transition jia and sam 2001 suspended load transport occurs mostly at a non equilibrium state and is usually simulated by non equilibrium transport models however most of the existing sediment transport models adopt the assumption of local equilibrium when simulating bed load transport recent studies on the spatial and temporal lags of bed load transport show that the non equilibrium transport model for bed load is needed in many cases such as strong erosion and strong deposition especially under unsteady flow conditions the cche2d model implements a full non equilibrium transport model for bed material load bed load plus suspended load three different non equilibrium approaches are proposed to handle the cases where sediment transport occurs mainly as bed load mainly as suspended load or as full total load respectively jia and sam 2001 in addition the cche2d model can simulate the transport of non uniform sediment mixtures with multiple size classes which is common in natural rivers and streams several formulas for fractional non cohesive sediment transport capacity and movable bed roughness are provided so that the user can choose the most appropriate one for the specific case under study another significant improvement of the cche2d sediment transport model is the capability of simulating cohesive sediment transport two approaches are adopted for the transport of sediment with weak and strong cohesive properties jia and sam 2001 in 2009 deng chen et al compared the results of the one dimensional model hec ras and cche2d on the salt river although the results were very similar they differed in a few cases and the cche2d model showed considerable superiority hec ras showed that an incision occurs above the pits while cche2d suggested that downstream erosion would be more significant hec ras predicted a maximum bed reduction of 3 6 m for pit 1 and a distance of 2 9 m upstream of pit 2 while cche2d predicted a maximum reduction of bed level of 3 3 m in addition cche2d showed that most of the sediment deposition occurs at the upstream end of the pits and the maximum sediment accumulation was 1 7 m for pit 1 and 1 9 for pit 2 based on field observations and previous modeling studies the two dimensional model had more accurate and realistic results in flood cover heterogeneous sediment investigation and channel morphological changes chen et al 2009 2 2 calibration of cche2d model to perform analysis lee et al laboratory flume as described previously was constructed using cche mesh the result is shown in fig 1 this model is a quadrilateral mesh with grid size of 0 02 m therefore the model is divided into 850 30 sections a pit with a depth of 0 06 m and 0 76 m in length was built at the distance of 9 5 m from the beginning of the channel based on the experimental data initial conditions was set as flow discharge equal to 0 043 cms m3 s 1 primary water level equal to 0 117 m and no sediment was supplied from upstream the bedmaterial was uniform sand with a median particle size d50 of 1 4 mm based on lee et al s 1993 work the deformation and migration of an in stream mining pit can be divided into two periods the first period is from the beginning of deformation to the moment when the upstream boundary of the mining pit reaches the original downstream end of the pit the second period starts from that moment onward the first period is dominated by the convection process during which the maximum scour depth remains more or less constant spatially and temporally and the second period is dominated by the diffusion process and the maximum scour depth starts to decrease as time proceeds therefore in order to compare the maximum scour depth convection period is used and considered to be 2 h based on the experimental results chen et al 2010 examined the non equilibrium adaptation parameters of a depth averaged two dimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport model through comparison with measured data of lee et al 1993 experiments on mining pit migration simulation time step of 10 s and the grid size of 0 02 m were considered to be appropriate in this study based on the sensitivity analysis of the research mentioned grid size is chosen to be 0 02 m and the non equilibrium adaptation parameter of 0 02 m is used chen et al 2010 the mixing length turbulence model was used to calculate the flow turbulence and the van rinn formula b1984 was used to calculate the bed roughness jia and sam 2001 among several formulas for calculating non cohesive sediment transport that have been published in recent decades four formulas have been selected by reviewing and evaluating extensive research in this field computational capabilities and experiments with abundant laboratory and field data for use in the cche2d model these formulas include the modified ackers and white 1983 the sedtra module 1995 presented by garbrecht and kuhnle and also the formula of wu wang and jia 2000 and the formula of englund and hans 1967 jia and sam 2001 these formulas along with karim 1998 and zhang modified formulas 1992 were tested in the technical guide of cche2d software with brownley data for homogeneous bed and bed load and toffaletti data for inhomogeneous bed the results testify to the superiority of wu et al formula in the vast majority of experiments so it is chosen as the method of calculating sediment transport jia and sam 2001 the minimum dry water depth is considered to be 2 mm which never occurred during the whole simulation process even assuming a minimum depth of 2 cm it did not occur flow3d flow science inc 2007 is a cfd software that employs numerical techniques to solve the fluid motion equations to obtain transient three dimensional solutions to multi scale multi physics flow problems in which computational fluid dynamics cfd methods are always used for the simulation of flow process by discretization and solving of navier stokes and continuity equations for the computational cells an array of physical and numerical options allows users to apply flow3d to a wide variety of fluid flows and heat transfer phenomena ghasemi and soltani gerdefaramarzi 2017 for better comparison different models of experiments were constructed by flow3d software and calibrated with laboratory data the best results were obtained with peter meyer sediment equation rng turbulence equation and 2 cm mesh size as shown in fig 2 bed deformation and displacement of the maximum scour depth by cche2d model is compared to experimental data and flow3d results at first glance three cases are clearly recognizable first bed changes upstream of the pit including pre pit bed elevation and upstream wall slope are well consistent with experimental data in this regard the most important point mentioned in lee et al s study is the 12 degree angle of the upstream wall where the model was good at simulating and even the results are slightly better than flow3d model results the simulation is well matched with experimental data except for the height of the upstream edge which is calculated more than experimental data although this is of little importance as this study deals with the maximum scour depth second the position and depth of scouring are calculated slightly better than flow3d model and finally the downstream wall of the hole is reasonably estimated although like the flow3d model with some error in the following goodness to fit of simulation results is compared with experimental data by different parameters the goodness of fit between computed and measured bed elevations were evaluated by three statistical parameters including the bias the average geometric deviation agd and the root mean square rms each parameter provides a measure of the goodness of fit between the computed and measured bed elevations from a slightly different perspective they are described as follows 2 2 1 bias 1 bias j 1 j z cj z mj j where zc and zm computed and measured bed elevations respectively and j data set number the bias with a unit of centimeter in the study represents the arithmetic mean of the difference between computed and experimental bed elevations a positive value of bias is produced when the calculated bed elevations are generally higher than the observed conditions 2 2 2 agd agd j 1 j r r j 1 j 2 r r j z mj z cj z cj z mj z cj z mj z cj z mj the dimensionless parameter agd represents the geometrical mean of the special discrepancy ratio rrj 2 2 3 rms 3 rms j 1 j z cj z mj 2 j 0 5 the root mean square represents the quadratic mean of the difference between the computed bed elevations and the measured values rms is especially useful when deviations are both positive and negative such as overestimation and underestimation of bed deformation in the current calculation rms has a unit of centimeter in this study these three statistical parameters bias agd and rms provide a comprehensive evaluation of the goodness of fit between the computed and measured bed elevation as can be seen from the comparison results of these parameters in table 1 the accuracy of cche2d model in simulation is close to the flow3d results and in some cases it is even better in general it can be concluded that the cche2d model has been properly and accurately simulated bed changes 2 3 construction of new models in order to compare the effect of curvature on gravel mining pits different models with different curvature had to be constructed so lee et al 1993 flume was modeled with different curvature all the model parameters such as length width slope soil type gravel mining pit dimensions flow and etc remained unchanged in the new model and the only difference in the new models was the channel curvature as a criterion for the degree of curvature parameter c l was chosen that is a suitable indicator of the degree of curvature sinuosity within which c is the arc length and l is the horizontal distance between the beginning and the end of the arc the higher the c l the sharper the curve and with c l equals to 1 the channel could be direct as of lee et al model in addition another parameter called curvature w r defined as dividing the channel width w by the radius of the arc r is considered alongside sinuosity to complete the understanding of the situation for this purpose using autocad software a plan of each model with c 17 m and desired l was created then by entering it in cche mesh height values were added to it to create the slope and pit in this research 6 new models with different c l were constructed and were analyzed table 2 all the selected parameters and methods mentioned in the modeling section of lee et al hereinafter referred to as the direct model are also applied to the new models the only item added to the new simulations is the placement of the curvature effect fig 3 3 results 3 1 results from simulations cche2d result files include many two dimensional parameters and many aspects of a hydraulic event could be analyzed to a great extent such as velocity shear stress and eddy viscosity it is worth noting that since the cche2d as a depth integrated model has no knowledge of the secondary flow an experimental or semi analytical approximation of the secondary flow is included in the software to predict the bed load movement in curved channels the most influential parameter with this regard is the angle between the direction of the main flow and the shear stress near the bed in the current model it is approximated by the englund 1974 relation 4 tan σ 7 h r where h is flow depth and r is the radius of curvature of the longitudinal line of the grid the formula error is 3 according to englund 1974 gravity forces the moving particle to move downward in the direction of the transverse slope in a curved channel the secondary flow tends to move against the transverse slope when the two effects neutralize each other equilibrium is established and the sediment particles begin to move in the main direction of the flow which is in the longitudinal direction altogether giving an average width of 0 6 value taken from lee et al 1993 and the secondary flow effect will be considered in the simulation another point is that although in the straight model symmetric shape the middle longitudinal line can be selected as a representative of the bed deformation in the curved models since the changes are three dimensional and asymmetric such a profile would only display one section and direction thus the profile would not represent all the changes with regard to channel bed to solve this problem longitudinal lines were selected from the beginning middle and end of the channel width respectively to display the general status of the deformation profile simulation results of the model number 2 with c l 1 09 are presented in fig 4 fig 5 and fig 6 the first step in understanding such complex processes is to classify the results to begin with as deformation of the bed is the most important parameter to be discussed considering the purpose of this research a qualitative comparison of bed deformation could be explanatory which is described as follows chief among the effects of morphological parameters the maximum scour depth could be pointed out as mining pits most destructive impact on their surrounding area therefore this parameter is chosen to be a representative of channels bed deformations from the straight channel to channel with high curvature the maximum scour depth position moves from the center of the channel to the outer wall while sedimentation occurs close to the inner wall moreover as can be seen from the results the maximum scour depth always increases from the straight channel to the channel with high curvature considering that this will happen regardless of existing of a pit the observed trend should be re evaluated as increase in velocity at outer wall of the bend would lead to outer wall bed degradation and sediment deposition at the inner wall vice versa according to the mentioned problem the cases with and without pit effect are separately considered in order to separate the pit effect a parameter δ was defined as the maximum scour depth with existence of the pit minus the maximum scour depth without existence of the pit thus the net effect of pit could be studied to build new models without pits the elevations of pits in the previous models were eliminated the fig 7 is an example of these models before and after the changes to obtain values of δ the modified models were simulated for the same 2 h the results are shown in the table 3 and fig 8 notable in the table 3 and fig 8 there are two wings of decreasing and increasing δ and a minimum at the c l 2 38 the following formula can be fitted to the results with the correlation factor of 0 91 5 δ 33 69 c l 2 158 9 c l 190 09 to explain this diagram fig 8 it can be argued that in the cases of direct channel to the channel with light curve the net effect of channel δ reduced such that for channel with c l about 2 38 this effect reduces to almost zero this means that there seems to be no pit effect on the maximum scour depth in channel with c l 2 38 after this point with increase in c l δ increases 3 2 analysis of results to understand why with sharper bends up to c l 2 38 the pit net effect on maximum scour depth gradually decreases and beyond this value gradually increases all important influential parameters are determined and classified the only difference between these models is the magnitude of the curvature so the models based o the curvature degree were classified into 3 categories table 4 when water flows over a mining pit flow separation occurs and eddy rollers are developed causing receding erosion meanwhile sediment brought from upstream is trapped in the pit and causes migration of the upstream end at the downstream end of the pit the dividing streamline veers away from the channel bed and another separation zone is formed at the region close to the downstream separation zone flow accelerates due to the sudden contraction of the channel cross sectional area causing local erosion thus the pit starts to migrate and deform lee et al 1993 in curved channels the events that occur in the direct channel are still happening with slightly differences back to morphology differences these differences can be outlined as follows 1 asymmetry in lateral velocity due to curvature 2 secondary flow in bends 3 more scouring at the outer wall of the bend due to the increased velocity and the secondary flow and more sedimentation in the inner wall of the bend due to the reduced flow velocity and the secondary flow and the disappearance of morphology symmetry of the bed over time laterally in the fig 9 the loss of symmetry of the cross sections is clearly visible the above information can be summarized as in the table 5 these parameters can be used to explain the behavior of the phenomena described in the previous sections one of the most important influences of mining pits on flow and sediment transport is the sudden increase and decrease in the flow depth of in the bend however the process is slightly different firstly a sudden increase in depth is seen and everything is the same as the direct channel then asymmetry of velocity and the secondary flow due to channel bend cause more scour in the outer wall and more sedimentation in the inner wall which leads to more moderate angle adjustment of pit at the upstream head near outer wall as it portrayed in fig 9 thus the flow is longitudinally adjusted and the pit is gradually deformed so the sudden decrease of depth becomes less effective and weaker at this state flow faces smaller velocity slowdown at the upstream of pit and slower velocity rising up at the downstream therefore as a result of this gradual change in velocity instead of a sudden change the sediment loss becomes less and scour at the downstream head of pit will be less than direct channel theoretically speaking for a fluid to begin transporting sediment that is currently at rest on a surface the boundary or bed shear stress τ b exerted by the fluid must exceed the critical shear stress τ c for the initiation of motion of grains at the bed for a newtonian fluid the shear stress at a surface element parallel to a flat plate at the point y is given by 6 τ y μ u y where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the flow u is the flow velocity along the boundary and y is the height above the boundary the higher the shear stress on the bed the more particles start to move and separate from it resulting in more erosion as can be seen from the shear stress equation the amount of shear stress is directly related to the flow velocity and therefore it can be concluded that the higher the velocity the higher the shear stress to clarify further three models for straight channels were constructed based on lee et al s experiment in the flow3d model and simulated under the same conditions the results of these simulations are shown in fig 10 as can be clearly seen the rate of flow velocity in contact with the bed downstream the pit where scouring happens has been reduced from the model with the vertical wall to the model with the smoother wall this maybe confirm the smoothing effect in other words in the simulation with direct channel after 2 h it was observed that the 90 angle between the upstream head of pit and the bed did not change much and the sudden change of the depth continued during the simulation however when the channel is curved it is seen that rough angles of the upstream and downstream heads decreased gradually which made the sudden change of depth lesser to make the discussion easier hereafter this phenomenon is called smoothing with sharper curvature smoothing happens faster and gets softer thus reductions in pit net effect on the maximum scour depth is expected the process proceeds to c l 2 38 at this point the net effect of pit on maximum scour depth will reduce to almost zero on the other hand secondary flow gets stronger for channels with higher curvatures and creates the increasing wing of δ c l diagram secondary flow tends to remove material from the bed and increase the scour depth in the outer wall secondary flow is strongly dependent on two parameters curvature degree and flow depth as mentioned with increase in the curvature degree c l and thus reduction in the radius of the arc the secondary flow becomes stronger it is clear that creation of mining pits by removal of material increases the flow depth in the channel and this would intensifies secondary flow strength compared to channels without pits in fact these two phenomena act against each other smoothing reduces the net effect of pits on maximum scour depth and the secondary flow increases it the simulation results indicate that from direct channel to the channel with c l 2 38 smoothing effect is more powerful than the weak secondary flow effect due to moderate curvature of channel bend thus reducing the effect of mining pit on maximum scour depth happens and the reducing wing of δ c l diagram occurs the point c l 2 38 is the point at which the strength of two phenomena balance each other in a way that it seems there is no pit or it has no effect on the maximum scour depth with increasing c l and consequently depth increase the intensity of the secondary flow increases such that the effect of mining pit on maximum scour depth will increase and make the raising wing of the δ c l diagram 4 conclusions gravel mining has always been extremely important due to the rich resources of construction materials this issue has profound impacts on rivers and their intersecting structures one of the most important of which is the bed degradation moreover it is crucial to consider that rivers are not usually straight and are generally flow a sinuous trial in this study an attempt has been made to investigate and understand the interaction between gravel mining pits and river curvature regarding river bed degradation to investigate the interacting effects of river curvature and gravel mining pits on rivers morphology models of a channel with different curvatures from a direct channel to a channel with high degree of curvature were constructed using the a 2d model and the results of the simulations were analyzed morphological study of river beds is a challenge due to the large amount of data produced by a 2d model and it would be extremely difficult to discover the pattern of changes therefore it was decided to focus the morphological effects on a single parameter by choosing the maximum scour depth as the most destructive morphological effect comparison has become much understandable i e while enjoy the high accuracy of the results due to the two dimensional simulation by focusing the results on this parameter comparison became more mathematical and quantitative than qualitative and descriptive examination of the results showed that from the direct channel to the channel with higher degree of curvature the maximum scour depth moves from the center of the cross section toward the outer wall and maximum deposition elevation moves toward the inner wall in addition moving of the maximum scour depth along the channel downstream is visible as can be seen from the results the maximum scour depth is almost always increased however it is clear that a curved channel without a pit will also have more degradation than a straight channel and that is due to the increase in velocity at the outer wall of the bend therefore the effect of the mining pit is isolated and investigated separately for this purpose a parameter called δ was defined which was considered equal to the maximum scour depth with the gravel mining pit minus the maximum scour depth without it changes in δ as the net effect of mining pit in maximum scour depth could be described in three parts a reducing wing an extremum and an increasing wing increasing the curvature the value of δ from direct channel to channel with light curvature of c l 2 38 is decreased at this point δ is eventually close to zero which in another word means that there are no difference in maximum scour depth between a channel with a pit and a channel without a pit at this curvature degree afterwards the increasing wing of δ c l diagram is formed inspection of the influent parameters showed that the event is due to two simultaneous phenomena decreasing phenomenon which is called smoothing is an effect of both asymmetry in channel shape and flow velocity which gradually changes the sudden increase and decrease of depth the pit effect to a smoother edge and cause the mining pit effect on maximum scour depth to decrease with sharper curvatures smoothing happens faster and gets softer therefore the pit net effect on the maximum scour depth is expected to mitigate further by increasing the curvature the secondary flow becomes stronger and consequently intensifies the net pit effect on maximum scour depth after a certain point c l 2 38 in which the effect of the both phenomena smoothing and secondary flow is in balance the secondary flow effect which resonates the net pit effect on maximum scour depth will take the lead by curvature increased finally as described in the previous sections there are several methods to understand and deal with the effects of gravel mining pit effects on rivers and their associated structures one of the most popular and widely used methods is the macroscopic view which usually examines the extraction of materials in the form of sediment budgets on the entire river ecosystem these methods have their own merits and are certainly very useful in their place however the results of the present study clearly show that the microscopic perspective on the issue of material withdrawal from rivers is also extremely important clearly as the results showed the location of the gravel mining pits along the river can intensify the bed degradation depth or move it to a great extent overall it seems that by combining these two perspectives and completing knowledge in both sectors we could have the most appropriate understanding of this phenomenon and adopt the best strategies to manage and reduce its impacts credit authorship contribution statement abedin mohammad

3843,to investigate the interacting effects of rivers curvature and gravel mining pits on rivers morphology channels with different curvatures were analyzed using a 2d 3d modelling approach implemented through the code cche2d a parameter δ the maximum channel scour depth with existence of pit minus the maximum scour depth without pit was defined as the net effect of gravel mining pits the results indicated that the net effect of a pit on the maximum scour depth from a straight channel to a channel with the curvature c l of 2 38 decreases and then increases with higher degrees of curvature the study of influential parameters showed that the cause of this event is due to the simultaneous effects of two opposing phenomena while one smoothing reduces the δ the other secondary flow increases it the reducing effect smoothing stems from the asymmetry of the flow velocity in the channel bend this causes bed deformation in a way that channel experience a gradual decrease in velocity and as a result less sediment loss furthermore the boosting effect goes back to the existence of secondary flow in the bends which grows stronger as the amount of curvature increases keywords gravel mining pits river morphology maximum scour depth 2d 1 introduction accumulation of aggregates gravels and sands on river beds creates a valuable source of materials highly important in construction and hard to ignore economically however large scale extraction of these materials from riverbeds can cause severe morphological changes which might followed by many harmful impacts the most visible impact is bed deformation creation of a pit in a riverbed would lead to changes in river flow regime and imbalance in the sediment equilibrium which can cause downstream progressive bed degradation it could also increase grade slope and instability of riverbanks luo et al 2007 in addition if the pit is deep enough it creates a cascading flow the resulting erosion can turn into a backward erosion and threaten the upstream of the pit moreover mining along rivers can divert streams to their banks and initiate eroding the problems of such fluvial erosions generated by these activities can affect properties and civil works located in the vicinity of rivers and have become a severe problem stover and montgomery 2001 in some cases degradation of the river channel can affect even the stability of bridges as in helleh river it caused up to 1 27 m at the bridge foundation zolghadr et al 2021 a variety of examples of such adverse effects of gravel mining are presented in raynov et al 1986 depending on the type of river and how construction materials are extracted braided rivers could be another consequence of the existence of gravel mining pits furthermore gravel extraction leads to the suspension of sediments in the stream which will have severe negative effects on the aquatic life and environment of the rivers asaeda and sanjaya 2017 overall gravel mining could have dramatic effects on all aspects of rivers the most important of these effects are morphological changes as the consequences can be seen kilometers downstream and upstream of the extraction site calle et al 2017 arróspide et al 2018 costea 2018 studying some cases even show that between 23 and 47 years after the end of mining the side effects have still not yet fully recovered dépret et al 2021 picco et al 2017 the impact of human activities on river systems has reached a state in which they can no longer be considered to be controlled only by natural processes of the earth but also by anthropogenic forces in many regions of world zhao et al 2020 the first way to deal with gravel mining problem in rivers is to forbid any extraction from the riverbeds the consequences of such decision would be to ignore such valuable source of materials the second method deals with it by understanding the changes and their magnitude and thus help decision makers minimizing the problems in this study the most important effect the riverbed degradation will be discussed to understand this phenomenon several approaches have been developed over the years which could be classified in three general categories the first category includes empirical formulas describing the deformation of river bed level in a cross section through time the outcome of this method is generally exponential functions or formulas of decay the coefficients in these formulas should be calibrated with observed bed level simon 1989 simon and darby 2002 simon and rinaldi 2006 rascher et al 2018 the second category consists of models based on analysis of sediment budget in river reaches this approach integrates sediment transport processes in time and space and converts them into a single number as total quantity of river bed degradation collins and dunne 1989 knuuti and mccomas 2003 zhai et al 2020 however it is worth mentioning that sediment transport for streams is exceedingly variable because sediment transport is a power function of stream flow which varies significantly from year to year and depends on sediment supply which is difficult to characterize thus an annual average sediment load might be meaningless kondolf and swanson 1993 the third category includes mathematical models based on the solution of equations of water and sediment transport mathematical physical based approaches consider gravel mining in river beds as digging a pit in the bed and using experimental analytical and numerical techniques to predict movement and deformation of the pit through river bed within the context of time and place lee et al 1993 gill 1994 boillat et al 2006 teo et al 2017 yao et al 2019 few research in mathematical analysis and experimental study of the gravel mining have been done and the most important ones can be noted as follows ahmadi 1990 worked out the problem using a one dimensional model the results shows that the allowable mining amount is a maximum of about one third or a quarter of the annual bed load and the excess will cause erosion and degradation of the river bed and water level upstream and downstream to a considerable and undesirable extent in a very important study lee fu songe composed many laboratory tests of rectangular pits using uniform deposition of material and proposed a formula to predict the changes in channel after extraction of material lee et al 1993 the purpose of this study was to investigate temporal and spatial variations of rectangular pits under the actions of different flow conditions a flume with a length of 17 m and a width of 0 6 m was used with uniform deposition of sand with an average diameter of 1 4 mm to investigate in stream sand and gravel mining operations five different pit geometries and 10 different flow conditions were chosen to perform the experiments based on the experimental results a systematic procedure with empirical formulas for prediction of the shape and migration of the pits was proposed the model was verified by the experimental data with satisfactory agreements the results showed that the maximum depth of scour decreases with increasing carrying capacity and the effective length of erosion is inversely related to carrying capacity the movement of the harvest pond can be divided into two time periods a convection period and a diffusion period the velocity of pit migration is constant in each period and increases with increasing carrying capacity and effective length and is inversely related to the depth of the pit the correlation equation between the maximum scour depth and the effective length of erosion with the shape and velocity of pits has been obtained in these studies these equations were then used to predict the size shape and migration velocity of rectangular pits gill 1994 offered an approximate theoretical solution of gravel mining pits with any regular geometric shape dug in an erosive riverbed based on the works of lee et al 1993 recently research in the field of numerical simulation using computer models have been done among them works of chen et al 2008 chen and liu 2009 and chen et al 2010 can be mentioned with the development of computers and their increasing computing power several numerical methods were developed however due to the complexity of the subject many of its aspects remain unknown in the present study an attempt has been made to address one of these lesser known aspects maximum scour depth as one of the most important problems of gravel mining pits in the interaction with the river curvature in this regard experimental data are crucial to build the model and its calibration due to the type of study that different models should be created with comparability it is impractical to use field data because of natural complexities of rivers and external influencing factors thus the most appropriate data for such a study is laboratory data respectively the best study that has been done and its data has been published is the studies of lee et al as described above therefore based on the physical model made in the studies of lee et al an accurate computer model was created and calibrated using cche2d afterwards without any changes in any other parameter different models were constructed and simulated just by changing the amount of the curvature the results of these simulations were then extracted and put together for comparison finally an attempt was made to identify the trend of changes and the reasons behind this process this paper is aimed to investigate the interacting effects of rivers curvature and gravel mining pits on rivers morphology channels with different curvatures using a 2d 3d modelling approach implemented through the code cche2d 2 materials and methods 2 1 cche2d model cche2d is a general model for two dimensional simulation and analysis of river flows dam break flows non uniform sediment transport morphologic processes coastal processes pollutant transport and water quality these processes are solved with the depth integrated reynolds equations mass transport equations sediment sorting equation bed load and bed deformation equations this model is based on efficient element method a collocation approach of the weighted residual method the numerical scheme can handle subcritical supercritical flows and their transition jia and sam 2001 suspended load transport occurs mostly at a non equilibrium state and is usually simulated by non equilibrium transport models however most of the existing sediment transport models adopt the assumption of local equilibrium when simulating bed load transport recent studies on the spatial and temporal lags of bed load transport show that the non equilibrium transport model for bed load is needed in many cases such as strong erosion and strong deposition especially under unsteady flow conditions the cche2d model implements a full non equilibrium transport model for bed material load bed load plus suspended load three different non equilibrium approaches are proposed to handle the cases where sediment transport occurs mainly as bed load mainly as suspended load or as full total load respectively jia and sam 2001 in addition the cche2d model can simulate the transport of non uniform sediment mixtures with multiple size classes which is common in natural rivers and streams several formulas for fractional non cohesive sediment transport capacity and movable bed roughness are provided so that the user can choose the most appropriate one for the specific case under study another significant improvement of the cche2d sediment transport model is the capability of simulating cohesive sediment transport two approaches are adopted for the transport of sediment with weak and strong cohesive properties jia and sam 2001 in 2009 deng chen et al compared the results of the one dimensional model hec ras and cche2d on the salt river although the results were very similar they differed in a few cases and the cche2d model showed considerable superiority hec ras showed that an incision occurs above the pits while cche2d suggested that downstream erosion would be more significant hec ras predicted a maximum bed reduction of 3 6 m for pit 1 and a distance of 2 9 m upstream of pit 2 while cche2d predicted a maximum reduction of bed level of 3 3 m in addition cche2d showed that most of the sediment deposition occurs at the upstream end of the pits and the maximum sediment accumulation was 1 7 m for pit 1 and 1 9 for pit 2 based on field observations and previous modeling studies the two dimensional model had more accurate and realistic results in flood cover heterogeneous sediment investigation and channel morphological changes chen et al 2009 2 2 calibration of cche2d model to perform analysis lee et al laboratory flume as described previously was constructed using cche mesh the result is shown in fig 1 this model is a quadrilateral mesh with grid size of 0 02 m therefore the model is divided into 850 30 sections a pit with a depth of 0 06 m and 0 76 m in length was built at the distance of 9 5 m from the beginning of the channel based on the experimental data initial conditions was set as flow discharge equal to 0 043 cms m3 s 1 primary water level equal to 0 117 m and no sediment was supplied from upstream the bedmaterial was uniform sand with a median particle size d50 of 1 4 mm based on lee et al s 1993 work the deformation and migration of an in stream mining pit can be divided into two periods the first period is from the beginning of deformation to the moment when the upstream boundary of the mining pit reaches the original downstream end of the pit the second period starts from that moment onward the first period is dominated by the convection process during which the maximum scour depth remains more or less constant spatially and temporally and the second period is dominated by the diffusion process and the maximum scour depth starts to decrease as time proceeds therefore in order to compare the maximum scour depth convection period is used and considered to be 2 h based on the experimental results chen et al 2010 examined the non equilibrium adaptation parameters of a depth averaged two dimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport model through comparison with measured data of lee et al 1993 experiments on mining pit migration simulation time step of 10 s and the grid size of 0 02 m were considered to be appropriate in this study based on the sensitivity analysis of the research mentioned grid size is chosen to be 0 02 m and the non equilibrium adaptation parameter of 0 02 m is used chen et al 2010 the mixing length turbulence model was used to calculate the flow turbulence and the van rinn formula b1984 was used to calculate the bed roughness jia and sam 2001 among several formulas for calculating non cohesive sediment transport that have been published in recent decades four formulas have been selected by reviewing and evaluating extensive research in this field computational capabilities and experiments with abundant laboratory and field data for use in the cche2d model these formulas include the modified ackers and white 1983 the sedtra module 1995 presented by garbrecht and kuhnle and also the formula of wu wang and jia 2000 and the formula of englund and hans 1967 jia and sam 2001 these formulas along with karim 1998 and zhang modified formulas 1992 were tested in the technical guide of cche2d software with brownley data for homogeneous bed and bed load and toffaletti data for inhomogeneous bed the results testify to the superiority of wu et al formula in the vast majority of experiments so it is chosen as the method of calculating sediment transport jia and sam 2001 the minimum dry water depth is considered to be 2 mm which never occurred during the whole simulation process even assuming a minimum depth of 2 cm it did not occur flow3d flow science inc 2007 is a cfd software that employs numerical techniques to solve the fluid motion equations to obtain transient three dimensional solutions to multi scale multi physics flow problems in which computational fluid dynamics cfd methods are always used for the simulation of flow process by discretization and solving of navier stokes and continuity equations for the computational cells an array of physical and numerical options allows users to apply flow3d to a wide variety of fluid flows and heat transfer phenomena ghasemi and soltani gerdefaramarzi 2017 for better comparison different models of experiments were constructed by flow3d software and calibrated with laboratory data the best results were obtained with peter meyer sediment equation rng turbulence equation and 2 cm mesh size as shown in fig 2 bed deformation and displacement of the maximum scour depth by cche2d model is compared to experimental data and flow3d results at first glance three cases are clearly recognizable first bed changes upstream of the pit including pre pit bed elevation and upstream wall slope are well consistent with experimental data in this regard the most important point mentioned in lee et al s study is the 12 degree angle of the upstream wall where the model was good at simulating and even the results are slightly better than flow3d model results the simulation is well matched with experimental data except for the height of the upstream edge which is calculated more than experimental data although this is of little importance as this study deals with the maximum scour depth second the position and depth of scouring are calculated slightly better than flow3d model and finally the downstream wall of the hole is reasonably estimated although like the flow3d model with some error in the following goodness to fit of simulation results is compared with experimental data by different parameters the goodness of fit between computed and measured bed elevations were evaluated by three statistical parameters including the bias the average geometric deviation agd and the root mean square rms each parameter provides a measure of the goodness of fit between the computed and measured bed elevations from a slightly different perspective they are described as follows 2 2 1 bias 1 bias j 1 j z cj z mj j where zc and zm computed and measured bed elevations respectively and j data set number the bias with a unit of centimeter in the study represents the arithmetic mean of the difference between computed and experimental bed elevations a positive value of bias is produced when the calculated bed elevations are generally higher than the observed conditions 2 2 2 agd agd j 1 j r r j 1 j 2 r r j z mj z cj z cj z mj z cj z mj z cj z mj the dimensionless parameter agd represents the geometrical mean of the special discrepancy ratio rrj 2 2 3 rms 3 rms j 1 j z cj z mj 2 j 0 5 the root mean square represents the quadratic mean of the difference between the computed bed elevations and the measured values rms is especially useful when deviations are both positive and negative such as overestimation and underestimation of bed deformation in the current calculation rms has a unit of centimeter in this study these three statistical parameters bias agd and rms provide a comprehensive evaluation of the goodness of fit between the computed and measured bed elevation as can be seen from the comparison results of these parameters in table 1 the accuracy of cche2d model in simulation is close to the flow3d results and in some cases it is even better in general it can be concluded that the cche2d model has been properly and accurately simulated bed changes 2 3 construction of new models in order to compare the effect of curvature on gravel mining pits different models with different curvature had to be constructed so lee et al 1993 flume was modeled with different curvature all the model parameters such as length width slope soil type gravel mining pit dimensions flow and etc remained unchanged in the new model and the only difference in the new models was the channel curvature as a criterion for the degree of curvature parameter c l was chosen that is a suitable indicator of the degree of curvature sinuosity within which c is the arc length and l is the horizontal distance between the beginning and the end of the arc the higher the c l the sharper the curve and with c l equals to 1 the channel could be direct as of lee et al model in addition another parameter called curvature w r defined as dividing the channel width w by the radius of the arc r is considered alongside sinuosity to complete the understanding of the situation for this purpose using autocad software a plan of each model with c 17 m and desired l was created then by entering it in cche mesh height values were added to it to create the slope and pit in this research 6 new models with different c l were constructed and were analyzed table 2 all the selected parameters and methods mentioned in the modeling section of lee et al hereinafter referred to as the direct model are also applied to the new models the only item added to the new simulations is the placement of the curvature effect fig 3 3 results 3 1 results from simulations cche2d result files include many two dimensional parameters and many aspects of a hydraulic event could be analyzed to a great extent such as velocity shear stress and eddy viscosity it is worth noting that since the cche2d as a depth integrated model has no knowledge of the secondary flow an experimental or semi analytical approximation of the secondary flow is included in the software to predict the bed load movement in curved channels the most influential parameter with this regard is the angle between the direction of the main flow and the shear stress near the bed in the current model it is approximated by the englund 1974 relation 4 tan σ 7 h r where h is flow depth and r is the radius of curvature of the longitudinal line of the grid the formula error is 3 according to englund 1974 gravity forces the moving particle to move downward in the direction of the transverse slope in a curved channel the secondary flow tends to move against the transverse slope when the two effects neutralize each other equilibrium is established and the sediment particles begin to move in the main direction of the flow which is in the longitudinal direction altogether giving an average width of 0 6 value taken from lee et al 1993 and the secondary flow effect will be considered in the simulation another point is that although in the straight model symmetric shape the middle longitudinal line can be selected as a representative of the bed deformation in the curved models since the changes are three dimensional and asymmetric such a profile would only display one section and direction thus the profile would not represent all the changes with regard to channel bed to solve this problem longitudinal lines were selected from the beginning middle and end of the channel width respectively to display the general status of the deformation profile simulation results of the model number 2 with c l 1 09 are presented in fig 4 fig 5 and fig 6 the first step in understanding such complex processes is to classify the results to begin with as deformation of the bed is the most important parameter to be discussed considering the purpose of this research a qualitative comparison of bed deformation could be explanatory which is described as follows chief among the effects of morphological parameters the maximum scour depth could be pointed out as mining pits most destructive impact on their surrounding area therefore this parameter is chosen to be a representative of channels bed deformations from the straight channel to channel with high curvature the maximum scour depth position moves from the center of the channel to the outer wall while sedimentation occurs close to the inner wall moreover as can be seen from the results the maximum scour depth always increases from the straight channel to the channel with high curvature considering that this will happen regardless of existing of a pit the observed trend should be re evaluated as increase in velocity at outer wall of the bend would lead to outer wall bed degradation and sediment deposition at the inner wall vice versa according to the mentioned problem the cases with and without pit effect are separately considered in order to separate the pit effect a parameter δ was defined as the maximum scour depth with existence of the pit minus the maximum scour depth without existence of the pit thus the net effect of pit could be studied to build new models without pits the elevations of pits in the previous models were eliminated the fig 7 is an example of these models before and after the changes to obtain values of δ the modified models were simulated for the same 2 h the results are shown in the table 3 and fig 8 notable in the table 3 and fig 8 there are two wings of decreasing and increasing δ and a minimum at the c l 2 38 the following formula can be fitted to the results with the correlation factor of 0 91 5 δ 33 69 c l 2 158 9 c l 190 09 to explain this diagram fig 8 it can be argued that in the cases of direct channel to the channel with light curve the net effect of channel δ reduced such that for channel with c l about 2 38 this effect reduces to almost zero this means that there seems to be no pit effect on the maximum scour depth in channel with c l 2 38 after this point with increase in c l δ increases 3 2 analysis of results to understand why with sharper bends up to c l 2 38 the pit net effect on maximum scour depth gradually decreases and beyond this value gradually increases all important influential parameters are determined and classified the only difference between these models is the magnitude of the curvature so the models based o the curvature degree were classified into 3 categories table 4 when water flows over a mining pit flow separation occurs and eddy rollers are developed causing receding erosion meanwhile sediment brought from upstream is trapped in the pit and causes migration of the upstream end at the downstream end of the pit the dividing streamline veers away from the channel bed and another separation zone is formed at the region close to the downstream separation zone flow accelerates due to the sudden contraction of the channel cross sectional area causing local erosion thus the pit starts to migrate and deform lee et al 1993 in curved channels the events that occur in the direct channel are still happening with slightly differences back to morphology differences these differences can be outlined as follows 1 asymmetry in lateral velocity due to curvature 2 secondary flow in bends 3 more scouring at the outer wall of the bend due to the increased velocity and the secondary flow and more sedimentation in the inner wall of the bend due to the reduced flow velocity and the secondary flow and the disappearance of morphology symmetry of the bed over time laterally in the fig 9 the loss of symmetry of the cross sections is clearly visible the above information can be summarized as in the table 5 these parameters can be used to explain the behavior of the phenomena described in the previous sections one of the most important influences of mining pits on flow and sediment transport is the sudden increase and decrease in the flow depth of in the bend however the process is slightly different firstly a sudden increase in depth is seen and everything is the same as the direct channel then asymmetry of velocity and the secondary flow due to channel bend cause more scour in the outer wall and more sedimentation in the inner wall which leads to more moderate angle adjustment of pit at the upstream head near outer wall as it portrayed in fig 9 thus the flow is longitudinally adjusted and the pit is gradually deformed so the sudden decrease of depth becomes less effective and weaker at this state flow faces smaller velocity slowdown at the upstream of pit and slower velocity rising up at the downstream therefore as a result of this gradual change in velocity instead of a sudden change the sediment loss becomes less and scour at the downstream head of pit will be less than direct channel theoretically speaking for a fluid to begin transporting sediment that is currently at rest on a surface the boundary or bed shear stress τ b exerted by the fluid must exceed the critical shear stress τ c for the initiation of motion of grains at the bed for a newtonian fluid the shear stress at a surface element parallel to a flat plate at the point y is given by 6 τ y μ u y where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the flow u is the flow velocity along the boundary and y is the height above the boundary the higher the shear stress on the bed the more particles start to move and separate from it resulting in more erosion as can be seen from the shear stress equation the amount of shear stress is directly related to the flow velocity and therefore it can be concluded that the higher the velocity the higher the shear stress to clarify further three models for straight channels were constructed based on lee et al s experiment in the flow3d model and simulated under the same conditions the results of these simulations are shown in fig 10 as can be clearly seen the rate of flow velocity in contact with the bed downstream the pit where scouring happens has been reduced from the model with the vertical wall to the model with the smoother wall this maybe confirm the smoothing effect in other words in the simulation with direct channel after 2 h it was observed that the 90 angle between the upstream head of pit and the bed did not change much and the sudden change of the depth continued during the simulation however when the channel is curved it is seen that rough angles of the upstream and downstream heads decreased gradually which made the sudden change of depth lesser to make the discussion easier hereafter this phenomenon is called smoothing with sharper curvature smoothing happens faster and gets softer thus reductions in pit net effect on the maximum scour depth is expected the process proceeds to c l 2 38 at this point the net effect of pit on maximum scour depth will reduce to almost zero on the other hand secondary flow gets stronger for channels with higher curvatures and creates the increasing wing of δ c l diagram secondary flow tends to remove material from the bed and increase the scour depth in the outer wall secondary flow is strongly dependent on two parameters curvature degree and flow depth as mentioned with increase in the curvature degree c l and thus reduction in the radius of the arc the secondary flow becomes stronger it is clear that creation of mining pits by removal of material increases the flow depth in the channel and this would intensifies secondary flow strength compared to channels without pits in fact these two phenomena act against each other smoothing reduces the net effect of pits on maximum scour depth and the secondary flow increases it the simulation results indicate that from direct channel to the channel with c l 2 38 smoothing effect is more powerful than the weak secondary flow effect due to moderate curvature of channel bend thus reducing the effect of mining pit on maximum scour depth happens and the reducing wing of δ c l diagram occurs the point c l 2 38 is the point at which the strength of two phenomena balance each other in a way that it seems there is no pit or it has no effect on the maximum scour depth with increasing c l and consequently depth increase the intensity of the secondary flow increases such that the effect of mining pit on maximum scour depth will increase and make the raising wing of the δ c l diagram 4 conclusions gravel mining has always been extremely important due to the rich resources of construction materials this issue has profound impacts on rivers and their intersecting structures one of the most important of which is the bed degradation moreover it is crucial to consider that rivers are not usually straight and are generally flow a sinuous trial in this study an attempt has been made to investigate and understand the interaction between gravel mining pits and river curvature regarding river bed degradation to investigate the interacting effects of river curvature and gravel mining pits on rivers morphology models of a channel with different curvatures from a direct channel to a channel with high degree of curvature were constructed using the a 2d model and the results of the simulations were analyzed morphological study of river beds is a challenge due to the large amount of data produced by a 2d model and it would be extremely difficult to discover the pattern of changes therefore it was decided to focus the morphological effects on a single parameter by choosing the maximum scour depth as the most destructive morphological effect comparison has become much understandable i e while enjoy the high accuracy of the results due to the two dimensional simulation by focusing the results on this parameter comparison became more mathematical and quantitative than qualitative and descriptive examination of the results showed that from the direct channel to the channel with higher degree of curvature the maximum scour depth moves from the center of the cross section toward the outer wall and maximum deposition elevation moves toward the inner wall in addition moving of the maximum scour depth along the channel downstream is visible as can be seen from the results the maximum scour depth is almost always increased however it is clear that a curved channel without a pit will also have more degradation than a straight channel and that is due to the increase in velocity at the outer wall of the bend therefore the effect of the mining pit is isolated and investigated separately for this purpose a parameter called δ was defined which was considered equal to the maximum scour depth with the gravel mining pit minus the maximum scour depth without it changes in δ as the net effect of mining pit in maximum scour depth could be described in three parts a reducing wing an extremum and an increasing wing increasing the curvature the value of δ from direct channel to channel with light curvature of c l 2 38 is decreased at this point δ is eventually close to zero which in another word means that there are no difference in maximum scour depth between a channel with a pit and a channel without a pit at this curvature degree afterwards the increasing wing of δ c l diagram is formed inspection of the influent parameters showed that the event is due to two simultaneous phenomena decreasing phenomenon which is called smoothing is an effect of both asymmetry in channel shape and flow velocity which gradually changes the sudden increase and decrease of depth the pit effect to a smoother edge and cause the mining pit effect on maximum scour depth to decrease with sharper curvatures smoothing happens faster and gets softer therefore the pit net effect on the maximum scour depth is expected to mitigate further by increasing the curvature the secondary flow becomes stronger and consequently intensifies the net pit effect on maximum scour depth after a certain point c l 2 38 in which the effect of the both phenomena smoothing and secondary flow is in balance the secondary flow effect which resonates the net pit effect on maximum scour depth will take the lead by curvature increased finally as described in the previous sections there are several methods to understand and deal with the effects of gravel mining pit effects on rivers and their associated structures one of the most popular and widely used methods is the macroscopic view which usually examines the extraction of materials in the form of sediment budgets on the entire river ecosystem these methods have their own merits and are certainly very useful in their place however the results of the present study clearly show that the microscopic perspective on the issue of material withdrawal from rivers is also extremely important clearly as the results showed the location of the gravel mining pits along the river can intensify the bed degradation depth or move it to a great extent overall it seems that by combining these two perspectives and completing knowledge in both sectors we could have the most appropriate understanding of this phenomenon and adopt the best strategies to manage and reduce its impacts credit authorship contribution statement abedin mohammad

3844,the interaction between the sewer network and the overland runoff is challenging to study due to the complex flow exchange between the two systems during flooding the complexity increases when dealing with sub catchments that contain separated urban satellite areas that share the sewer network under this context it is possible to devise likely model structures which render determinist approaches spuriously precise in this paper a methodology is proposed for to devise multiple model structures for urban flood inundation uncertainty seven different model structures are assembled and validated in a case study baiersdorf for the flood event from 21st of 2007 to produce a probabilistic flood inundation uncertainty map the results show that the flood inundation extent uncertainty differs across the study area the overall flood extent uncertainty covers 14 15 of the inundation area the highest uncertainty is found to be 30 87 at the north part up of the study area many small areas of high uncertainty are concentrated in the main urban area and close to most of the upstream boundary conditions it is conducted that the highest uncertainties are likely to be found downstream of the coupling points of the 2d overland flow with either the 1d sewer system or the 1d overland flow network these results highlight the need to consider multiple model structures when estimating the uncertainty of the flood inundation extents keywords urban areas model structure uncertainty dual drainage flood inundation extent flood probabilistic maps 1 introduction flash floods are rapid and local events that are characterized by their high energy high flow velocities debris load and their immediate impact doswell 2015 the damages caused by inundations are more severe in urban areas due to their high vulnerability driven by the concentration of economic activities infrastructure and population atta ur rahman et al 2016 through the period from 1980 to 2017 flood events caused over 4300 fatalities and more than eur 170 billion of direct economic losses in the european economic area member countries eea 2019 therefore it is important to improve the developments in prediction and preparation for flash floods to mitigate the damages that are caused every year worldwide despite the very good understanding of the physics of flood propagation urban flood modelling still encompasses many sources of great uncertainty these uncertainties are driven by climate and hydrological variables such as rainfall trend or magnitude of the probability events dittes et al 2018 the variability in the non stationary of the hydrological parameters which are influenced by the change in land use and the soil initial conditions liu et al 2019 the possible source of errors in the measurement of real events observations bates et al 2014 and the scarce availability of such data leandro et al 2011 molinari et al 2019 which can lead to an incorrect validation of models setup just to name a few hence often a single model structure is setup driven by a desired purpose a required accuracy and a suitable computational effort without considering the possible uncertainty generated by the model structure the modeler experience can have a large impact in the model structure uncertainty the modeler must decide which hydrological hydraulic processes within the catchment need to be considered and how as well as the setup of the model structure which comprehends the topographic terrain and the key urban elements as streets buildings and the sewer network leandro et al 2016 schubert and sanders 2012 wang et al 2018 especially the underground drainage system effect is complex to model due to its interaction with the surface runoff though gullies and manholes leandro et al 2009 wang et al 2018 during urban pluvial flooding the flood extent is influenced by the surcharge and drainage effect originating on the drainage system and how their interaction is modelled furthermore it is possible that the same sewer network connects separated urban areas in this case the number of possible model structures as well as the underline uncertainty increases the modeler must therefore evaluate the different model structures e g 1d or and 2d and the connection between both if applicable for example in terms of the computational effort the number of variables required parameters and their degree of detail based on some goodness of fit on observed data a specific model structure may be considered valid however and due to the insufficient or quality data in urban flood studies different model structures may display similar goodness of fits regardless of discrepancies in the flood inundation extent the inclusion of uncertainty into deterministic flood inundation extents can be achieved by producing flood probabilistic maps di baldassarre et al 2010 inherent uncertainty in flood model estimates and the nonstationary performance of inundation hazards has been evaluated in several studies with this approach some studies analyze the uncertainty under different assumptions as the changes in flow frequency in river confluence neal et al 2013 the historical change in land use alfonso et al 2016 the impact of uncertain boundary conditions e g dyke failure domeneghetti et al 2013 the uncertainty in of multiple factors has also been performed stephens and bledsoe 2020 combined flow discharge friction parameters and channel uncertainty nevertheless and according to teng et al 2017 the uncertainty quantification arising from hydrodynamic models is still a matter of research in urban flood modelling in this paper a methodology to devise multiple model structures for urban flood inundation uncertainty for areas with several satellite urban areas is proposed the aim is to develop a method to define likely model structures to simulate the flood extent into complex sub catchments that contain multiple urban satellite areas 2 methodology to devise multiple model structures this section is divided into two subsections the first one elaborates on the model chain to devise likely model structures and the second subsection describes the urban flood models applied to simulate the event 2 1 model chain to devise multiple model structures fig 1 summarizes the proposed model chain which is divided in three main steps the first main step consists in the assembly of each likely model structure the second is the validation of each model structure and the third main step focuses on the estimation of the flood inundation uncertainty 2 1 1 model structure assembly data collection and pre process buildings and streets and urban key elements that need to be explicitly included into the digital elevation model dem this can be accomplish by raising or burning these elements into the dem buildings are modeled as 5 m raised blocks in the dem building block approach schubert and sanders 2012 as such buildings can still collect rainfall and represent and obstacle for the 2d overland flows streets are lowered by 10 cm in order for these features to represent preferential overland flow paths gallegos et al 2009 in order to achieve a balance between the computing effort and the output accuracy a regular grid of cell size 5 m 5 m is chosen for the model inputs chen et al 2012 gallegos et al 2009 the personal computer storm water management model pcswmm commercial interface is used to perform the automatic delineation of the 1d overland flow paths and sub catchment for the whole catchment of interest chi 2016 model structures set up seven different model structures are proposed to estimate the contribution of the model structure uncertainty to the uncertainty in flood inundation maps fig 2 when representing flash floods a modeler needs to define a model structure the decision is determined by the need to represent certain hydrological and or hydrodynamic processes within a catchment and the possible need for simplifications in order to reduce the computational effort the methodology herein is developed with the aim of obtaining a good representation of the 2d flood inundation in a main urban area which has a complex sub catchment containing separate urban satellite areas for areas which do not contain satellite areas some of the proposed model structures would become unnecessary in order to set up the model structures the dem and the roughness raster layer are clipped according with each of the seven model structures considered fig 2 after that the connection between the 1d and 2d overland runoff is accomplished through the assembly of 1d elements such as nodes and conduits the urban areas are classified into main urban area which corresponds to the most densified urban section located downstream of the catchment and its upstream urban areas denominated as urban satellites the area linking two satellites which may have a complex 2d overland which cannot be easily represented by a 1d overland network of channels is termed complex hydrodynamic area these could for example floodplain areas with a drainage system that tend to quickly overflow their banks during heavy rain events if applicable a sewer network may be added and connected with the overland flow depending on the model structures precipitation is added either directly to the overland flow as effective precipitation or divided with the 1d sewer network the final proposed model structures aim to represent the study area with different levels of details ranging from a very detailed model structure i e 1d 2d dual drainage model in the whole extent to simplified model structures in some areas to reduce the computational effort i e 1d 1d dual drainage model structure instead of 1d 2d in addition the inclusion of hydrodynamic processes that occur within the complex areas e g satellites and complex hydrodynamic areas were also considered through the application of different approaches i e 1d 1d or 1d 2d the seven model structures are graphically schematized in fig 2 c1 1d 1d and 1d 2d model main urban area 2d in this model structure the main urban area is modelled with a 1d 2d dual drainage model in this case the overland flow is modelled with a 2d approximation and the sewer network with a 1d representation the connection between the 1d sewer network and the 2d overland runoff is simulated by assuming that the sewer network outfalls are unidirectional and that the sewer network junctions have bidirectional interaction the total precipitation has been split according with the catchment areas between the sewer network 1d area and the 2d extent to avoid rainfall volume overlapping the upstream catchments are modelled with a 1d 1d dual drainage model in this case both the overland flow and the sewer network are modelled with 1d representations the connection between the main urban area and the upstream catchments is accomplished by unidirectional linkage points in this formulation no backwater is allowed from the main urban area to the upstream catchments c2 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites 2d independent in this model structure the main urban area and satellites are modelled with multiple 1d 2d dual drainage models overland flow modelled as 2d and the sewer network as 1d the interaction between the 1d sewer network and 2d overland flow at the main urban area and satellites is modelled similarly to the model structure c1 see c1 1d 1d and 1d 2d model main urban area 2d the remaining catchment area is modelled with a 1d 1d dual drainage model overland flow and sewer network modelled as 1d the satellites are set as independent this means that the external boundary conditions of the 2d satellites are set as open leading to water leaving the 2d satellites not reentering the 1d overland network hence the term independent is used the overland flow interaction between the 2d satellites and the 1d overland network occurs only upstream and is unidirectional i e from 1d to 2d the water transferred into the 2d satellites will not be removed from the 1d overland network by doing so no water is lost by the system because and it is possible to assure that this water will be transported further downstream this is assured by the 1d overland conduits that convey downstream the runoff from the satellites upstream as well as by the 1d overland catchments that overlap with the 2d extent in this scheme no backwater is allowed from the main urban area and the satellites to the upstream catchment c3 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites 2d dependent the main urban area and satellites are modelled with multiple 1d 2d dual drainage models overland flow modelled as 2d and the sewer network as 1d the interaction between the 1d sewer network and 2d overland flow at the main urban area and satellites is modelled similarly to the model structure c1 see c1 1d 1d and 1d 2d model main urban area 2d the remaining catchment area is modelled with a 1d 1d dual drainage model overland flow and sewer network modelled as 1d the satellites are set as dependent this means that the external boundary conditions of the satellites are set as closed water cannot leave or be lost by the 2d satellites the overland flow interaction between the satellites and the 1d overland runoff is bidirectional unlike the previous model structure and therefore the term dependent is now applied to distinguish the two structures there is no overlapping between the 1d overland catchments and the 2d extent the flow exchange occurs at several nodes placed along the 1d overland flow network and sewer network that cross the satellites area c4 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites and complex hydrodynamic area 2d independent in this configuration the main urban area satellites and complex hydrodynamic area are modelled with multiple 1d 2d dual drainage models overland flow modelled as 2d and the sewer network as 1d the interaction between the 1d sewer network and

the whole catchment is modelled with a 2d overland flow model in this case the overland runoff is modelled with a 2d approximation and the sewer network is neglected 2 1 2 validation physically based urban floods models are less dependent on calibration than conceptual models in physical based urban flood models a good representation of the relevant processes e g sewer surcharge and key urban features geometries e g buildings are more determinant factors for the accuracy of the simulations than the calibration of model parameters guinot and gourbesville 2003 in this case the validation of the different model structures is of paramount importance herein the validation of the model structures is based on goodness of fit criteria gofs based on observed data three gofs coefficients are selected for model evaluation nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 krause et al 2005 and root mean square error rmse banterng et al 2010 the criteria to reject the model structure is the nse 0 75 which is according d n moriasi et al 2017 the limit value for a very good fit for the model performance 2 1 3 inundation uncertainty due to insufficient of quality of observed data different model structures can display similar goodness of fits and still show large discrepancies in the flood inundation extent hence flood probabilistic maps fpms should be preferred in comparison to deterministic maps fpms as defined by di baldassarre et al 2010 are utilized herein to assess the uncertainties in the flood inundation extents and represent the flood extension for the sake of completion the procedure is summarized here shortly the first step to obtain the fpm is to simulate the same rain event in all model structures and thereby obtain the flood extension of each model structure after that a likelihood weight l is assigned based on the gof e g nse obtained from each simulation using the following equation di baldassarre et al 2010 1 l i f k min f k m a x f k m i n f k where l i is the likelihood of the i cell and f is the measure of fit that indicates how well the comparison between the simulated and observed data is therefore the flood state c i is defined as di baldassarre et al 2010 2 c i σ k l k w ki σ k l k where w is either 1 for a flooded cell or 0 for a dry cell the fpms display the flood extent assigning to each cell the probability of the cell of being flooded when the cell values are exactly 1 or 0 means that all model structures coincide in simulating the cell as flooded or dry respectively therefore the uncertain of flooding appears when the cell value is between 1 and 0 the inundation uncertainty regarding a rain event is defined as 3 uncertainty n uf n t 100 where n uf is the number of cells which are classified as uncertain flooding and n t is the number of total cells 2 2 urban flood models in this study the urban flood simulations are performed with the parallel diffusive wave model p dwave

the methodology developed in this paper is applied to the city of baiersdorf in germany the city suffered on july 21st of 2007 an extreme flood event causing severe damage the flash flood was caused by a heavy rainfall event that reached an intensity of more than 40 mm h the event caused a total estimated damage in the city of baiersdorf of about 86 million euros baiersdorf freiwillige feuerwehr 2008 the catchment area has a surface of 49 45 km2 the main urban areas within the study area are from west north to south east baiersdorf poxdorf effeltrich hagenau igelsdorf langensendelbach bräuningshof and adilt fig 4 the most downstream urban area is baiersdorf which is the most populated urban area furthermore the city of baiersdorf is divided in two main areas due to the nuremberg bamberg railway the city center northwest and the skirt area southeast the highest elevation point in the catchment is 548 4 m and the lowest one is 256 7 m fig 4 fig 4 shows the urban areas and the natural channels within the catchment as well as the sewer network that connects the urban areas underground the sewer network consists of a combined system the sanitary flow in bavaria is estimated as 130 7 l per person per day dettmar and brombach 2019 and was added as base flow the wastewater treatment plant wwtp located at the northern edge of baiersdorf receives the water collected by the combined water system and discharges it to the reignitz river the wwtp does not collect however the whole stormwater while the wwtp collects the whole main urban area of baiersdorf this is not the case for the stormwater originated at the upstream urban areas satellites a portion of the stormwater collected upstream are discharged via the outfalls shown in fig 4 directly to the overland surface and conveyed to nearby natural water bodies e g kreuzbach and schalengenbach the input data used for the physical model configuration are the shapefiles layers of key urban features such as streets and buildings the dem raster the roughness raster and the shapefile elements of the sewer network the street shapefile includes 3519 polylines the buildings shape files include 11 520 elements the roughness raster values are setup based on land type and the roughness values recommended by the bayerisches landesamt fur umwelt bavarian environmental agency lfu the dem and the roughness raster layers have a resolution of 5 5 m and cover an area of 49 45 km2 the sewer network is defined by the following elements junctions storages outfalls pipes pumps orifices weirs and subcatchments the case study data is provided by lfu the surcharge return period of the sewer network is defined in germany for urban areas by the worksheet 118 deutschen vereinigung für wasser und abfallwirtschaft german association for water management wastewater and waste dwa dwa 2006 hence a quality control of the drainage data was undertaking following this worksheet in accordance with din en 752 2 by assuming that the main urban area and the satellites should not experience flooding for the return periods of 5 and 3 years respectively the rain event on july 21st of 2007 has been obtained by radar data with a resolution of 1 1 km and 5 min from the german weather service radolan yw from dwd during the 21st of july of 2007 rain event the maximum water depth was recorded at ten different spots within the city of baiersdorf main urban area their locations are shown in fig 5 the water depths were registered on site after the rainfall event as a result of the water marks on buildings for the validation of the different model structures the values of the maximum water depth at ten different locations were used 4 application and results in this paper the rainfall event on july 21st of 2007 is applied to the baiersdorf s catchment the seven model structures are assembled and validated finally the fpm is obtained and the flood extent with uncertainty is plotted for the main urban area of the city of baiersdorf 4 1 model structures the main urban area is defined by the city of baiersdorf the satellites are the remaining urban areas and the complex hydrodynamic area is the existing floodplain that separates the urban areas of igelsdorf and langensendelbach the seven model structures assembled are shown in fig 6 the 21st of july of 2007 event for which observed data is available was simulated and the flood inundation maps of each model structure were obtained fig 7 the inundation extents of the 2d main urban area baiersdorf city for each model structure are obtained and sorted from higher to lower number of flooded cells c7 59 42 c5 59 15 c3 57 96 c4 56 36 c1 56 25 c2 55 96 and c6 55 37 to verify the overall agreement between the different model structures the sewer network behavior is evaluated analyzing the direct discharge of the sewer network outfalls into the 2d and the volume interaction between the sewer network nodes and the 2d fig 8 the bidirectional volume exchange between the sewer network and the overland flow is represented as sewer surcharge to 2d and drained by sewer from 2d the bidirectional exchange is divided into main urban area and upstream upstream is the area upstream the main urban area which runoff is modelled as 2d the unidirectional discharge is represented as outfall direct discharge to 2d and it is divided into the wwtp outflow and the discharge into the main urban area and the upstream fig 8 4 2 validation and computational effort there are ten available checkpoints within the city of baiersdorf main urban area fig 9 shows that three out of ten observed maximum water depths lie within the 95 confidence interval of the model structures simulations table 1 shows the computed gofs coefficients of each model structure obtained from comparing the simulated and observed maximum water depths at the checkpoints all model structures show an nse value greater than 0 75 therefore no model structure is rejected the model structure that displayed the worst gofs performance is c5 1d 1d 1d 2d model satellites complex hydrodynamic area 2d dependent with values of r2 0 80 nse 0 79 and rmse 0 24 m in the other hand the best fit of the gofs is performed by the model structure c4 1d 1d 1d 2d model satellites complex hydrodynamic area 2d independent with values of r2 0 92 nse 0 91 and rmse 0 16 m from ten measured points there is only one point with less depth than 0 25 m most of observations vary between 0 5 m and 0 75 m and the higher measurement registered is 2 17 m therefore the authors consider that the rmse are acceptable the computation effort of the model structures is represented by the computation time spend to simulate the rainfall event of july 21st of 2007 in a intel xeon cpu e5 2620 v3 2 4 ghz with 12 cpus as it is shown in table 1 the computational effort of the model structure c7 2d model whole extent 2d is 9 05 h in comparision with the model structure c7 the coupled model c6 1d 2d model whole extent 2d increases the computational effort of 42 59 the other model structures decrease the computational time in comparision with c7 c1 1d 1d and 1d 2d model main urban area 2d decreases by 85 19 c2 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites 2d independent decreases by 42 59 c4 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites and complex hydrodynamic area 2d independent decreases by 35 19 c3 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites 2d dependent decreases by 14 81 and c5 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites and complex hydrodynamic area 2d dependent decreases by 9 26 overall the model structures that model the satellites as dependent requires more computational time than the ones with independent satellites 4 3 inundation uncertainty in this section the flood extent uncertainty is estimated for the city of baiersdorf main urban area the flood inundation maps at the city of baiersdorf and the nse values of each model structures are used to obtain the fpm at baiersdorf of the rain event of july 21st of 2007 fig 10 in addition the city of baiersdorf is divided into three sub areas of interest in order to elaborate on the outcomes of the flood extent uncertainty fig 11 the sub areas of interest are north southeast and west the north corresponds to area at the downstream of the main urban area the wwtp is located in this area of interest the southeast area of interest is located at the edge of the outskirt urban area of baiersdorf this area is located upstream the railway the west extension is located downstream of the railway and is the most densified urban area of baiersdorf the west area is divided in urban area downstream and upstream west downstream and west upstream as fig 11 shows the north area of interest shows large areas of high uncertainty grey area the west area on the contrary shows many small areas of moderate uncertainty close to the buildings also it is larger and more spread at the area downstream than at the area upstream at the southeast the uncertainties are mostly located near the boundary of the 2d model according to table 2 the percentage of the area with uncertainty between 0 and 1 of being flooded is 14 15 while the percentages of being or not flooded i e in which all model structures agreed is 85 85 the north extent shows the largest percentage of uncertain flooding with 30 87 while the west extent presents the lowest percentage of uncertainty with only 11 90 of the whole west area 5 discussion 5 1 performance of the multiple model structures the inundation extent of the model structure c7 2d model whole extent is larger than the dual drainage c6 1d 1d 1d 2d model whole extent 2d this indicates that the sewer network is effective in reducing the flood inundation extent from 59 42 to 55 37 furthermore when the satellites are modeled as dependent c3 and c5 the flood extension is higher than when modeled as independent satellites this is a direct consequence of the observed larger water volume conveyed to the most downstream area when the satellites are modeled as closed boundaries as fig 8 shows that each model structure has a different impact to the behavior of the sewer network the sewer network from the satellites directly affects the sewer network downstream connected to the wwtp the sewer network from the satellites drains the overland surface water and convey it to the main urban area in baiersdorf at baiersdorf the volume of water transported either flows through the sewer network until it arrives the wwtp or it is returned to the surface by the sewer network via surcharge once its discharge capacity is exceeded in the case of the dependent satellites model structures the outflow volume of the wwtp displays a higher value the reason is that the sewer network from the satellites drains a larger quantity of flooded water than the other model structures this translates into the sewer system experiencing longer times at full capacity increasing therefore the volume outflow at the wwdt and outfalls as well as higher surcharge volumes the drained volume in the dependent satellites approach is larger because the water accumulation caused by the closed 2d boundaries increases the available head at the locations near the manhole nodes this increase in the head atop of the manholes leads to an increased and continuous drainage flow into the sewer network in the other model structures the overland runoff is only drained into the sewer when these have available capacity otherwise runoff will simply leave the 2d domain once it reaches the 2d open boundaries 5 2 efficiency and application of model structures the efficiency of model structures can be measured by the computational effort and the quality of the simulation s outputs i e consumption time and gofs coefficients shown in table 1 modelers often rely on these measures for deciding a suitable model structure in a deterministic approach the model structure with the best gofs and smallest acceptable computational effort would be selected in a probabilistic approach it is important to describe the model structural uncertainty hence seven model structures are derived to simulate the flood propagation in baiersdorf in any case it is still of interest to select model structures for which the computational time is still manageable the model structure c1 has the lowest computational time although c2 c3 c4 and c6 perform better in at least two of the three gofs in addition it is expected that the hydrological hydraulic processes in urban flooding are better described by c6 than by c7 table 1 the former considers the bi directional interaction with the overland and sewer flow this comes with the additional cost of extra computational time in this case the computational time of c6 is 42 59 larger than c7 table 1 in principle a more complex model structure considering more key urban elements should provide better results chang et al 2018 chen et al 2012 however due to the lack of good quality data e g flood inundation extents or multiple check points observation with time or data availability leandro et al 2011 validation in itself is uncertain therefore when considering probabilistic approaches for assessing inundation uncertainty the inclusion of different model structures to compute the flood inundation extent should be primarily based on accuracy such as gofs here used and not on computational time 5 3 flood extent uncertainty the model structure uncertainty differs among the three areas of interest north west and southeast see figs 10 and 11 the highest uncertainty occurs at the north extent table 2 because it is the area further downstream of the sewer network and the overland catchment therefore it is natural to expect that the changes applied in the model structures will have a higher impact in this area due to propagation of uncertainty at the north sub area uncertainty is visible in large areas while at the west sub area the uncertainty is spread in smaller areas within the urban tissue see fig 11 in fact the uncertainty is higher at these smaller areas within the west sub area further downstream this is likely caused by the sewer network bi directional interaction i e drainage and surcharge which increases towards the downstream areas of the catchment the uncertainty at the southeast sub area of interest is around the 2d boundary fig 11 this is likely due to the use of closed and open boundaries at the satellites the former is known to increase the water drained by the sewer system and hence increase the inundation extent of the main urban area overall the flood extent uncertainty during the july 21st of 2007 rainfall event is 14 15 table 2 therefore and as discussed the flood inundation extent differs between model structures regardless of the overall good performance shown in the gofs see r2 and nse at table 1 uncertainty varies across the area of interest this highlights the importance to validate different model structures in order to quantify the uncertainty when estimating flood inundation extents assessing the flood inundation uncertainty adds new information to flood risk management and can likely improve decision making 5 4 limitations of the present study this study focuses on model structure uncertainty other sources of uncertainty were not considered such as the climate and hydrological variables the variability in the non stationary hydrological parameters and the possible errors and scarcity in the measurement of the real events observations beven and binley 1992 due to time constrains it was not possible to perform measurements of real events within the sewer network measuring the sewer network discharges for extreme rainfall events would strengthen the validation of the dual drainage models finally the present study estimates the model structure uncertainty focusing solely on the flood inundation extents and not on the water depths future work could see the addition of more scenarios to analyze the effect of other sources of uncertainty such as dem resolution or rainfall intensity 6 conclusion a method to define likely model structures to simulate the flood extent into complex sub catchments that contain multiple urban satellites areas were presented in this study the methodology derived seven model structures which displayed similar goodness of fits for the available observed data at the same time the different model structures displayed differences in the flood inundation extent these differences highlighted the high uncertainty associated to model structure uncertainty urban drainage systems play an important role in the urban flood management practices due to its impact in reducing the overland runoff in urban areas therefore dual drainage model structures represent the expected most accurate setup for reducing the uncertainty in decision making however it was clear from this study that complex study areas with multiple urban satellites may lead to different model structures performing equally well in addition applying a full 1d 2d dual drainage model to the whole domain may in some cases not be feasible due to computations restrictions moreover it is not clear that this model structure would always be the most suitable the use of more complex models also leads to other sources of uncertainty which were not considered in this study herein the consideration of multiple model structures lead to an overall inundation uncertainty for the july 21st of 2007 rainfall event of 14 15 a more detailed analysis of the flood inundation extent has shown that uncertainty is highly depending on the focus area at the north of the main urban area it reached 30 87 higher uncertainties were also found spread in smaller areas nearby the buildings within the urban area and on the perimeter of the most upstream boundary of the main urban area the highest uncertainties were found in the most downstream areas because these are collection points for the sewer network system and the overland runoff understanding the location of areas with higher uncertainty is crucial because it allows for better informed decisions accordingly the consideration of multiple model structures when evaluating the flood inundation extent is in the opinion of the authors essential for dealing with uncertainty in the context

3844,the interaction between the sewer network and the overland runoff is challenging to study due to the complex flow exchange between the two systems during flooding the complexity increases when dealing with sub catchments that contain separated urban satellite areas that share the sewer network under this context it is possible to devise likely model structures which render determinist approaches spuriously precise in this paper a methodology is proposed for to devise multiple model structures for urban flood inundation uncertainty seven different model structures are assembled and validated in a case study baiersdorf for the flood event from 21st of 2007 to produce a probabilistic flood inundation uncertainty map the results show that the flood inundation extent uncertainty differs across the study area the overall flood extent uncertainty covers 14 15 of the inundation area the highest uncertainty is found to be 30 87 at the north part up of the study area many small areas of high uncertainty are concentrated in the main urban area and close to most of the upstream boundary conditions it is conducted that the highest uncertainties are likely to be found downstream of the coupling points of the 2d overland flow with either the 1d sewer system or the 1d overland flow network these results highlight the need to consider multiple model structures when estimating the uncertainty of the flood inundation extents keywords urban areas model structure uncertainty dual drainage flood inundation extent flood probabilistic maps 1 introduction flash floods are rapid and local events that are characterized by their high energy high flow velocities debris load and their immediate impact doswell 2015 the damages caused by inundations are more severe in urban areas due to their high vulnerability driven by the concentration of economic activities infrastructure and population atta ur rahman et al 2016 through the period from 1980 to 2017 flood events caused over 4300 fatalities and more than eur 170 billion of direct economic losses in the european economic area member countries eea 2019 therefore it is important to improve the developments in prediction and preparation for flash floods to mitigate the damages that are caused every year worldwide despite the very good understanding of the physics of flood propagation urban flood modelling still encompasses many sources of great uncertainty these uncertainties are driven by climate and hydrological variables such as rainfall trend or magnitude of the probability events dittes et al 2018 the variability in the non stationary of the hydrological parameters which are influenced by the change in land use and the soil initial conditions liu et al 2019 the possible source of errors in the measurement of real events observations bates et al 2014 and the scarce availability of such data leandro et al 2011 molinari et al 2019 which can lead to an incorrect validation of models setup just to name a few hence often a single model structure is setup driven by a desired purpose a required accuracy and a suitable computational effort without considering the possible uncertainty generated by the model structure the modeler experience can have a large impact in the model structure uncertainty the modeler must decide which hydrological hydraulic processes within the catchment need to be considered and how as well as the setup of the model structure which comprehends the topographic terrain and the key urban elements as streets buildings and the sewer network leandro et al 2016 schubert and sanders 2012 wang et al 2018 especially the underground drainage system effect is complex to model due to its interaction with the surface runoff though gullies and manholes leandro et al 2009 wang et al 2018 during urban pluvial flooding the flood extent is influenced by the surcharge and drainage effect originating on the drainage system and how their interaction is modelled furthermore it is possible that the same sewer network connects separated urban areas in this case the number of possible model structures as well as the underline uncertainty increases the modeler must therefore evaluate the different model structures e g 1d or and 2d and the connection between both if applicable for example in terms of the computational effort the number of variables required parameters and their degree of detail based on some goodness of fit on observed data a specific model structure may be considered valid however and due to the insufficient or quality data in urban flood studies different model structures may display similar goodness of fits regardless of discrepancies in the flood inundation extent the inclusion of uncertainty into deterministic flood inundation extents can be achieved by producing flood probabilistic maps di baldassarre et al 2010 inherent uncertainty in flood model estimates and the nonstationary performance of inundation hazards has been evaluated in several studies with this approach some studies analyze the uncertainty under different assumptions as the changes in flow frequency in river confluence neal et al 2013 the historical change in land use alfonso et al 2016 the impact of uncertain boundary conditions e g dyke failure domeneghetti et al 2013 the uncertainty in of multiple factors has also been performed stephens and bledsoe 2020 combined flow discharge friction parameters and channel uncertainty nevertheless and according to teng et al 2017 the uncertainty quantification arising from hydrodynamic models is still a matter of research in urban flood modelling in this paper a methodology to devise multiple model structures for urban flood inundation uncertainty for areas with several satellite urban areas is proposed the aim is to develop a method to define likely model structures to simulate the flood extent into complex sub catchments that contain multiple urban satellite areas 2 methodology to devise multiple model structures this section is divided into two subsections the first one elaborates on the model chain to devise likely model structures and the second subsection describes the urban flood models applied to simulate the event 2 1 model chain to devise multiple model structures fig 1 summarizes the proposed model chain which is divided in three main steps the first main step consists in the assembly of each likely model structure the second is the validation of each model structure and the third main step focuses on the estimation of the flood inundation uncertainty 2 1 1 model structure assembly data collection and pre process buildings and streets and urban key elements that need to be explicitly included into the digital elevation model dem this can be accomplish by raising or burning these elements into the dem buildings are modeled as 5 m raised blocks in the dem building block approach schubert and sanders 2012 as such buildings can still collect rainfall and represent and obstacle for the 2d overland flows streets are lowered by 10 cm in order for these features to represent preferential overland flow paths gallegos et al 2009 in order to achieve a balance between the computing effort and the output accuracy a regular grid of cell size 5 m 5 m is chosen for the model inputs chen et al 2012 gallegos et al 2009 the personal computer storm water management model pcswmm commercial interface is used to perform the automatic delineation of the 1d overland flow paths and sub catchment for the whole catchment of interest chi 2016 model structures set up seven different model structures are proposed to estimate the contribution of the model structure uncertainty to the uncertainty in flood inundation maps fig 2 when representing flash floods a modeler needs to define a model structure the decision is determined by the need to represent certain hydrological and or hydrodynamic processes within a catchment and the possible need for simplifications in order to reduce the computational effort the methodology herein is developed with the aim of obtaining a good representation of the 2d flood inundation in a main urban area which has a complex sub catchment containing separate urban satellite areas for areas which do not contain satellite areas some of the proposed model structures would become unnecessary in order to set up the model structures the dem and the roughness raster layer are clipped according with each of the seven model structures considered fig 2 after that the connection between the 1d and 2d overland runoff is accomplished through the assembly of 1d elements such as nodes and conduits the urban areas are classified into main urban area which corresponds to the most densified urban section located downstream of the catchment and its upstream urban areas denominated as urban satellites the area linking two satellites which may have a complex 2d overland which cannot be easily represented by a 1d overland network of channels is termed complex hydrodynamic area these could for example floodplain areas with a drainage system that tend to quickly overflow their banks during heavy rain events if applicable a sewer network may be added and connected with the overland flow depending on the model structures precipitation is added either directly to the overland flow as effective precipitation or divided with the 1d sewer network the final proposed model structures aim to represent the study area with different levels of details ranging from a very detailed model structure i e 1d 2d dual drainage model in the whole extent to simplified model structures in some areas to reduce the computational effort i e 1d 1d dual drainage model structure instead of 1d 2d in addition the inclusion of hydrodynamic processes that occur within the complex areas e g satellites and complex hydrodynamic areas were also considered through the application of different approaches i e 1d 1d or 1d 2d the seven model structures are graphically schematized in fig 2 c1 1d 1d and 1d 2d model main urban area 2d in this model structure the main urban area is modelled with a 1d 2d dual drainage model in this case the overland flow is modelled with a 2d approximation and the sewer network with a 1d representation the connection between the 1d sewer network and the 2d overland runoff is simulated by assuming that the sewer network outfalls are unidirectional and that the sewer network junctions have bidirectional interaction the total precipitation has been split according with the catchment areas between the sewer network 1d area and the 2d extent to avoid rainfall volume overlapping the upstream catchments are modelled with a 1d 1d dual drainage model in this case both the overland flow and the sewer network are modelled with 1d representations the connection between the main urban area and the upstream catchments is accomplished by unidirectional linkage points in this formulation no backwater is allowed from the main urban area to the upstream catchments c2 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites 2d independent in this model structure the main urban area and satellites are modelled with multiple 1d 2d dual drainage models overland flow modelled as 2d and the sewer network as 1d the interaction between the 1d sewer network and 2d overland flow at the main urban area and satellites is modelled similarly to the model structure c1 see c1 1d 1d and 1d 2d model main urban area 2d the remaining catchment area is modelled with a 1d 1d dual drainage model overland flow and sewer network modelled as 1d the satellites are set as independent this means that the external boundary conditions of the 2d satellites are set as open leading to water leaving the 2d satellites not reentering the 1d overland network hence the term independent is used the overland flow interaction between the 2d satellites and the 1d overland network occurs only upstream and is unidirectional i e from 1d to 2d the water transferred into the 2d satellites will not be removed from the 1d overland network by doing so no water is lost by the system because and it is possible to assure that this water will be transported further downstream this is assured by the 1d overland conduits that convey downstream the runoff from the satellites upstream as well as by the 1d overland catchments that overlap with the 2d extent in this scheme no backwater is allowed from the main urban area and the satellites to the upstream catchment c3 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites 2d dependent the main urban area and satellites are modelled with multiple 1d 2d dual drainage models overland flow modelled as 2d and the sewer network as 1d the interaction between the 1d sewer network and 2d overland flow at the main urban area and satellites is modelled similarly to the model structure c1 see c1 1d 1d and 1d 2d model main urban area 2d the remaining catchment area is modelled with a 1d 1d dual drainage model overland flow and sewer network modelled as 1d the satellites are set as dependent this means that the external boundary conditions of the satellites are set as closed water cannot leave or be lost by the 2d satellites the overland flow interaction between the satellites and the 1d overland runoff is bidirectional unlike the previous model structure and therefore the term dependent is now applied to distinguish the two structures there is no overlapping between the 1d overland catchments and the 2d extent the flow exchange occurs at several nodes placed along the 1d overland flow network and sewer network that cross the satellites area c4 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites and complex hydrodynamic area 2d independent in this configuration the main urban area satellites and complex hydrodynamic area are modelled with multiple 1d 2d dual drainage models overland flow modelled as 2d and the sewer network as 1d the interaction between the 1d sewer network and 2d overland flow at the main urban area and satellites is modelled similarly to the model structure c1 see c1 1d 1d and 1d 2d model main urban area 2d the remaining catchment area is modelled with a 1d 1d dual drainage model overland flow and sewer network modelled as 1d the satellites and complex hydrodynamic area are set as independent see definition in model configuration c2 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites 2d independent c5 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites and complex hydrodynamic area 2d dependent the main urban area satellites and complex hydrodynamic area are modelled with multiple 1d 2d dual drainage models overland flow modelled as 2d and the sewer network as 1d the interaction between the 1d sewer network and 2d overland flow at the main urban area and satellites is modelled similarly to the model structure c1 see c1 1d 1d and 1d 2d model main urban area 2d the remaining catchment area is modelled with a 1d 1d dual drainage model overland flow and sewer network modelled as 1d the satellites and complex hydrodynamic area are set as dependent see definition in model configuration c3 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites 2d dependent c6 1d 2d model whole extent 2d in this model structure the whole catchment is modelled with a single 1d 2d dual drainage model overland flow modelled as 2d and the sewer network as 1d the interaction between the 1d sewer network and 2d overland flow at the main urban area and satellites is modelled similarly to the model structure c1 see c1 1d 1d and 1d 2d model main urban area 2d c7 2d model whole extent 2d in this configuration the whole catchment is modelled with a 2d overland flow model in this case the overland runoff is modelled with a 2d approximation and the sewer network is neglected 2 1 2 validation physically based urban floods models are less dependent on calibration than conceptual models in physical based urban flood models a good representation of the relevant processes e g sewer surcharge and key urban features geometries e g buildings are more determinant factors for the accuracy of the simulations than the calibration of model parameters guinot and gourbesville 2003 in this case the validation of the different model structures is of paramount importance herein the validation of the model structures is based on goodness of fit criteria gofs based on observed data three gofs coefficients are selected for model evaluation nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 krause et al 2005 and root mean square error rmse banterng et al 2010 the criteria to reject the model structure is the nse 0 75 which is according d n moriasi et al 2017 the limit value for a very good fit for the model performance 2 1 3 inundation uncertainty due to insufficient of quality of observed data different model structures can display similar goodness of fits and still show large discrepancies in the flood inundation extent hence flood probabilistic maps fpms should be preferred in comparison to deterministic maps fpms as defined by di baldassarre et al 2010 are utilized herein to assess the uncertainties in the flood inundation extents and represent the flood extension for the sake of completion the procedure is summarized here shortly the first step to obtain the fpm is to simulate the same rain event in all model structures and thereby obtain the flood extension of each model structure after that a likelihood weight l is assigned based on the gof e g nse obtained from each simulation using the following equation di baldassarre et al 2010 1 l i f k min f k m a x f k m i n f k where l i is the likelihood of the i cell and f is the measure of fit that indicates how well the comparison between the simulated and observed data is therefore the flood state c i is defined as di baldassarre et al 2010 2 c i σ k l k w ki σ k l k where w is either 1 for a flooded cell or 0 for a dry cell the fpms display the flood extent assigning to each cell the probability of the cell of being flooded when the cell values are exactly 1 or 0 means that all model structures coincide in simulating the cell as flooded or dry respectively therefore the uncertain of flooding appears when the cell value is between 1 and 0 the inundation uncertainty regarding a rain event is defined as 3 uncertainty n uf n t 100 where n uf is the number of cells which are classified as uncertain flooding and n t is the number of total cells 2 2 urban flood models in this study the urban flood simulations are performed with the parallel diffusive wave model p dwave

the methodology developed in this paper is applied to the city of baiersdorf in germany the city suffered on july 21st of 2007 an extreme flood event causing severe damage the flash flood was caused by a heavy rainfall event that reached an intensity of more than 40 mm h the event caused a total estimated damage in the city of baiersdorf of about 86 million euros baiersdorf freiwillige feuerwehr 2008 the catchment area has a surface of 49 45 km2 the main urban areas within the study area are from west north to south east baiersdorf poxdorf effeltrich hagenau igelsdorf langensendelbach bräuningshof and adilt fig 4 the most downstream urban area is baiersdorf which is the most populated urban area furthermore the city of baiersdorf is divided in two main areas due to the nuremberg bamberg railway the city center northwest and the skirt area southeast the highest elevation point in the catchment is 548 4 m and the lowest one is 256 7 m fig 4 fig 4 shows the urban areas and the natural channels within the catchment as well as the sewer network that connects the urban areas underground the sewer network consists of a combined system the sanitary flow in bavaria is estimated as 130 7 l per person per day dettmar and brombach 2019 and was added as base flow the wastewater treatment plant wwtp located at the northern edge of baiersdorf receives the water collected by the combined water system and discharges it to the reignitz river the wwtp does not collect however the whole stormwater while the wwtp collects the whole main urban area of baiersdorf this is not the case for the stormwater originated at the upstream urban areas satellites a portion of the stormwater collected upstream are discharged via the outfalls shown in fig 4 directly to the overland surface and conveyed to nearby natural water bodies e g kreuzbach and schalengenbach the input data used for the physical model configuration are the shapefiles layers of key urban features such as streets and buildings the dem raster the roughness raster and the shapefile elements of the sewer network the street shapefile includes 3519 polylines the buildings shape files include 11 520 elements the roughness raster values are setup based on land type and the roughness values recommended by the bayerisches landesamt fur umwelt bavarian environmental agency lfu the dem and the roughness raster layers have a resolution of 5 5 m and cover an area of 49 45 km2 the sewer network is defined by the following elements junctions storages outfalls pipes pumps orifices weirs and subcatchments the case study data is provided by lfu the surcharge return period of the sewer network is defined in germany for urban areas by the worksheet 118 deutschen vereinigung für wasser und abfallwirtschaft german association for water management wastewater and waste dwa dwa 2006 hence a quality control of the drainage data was undertaking following this worksheet in accordance with din en 752 2 by assuming that the main urban area and the satellites should not experience flooding for the return periods of 5 and 3 years respectively the rain event on july 21st of 2007 has been obtained by radar data with a resolution of 1 1 km and 5 min from the german weather service radolan yw from dwd during the 21st of july of 2007 rain event the maximum water depth was recorded at ten different spots within the city of baiersdorf main urban area their locations are shown in fig 5 the water depths were registered on site after the rainfall event as a result of the water marks on buildings for the validation of the different model structures the values of the maximum water depth at ten different locations were used 4 application and results in this paper the rainfall event on july 21st of 2007 is applied to the baiersdorf s catchment the seven model structures are assembled and validated finally the fpm is obtained and the flood extent with uncertainty is plotted for the main urban area of the city of baiersdorf 4 1 model structures the main urban area is defined by the city of baiersdorf the satellites are the remaining urban areas and the complex hydrodynamic area is the existing floodplain that separates the urban areas of igelsdorf and langensendelbach the seven model structures assembled are shown in fig 6 the 21st of july of 2007 event for which observed data is available was simulated and the flood inundation maps of each model structure were obtained fig 7 the inundation extents of the 2d main urban area baiersdorf city for each model structure are obtained and sorted from higher to lower number of flooded cells c7 59 42 c5 59 15 c3 57 96 c4 56 36 c1 56 25 c2 55 96 and c6 55 37 to verify the overall agreement between the different model structures the sewer network behavior is evaluated analyzing the direct discharge of the sewer network outfalls into the 2d and the volume interaction between the sewer network nodes and the 2d fig 8 the bidirectional volume exchange between the sewer network and the overland flow is represented as sewer surcharge to 2d and drained by sewer from 2d the bidirectional exchange is divided into main urban area and upstream upstream is the area upstream the main urban area which runoff is modelled as 2d the unidirectional discharge is represented as outfall direct discharge to 2d and it is divided into the wwtp outflow and the discharge into the main urban area and the upstream fig 8 4 2 validation and computational effort there are ten available checkpoints within the city of baiersdorf main urban area fig 9 shows that three out of ten observed maximum water depths lie within the 95 confidence interval of the model structures simulations table 1 shows the computed gofs coefficients of each model structure obtained from comparing the simulated and observed maximum water depths at the checkpoints all model structures show an nse value greater than 0 75 therefore no model structure is rejected the model structure that displayed the worst gofs performance is c5 1d 1d 1d 2d model satellites complex hydrodynamic area 2d dependent with values of r2 0 80 nse 0 79 and rmse 0 24 m in the other hand the best fit of the gofs is performed by the model structure c4 1d 1d 1d 2d model satellites complex hydrodynamic area 2d independent with values of r2 0 92 nse 0 91 and rmse 0 16 m from ten measured points there is only one point with less depth than 0 25 m most of observations vary between 0 5 m and 0 75 m and the higher measurement registered is 2 17 m therefore the authors consider that the rmse are acceptable the computation effort of the model structures is represented by the computation time spend to simulate the rainfall event of july 21st of 2007 in a intel xeon cpu e5 2620 v3 2 4 ghz with 12 cpus as it is shown in table 1 the computational effort of the model structure c7 2d model whole extent 2d is 9 05 h in comparision with the model structure c7 the coupled model c6 1d 2d model whole extent 2d increases the computational effort of 42 59 the other model structures decrease the computational time in comparision with c7 c1 1d 1d and 1d 2d model main urban area 2d decreases by 85 19 c2 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites 2d independent decreases by 42 59 c4 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites and complex hydrodynamic area 2d independent decreases by 35 19 c3 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites 2d dependent decreases by 14 81 and c5 1d 1d and 1d 2d model satellites and complex hydrodynamic area 2d dependent decreases by 9 26 overall the model structures that model the satellites as dependent requires more computational time than the ones with independent satellites 4 3 inundation uncertainty in this section the flood extent uncertainty is estimated for the city of baiersdorf main urban area the flood inundation maps at the city of baiersdorf and the nse values of each model structures are used to obtain the fpm at baiersdorf of the rain event of july 21st of 2007 fig 10 in addition the city of baiersdorf is divided into three sub areas of interest in order to elaborate on the outcomes of the flood extent uncertainty fig 11 the sub areas of interest are north southeast and west the north corresponds to area at the downstream of the main urban area the wwtp is located in this area of interest the southeast area of interest is located at the edge of the outskirt urban area of baiersdorf this area is located upstream the railway the west extension is located downstream of the railway and is the most densified urban area of baiersdorf the west area is divided in urban area downstream and upstream west downstream and west upstream as fig 11 shows the north area of interest shows large areas of high uncertainty grey area the west area on the contrary shows many small areas of moderate uncertainty close to the buildings also it is larger and more spread at the area downstream than at the area upstream at the southeast the uncertainties are mostly located near the boundary of the 2d model according to table 2 the percentage of the area with uncertainty between 0 and 1 of being flooded is 14 15 while the percentages of being or not flooded i e in which all model structures agreed is 85 85 the north extent shows the largest percentage of uncertain flooding with 30 87 while the west extent presents the lowest percentage of uncertainty with only 11 90 of the whole west area 5 discussion 5 1 performance of the multiple model structures the inundation extent of the model structure c7 2d model whole extent is larger than the dual drainage c6 1d 1d 1d 2d model whole extent 2d this indicates that the sewer network is effective in reducing the flood inundation extent from 59 42 to 55 37 furthermore when the satellites are modeled as dependent c3 and c5 the flood extension is higher than when modeled as independent satellites this is a direct consequence of the observed larger water volume conveyed to the most downstream area when the satellites are modeled as closed boundaries as fig 8 shows that each model structure has a different impact to the behavior of the sewer network the sewer network from the satellites directly affects the sewer network downstream connected to the wwtp the sewer network from the satellites drains the overland surface water and convey it to the main urban area in baiersdorf at baiersdorf the volume of water transported either flows through the sewer network until it arrives the wwtp or it is returned to the surface by the sewer network via surcharge once its discharge capacity is exceeded in the case of the dependent satellites model structures the outflow volume of the wwtp displays a higher value the reason is that the sewer network from the satellites drains a larger quantity of flooded water than the other model structures this translates into the sewer system experiencing longer times at full capacity increasing therefore the volume outflow at the wwdt and outfalls as well as higher surcharge volumes the drained volume in the dependent satellites approach is larger because the water accumulation caused by the closed 2d boundaries increases the available head at the locations near the manhole nodes this increase in the head atop of the manholes leads to an increased and continuous drainage flow into the sewer network in the other model structures the overland runoff is only drained into the sewer when these have available capacity otherwise runoff will simply leave the 2d domain once it reaches the 2d open boundaries 5 2 efficiency and application of model structures the efficiency of model structures can be measured by the computational effort and the quality of the simulation s outputs i e consumption time and gofs coefficients shown in table 1 modelers often rely on these measures for deciding a suitable model structure in a deterministic approach the model structure with the best gofs and smallest acceptable computational effort would be selected in a probabilistic approach it is important to describe the model structural uncertainty hence seven model structures are derived to simulate the flood propagation in baiersdorf in any case it is still of interest to select model structures for which the computational time is still manageable the model structure c1 has the lowest computational time although c2 c3 c4 and c6 perform better in at least two of the three gofs in addition it is expected that the hydrological hydraulic processes in urban flooding are better described by c6 than by c7 table 1 the former considers the bi directional interaction with the overland and sewer flow this comes with the additional cost of extra computational time in this case the computational time of c6 is 42 59 larger than c7 table 1 in principle a more complex model structure considering more key urban elements should provide better results chang et al 2018 chen et al 2012 however due to the lack of good quality data e g flood inundation extents or multiple check points observation with time or data availability leandro et al 2011 validation in itself is uncertain therefore when considering probabilistic approaches for assessing inundation uncertainty the inclusion of different model structures to compute the flood inundation extent should be primarily based on accuracy such as gofs here used and not on computational time 5 3 flood extent uncertainty the model structure uncertainty differs among the three areas of interest north west and southeast see figs 10 and 11 the highest uncertainty occurs at the north extent table 2 because it is the area further downstream of the sewer network and the overland catchment therefore it is natural to expect that the changes applied in the model structures will have a higher impact in this area due to propagation of uncertainty at the north sub area uncertainty is visible in large areas while at the west sub area the uncertainty is spread in smaller areas within the urban tissue see fig 11 in fact the uncertainty is higher at these smaller areas within the west sub area further downstream this is likely caused by the sewer network bi directional interaction i e drainage and surcharge which increases towards the downstream areas of the catchment the uncertainty at the southeast sub area of interest is around the 2d boundary fig 11 this is likely due to the use of closed and open boundaries at the satellites the former is known to increase the water drained by the sewer system and hence increase the inundation extent of the main urban area overall the flood extent uncertainty during the july 21st of 2007 rainfall event is 14 15 table 2 therefore and as discussed the flood inundation extent differs between model structures regardless of the overall good performance shown in the gofs see r2 and nse at table 1 uncertainty varies across the area of interest this highlights the importance to validate different model structures in order to quantify the uncertainty when estimating flood inundation extents assessing the flood inundation uncertainty adds new information to flood risk management and can likely improve decision making 5 4 limitations of the present study this study focuses on model structure uncertainty other sources of uncertainty were not considered such as the climate and hydrological variables the variability in the non stationary hydrological parameters and the possible errors and scarcity in the measurement of the real events observations beven and binley 1992 due to time constrains it was not possible to perform measurements of real events within the sewer network measuring the sewer network discharges for extreme rainfall events would strengthen the validation of the dual drainage models finally the present study estimates the model structure uncertainty focusing solely on the flood inundation extents and not on the water depths future work could see the addition of more scenarios to analyze the effect of other sources of uncertainty such as dem resolution or rainfall intensity 6 conclusion a method to define likely model structures to simulate the flood extent into complex sub catchments that contain multiple urban satellites areas were presented in this study the methodology derived seven model structures which displayed similar goodness of fits for the available observed data at the same time the different model structures displayed differences in the flood inundation extent these differences highlighted the high uncertainty associated to model structure uncertainty urban drainage systems play an important role in the urban flood management practices due to its impact in reducing the overland runoff in urban areas therefore dual drainage model structures represent the expected most accurate setup for reducing the uncertainty in decision making however it was clear from this study that complex study areas with multiple urban satellites may lead to different model structures performing equally well in addition applying a full 1d 2d dual drainage model to the whole domain may in some cases not be feasible due to computations restrictions moreover it is not clear that this model structure would always be the most suitable the use of more complex models also leads to other sources of uncertainty which were not considered in this study herein the consideration of multiple model structures lead to an overall inundation uncertainty for the july 21st of 2007 rainfall event of 14 15 a more detailed analysis of the flood inundation extent has shown that uncertainty is highly depending on the focus area at the north of the main urban area it reached 30 87 higher uncertainties were also found spread in smaller areas nearby the buildings within the urban area and on the perimeter of the most upstream boundary of the main urban area the highest uncertainties were found in the most downstream areas because these are collection points for the sewer network system and the overland runoff understanding the location of areas with higher uncertainty is crucial because it allows for better informed decisions accordingly the consideration of multiple model structures when evaluating the flood inundation extent is in the opinion of the authors essential for dealing with uncertainty in the context
