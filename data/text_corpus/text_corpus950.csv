4750,little knowledge has been gained about the mechanics of the sediment transport and riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a karst river because of inadequate data of field investigation and laboratory experiments numerical simulation of mixed flow and sediment transport on moveable riverbed in sinking streams is seldom reported due to difficulties in modeling irregular closed cross sections cs in this study a unified hydrodynamic and sediment transport model is developed for the free surface and the pressurized mixed reaches of a karst river with sinking streams where a technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is proposed to describe and account for an irregular closed cs and its riverbed evolution mechanics of riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a dammed karst river are studied using a real karst river reservoir jiayan reservoir which is still conducted in a data scarce environment under damming effects a delta deposition of sediment develops at the end of reservoir backwater and steps forward it is found that the deposition delta is able to go through the sinking streams while a narrow passage is finally reserved in sinking streams and keeps conveying flow the riverbed elevation of a closed cs mainly determined by the lower one of cs ceiling and reservoir water level is dynamically stable in a dammed karst river a fully developed shrunk sinking stream has periodic morphological dynamics one cycle of which can be described as a successive process of siltation reduction of conveyance area flow lag upstream of sinking streams large hydraulic gradient increase of velocity large sediment transport capacity erosion of closed cs increase of conveyance area sensitivity studies of the parameters of the hydrodynamic and the sediment transport models are performed whose results indicate that the periodic morphological dynamics of a fully developed sinking stream in a dammed karst river is not changed the sinking stream in a dammed karst river will not be silted completely when the condition for forming a large gradient of piezometric head along a sinking stream is not broken by special geomorphologies or anthropogenic influences this fact is supported by both the numerical simulations and our field investigation of sinking streams in an existing karst river reservoir keywords karst river sinking stream irregular closed cross section numerical model mixed flow sediment transport riverbed evolution data scarce environment 1 introduction to alleviate water shortage human beings sometimes have to build dams and construct reservoirs in karst rivers with sinking streams after the impoundment of a karst river reservoir the velocity in the sinking stream reaches is reduced significantly han et al 2018 yu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 followed by the change of sediment transport and riverbed evolution see fig 1 unfortunately little attention has been paid to sediment transport and riverbed evolution of a dammed karst river with sinking streams before zhang et al 2017 although researchers have gained a great deal of knowledge about the sedimentation of open channel reservoirs the sinking streams are formed when the bottom of a mountain in the path of a karst river is eroded by the dissolution of soluble rocks and then an underground flow passage appears the sediment transport and riverbed evolution of the sinking streams in a karst river are complex for the following reasons first a sinking stream may be pressurized because of the low elevation or become pressurized in a large flood period as a result a karst river with sinking streams the open channel and the sinking reaches often appear alternately is often filled with the free surface and the pressurized mixed flow second the passage of a real sinking stream has irregular closed cross sections due to a nonuniform dissolution of soluble rocks third impacts caused by strong anthropogenic activities especially the damming and their mechanics remain unclear traditionally sedimentation of open channel reservoirs is studied by one dimensional 1d numerical models which are not only cheap but also provide fast simulations however a model for open channel reservoirs should be rebuilt or essentially enhanced to stand up to the challenges brought by simulation of the mixed flow and the sediment transport related to the sinking streams in a karst river the details are analyzed as follows mixed flow with frequent transition of flow regimes is highly dynamic yen 2001 and a unified mathematical description as well as a unified solution of the free surface and the pressurized parts are challenging kerger et al 2011 the existing 1d models either describe the mixed flow using two sets of equations tse or a single set of equations ase e g the saint venant equations or their equivalents a tse model such as the rigid column approach li and mccorquodale 1999 zhou et al 2002 and the shock fitting approach fuamba 2002 politano et al 2007 solves the free surface and the pressurized parts separately and tracks pressurization fronts explicitly per bousso et al 2013 a tse model requires a number of assumptions and simplifications and is unable to fully simulate the complex multiphase multi regime and flow instabilities that result from mixed flow an ase model builds a unified formulation applied to the two regimes of mixed flow one sub kind of the ase model called shock capturing model león et al 2009 kerger et al 2011 uses a conservative form of governing equations and adopts riemann solvers bourdarias and gerbi 2008 to capture the physical discontinuousness and track the pressurization fronts automatically a free surface term is not explicitly included in the governing equations of a shock capturing model so additional techniques such as the preissmann slot cunge and wegner 1964 or the two component pressure approach vasconcelos et al 2006 sanders and bradford 2011 are needed to quantify the piezometric head when flow is pressurized another kind of the ase model casulli and stelling 2013 hu et al 2019 uses a nonconservative form of equations where the piezometric head is explicitly described in the momentum equation instead of the two terms of water depth and bed slope the piezometric head means the water level in the case of free surface flows so a unified description of the free surface and the pressurized mixed flow is reached and moreover the two regimes can be synchronously solved casulli and stelling 2013 the aforementioned mixed flow models have laid a solid foundation for the simulation of sinking stream mixed flows however almost all the existing models are developed to simulate the mixed flow in simple passages with regular cross sections such as rectangle or circular pipes in sewer systems a mixed flow model for real sinking streams with irregular closed cross sections is seldom reported zhang et al 2017 simulates a real karst river by assuming that the sinking stream reach is totally pressurized and the left reaches are totally free surface two sets of equations are used to describe the two regimes of the mixed flow whose solutions are coupled by providing boundary conditions for each other this model may not simulate transition of flow regimes and does not simulate a real mixed flow in sinking streams hence further effort is expected to develop sophisticated models for the real sinking stream mixed flow in karst rivers characterized by irregular closed cross sections the simulation of the mixed flow is the foundation of the calculation of sediment transport in sinking streams because of the currently insufficient techniques for modeling the mixed flow in irregular passages a sediment transport model for the riverbed evolution of real sinking streams is seldom developed to our knowledge insufficient modeling techniques have prevented researchers from understanding the mechanics of the riverbed evolution of sinking streams in karst rivers moreover related data collected in field investigation and laboratory experiments for sinking streams is also quite limited as a result little knowledge has been gained about the mechanics of riverbed evolution of real sinking streams for a dammed open channel river a delta deposition of sediment is usually found to develop at the end of backwater and step forward relatively the riverbed evolution of a dammed karst river with sinking streams may be different for a karst river reservoir with sinking streams how will the deposition delta go through a sinking stream see fig 1 under the effect of damming will the sinking streams of a karst river be completely silted further studies are needed to understand the behavior of sediment transport and motion of the deposition body in real karst rivers with sinking streams in this study a technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is proposed to describe and account for the irregular closed cross section of sinking streams in karst rivers and its riverbed evolution using this technique a unified hydrodynamic and sediment transport model is developed for the free surface and the pressurized mixed reaches of karst rivers with sinking streams then the new model is used to study the sediment transport and riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a dammed karst river using a real karst river reservoir project 2 study area to clarify the mechanics of riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a dammed karst river the jiayan reservoir project in the middle liuchong river a first level tributary of wujiang river is taken as an example locating across the bijie and zunyi cities guizhou province southwest of china the normal storage water level of the reservoir is 1323 m besides the inflow of the liuchong river the jiayan reservoir has three other tributaries which are the da river the waga river and the yindi river sequentially see fig 2 the areas of the drainage basin of these three tributaries are 1195 1195 and 535 km2 respectively the reservoir and its tributaries form dendritic river networks where the hydraulic connection among the branches should be considered in a simulation the liuchong river goes through three under mountain passages in the domain of the jiayan reservoir which are respectively named by the large middle and small tianqiao sinking streams the large and middle tianqiao sinking streams are connected by a very short open channel reach and it is denoted by lm sinking the small tianqiao stream is also denoted by s sinking for short a hydrological station named qixingguan is located downstream of outlet of the s sinking stream whose area of drainage basin is 2999 km2 at station qixingguan the annually average discharge in the liuchong river is about 38 m3 s these three sinking streams have irregular closed cross sections ceilings of which are 1379 7 1302 8 1368 5 1311 5 and 1306 6 1289 5 m respectively partial cross sections of these sinking streams are pressurized during large flood periods or when the reservoir is impounded while the others are still free surface as a result the pressurized and the free surface flows alternate in the liuchong river of the jiayan reservoir forming mixed flows in the irregular passages the mixed flows sediment transport and riverbed evolution of the sinking streams are complex the jiayan reservoir is one of the 172 national important hydraulic engineering productions in the 13th 5 year project of china hence sedimentation of the jiayan reservoir has received wide attention if the sinking stream in the tail of the reservoir is completely silted the event will threaten reservoir security and change the flood defense situation of upstream cities to clarify the mechanics of riverbed evolution of the sinking streams is emergent for the jiayan reservoir project and this is also one of the motivations of this study 3 methods first a technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is proposed to describe and account for the irregular closed cross sections in sinking streams and its riverbed evolution second a unified 1d numerical model for the free surface and the pressurized mixed flows in karst river with sinking streams characterized by irregular closed cross sections is developed using a semi implicit formulation of hu et al 2019 2020 third a nonuniform sediment transport model with a source term describing sediment exchange between the flow and the riverbed is developed for simulating the riverbed evolution in both the pressurized and the free surface reaches the resulting new models are applicable to general karst rivers with sinking streams 3 1 governing equations of numerical models the 1d saint venant equations eqs 1 and 2 achieves a unified mathematical description of the free surface and the pressurized mixed flows and they are used as governing equations of the 1d hydrodynamic model 1 b η t a u x 0 2 u t u u x g η x g n m 2 u u r 4 3 where a cross sectional conveyance

sediment is transported in the form of suspended load and nonuniform suspended sediment is calculated using a fraction method the bedload accounting for about 15 of the total load can be calculated approximately by increasing coarse fractions of suspended load for simplicity liu et al 2007 the 1d advection diffusion equation with a source term describing sediment exchange between flow and riverbed is used as the governing equation of the nonuniform suspended load transport and it is given by for fraction k 3 a c k t ua c k x x υ c a c k x α w sk b bed s k c k where k the index of sediment fraction k 1 2 ns ns is the number of fractions ck and s k sediment concentration and the sediment transport capacity of flows for the k th fraction of the nonuniform sediment respectively kg

k th fraction of the sediment m s α sediment recovery coefficient the nonuniform sediment of the liuchong river is divided into 16 fractions the upper limit of which are sequentially 0 005 0 01 0 025 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 2 5 10 25 50 75 100 150 mm the suspended load accounts for the first 8 fractions whose size ranges are sequentially 0 0 005 0 005 0 01 0 01 0 025 0 025 0 05 0 05 0 1 0 01 0 25 0 25 0 5 and 0 5 1 mm the quantity of the bedload is added to fraction 0 5 1 mm the coarsest fraction of suspended load the quantity of the resulting fraction 0 5 1 mm is equal to the quantity of the original fraction 0 5 1 mm and the quantity of the bedload zhang s formula zhang and xie 1989 for the sediment transport capacity of flows is used in the model and given by 4 s k k u 3 gh w sk m where h is the water depth m k and m are coefficients for determining the sediment transport capacity in the present model the zhang s formula and the method of wei et al 1997 are combined to determine the fractional sediment transport capacities for the fractions of nonuniform sediment corresponding to eq 4 the riverbed deformation caused by the transport of the k th fraction of nonuniform sediment is described by 5 ρ a bk t α w sk b bed c k s k where abk riverbed deformation caused by the k th fraction sediment m ρ dry density of bed materials kg m3 the gradation of the bed materials is also updated using the method of wei et al 1997 zhang s formula is widely accepted in evaluating the sediment transport capacity of flows in real applications in china according to a large number of applications the proper k and m for the simulations of real reservoir sedimentation are 0 03 and 0 92 respectively moreover the α is set to 1 0 and 0 25 respectively in the case of erosion and deposition of sediment han and he 1984 generally in data scarce environment this study is just a data scarce case the aforementioned values for k m and α are used as default 3 2 computational grid and description of mixed flows in karst river networks with sinking streams both the free surface and the pressurized reaches are divided by 1d cells the ne and ns are used to denote respectively the quantities of cells and sides in the computational grid and every cell side has a unique global cell side index a staggered grid of variable arrangement is used see fig 3 the u is defined at side centers i 1 2 i 1 2 whereas the η and the c are defined at cell centroids i 1 i 1 a cross section cs with general topographical data is arranged at the center of each cell and the geometry of a cell is described by the following variables for cell i δxi represents the length of the 1d cell bi is the wet surface width and is related to ηi that varies with respect to time ai represents the conveyance area of the cs located at the center of cell i for side j i 1 2 which connects cells i and i 1 δxi 1 2 is the distance between the centers of cells i and i 1 ai 1 2 and ri 1 2 are the conveyance area and the hydraulic radius at side j respectively and they are interpolated from those of neighboring cells cells i and i 1 the cells of the closed and nonclosed cs are distinguished by a mark clo clo is set to 1 for closed cs cells and set to 0 for nonclosed cs in the input files the closed cs cells are further distinguished according to their flow regimes denoted by a mark pre pre is set to 1 when the flow of the cs is pressurized and set to 0 when the cs has a regime of free surface flow the cells in all the free surface and the pressurized parts of the channel together contribute to the construction of an algebraic system 3 3 technique of symmetric shadow subgrid traditionally a subgrid method is used to describe the topography of an irregular cs in 1d models for open channel flows hec 2010 mike11 2014 applying a stepwise approximation to a cs the topography of a subgrid can be represented by the average elevation z b j of its two nodes see fig 3 only wet subgrids whose z b j are below the water surface take part in the calculation of hydraulic parameters the horizontal distances or the length of all the wet subgrids are summed to get the free surface width and the wet perimeter for an irregular open channel cs described by np discretization points the conveyance area can be calculated as 6 a j 1 np 1 y j 1 y j η z b j where y the coordinate in the cs direction j index of subgrid at the cs z b j average elevation of subgrid j then the hydraulic radius is calculated using the conveyance area and wet perimeter to be different with the open channel cs a closed cs generally at least has a left and a right turning point denoted by pl and pr respectively the two turning points divide a closed cs into a bottom and a top part in fig 4 a c using a series of closed cs with gradually increased irregularity we clarify the difficulty in describing and simulating the mixed flow sediment transport and riverbed evolution of an irregular closed cs by traditional subgrid methods then to overcome deficiencies of the traditional subgrid methods a technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is proposed as shown in fig 4d for a regular closed cs fig 4a it is found that a division of subgrids have two properties 1 the pl and the pr are at the same elevation 2 every subgrid on the bottom part has a corresponding subgrid on the top part and the two have the same horizontal range such a corresponding subgrid on the top part can be defined as the shadow subgrid of the bottom subgrid with these two advantages hydraulic parameters of a regular closed cs can be easily calculated however these two advantages of the subgrid division of a regular closed cs may vanish for generally irregular closed cs for an irregular closed cs in real sinking streams the pl and the pr usually have different elevations moreover in a field survey of the closed cs in sinking streams the distribution of the discretization points for recording topography is nonuniform as a result the top shadow subgrid corresponding to a bottom subgrid of a closed cs does not exist at all in this case hydraulic parameters of an irregular closed cs may have to be evaluated using a method of calculating several zones according to the different elevations of the left and the right turning points e g zone 1 2 in fig 4b and zone 1 5 in fig 4c in these cases it is difficult to describe and account for an irregular closed cs and its riverbed evolution especially when the cs experiences a temporarily unpredictable morphological dynamics because of sediment transport to solve the aforementioned dilemma a technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is proposed to describe and account for the irregular closed cs and its riverbed evolution in sinking streams the technique includes two parts respectively a preconditioning and a merging technique of top bottom symmetric subgrids the proposed preconditioning technique of symmetric subgrids described in fig 4d takes three steps first only the discretization points of the bottom part and the two turning points are reserved for which the number is denoted by np b if necessary the subgrids on the bottom part are refined by inserting extra discretization points second a shadow point on the top part is obtained by interpolation for each discretized point on the bottom part using the vertical line through the latter third based on shadow points subgrids are reconstructed for the top part of the closed cs in the resulting new division of the irregular closed cs the discretization points and the subgrids on the bottom and the top parts are symmetric at this time a bottom subgrid and its top shadow subgrid can work as one subgrid defined as a connected subgrid in all the calculations of the mixed flow sediment transport and riverbed evolution in sinking streams then the evaluation of the hydraulic parameters of an irregular closed cs can be as easy as that of a regular closed cs for example the conveyance area of an irregular closed cs with symmetric subgrids can be calculated as see fig 4d 7 a j 1 n p b 1 y j 1 y j min η z b j s h a d o w z b j where z b j s h a d o w average elevation of the shadow subgrid corresponding to subgrid j at the bottom part benefiting from the connected subgrid the calculation of the riverbed evolution of irregular closed cs is very convenient riverbed deformation because of sediment transport generally happens only on the bottom part of a closed cs calculation of the riverbed erosion of a subgrid of a closed cs can be done in a similar way to that of an open channel cs in the case of sediment deposition a common case for a dammed reservoir the riverbed of a bottom subgrid in a closed cs will be elevated with the elevation of its shadow subgrid being as an upper limit when the riverbed of a bottom subgrid is elevated and reaches its upper limit it means that the bottom subgrid and its top shadow subgrid are merged as well as that the connected subgrid is completely silted generally under the influence of the friction of solid walls the velocity of the flow in a closed cs is smaller near the wall and larger near the center region forming a flow core in the center of the cs sediment transport is sensitive to flow velocity so siltation is easy on the two sides of a closed cs while the erosion there is difficult as a result it is not easy for a completely silted connected subgrid on two sides of a closed cs to be eroded and this paper assume that they will not experience an unmerged process of subgrids in simulations of sediment transport and riverbed evolution moreover because the bottom subgrids on the left and right sides of a closed cs have relatively low top shadow subgrids the complete siltation of the connected subgrids begins on the two sides of a closed cs as shown in fig 5 using the merging technique of the symmetric subgrids the deposition process of an irregular closed cs can be described in fig 5 according to the aforementioned details the proposed technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is applicable to any arbitrarily irregular closed cs which has one left and one right turning point 3 4 hydrodynamic and sediment transport model based on the technique of symmetric shadow subgrid our former 1d numerical models for the mixed flows and scalar transport hu et al 2019 2020 are rebuilt for the simulation of karst rivers with sinking streams the hydrodynamic model follows a semi implicit eulerian lagrangian formulation the discretization of the governing equations for one branch of the karst river networks is first introduced the momentum equation is solved within a finite difference framework and using an operator splitting technique to eliminate the stability restrictions imposed by rapid gravity waves the θ semi implicit method casulli and zanolli 2002 casulli and stelling 2013 is used to discretize the gradient of piezometric head in two parts a point wise eulerian lagrangian method elm using a multistep backward euler technique dimou 1992 zhang et al 2004 is used to solve the advection term when the advection term has been solved by the elm the u is updated and denoted by ubt for side i 1 2 the discretized momentum equation is given by 8 1 g δ t n m 2 u bt i 1 2 n r i 1 2 n 4 3 u i 1 2 n 1 u bt i 1 2 n 1 θ g δ t η i 1 n η i n δ x i 1 2 θ g δ t η i 1 n 1 η i n 1 δ x i 1 2 where θ is the implicit factor δt is the time step superscript n indicates time level n and the riverbed friction is discretized using ubt and un 1 to enhance computational stability when explicit terms of the discretized momentum equation are incorporated the unknowns cell piezometric heads of time level n 1 ηn 1 emerge and eq 8 is then transformed into the following form 9 u i 1 2 n 1 g i 1 2 n f i 1 2 n θ δ t g 1 f i 1 2 n η i 1 n 1 η i n 1 δ x i 1 2 where f i 1 2 n 1 g δ t n m 2 u bt i 1 2 n r i 1 2 n 4 3 g i 1 2 n u bt i 1 2 n 1 θ g δ t η i 1 n η i n δ x i 1 2 and g i 1 2 n f i 1 2 n can be regarded as a provisional solution provisional velocity by solving the explicit terms corresponding to the discretized momentum equations the continuity equation eq 1 is discretized using the implicit factor θ within a finite volume framework as follows at cell i 10 b i n δ x i η i n 1 η i n θ δ t a i 1 2 n u i 1 2 n 1 a i 1 2 n u i 1 2 n 1 1 θ δ t a i 1 2 n u i 1 2 n a i 1 2 n u i 1 2 n the velocity pressure coupling of the karst river networks is solved locally based on domain decomposition using a prediction correction method hu et al 2015a 2015b benefiting from local solutions the flow model only needs to solve pure 1d problems of mixed flows the flow model requires only the solution of 1d subsystems for branches while solution of large multi dimensional algebraic systems for the whole networks is not needed for each branch the velocity pressure coupling is performed by substituting eq 9 into eq 10 to construct a subsystem with the η as unknowns at the two end cells of a branch all the neighboring cells in other branches supply water levels as boundary conditions to close the subsystem the subsystem is a tridiagonal linear system with a symmetric and positive definite coefficient matrix and can be solved directly when constructions of the subsystems have been complete for all the branches a two step solution a prediction step and a correction step is carried out to couple the solutions of the subsystems the subsystems for branches are solved to obtain the final solutions ηn 1 once the ηn 1 has been obtained the un 1 defined at side centers is calculated using eq 9 the sediment transport model uses a fully explicit finite volume formulation as follows where the index of sediment fraction is omitted 11 c i n 1 c bt i n 1 δ t a i n δ x i υ c i 1 2 n a i 1 2 n c i 1 n c i n δ x i 1 2 υ c i 1 2 n a i 1 2 n c i n c i 1 n δ x i 1 2 δ t a i n α w s b bed i s i c i where cbt is the solution of the advection term using a 1d flux form elm hu et al 2020 the 1d flux form elm applied to the transport model has the advantages of mass conservative allow large time steps for which the courant friedrichs lewy number can be greater than 1 well parallelizable benefiting from the advantages of the 1d flux form elm an accurate and highly efficient simulation can be achieved for each fraction of the nonuniform sediment one transport equation of eq 11 must be solved moreover because the sediment transport model is advanced fully explicitly the extension of eq 11 to solve the sediment transport for a junction cell in the karst river networks is straightforward 3 5 computational conditions of simulations the new 1d numerical model is used to study the mechanics of the sediment transport and riverbed evolution of sinking streams in real dammed karst rivers using the jiayan reservoir project the liuchong river and its tributaries in the domain of the jiayan reservoir form dendritic river networks which is divided by a grid of 267 cells the grid scale is 200 300 m and 100 150 m respectively for the open channel reaches and the sinking streams the bathymetry dataset and the hydrological data are provided by the hydrological departments of the yangtze river water conservancy commission yrwcc and the guizhou survey and design research institute for water resources and hydropower gsdriwrh in tests the time step of the model is set to 60 s and a sub time step of 6 s is used in the backtracking of both the elm in the hydrodynamic model and the flux form elm in the sediment transport model the semi implicit factor θ was set to 0 6 the manning s roughness coefficient nm is set to 0 04 0 05 as default which is provided by the gsdriwrh while the coefficient of the sediment carrying capacity k is set to be 0 03 the topographical data of 2011 is used as the initial topography the measured data of bed materials in july 2012 is used to set the initial gradation of the nonuniform bed materials four inflows from the liuchong the da the waga and the yindi rivers are received stored by the jiayan reservoir and then drained downstream the serial hydrological year of 1971 1990 is used as the hydrological process of forecast simulations the quantities of the runoff and the sediment load in 1971 1990 in these four inflows are listed in table 1 the daily river discharge and sediment concentration of 1971 1990 are imposed at inflow boundaries the downstream open boundary is forced by the daily water level before the dam in 1971 1990 and two cases are considered in case 1 the daily water level before dam is kept constant at the normal storage water level of the reservoir 1323 m which is an extreme case of reservoir operation in case 2 the daily water level before the dam is determined by a real operation of the reservoir as shown in fig 6 which is provided by the gsdriwrh the serial hydrological years of 1971 1990 is cycled to make a hydrological series of 100 years which is long enough in terms of a full riverbed evolution of sinking streams in the preliminary tests then a 100 year unsteady process of mixed flows sediment transport and riverbed evolution are simulated to study the morphological dynamics of sinking streams in a dammed karst river simulations are done under case 1 and 2 the simulations of case 1 are denoted by constant z while those of case 2 are denoted by dynamic z 4 results 4 1 sensitivity study of model parameters obtaining of the parameters of the hydrodynamic and sediment transport models is challenging for data scarce areas a parameter sensitivity study will be helpful to clarify the representativeness of the model parameters and help further understand simulation results of the complex dynamic system of sinking streams the aforementioned 100 year unsteady hydrological process is used to perform a sensitivity study of parameters of the hydrodynamic model nm and the sediment transport model k under the condition of dynamic z first the model is tested on the gradually increased nm which is sequentially 0 032 0 035 0 038 0 041 and 0 045 to clarify the influence of nm on the simulations of riverbed evolution of sinking streams under different nm variations of the cross sectional area a during the 100 year reservoir operation are plotted in fig 7 a cs62 is taken as an example and variations of the average gradient of piezometric head along a sinking stream sf are shown in fig 7b the s sinking stream is taken as an example as shown in fig 7a generally seasonal variability of the cs topography of sinking streams is characterized by three periods respectively the deposition the erosion and the quasi balanced periods the first period is after the flood season of the last year and before the flood season of this year when small inflow and high downstream water level lead to low velocity and sediment transport capacity in sinking streams the cs area of sinking streams is continuously reduced and reaches its minimum value amin at the end of the deposition period the flood season may be divided into a main and a tail flood seasons corresponding to the erosion and quasi balanced periods the second period has large inflow and low downstream water level when the riverbed of the sinking stream is rapidly eroded the cs area of the sinking streams reaches its maximum value amax at the end of the erosion period in the third period effects of large inflow and low downstream water level are weakened and little change in the cs area can be observed which implies that a quasi balance of the sinking streams is reached then riverbed evolution of the cs of sinking streams turns to the next cycle in the sensitivity study of nm on the one hand it is found that the smaller the nm is the smaller the amin and the amax will be under smaller nm the higher flow velocity in the deposition delta reach upstream a sinking stream leads to higher sediment transport capacity resulting that more sediment in upstream reaches is carried downstream and arrives at the sinking streams hence under smaller nm the cs of a sinking stream is likely to suffer from more siltation in the deposition period characterized by a smaller amin with a larger upstream sediment transport rate it is more difficult for the cs of sinking streams to expand in the erosion period characterized by a smaller amax on the other hand the sf is not sensitive to the nm in flood seasons while it increases with respect to nm slightly in dry periods fig 7b under smaller nm the back of the deposition delta is overall lower than that in a simulation using bigger nm but differences of the longitudinal thalwegs under different nm fig 7c are minor second the model is tested on the gradually increased k which is sequentially 0 02 0 025 0 03 0 035 and 0 04 to clarify the influence of k on simulation results under different k variations of the a during the 100 year operation are plotted in fig 8 a cs62 and variations of the sf are in fig 8b s sinking stream in the sensitivity study of k on the one hand it is found that the smaller the k is the larger the amin and the amax will be under the smaller k and the resulting lower sediment transport capacity in reaches upstream a sinking stream less sediment in the upstream reaches is carried downstream which alleviates the siltation in the downstream sinking streams as a result under smaller k the cs of a sinking stream has a lower speed of siltation in the deposition period with a smaller upstream sediment transport rate it is also easier for the cs of a sinking stream to keep a relatively larger amax at end of the erosion period on the other hand the sf is not sensitive to the k in flood seasons while the sf in dry seasons decreases with respect to the k slightly fig 8b under a smaller k the back of the deposition delta is overall elevated and higher than that in a simulation using bigger k but differences of the longitudinal thalwegs under different nm fig 8c are minor overall according to the simulations under different nm and k the periodic morphological dynamics of a fully developed sinking stream this will be introduced in section 4 2 and 4 3 is not changed 4 2 predicted morphological dynamics 4 2 1 evolution of deposition delta and longitudinal thalweg in the 100 year unsteady process of mixed flows and sediment transport variation of the river thalweg in the longitudinal direction of the reservoir is plotted in fig 9 under the effect of damming a delta deposition of sediment develops at the end of backwater in the karst river and steps forward similar to the sedimentation of an open channel reservoir moreover the deposition deltas in case 1 and case 2 have different speed of movement and different longitudinal gradient because of the different downstream water level the case 1 is an extreme case of reservoir operation with the downstream water level being kept at the normal storage water level it takes about 30 years for the deposition delta to reach the entrance of the lm sinking stream then it is found that the delta deposition of sediment is able to go through the sinking streams the pivot point of the deposition delta reaches the outlets of the lm sinking and s sinking streams respectively after about 40 and 55 years after the deposition delta has gone through the sinking streams the evolution of the closed cs sharply slows down and a narrow passage is reserved in sinking streams and keeps conveying flow the topography of a closed cs mainly determined by the lower one of cs ceiling and reservoir water level is dynamically stable at 100 years the pivot point of the deposition delta reaches a position about 31 km from dam the case 2 represents a common case of reservoir operation under the effect of a frequently lowered reservoir water level the movement of the deposition delta in case 2 is much faster than that in case 1 the pivot point of the deposition delta reaches the outlets of the lm sinking and s sinking streams respectively at about 25 and 40 years after the operation of the reservoir as a result the topography of the sinking streams reaches a dynamically stable state in case 2 about 15 years earlier than in case 1 in both case 1 and 2 the sinking streams are not completely silted after the deposition delta has passed through them relative to case 1 case 2 which has a lower downstream water level leads to a larger sediment transport rate in the sinking streams moreover in case 2 the surface of the deposition delta is no more horizontal but has a gradient of about 6 8 10 4 under a larger sediment transport rate and steeper longitudinal riverbed the riverbed deformation of a low closed cs is more sensitive to flow intensity in case 2 than in case 1 in case 2 when the downstream water level is elevated again riverbed of a low closed cs will be rapidly deposited an accumulative effect of these processes leads to a higher riverbed elevation in case 2 than in case 1 at the low closed cs as shown in fig 9 the vertical distance between the lowest riverbed of sinking streams and the surface of the deposition delta is 39 5 m 1280 5 1320 0 m in case 1 and it is reduced to about 31 0 m 1285 0 1316 0 m in case 2 the curve of the longitudinal thalweg in deposited sinking stream acts just like a bungee which is tightened under the effect of a frequently lowered downstream water level 4 2 2 evolution of cross sections in sinking streams in sinking streams the closed cs with a remarkably low ceiling is representative three such css are used to analyze the evolution of the three sinking streams which are respectively cs51 cs62 and cs90 from upstream to downstream in the 100 year unsteady process of the mixed flows and sediment transport riverbed evolutions of the three typical css are shown in fig 10 in the last several years of the 100 year operation of the reservoir variation of the cross sectional conveyance area is listed in table 2 in the initial stage of reservoir sedimentation the deposition delta has not reached the sinking streams at this time the cs of the sinking streams experience only a minor deposition with a thin layer of sediment covering the riverbed when the deposition delta steps through the sinking streams the cs there begins to shrink rapidly in this process riverbed of the closed cs is elevated when the riverbeds of the bottom subgrids on both sides of a closed cs gradually reach the elevation of its shadow subgrid these subgrids are merged the deposition of riverbed and the merging of subgrids tend to be slowed down when the deposition delta has fully passed through the sinking streams after that the riverbed of the closed cs experiences an intensive erosion in flood events or low water level periods and then recovers to its original deposition state in the next dry season a dynamically stable state of the conveyance area is finally kept at these closed css in sinking streams in case 2 the dynamically stable state of the conveyance area reaches at about 30 40 40 50 and 50 60 years after the reservoir operation respectively at cs51 cs62 and cs90 in case 2 the range of variation in the conveyance area is generally 15 42 m2 at the three css relatively the conveyance area of cs51 cs62 and cs90 reaches their dynamically stable states much slower in case 1 than case 2 in case 1 at the end of the 100 year simulation a slow reduction of the conveyance area of these closed cs is still kept and the range of variation in the conveyance area at the three css is 42 123 m2 in the last several years 4 3 mechanics of riverbed evolution of sinking streams in this section first we attempt to study the reasons why a sinking stream in a dammed karst river will not be silted completely for this purpose the variations of the cross sectional sediment transport capacity at the typical css cs51 cs62 and cs90 during the 100 year operation are plotted in fig 11 and analyzed it is found that when the deposited shrunk sinking stream meets a flood event or the period of low water level of the reservoir the cross sectional sediment transport capacity in the narrow passage can reach as large as 100 kg m3 as a result the sinking stream with a narrow passage will experience sharp erosion and then the conveyance area of the closed cs is enlarged hence the narrow passage will be kept in sinking streams second we continue to explain how large sediment transport capacity happens in a deposited shrunk sinking stream for this purpose variations of the average gradient of piezometric head along a sinking stream sf in the 100 year operation are plotted in fig 12 it is found that in the final decade of the 100 year operation the ability of the sinking stream in conveying water is sharply reduced by its shrunk cs because of sediment deposition and a great deal of inflow is lagged upstream of the entrance of the sinking streams in flood events or low water level periods hence large gradient of piezometric head is formed along the deposited sinking stream as shown in fig 12 gradients of piezometric head may be as large as 0 01 along the lm sinking and the s sinking streams large pressure gradient leads to large flow velocity and then large sediment transport capacity along the narrow passage in the deposited sinking streams in flood events or low water level periods therefore in a dammed karst river a fully developed shrunk sinking stream has periodic morphological dynamics one cycle of which can be described as a successive process of siltation reduction of conveyance area flow lag upstream of sinking streams large hydraulic gradient increase of velocity large sediment transport capacity erosion of closed cs increase of conveyance area after the dynamic processes of one cycle evolution of a sinking stream enters the time of sediment siltation in the next cycle however the periodic morphological dynamic of a sinking stream may become irregular due to the randomness of the upstream inflow events and the downstream dynamic water levels of complex reservoir operations 4 4 possible siltation of sinking streams there are many factors conditions in hydrology geomorphology anthropogenic impacts and so on that may influence the riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a dammed karst river the development of hydropower reservoirs in karst rivers in china is still at its initial stage the samples of the karst river reservoir with sinking streams are now scarce although the number of them may be considerable in future after a deep development of hydropower in karst rivers currently the limited samples do not allow that knowledge of the riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a dammed karst river is built in terms of statistical analysis in this background the paper studies the sedimentation of dammed karst rivers in terms of mechanics see section 4 3 based on the aforementioned simulations the reason why a sinking stream in a dammed karst river will not be completely silted has been attributed to the large gradient of the piezometric head and the resulting large velocity and sediment transport capacity along a fully shrunk sinking stream these factors prevent the narrow passage of a sinking stream from being completely silted a 20 year hydrological process used to conduct simulations has included various hydrology conditions e g the extremely rainy and dry years all the simulations indicate that the narrow passage of the fully shrunk sinking stream is not completely silted in each of the hydrology years while sensitivity studies of the model parameters also enhance this conclusion hence this conclusion can be potentially generalized to the sink streams in dammed karst rivers with different hydrology conditions however siltation of a sinking stream in a dammed karst river is possible when the condition for forming large gradients of piezometric head along a sinking stream is broken by special geomorphology or anthropogenic influences for example if there are low breaches in solid walls or underground leakage passages in the river reaches upstream of a sinking stream namely a special geomorphology the water lagged there in flood periods may find a way out for another example if a manmade flow diversion construction e g a water intake or tunnel for releasing floods is built upstream of a sinking stream the water lagged there in flood periods may be pumped or diverted away in these cases the gradient of the piezometric head along a sinking stream will be considerably reduced because of the absence of the lagged water upstream of a sinking stream without the effect of a large pressure gradient along the sinking stream the passage of a sinking stream is to be completely silted without the aforementioned special geomorphology or anthropogenic influences the karst river sinking stream along which large pressure gradient can be kept in flood periods will not be completely silted by sedimentation such as the jiayan reservoir of this study 5 discussions the contributions of this study include two first a unified hydrodynamic and sediment transport model is developed for the free surface and pressurized mixed reaches of karst rivers with sinking streams second the mechanics of sediment transport and riverbed evolution in a kart river with sinking streams is clarified 5 1 new techniques of numerical model according to the introduction although the 1d mixed flow models for regular cross sections have been widely studied but the problem of simulating the mixed flows in passages with irregular closed cross sections has not been well solved yet moreover a sediment transport and riverbed deformation model for the flow passages with irregular closed cross sections is also seldom reported the insufficient modeling techniques have prevented the researchers from understanding the mechanics of riverbed evolution of the sinking streams in kart rivers after analysis we find that one key difficulty in modeling sinking streams is to find a technique which is capable of describing and accounting for the irregular closed cross sections of sinking streams and its riverbed evolution especially when the cross section experiences complex riverbed deformations in this study a technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is proposed to describe and account for the irregular closed cross sections of the sinking streams in karst rivers and their riverbed evolution based on this technique our former 1d numerical models for the mixed flows and scalar transport hu et al 2019 2020 are rebuilt for the simulation of the sinking streams in karst rivers the technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is simple and functional to our best knowledge this is the first time that a numerical model for the mixed flow the sediment transport and the riverbed evolution in real irregular closed passages is reported 5 2 riverbed evolution of sinking streams this study is conducted in a data scarce area in simulations the manning s coefficient nm is provided by the hydrological department of the gsdriwrh besides the coefficient of sediment carrying capacity k is set to 0 03 in zhang s formula according to the experience obtained in a number of simulations of real open channel reservoir sedimentation for a fully deposited shrunk sinking stream in a dammed karst river the calculated sediment transport capacity can be as large as 100 kg m3 in flood events because of large hydraulic gradient because of the resulting high velocity and sediment transport capacity the sinking stream in a dammed karst river will be not silted completely to our knowledge this may be the first time that the process of riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a dammed karst river is completely simulated with mechanics being clarified flow condition in a sinking stream varies considerably in different seasons and downstream water levels which determines that the sediment transport may be in varying forms of suspended load and bedload unfortunately a theory of sediment transport in a sinking stream has never been reported in literatures yet in this study we have to use a formula for the open channels to calculate the sediment transport capacity in sinking streams moreover in a data scarce area a validation of the accuracy of the numerical model is difficult the model parameters can only be set according to the experience of applications of open channel reservoirs to enhance the reasonability of the simulation results on the one hand a parameter sensitivity study of the hydrodynamic model and sediment transport models is conducted on the other hand a field investigation is also conducted in a neighboring karst river reservoir with sinking streams namely the dina reservoir the dina reservoir locates in the youcai reach of the middle liuchong river across the dafang and nayong counties guizhou province china just downstream of the jiayan reservoir the areas of the catchments at the cross sections of the lm and the tiziyan sinking streams are respectively 2999 and 4573 km2 a sinking stream named tiziyan is 650 m upstream of the dam of the dina reservoir in 2003 before impoundment of the dina reservoir the elevation of the riverbed at the dam is 1168 m while that at the entrance of the tiziyan sinking stream is 1172 1174 m the normal storage water level of the dina reservoir is 1184 m resulting in a water depth of about 10 12 m at the entrance of the tiziyan sinking stream and a short backwater during the impoundment of the dina reservoir the water level at the outlet of the tiziyan sinking stream is elevated by about 12 14 m the assessment of environmental impact was not conducted for the dina reservoir and survey of topographical data was limited to local area of the dam hence we may not have more information to quantify the detailed morphological changes of the tiziyan sinking stream since the operation of the reservoir in 2005 10 fortunately two sets of pictures of the outlet of the tiziyan sinking stream respectively taken in march 2003 before impoundment of the reservoir and november 2019 may help us understand the evolution of the tiziyan sinking stream as shown in fig 13 with the same elevation being marked two points can be summarized about morphological dynamic in the tiziyan sinking stream after a 15 year operation of the reservoir first it is found that the deposition delta has gone through the tiziyan sinking stream within the past 15 years with its head being shown outside the sinking stream in the form of band sand the elevation of the new sand is shown to be higher than the water level of the reservoir about 1182 1184 m indicating a deposition of about 15 m there second water is still allowed to be conveyed through the sinking stream implying that the tiziyan sinking stream has not been silted completely the two points are consistent with the results of the simulations of this paper which qualitatively reveals that our numerical model produces reasonable results 5 3 sedimentation of sinking streams under different backwaters cross sections of the sinking stream in a dammed karst river begin to experience remarkable siltation after the deposition delta developed in the tail of the reservoir has reached and gone through the sinking stream the time which the deposition delta spends on moving from the end of the reservoir backwater to the sinking stream is denoted by δt the δt is determined by two factors the first is the distance between the end of the backwater and the sinking stream the nearer the end of the backwater the smaller the δt is the second is the reservoir storage upstream the sinking stream a large storage can trap more sediment and will result in a smaller speed of the movement of the deposition delta and at the same time a larger δt for a given karst river with a sinking stream see fig 14 either a high dam or low dam may be built according to the requirement of the development of local regions water depth upstream the sinking stream h under a high dam is larger than that under a low dam a large h implies that the end of the backwater is far away from the sinking stream and that the water region upstream the sinking stream will provide a large storage for trapping sediment hence in case of a high dam it will take a lot of time for the deposition delta developed in the tail of the reservoir to move and reach the sinking stream in case of a low dam with a smaller distance and a larger speed of the movement of the deposition delta the δt required by movement of the deposition delta will be reduced under the same runoff and inflow sediment the jiayan and the dina reservoirs both locate in the middle liuchong river with the latter being at the downstream on the one hand the h upstream the lm sinking stream in the jiayan reservoir is 33 m while that upstream the tiziyan sinking stream in the dina reservoir is 10 12 m on the other hand the annually averaged quantities of sediment transported by runoff in the reach of the jiayan and the dina reservoirs are 238 104 and 436 104 t year respectively for the two reasons the deposition delta of the dina reservoir will go through the sinking stream much earlier than that of the jiayan reservoir in our simulations the case of dynamic z the pivot point of the deposition delta reaches the outlet of the lm sinking stream at about 25 years after the operation of reservoir at the same time according to the field pictures fig 14 it takes less than 15 years for the deposition delta to go through the sinking stream in the dina reservoir 6 conclusions first a unified hydrodynamic and sediment transport model is developed for the free surface and the pressurized mixed reaches of a karst river with sinking streams where a technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is proposed to describe and account for an irregular closed cs and its riverbed evolution to our best knowledge this is the first time that a 1d numerical model for the mixed flow and sediment transport on moveable riverbed in real irregular closed passages is reported second the mechanic of sediment transport and riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a dammed karst river is studied using the numerical model in the background of a real karst river reservoir the jiayan reservoir which is also conducted in a data scarce environment the simulations of a hydrological series of 100 years are done under a conventional operation of reservoir dynamic z and an extreme case of high reservoir water level constant z respectively using different model parameters the new findings are as follows 1 in both the scenarios of constant z and dynamic z under damming effects a delta deposition of sediment develops at the end of reservoir backwater and steps forward the deposition delta is able go through the sinking streams in the process of the movement of the deposition delta the closed cs in sinking streams shrinks rapidly finally a narrow passage is reserved in the sinking streams and keeps conveying flow topography of a cs in sinking streams experiences intensive erosion in flood events or low water level periods and then recovers to its original deposition state in a following period the topography of the sinking stream closed cs mainly determined by the lower one of the cs ceiling and the reservoir water level is dynamically stable 2 in a dammed karst river a fully developed sinking stream has periodic morphological dynamics one cycle of which can be described as a successive process of siltation reduction of conveyance area flow lag upstream of sinking streams large hydraulic gradient increase of velocity large sediment transport capacity erosion of closed cs increase of conveyance area 3 the conveyance area of the cs of a sinking stream reaches its dynamically stable states slower in case of constant z than dynamic z moreover the curve of the longitudinal thalweg in fully deposited sinking streams is found to have an interesting bungee property where the vertical distance between the lowest riverbed of sinking streams and the surface of the deposition delta is reduced in case of dynamic z it is related to the larger sediment transport rate under the effect of the lowered reservoir water level in case of dynamic z 4 sensitivity studies of the parameters of the hydrodynamic and the sediment transport models are performed whose results indicate that the periodic morphological dynamics of a fully developed sinking stream in a dammed karst river is not changed the sinking stream in a dammed karst river will not be silted completely when the condition for forming a large gradient of piezometric head along a sinking stream is not broken by special geomorphologies or anthropogenic influences this fact is supported by both the numerical simulations and our field investigation of sinking streams in an existing karst river reservoir credit

4750,little knowledge has been gained about the mechanics of the sediment transport and riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a karst river because of inadequate data of field investigation and laboratory experiments numerical simulation of mixed flow and sediment transport on moveable riverbed in sinking streams is seldom reported due to difficulties in modeling irregular closed cross sections cs in this study a unified hydrodynamic and sediment transport model is developed for the free surface and the pressurized mixed reaches of a karst river with sinking streams where a technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is proposed to describe and account for an irregular closed cs and its riverbed evolution mechanics of riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a dammed karst river are studied using a real karst river reservoir jiayan reservoir which is still conducted in a data scarce environment under damming effects a delta deposition of sediment develops at the end of reservoir backwater and steps forward it is found that the deposition delta is able to go through the sinking streams while a narrow passage is finally reserved in sinking streams and keeps conveying

fact is supported by both the numerical simulations and our field investigation of sinking streams in an existing karst river reservoir keywords karst river sinking stream irregular closed cross section numerical model mixed flow sediment transport riverbed evolution data scarce environment 1 introduction to alleviate water shortage human beings sometimes have to build dams and construct reservoirs in karst rivers with sinking streams after the impoundment of a karst river reservoir the velocity in the sinking stream reaches is reduced significantly han et al 2018 yu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 followed by the change of sediment transport and riverbed evolution see fig 1 unfortunately little attention has been paid to sediment transport and riverbed evolution of a dammed karst river with sinking streams before zhang et al 2017 although researchers have gained a great deal of knowledge about the sedimentation of open channel reservoirs the sinking streams are formed when the bottom of a mountain in the path of a karst river is eroded by the dissolution of soluble rocks and then an underground flow passage appears the sediment transport and riverbed evolution of the sinking streams in a karst river are complex for the following reasons first a sinking stream may be pressurized because of the low elevation or become pressurized in a large flood period as a result a karst river with sinking streams the open channel and the sinking reaches often appear alternately is often filled with the free surface and the pressurized mixed flow second the passage of a real sinking stream has irregular closed cross sections due to a nonuniform dissolution of soluble rocks third impacts caused by strong anthropogenic activities especially the damming and their mechanics remain unclear traditionally sedimentation of open channel reservoirs is studied by one dimensional 1d numerical models which are not only cheap but also provide fast simulations however a model for open channel reservoirs should be rebuilt or essentially enhanced to stand up to the challenges brought by simulation of the mixed flow and the sediment transport related to the sinking streams in a karst river the details are analyzed as follows mixed flow with frequent transition of flow regimes is highly dynamic yen 2001 and a unified mathematical description as well as a unified solution of the free surface and the pressurized parts are challenging kerger et al 2011 the existing 1d models either describe the mixed flow using two sets of equations tse or a single set of equations ase e g the saint venant equations or their equivalents a tse model such as the rigid column approach li and mccorquodale 1999 zhou et al 2002 and the shock fitting approach fuamba 2002 politano et al 2007 solves the free surface and the pressurized parts separately and tracks pressurization fronts explicitly per bousso et al 2013 a tse model requires a number of assumptions and simplifications and is unable to fully simulate the complex multiphase multi regime and flow instabilities that result from mixed flow an ase model builds a unified formulation applied to the two regimes of mixed flow one sub kind of the ase model called shock capturing model león et al 2009 kerger et al 2011 uses a conservative form of governing equations and adopts riemann solvers bourdarias and gerbi 2008 to capture the physical discontinuousness and track the pressurization fronts automatically a free surface term is not explicitly included in the governing equations of a shock capturing model so additional techniques such as the preissmann slot cunge and wegner 1964 or the two component pressure approach vasconcelos et al 2006 sanders and bradford 2011 are needed to quantify the piezometric head when flow is pressurized another kind of the ase model casulli and stelling 2013 hu et al 2019 uses a nonconservative form of equations where the piezometric head is explicitly described in the momentum equation instead of the two terms of water depth and bed slope the piezometric head means the water level in the case of free surface flows so a unified description of the free surface and the pressurized mixed flow is reached and moreover the two regimes can be synchronously solved casulli and stelling 2013 the aforementioned mixed flow models have laid a solid foundation for the simulation of sinking stream mixed flows however almost all the existing models are developed to simulate the mixed flow in simple passages with regular cross sections such as rectangle or circular pipes in sewer systems a mixed flow model for real sinking streams with irregular closed cross sections is seldom reported zhang et al 2017 simulates a real karst river by assuming that the sinking stream reach is totally pressurized and the left reaches are totally free surface two sets of equations are used to describe the two regimes of the mixed flow whose solutions are coupled by providing boundary conditions for each other this model may not simulate transition of flow regimes and does not simulate a real mixed flow in sinking streams hence further effort is expected to develop sophisticated models for the real sinking stream mixed flow in karst rivers characterized by irregular closed cross sections the simulation of the mixed flow is the foundation of the calculation of sediment transport in sinking streams because of the currently insufficient techniques for modeling the mixed flow in irregular passages a sediment transport model for the riverbed evolution of real sinking streams is seldom developed to our knowledge insufficient modeling techniques have prevented researchers from understanding the mechanics of the riverbed evolution of sinking streams in karst rivers moreover related data collected in field investigation and laboratory experiments for sinking streams is also quite limited as a result little knowledge has been gained about the mechanics of riverbed evolution of real sinking streams for a dammed open channel river a delta deposition of sediment is usually found to develop at the end of backwater and step forward relatively the riverbed evolution of a dammed karst river with sinking streams may be different for a karst river reservoir with sinking streams how will the deposition delta go through a sinking stream see fig 1 under the effect of damming will the sinking streams of a karst river be completely silted further studies are needed to understand the behavior of sediment transport and motion of the deposition body in real karst rivers with sinking streams in this study a technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is proposed to describe and account for the irregular closed cross section of sinking streams in karst rivers and its riverbed evolution using this technique a unified hydrodynamic and sediment transport model is developed for the free surface and the pressurized mixed reaches of karst rivers with sinking streams then the new model is used to study the sediment transport and riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a dammed karst river using a real karst river reservoir project 2 study area to clarify the mechanics of riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a dammed karst river the jiayan reservoir project in the middle liuchong river a first level tributary of wujiang river is taken as an example locating across the bijie and zunyi cities guizhou province southwest of china the normal storage water level of the reservoir is 1323 m besides the inflow of the liuchong river the jiayan reservoir has three other tributaries which are the da river the waga river and the yindi river sequentially see fig 2 the areas of the drainage basin of these three tributaries are 1195 1195 and 535 km2 respectively the reservoir and its tributaries form dendritic river networks where the hydraulic connection among the branches should be considered in a simulation the liuchong river goes through three under mountain passages in the domain of the jiayan reservoir which are respectively named by the large middle and small tianqiao sinking streams the large and middle tianqiao sinking streams are connected by a very short open channel reach and it is denoted by lm sinking the small tianqiao stream is also denoted by s sinking for short a hydrological station named qixingguan is located downstream of outlet of the s sinking stream whose area of drainage basin is 2999 km2 at station qixingguan the annually average discharge in the liuchong river is about 38 m3 s these three sinking streams have irregular closed cross sections ceilings of which are 1379 7 1302 8 1368 5 1311 5 and 1306 6 1289 5 m respectively partial cross sections of these sinking streams are pressurized during large flood periods or when the reservoir is impounded while the others are still free surface as a result the pressurized and the free surface flows alternate in the liuchong river of the jiayan reservoir forming mixed flows in the irregular passages the mixed flows sediment transport and riverbed evolution of the sinking streams are complex the jiayan reservoir is one of the 172 national important hydraulic engineering productions in the 13th 5 year project of china hence sedimentation of the jiayan reservoir has received wide attention if the sinking stream in the tail of the reservoir is completely silted the event will threaten reservoir security and change the flood defense situation of upstream cities to clarify the mechanics of riverbed evolution of the sinking streams is emergent for the jiayan reservoir project and this is also one of the motivations of this study 3 methods first a technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is proposed to describe and account for the irregular closed cross sections in sinking streams and its riverbed evolution second a unified 1d numerical model for the free surface and the pressurized mixed flows in karst river with sinking streams characterized by irregular closed cross sections is developed using a semi implicit formulation of hu et al 2019 2020 third a nonuniform sediment transport model with a source term describing sediment exchange between the flow and the riverbed is developed for simulating the riverbed evolution in both the pressurized and the free surface reaches the resulting new models are applicable to general karst rivers with sinking streams 3 1 governing equations of numerical models the 1d saint venant equations eqs 1 and 2 achieves a unified mathematical description of the free

sediment is transported in the form of suspended load and nonuniform suspended sediment is calculated using a fraction method the bedload accounting for about 15 of the total load can be calculated approximately by increasing coarse fractions of suspended load for simplicity liu et al 2007 the 1d advection diffusion equation with a source term describing sediment exchange between flow and

h is the water depth m k and m are coefficients for determining the sediment transport capacity in the present model the zhang s formula and the method of wei et al 1997 are combined to determine the

applications the proper k and m for the simulations of real reservoir sedimentation are 0 03 and 0 92 respectively moreover the α is set to 1 0 and 0 25 respectively in the case of erosion and deposition of sediment han and he 1984 generally in data scarce environment this study is just a data scarce case the aforementioned values for k m and α are used as default 3 2 computational grid and description of mixed flows in karst river networks with sinking streams both the free surface and the pressurized reaches are divided by 1d cells the ne and ns are used to denote respectively the quantities of cells and sides in the computational grid and every cell side has a unique global cell side index a staggered grid of variable arrangement is used see fig 3 the u is defined at side centers i 1 2 i 1 2 whereas the η and the c are defined at cell centroids i 1 i 1 a cross section cs with general topographical data is arranged at the center of each cell and the geometry of a cell is described by the following variables for cell i δxi represents the length of the 1d cell bi is the wet surface width and is related to ηi that varies with respect to time ai represents the conveyance area of the cs located at the center of cell i for side j i 1 2 which connects cells i and i 1 δxi 1 2 is the distance between the centers of cells i and i 1 ai 1 2 and ri 1 2 are the conveyance area and the hydraulic radius at side j respectively and they are interpolated from those of neighboring cells cells i and i 1 the cells of the closed and nonclosed cs are distinguished by a mark clo clo is set to 1 for closed cs cells and set to 0 for nonclosed cs in the input files the closed cs cells are further distinguished according to their flow regimes denoted by a mark pre pre is set to 1 when the flow of the cs is pressurized and set to 0 when the cs has a regime of free surface flow the cells in all the free surface and the pressurized parts of the channel together contribute to the construction of an algebraic system 3 3 technique of symmetric shadow subgrid traditionally a subgrid method is used to describe the topography of an irregular cs in 1d models for open channel flows hec 2010 mike11 2014 applying a stepwise approximation to a cs the topography of a subgrid can be represented by the average elevation z b j of its two nodes see fig 3 only wet subgrids whose z b j are below the water surface take part in the calculation of hydraulic parameters the horizontal distances or the length of all the wet subgrids are summed to get the free surface width and the wet perimeter for an irregular open channel cs described by np discretization points the conveyance area can be calculated as 6 a j 1 np 1 y j 1 y j η z b j where y the coordinate in the cs direction j index of subgrid at the cs z b j average elevation of subgrid j then the hydraulic radius is calculated using the conveyance area and wet perimeter to be different with the open channel cs a closed cs generally at least has a left and a right turning point denoted by pl and pr respectively the two turning points divide a closed cs into a bottom and a top part in fig 4 a c using a series of closed cs with gradually increased irregularity we clarify the difficulty in describing and simulating the mixed flow sediment transport and riverbed evolution of an irregular closed cs by traditional subgrid methods then to overcome deficiencies of the traditional subgrid methods a technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is proposed as shown in fig 4d for a regular closed cs fig 4a it is found that a division of subgrids have two properties 1 the pl and the pr are at the same elevation 2 every subgrid on the bottom part has a corresponding subgrid on the top part and the two have the same horizontal range such a corresponding subgrid on the top part can be defined as the shadow subgrid of the bottom subgrid with these two advantages hydraulic parameters of a regular closed cs can be easily calculated however these two advantages of the subgrid division of a regular closed cs may vanish for generally irregular closed cs for an irregular closed cs in real sinking streams the pl and the pr usually have different elevations moreover in a field survey of the closed cs in sinking streams the distribution of the discretization points for recording topography is nonuniform as a result the top shadow subgrid corresponding to a bottom subgrid of a closed cs does not exist at all in this case hydraulic parameters of an irregular closed cs may have to be evaluated using a method of calculating several zones according to the different elevations of the left and the right turning points e g zone 1 2 in fig 4b and zone 1 5 in fig 4c in these cases it is difficult to describe and account for an irregular closed cs and its riverbed evolution especially when the cs experiences a temporarily unpredictable morphological dynamics because of sediment transport to solve the aforementioned dilemma a technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is proposed to describe and account for the irregular closed cs and its riverbed evolution in sinking streams the technique includes two parts respectively a preconditioning and a merging technique of top bottom symmetric subgrids the proposed preconditioning technique of symmetric subgrids described in fig 4d takes three steps first only the discretization points of the bottom part and the two turning points are reserved for which the number is denoted by np b if necessary the subgrids on the bottom part are refined by inserting extra discretization points second a shadow point on the top part is obtained by interpolation for each discretized point on the bottom part using the vertical line through the latter third based on shadow points subgrids are reconstructed for the top part of the closed cs in the resulting new division of the irregular closed cs the discretization points and the subgrids on the bottom and the top parts are symmetric at this time a bottom subgrid and its top shadow subgrid can work as one subgrid defined as a connected subgrid in all the calculations of the mixed flow sediment transport and riverbed evolution in sinking streams then the evaluation of the hydraulic parameters of an irregular closed cs can be as easy as that of a regular closed cs for example the conveyance area of an irregular closed cs with symmetric subgrids can be calculated as see fig 4d 7 a j 1 n p b 1 y j 1 y j min η z b j s h a d o w z b j where z b j s h a d o w average elevation of the shadow subgrid corresponding to subgrid j at the bottom part benefiting from the connected subgrid the calculation of the riverbed evolution of irregular closed cs is very convenient riverbed deformation because of sediment transport generally happens only on the bottom part of a closed cs calculation of the riverbed erosion of a subgrid of a closed cs can be done in a similar way to that of an open channel cs in the case of sediment deposition a common case for a dammed reservoir the riverbed of a bottom subgrid in a closed cs will be elevated with the elevation of its shadow subgrid being as an upper limit when the riverbed of a bottom subgrid is elevated and reaches its upper limit it means that the bottom subgrid and its top shadow subgrid are merged as well as that the connected subgrid is completely silted generally under the influence of the friction of solid walls the velocity of the flow in a closed cs is smaller near the wall and larger near the center region forming a flow core in the center of the cs sediment transport is sensitive to flow velocity so siltation is easy on the two sides of a closed cs while the erosion there is difficult as a result it is not easy for a completely silted connected subgrid on two sides of a closed cs to be eroded and this paper assume that they will not experience an unmerged process of subgrids in simulations of sediment transport and riverbed evolution moreover because the bottom subgrids on the left and right sides of a closed cs have relatively low top shadow subgrids the complete siltation of the connected subgrids begins on the two sides of a closed cs as shown in fig 5 using the merging technique of the symmetric subgrids the deposition process of an irregular closed cs can be described in fig 5 according to the aforementioned details the proposed technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is applicable to any arbitrarily irregular closed cs which has one left and one right turning point 3 4 hydrodynamic and sediment transport model based on the technique of symmetric shadow subgrid our former 1d numerical models for the mixed flows and scalar transport hu et al 2019 2020 are rebuilt for the simulation of karst rivers with sinking streams the hydrodynamic model follows a semi implicit eulerian lagrangian formulation the discretization of the governing equations for one branch of the karst river networks is first introduced the momentum equation is solved within a finite difference framework and using an operator splitting technique to eliminate the stability restrictions imposed by rapid gravity waves the θ semi implicit method casulli and zanolli 2002 casulli and stelling 2013 is used to discretize the gradient of piezometric head in two parts a point wise eulerian lagrangian method elm using a multistep backward euler technique dimou 1992 zhang et al 2004 is used to solve the advection term when the advection term has been solved by the elm the u is updated and denoted by ubt for side i 1 2 the discretized momentum equation is given by 8 1 g δ t n m 2 u bt i 1 2 n r i 1 2 n 4 3 u i 1 2 n 1 u bt i 1 2 n 1 θ g δ t η i 1 n η i n δ x i 1 2 θ g δ t η i 1 n 1 η i n 1 δ x i 1 2 where θ is the implicit factor δt is the time step superscript n indicates time level n and the riverbed friction is discretized using ubt and un 1 to enhance computational stability when explicit terms of the discretized momentum equation are incorporated the unknowns cell piezometric heads of time level n 1 ηn 1 emerge and eq 8 is then transformed into the following form 9 u i 1 2 n 1 g i 1 2 n f i 1 2 n θ δ t g 1 f i 1 2 n η i 1 n 1 η i n 1 δ x i 1 2 where f i 1 2 n 1 g δ t n m 2 u bt i 1 2 n r i 1 2 n 4 3 g i 1 2 n u bt i 1 2 n 1 θ g δ t η i 1 n η i n δ x i 1 2 and g i 1 2 n f i 1 2 n can be regarded as a provisional solution provisional velocity by solving the explicit terms corresponding to the discretized momentum equations the continuity equation eq 1 is discretized using the implicit factor θ within a finite volume framework as follows at cell i 10 b i n δ x i η i n 1 η i n θ δ t a i 1 2 n u i 1 2 n 1 a i 1 2 n u i 1 2 n 1 1 θ δ t a i 1 2 n u i 1 2 n a i 1 2 n u i 1 2 n the velocity pressure coupling of the karst river networks is solved locally based on domain decomposition using a prediction correction method hu et al 2015a 2015b benefiting from local solutions the flow model only needs to solve pure 1d problems of mixed flows the flow model requires only the solution of 1d subsystems for branches while solution of large multi dimensional algebraic systems for the whole networks is not needed for each branch the velocity pressure coupling is performed by substituting eq 9 into eq 10 to construct a subsystem with the η as unknowns at the two end cells of a branch all the neighboring cells in other branches supply water levels as boundary conditions to close the subsystem the subsystem is a tridiagonal linear system with a symmetric and positive definite coefficient matrix and can be solved directly when constructions of the subsystems have been complete for all the branches a two step solution a prediction step and a correction step is carried out to couple the solutions of the subsystems the subsystems for branches are solved to obtain the final solutions ηn 1 once the ηn 1 has been obtained the un 1 defined at side centers is calculated using eq 9 the sediment transport model uses a fully explicit finite volume formulation as follows where the index of sediment fraction is omitted 11 c i n 1 c bt i n 1 δ t a i n δ x i υ c i 1 2 n a i 1 2 n c i 1 n c i n δ x i 1 2 υ c i 1 2 n a i 1 2 n c i n c i 1 n δ x i 1 2 δ t a i n α w s b bed i s i c i where cbt is the solution of the advection term using a 1d flux form elm hu et al 2020 the 1d flux form elm applied to the transport model has the advantages of mass conservative allow large time steps for which the courant friedrichs lewy number can be greater than 1 well parallelizable benefiting from the advantages of the 1d flux form elm an accurate and highly efficient simulation can be achieved for each fraction of the nonuniform sediment one transport equation of eq 11 must be solved moreover because the sediment transport model is advanced fully explicitly the extension of eq 11 to solve the sediment transport for a junction cell in the karst river networks is straightforward 3 5 computational conditions of simulations the new 1d numerical model is used to study the mechanics of the sediment transport and riverbed evolution of sinking streams in real dammed karst rivers using the jiayan reservoir project the liuchong river and its tributaries in the domain of the jiayan reservoir form dendritic river networks which is divided by a grid of 267 cells the grid scale is 200 300 m and 100 150 m respectively for the open channel reaches and the sinking streams the bathymetry dataset and the hydrological data are provided by the hydrological departments of the yangtze river water conservancy commission yrwcc and the guizhou survey and design research institute for water resources and hydropower gsdriwrh in tests the time step of the model is set to 60 s and a sub time step of 6 s is used in the backtracking of both the elm in the hydrodynamic model and the flux form elm in the sediment transport model the semi implicit factor θ was set to 0 6 the manning s roughness coefficient nm is set to 0 04 0 05 as default which is provided by the gsdriwrh while the coefficient of the sediment carrying capacity k is set to be 0 03 the topographical data of 2011 is used as the initial topography the measured data of bed materials in july 2012 is used to set the initial gradation of the nonuniform bed materials four inflows from the liuchong the da the waga and the yindi rivers are received stored by the jiayan reservoir and then drained downstream the serial hydrological year of 1971 1990 is used as the hydrological process of forecast simulations the quantities of the runoff and the sediment load in 1971 1990 in these four inflows are listed in table 1 the daily river discharge and sediment concentration of 1971 1990 are imposed at inflow boundaries the downstream open boundary is forced by the daily water level before the dam in 1971 1990 and two cases are considered in case 1 the daily water level before dam is kept constant at the normal storage water level of the reservoir 1323 m which is an extreme case of reservoir operation in case 2 the daily water level before the dam is determined by a real operation of the reservoir as shown in fig 6 which is provided by the gsdriwrh the serial hydrological years of 1971 1990 is cycled to make a hydrological series of 100 years which is long enough in terms of a full riverbed evolution of sinking streams in the preliminary tests then a 100 year unsteady process of mixed flows sediment transport and riverbed evolution are simulated to study the morphological dynamics of sinking streams in a dammed karst river simulations are done under case 1 and 2 the simulations of case 1 are denoted by constant z while those of case 2 are denoted by dynamic z 4 results 4 1 sensitivity study of model parameters obtaining of the parameters of the hydrodynamic and sediment transport models is challenging for data scarce areas a parameter sensitivity study will be helpful to clarify the representativeness of the model parameters and help further understand simulation results of the complex dynamic system of sinking streams the aforementioned 100 year unsteady hydrological process is used to perform a sensitivity study of parameters of the hydrodynamic model nm and the sediment transport model k under the condition of dynamic z first the model is tested on the gradually increased nm which is sequentially 0 032 0 035 0 038 0 041 and 0 045 to clarify the influence of nm on the simulations of riverbed evolution of sinking streams under different nm variations of the cross sectional area a during the 100 year reservoir operation are plotted in fig 7 a cs62 is taken as an example and variations of the average gradient of piezometric head along a sinking stream sf are shown in fig 7b the s sinking stream is taken as an example as shown in fig 7a generally seasonal variability of the cs topography of sinking streams is characterized by three periods respectively the deposition the erosion and the quasi balanced periods the first period is after the flood season of the last year and before the flood season of this year when small inflow and high downstream water level lead to low velocity and sediment transport capacity in sinking streams the cs area of sinking streams is continuously reduced and reaches its minimum value amin at the end of the deposition period the flood season may be divided into a main and a tail flood seasons corresponding to the erosion and quasi balanced periods the second period has large inflow and low downstream water level when the riverbed of the sinking stream is rapidly eroded the cs area of the sinking streams reaches its maximum value amax at the end of the erosion period in the third period effects of large inflow and low downstream water level are weakened and little change in the cs area can be observed which implies that a quasi balance of the sinking streams is reached then riverbed evolution of the cs of sinking streams turns to the next cycle in the sensitivity study of nm on the one hand it is found that the smaller the nm is the smaller the amin and the amax will be under smaller nm the higher flow velocity in the deposition delta reach upstream a sinking stream leads to higher sediment transport capacity resulting that more sediment in upstream reaches is carried downstream and arrives at the sinking streams hence under smaller nm the cs of a sinking stream is likely to suffer from more siltation in the deposition period characterized by a smaller amin with a larger upstream sediment transport rate it is more difficult for the cs of sinking streams to expand in the erosion period characterized by a smaller amax on the other hand the sf is not sensitive to the nm in flood seasons while it increases with respect to nm slightly in dry periods fig 7b under smaller nm the back of the deposition delta is overall lower than that in a simulation using bigger nm but differences of the longitudinal thalwegs under different nm fig 7c are minor second the model is tested on the gradually increased k which is sequentially 0 02 0 025 0 03 0 035 and 0 04 to clarify the influence of k on simulation results under different k variations of the a during the 100 year operation are plotted in fig 8 a cs62 and variations of the sf are in fig 8b s sinking stream in the sensitivity study of k on the one hand it is found that the smaller the k is the larger the amin and the amax will be under the smaller k and the resulting lower sediment transport capacity in reaches upstream a sinking stream less sediment in the upstream reaches is carried downstream which alleviates the siltation in the downstream sinking streams as a result under smaller k the cs of a sinking stream has a lower speed of siltation in the deposition period with a smaller upstream sediment transport rate it is also easier for the cs of a sinking stream to keep a relatively larger amax at end of the erosion period on the other hand the sf is not sensitive to the k in flood seasons while the sf in dry seasons decreases with respect to the k slightly fig 8b under a smaller k the back of the deposition delta is overall elevated and higher than that in a simulation using bigger k but differences of the longitudinal thalwegs under different nm fig 8c are minor overall according to the simulations under different nm and k the periodic morphological dynamics of a fully developed sinking stream this will be introduced in section 4 2 and 4 3 is not changed 4 2 predicted morphological dynamics 4 2 1 evolution of deposition delta and longitudinal thalweg in the 100 year unsteady process of mixed flows and sediment transport variation of the river thalweg in the longitudinal direction of the reservoir is plotted in fig 9 under the effect of damming a delta deposition of sediment develops at the end of backwater in the karst river and steps forward similar to the sedimentation of an open channel reservoir moreover the deposition deltas in case 1 and case 2 have different speed of movement and different longitudinal gradient because of the different downstream water level the case 1 is an extreme case of reservoir operation with the downstream water level being kept at the normal storage water level it takes about 30 years for the deposition delta to reach the entrance of the lm sinking stream then it is found that the delta deposition of sediment is able to go through the sinking streams the pivot point of the deposition delta reaches the outlets of the lm sinking and s sinking streams respectively after about 40 and 55 years after the deposition delta has gone through the sinking streams the evolution of the closed cs sharply slows down and a narrow passage is reserved in sinking streams and keeps conveying flow the topography of a closed cs mainly determined by the lower one of cs ceiling and reservoir water level is dynamically stable at 100 years the pivot point of the deposition delta reaches a position about 31 km from dam the case 2 represents a common case of reservoir operation under the effect of a frequently lowered reservoir water level the movement of the deposition delta in case 2 is much faster than that in case 1 the pivot point of the deposition delta reaches the outlets of the lm sinking and s sinking streams respectively at about 25 and 40 years after the operation of the reservoir as a result the topography of the sinking streams reaches a dynamically stable state in case 2 about 15 years earlier than in case 1 in both case 1 and 2 the sinking streams are not completely silted after the deposition delta has passed through them relative to case 1 case 2 which has a lower downstream water level leads to a larger sediment transport rate in the sinking streams moreover in case 2 the surface of the deposition delta is no more horizontal but has a gradient of about 6 8 10 4 under a larger sediment transport rate and steeper longitudinal riverbed the riverbed deformation of a low closed cs is more sensitive to flow intensity in case 2 than in case 1 in case 2 when the downstream water level is elevated again riverbed of a low closed cs will be rapidly deposited an accumulative effect of these processes leads to a higher riverbed elevation in case 2 than in case 1 at the low closed cs as shown in fig 9 the vertical distance between the lowest riverbed of sinking streams and the surface of the deposition delta is 39 5 m 1280 5 1320 0 m in case 1 and it is reduced to about 31 0 m 1285 0 1316 0 m in case 2 the curve of the longitudinal thalweg in deposited sinking stream acts just like a bungee which is tightened under the effect of a frequently lowered downstream water level 4 2 2 evolution of cross sections in sinking streams in sinking streams the closed cs with a remarkably low ceiling is representative three such css are used to analyze the evolution of the three sinking streams which are respectively cs51 cs62 and cs90 from upstream to downstream in the 100 year unsteady process of the mixed flows and sediment transport riverbed evolutions of the three typical css are shown in fig 10 in the last several years of the 100 year operation of the reservoir variation of the cross sectional conveyance area is listed in table 2 in the initial stage of reservoir sedimentation the deposition delta has not reached the sinking streams at this time the cs of the sinking streams experience only a minor deposition with a thin layer of sediment covering the riverbed when the deposition delta steps through the sinking streams the cs there begins to shrink rapidly in this process riverbed of the closed cs is elevated when the riverbeds of the bottom subgrids on both sides of a closed cs gradually reach the elevation of its shadow subgrid these subgrids are merged the deposition of riverbed and the merging of subgrids tend to be slowed down when the deposition delta has fully passed through the sinking streams after that the riverbed of the closed cs experiences an intensive erosion in flood events or low water level periods and then recovers to its original deposition state in the next dry season a dynamically stable state of the conveyance area is finally kept at these closed css in sinking streams in case 2 the dynamically stable state of the conveyance area reaches at about 30 40 40 50 and 50 60 years after the reservoir operation respectively at cs51 cs62 and cs90 in case 2 the range of variation in the conveyance area is generally 15 42 m2 at the three css relatively the conveyance area of cs51 cs62 and cs90 reaches their dynamically stable states much slower in case 1 than case 2 in case 1 at the end of the 100 year simulation a slow reduction of the conveyance area of these closed cs is still kept and the range of variation in the conveyance area at the three css is 42 123 m2 in the last several years 4 3 mechanics of riverbed evolution of sinking streams in this section first we attempt to study the reasons why a sinking stream in a dammed karst river will not be silted completely for this purpose the variations of the cross sectional sediment transport capacity at the typical css cs51 cs62 and cs90 during the 100 year operation are plotted in fig 11 and analyzed it is found that when the deposited shrunk sinking stream meets a flood event or the period of low water level of the reservoir the cross sectional sediment transport capacity in the narrow passage can reach as large as 100 kg m3 as a result the sinking stream with a narrow passage will experience sharp erosion and then the conveyance area of the closed cs is enlarged hence the narrow passage will be kept in sinking streams second we continue to explain how large sediment transport capacity happens in a deposited shrunk sinking stream for this purpose variations of the average gradient of piezometric head along a sinking stream sf in the 100 year operation are plotted in fig 12 it is found that in the final decade of the 100 year operation the ability of the sinking stream in conveying water is sharply reduced by its shrunk cs because of sediment deposition and a great deal of inflow is lagged upstream of the entrance of the sinking streams in flood events or low water level periods hence large gradient of piezometric head is formed along the deposited sinking stream as shown in fig 12 gradients of piezometric head may be as large as 0 01 along the lm sinking and the s sinking streams large pressure gradient leads to large flow velocity and then large sediment transport capacity along the narrow passage in the deposited sinking streams in flood events or low water level periods therefore in a dammed karst river a fully developed shrunk sinking stream has periodic morphological dynamics one cycle of which can be described as a successive process of siltation reduction of conveyance area flow lag upstream of sinking streams large hydraulic gradient increase of velocity large sediment transport capacity erosion of closed cs increase of conveyance area after the dynamic processes of one cycle evolution of a sinking stream enters the time of sediment siltation in the next cycle however the periodic morphological dynamic of a sinking stream may become irregular due to the randomness of the upstream inflow events and the downstream dynamic water levels of complex reservoir operations 4 4 possible siltation of sinking streams there are many factors conditions in hydrology geomorphology anthropogenic impacts and so on that may influence the riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a dammed karst river the development of hydropower reservoirs in karst rivers in china is still at its initial stage the samples of the karst river reservoir with sinking streams are now scarce although the number of them may be considerable in future after a deep development of hydropower in karst rivers currently the limited samples do not allow that knowledge of the riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a dammed karst river is built in terms of statistical analysis in this background the paper studies the sedimentation of dammed karst rivers in terms of mechanics see section 4 3 based on the aforementioned simulations the reason why a sinking stream in a dammed karst river will not be completely silted has been attributed to the large gradient of the piezometric head and the resulting large velocity and sediment transport capacity along a fully shrunk sinking stream these factors prevent the narrow passage of a sinking stream from being completely silted a 20 year hydrological process used to conduct simulations has included various hydrology conditions e g the extremely rainy and dry years all the simulations indicate that the narrow passage of the fully shrunk sinking stream is not completely silted in each of the hydrology years while sensitivity studies of the model parameters also enhance this conclusion hence this conclusion can be potentially generalized to the sink streams in dammed karst rivers with different hydrology conditions however siltation of a sinking stream in a dammed karst river is possible when the condition for forming large gradients of piezometric head along a sinking stream is broken by special geomorphology or anthropogenic influences for example if there are low breaches in solid walls or underground leakage passages in the river reaches upstream of a sinking stream namely a special geomorphology the water lagged there in flood periods may find a way out for another example if a manmade flow diversion construction e g a water intake or tunnel for releasing floods is built upstream of a sinking stream the water lagged there in flood periods may be pumped or diverted away in these cases the gradient of the piezometric head along a sinking stream will be considerably reduced because of the absence of the lagged water upstream of a sinking stream without the effect of a large pressure gradient along the sinking stream the passage of a sinking stream is to be completely silted without the aforementioned special geomorphology or anthropogenic influences the karst river sinking stream along which large pressure gradient can be kept in flood periods will not be completely silted by sedimentation such as the jiayan reservoir of this study 5 discussions the contributions of this study include two first a unified hydrodynamic and sediment transport model is developed for the free surface and pressurized mixed reaches of karst rivers with sinking streams second the mechanics of sediment transport and riverbed evolution in a kart river with sinking streams is clarified 5 1 new techniques of numerical model according to the introduction although the 1d mixed flow models for regular cross sections have been widely studied but the problem of simulating the mixed flows in passages with irregular closed cross sections has not been well solved yet moreover a sediment transport and riverbed deformation model for the flow passages with irregular closed cross sections is also seldom reported the insufficient modeling techniques have prevented the researchers from understanding the mechanics of riverbed evolution of the sinking streams in kart rivers after analysis we find that one key difficulty in modeling sinking streams is to find a technique which is capable of describing and accounting for the irregular closed cross sections of sinking streams and its riverbed evolution especially when the cross section experiences complex riverbed deformations in this study a technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is proposed to describe and account for the irregular closed cross sections of the sinking streams in karst rivers and their riverbed evolution based on this technique our former 1d numerical models for the mixed flows and scalar transport hu et al 2019 2020 are rebuilt for the simulation of the sinking streams in karst rivers the technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is simple and functional to our best knowledge this is the first time that a numerical model for the mixed flow the sediment transport and the riverbed evolution in real irregular closed passages is reported 5 2 riverbed evolution of sinking streams this study is conducted in a data scarce area in simulations the manning s coefficient nm is provided by the hydrological department of the gsdriwrh besides the coefficient of sediment carrying capacity k is set to 0 03 in zhang s formula according to the experience obtained in a number of simulations of real open channel reservoir sedimentation for a fully deposited shrunk sinking stream in a dammed karst river the calculated sediment transport capacity can be as large as 100 kg m3 in flood events because of large hydraulic gradient because of the resulting high velocity and sediment transport capacity the sinking stream in a dammed karst river will be not silted completely to our knowledge this may be the first time that the process of riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a dammed karst river is completely simulated with mechanics being clarified flow condition in a sinking stream varies considerably in different seasons and downstream water levels which determines that the sediment transport may be in varying forms of suspended load and bedload unfortunately a theory of sediment transport in a sinking stream has never been reported in literatures yet in this study we have to use a formula for the open channels to calculate the sediment transport capacity in sinking streams moreover in a data scarce area a validation of the accuracy of the numerical model is difficult the model parameters can only be set according to the experience of applications of open channel reservoirs to enhance the reasonability of the simulation results on the one hand a parameter sensitivity study of the hydrodynamic model and sediment transport models is conducted on the other hand a field investigation is also conducted in a neighboring karst river reservoir with sinking streams namely the dina reservoir the dina reservoir locates in the youcai reach of the middle liuchong river across the dafang and nayong counties guizhou province china just downstream of the jiayan reservoir the areas of the catchments at the cross sections of the lm and the tiziyan sinking streams are respectively 2999 and 4573 km2 a sinking stream named tiziyan is 650 m upstream of the dam of the dina reservoir in 2003 before impoundment of the dina reservoir the elevation of the riverbed at the dam is 1168 m while that at the entrance of the tiziyan sinking stream is 1172 1174 m the normal storage water level of the dina reservoir is 1184 m resulting in a water depth of about 10 12 m at the entrance of the tiziyan sinking stream and a short backwater during the impoundment of the dina reservoir the water level at the outlet of the tiziyan sinking stream is elevated by about 12 14 m the assessment of environmental impact was not conducted for the dina reservoir and survey of topographical data was limited to local area of the dam hence we may not have more information to quantify the detailed morphological changes of the tiziyan sinking stream since the operation of the reservoir in 2005 10 fortunately two sets of pictures of the outlet of the tiziyan sinking stream respectively taken in march 2003 before impoundment of the reservoir and november 2019 may help us understand the evolution of the tiziyan sinking stream as shown in fig 13 with the same elevation being marked two points can be summarized about morphological dynamic in the tiziyan sinking stream after a 15 year operation of the reservoir first it is found that the deposition delta has gone through the tiziyan sinking stream within the past 15 years with its head being shown outside the sinking stream in the form of band sand the elevation of the new sand is shown to be higher than the water level of the reservoir about 1182 1184 m indicating a deposition of about 15 m there second water is still allowed to be conveyed through the sinking stream implying that the tiziyan sinking stream has not been silted completely the two points are consistent with the results of the simulations of this paper which qualitatively reveals that our numerical model produces reasonable results 5 3 sedimentation of sinking streams under different backwaters cross sections of the sinking stream in a dammed karst river begin to experience remarkable siltation after the deposition delta developed in the tail of the reservoir has reached and gone through the sinking stream the time which the deposition delta spends on moving from the end of the reservoir backwater to the sinking stream is denoted by δt the δt is determined by two factors the first is the distance between the end of the backwater and the sinking stream the nearer the end of the backwater the smaller the δt is the second is the reservoir storage upstream the sinking stream a large storage can trap more sediment and will result in a smaller speed of the movement of the deposition delta and at the same time a larger δt for a given karst river with a sinking stream see fig 14 either a high dam or low dam may be built according to the requirement of the development of local regions water depth upstream the sinking stream h under a high dam is larger than that under a low dam a large h implies that the end of the backwater is far away from the sinking stream and that the water region upstream the sinking stream will provide a large storage for trapping sediment hence in case of a high dam it will take a lot of time for the deposition delta developed in the tail of the reservoir to move and reach the sinking stream in case of a low dam with a smaller distance and a larger speed of the movement of the deposition delta the δt required by movement of the deposition delta will be reduced under the same runoff and inflow sediment the jiayan and the dina reservoirs both locate in the middle liuchong river with the latter being at the downstream on the one hand the h upstream the lm sinking stream in the jiayan reservoir is 33 m while that upstream the tiziyan sinking stream in the dina reservoir is 10 12 m on the other hand the annually averaged quantities of sediment transported by runoff in the reach of the jiayan and the dina reservoirs are 238 104 and 436 104 t year respectively for the two reasons the deposition delta of the dina reservoir will go through the sinking stream much earlier than that of the jiayan reservoir in our simulations the case of dynamic z the pivot point of the deposition delta reaches the outlet of the lm sinking stream at about 25 years after the operation of reservoir at the same time according to the field pictures fig 14 it takes less than 15 years for the deposition delta to go through the sinking stream in the dina reservoir 6 conclusions first a unified hydrodynamic and sediment transport model is developed for the free surface and the pressurized mixed reaches of a karst river with sinking streams where a technique of symmetric shadow subgrid is proposed to describe and account for an irregular closed cs and its riverbed evolution to our best knowledge this is the first time that a 1d numerical model for the mixed flow and sediment transport on moveable riverbed in real irregular closed passages is reported second the mechanic of sediment transport and riverbed evolution of sinking streams in a dammed karst river is studied using the numerical model in the background of a real karst river reservoir the jiayan reservoir which is also conducted in a data scarce environment the simulations of a hydrological series of 100 years are done under a conventional operation of reservoir dynamic z and an extreme case of high reservoir water level constant z respectively using different model parameters the new findings are as follows 1 in both the scenarios of constant z and dynamic z under damming effects a delta deposition of sediment develops at the end of reservoir backwater and steps forward the deposition delta is able go through the sinking streams in the process of the movement of the deposition delta the closed cs in sinking streams shrinks rapidly finally a narrow passage is reserved in the sinking streams and keeps conveying flow topography of a cs in sinking streams experiences intensive erosion in flood events or low water level periods and then recovers to its original deposition state in a following period the topography of the sinking stream closed cs mainly determined by the lower one of the cs ceiling and the reservoir water level is dynamically stable 2 in a dammed karst river a fully developed sinking stream has periodic morphological dynamics one cycle of which can be described as a successive process of siltation reduction of conveyance area flow lag upstream of sinking streams large hydraulic gradient increase of velocity large sediment transport capacity erosion of closed cs increase of conveyance area 3 the conveyance area of the cs of a sinking stream reaches its dynamically stable states slower in case of constant z than dynamic z moreover the curve of the longitudinal thalweg in fully deposited sinking streams is found to have an interesting bungee property where the vertical distance between the lowest riverbed of sinking streams and the surface of the deposition delta is reduced in case of dynamic z it is related to the larger sediment transport rate under the effect of the lowered reservoir water level in case of dynamic z 4 sensitivity studies of the parameters of the hydrodynamic and the sediment transport models are performed whose results indicate that the periodic morphological dynamics of a fully developed sinking stream in a dammed karst river is not changed the sinking stream in a dammed karst river will not be silted completely when the condition for forming a large gradient of piezometric head along a sinking stream is not broken by special geomorphologies or anthropogenic influences this fact is supported by both the numerical simulations and our field investigation of sinking streams in an existing karst river reservoir credit

4751,high resolution simulation of water budgets across the agricultural landscape is critically important to a variety of applications such as precision agriculture water resources management and environmental quality assessment model data integration has been shown to be an effective approach to reduce model uncertainties and there is a growing opportunity to improve land surface modeling through spatially explicit calibration with satellite data in recent decades recently a satellite based daily 30 m resolution evapotranspiration et product bess stair has been developed achieving a high performance and well capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of et across the u s corn belt to explore the potential of high resolution spatially explicit calibration for advancing land surface modeling at fine scales we carried out calibration experiments for the noah mp land surface model lsm over cropland using this newly developed bess stair et we first used sobol sensitivity analysis to identify the most sensitive parameters for the noah mp s et simulation the most sensitive vegetation minimum stomatal resistance and soil parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity saturated matric potential and a soil pore size distribution parameter were calibrated using bess stair et to improve model simulation of surface water balance we conducted calibration experiments at 8 eddy covariance flux tower sites that grew maize and soybean across the u s corn belt as well as a regional calibration study on the spoon river watershed in champaign illinois when benchmarked with flux tower measurements the bess stair et calibrated model driven by flux tower forcing on average reduced the rmse of hourly et from 61 w m2 to 47 w m2 for maize and from 66 w m2 to 53 w m2 for soybean and matched the performance of directly calibrating using flux tower measured et the regional study found that calibration using bess stair et also improved the simulation of long term regional water budgets and achieved better performance of et than traditionally lumped calibration using streamflow further analysis revealed that the high resolution calibration can resolve the spatial variations of et to a certain extent and the accuracy of the calibration can be largely attributed to the low bias and excellent long term correlation of the bess stair et data itself our study thus demonstrates the effectiveness of high resolution model calibration and provides important implications in field scale hydrological modeling and precision agricultural applications keywords high resolution modeling evapotranspiration land surface model bess stair parameter estimation 1 introduction high resolution simulation of surface energy and water budgets can benefit a variety of purposes wood and coauthors 2011 field scale modeling across the agricultural landscape in particular is of great interest for precision agricultural applications karthikeyan et al 2020 lobell et al 2015 wood and coauthors 2011 for instance simulations that resolve water and energy budgets in individual crop fields can be used to study crops response to various environmental factors and guide producers management practices like irrigation furthermore resolving water energy budgets is a prerequisite to simulate nutrient dynamics austin et al 2004 ciais et al 2013 which may provide implications for fertilization management a major source of uncertainty within land surface modeling lies in the parameters related with surface energy partitioning canopy dynamics and hydrological processes crow et al 2003 xia et al 2002 this is particularly true at high resolution due to the spatial heterogeneity of parameters certain parameters like those related with plant responses to abiotic stresses jarvis 1976 are inherently empirical and hard to measure directly other parameters like soil hydraulic properties are physically based and can be measured albeit at small support volumes from soil cores 250 cm3 however they are highly heterogeneous in space and still have high uncertainties due to limited sampling coverage as a result the successful application of land surface models to a large extent is contingent upon how well the parameters are calibrated traditionally calibration of hydrological models is conducted only at basin scales using streamflow observations pending on the availability of a stream gauge immerzeel and droogers 2008 rajib et al 2018 sutanudjaja et al 2014 this kind of calibration work usually results in an apparently accurate model giving acceptable stream simulation while unrealistically representing internal hydrological processes in individual model grids in addition the equifinality issue beven 2006 further complicates the model calibration problem as the degree of equifinality will significantly increase when observational constraints are limited while calibration using stream gauges at multiple locations can slightly mitigate the equifinality problem and improve the overall performance niraula et al 2012 the internal hydrological processes still cannot be fully represented parameter regionalization techniques can be used to estimate hydrologic parameters in ungauged areas even across scales beck et al 2016 but transferring parameters to finer resolutions is challenging and the modeling performance with regionalized parameters cannot match direct calibration beck et al 2016 samaniego et al 2010 moreover many hydrological variables e g evapotranspiration and parameters vegetation and soil parameters have large spatial heterogeneities at fine scales that traditional lumped calibration is unable to capture therefore it is still appealing to conduct spatially explicit calibration using distributed observations especially at high resolutions yang et al 2019 the advancement in satellite remote sensing has enabled hydrologists and environmental modelers to use remotely sensed measurements of water and energy balance components to constrain land surface models in a spatially explicit way remotely sensed soil moisture from passive microwave satellite is widely used to calibrate soil hydraulic parameters and improve model simulations houser et al 1998 kerr et al 2001 wanders et al 2014 however due to coarse resolutions tens of kilometers shallow penetration depths jackson et al 1997 peng et al 2017 and high uncertainties of microwave based satellite soil moisture products it is still challenging to calibrate a field scale model with satellite based soil moisture estimations over an extensive area satellite remote sensing can also provide estimation for evapotranspiration et a critical flux that connects surface energy and water budgets compared with soil moisture products et estimations from satellite can have a much higher spatial resolution and better accuracy anderson et al 2011 li et al 2009 liou and kar 2014 su 2002 previous studies have explored the potential of using satellite based et products for hydrological model calibration immerzeel and droogers 2008 rajib et al 2018 but they mainly focused on using modis et product which has been demonstrated to bear large uncertainties velpuri et al 2013 further very few of those studies focused on agricultural landscapes where field scale water management is crucial for crop growth and yield recently a satellite based daily cloud gap free 30 m resolution et product bess stair has been developed jiang et al 2019 validations showed that the carefully gap filled satellite data and physically based retrieval approach which considers multiple constraints energy water and carbon in the et process jiang et al 2019 provide an extremely powerful and reliable way to reconstruct et this is evidenced by bess stair s good accuracy with an overall r2 of 0 75 and root mean squared error rmse of 24 3 w m2 when benchmarked with daily eddy covariance measurements at 12 flux tower sites across the u s corn belt it also well captured the spatial and temporal patterns of et bess stair et provides a great opportunity to test whether and how satellite products could improve the performance of land surface models at fine scales the primary objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of high resolution spatially explicit land surface model calibration using bess stair et product and the noah mp land surface model lsm we aim to answer the following three science questions in this study 1 to what extent can calibration using the high resolution et data improve noah mp s simulation of surface water budgets 2 what are the benefits of spatially explicit model calibration at fine scales compared to traditional lumped calibration 3 what factors determine the effectiveness of the high resolution model calibration experiment and their implications to answer these questions we conducted model calibration experiments to constrain the most sensitive vegetation and soil parameters in noah mp using bess stair et at 8 ameriflux sites as well as a regional calibration study in the spoon river watershed in champaign illinois we evaluated the accuracy of the et simulation from calibrated models using flux tower measurements at the site level and its spatial patterns and comparison with traditional lumped calibration in the regional study simulations of other surface water budget components soil water content and runoff were also evaluated finally the effectiveness of the high resolution land surface model calibration and its implications were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 noah mp lsm and related parameters in this study we chose the widely used noah mp lsm for its relatively complete and parsimonious representation of surface water and energy budgets as well as its high computational efficiency noah mp is an improved version of the original noah model niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 that enhances the representation of physics and adds multi parameterization options in this study we ran noah mp in offline mode without coupling to atmospheric models we used default parameterization options except for stomatal resistance for which we used the javis scheme jarvis 1976 as the primary goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of high resolution calibration using bess stair et to improve noah mp s simulation of water and energy balances we reduced the model complexity by turning off carbon cycling of noah mp thus javis stomatal resistance scheme is deemed adequate and can be better constrained for this study in noah mp et is resolved as the sum of the three components canopy evaporation bare ground evaporation and transpiration during the growing season transpiration dominates et so we focused on parameterization schemes and parameters that control the transpiration process in noah mp the transpiration heat flux trv w m2 is calculated as 1 t r v f veg ρ air c p a i r c tw e sat t v e a h γ where f veg is the fraction of the ground covered by vegetation ρ air is the density of air g cm 1 c p a i r is the heat capacity j kg 1 k 1 of dry air at constant pressure e sat v is the saturation vapor pressure pa

represents the plant physiological and environmental controls on canopy transpiration c tw is given as 2 c tw 1 f wet lai sun r b r s s u n lai sha r b r s s h a where f wet is the wetted fraction of canopy lai is the leaf area index r b is the bulk leaf boundary layer resistance s m 1 r s is the leaf stomatal resistance s m 1 and subscripts sun and sha denote the fraction of sunlit and shaded

the volumetric soil water content swc m3 m 3 in the ith layer θ ref and θ w are the reference soil water content m3 m 3 and soil water content at wilting point m3 m 3 and d z i is the ith soil layer depth m in noah mp soil moisture exerts its control on et through the soil water stress term aside from the two soil parameters θ ref and θ w that are directly involved in soil water stress calculation in eq 7 the soil water content in each layer also determines the term noah mp has four soil layers with thicknesses of 0 1 m 0 3 m 0 6 m and 1 m from top to bottom it solves the 1 dimensional richards equation to calculate the soil water content of each layer and the flux between them 8 θ t z k ψ θ θ x k z f θ where θ is the volumetric soil water content m3 m 3 t is time s z is

properties between different layers so the six soil parameters are the same at different depths a total of nine relevant parameters to et calculation are summarized in table 1 default parameter values are needed to provide a prior distribution for calibration and a performance baseline in this study the default values for the five vegetation parameters rs min rs max rgl hs and topt were acquired from the cropland category in the default model parameter lookup table three soil parameters k sat θ max b were acquired from the probabilistic remapping of ssurgo polaris dataset chaney et al 2016 we calculated the weighted average from the six layers in polaris with thicknesses of 0 05 m 0 1 m 0 15 m 0 3 m 0 4 m 1 m to match the four layers defined in noah mp the saturated soil matric potential ψ sat was acquired from noah mp s lookup table according to the dominant soil type provided by the ssurgo soil texture database runoff in the noah mp model is calculated as the sum of surface runoff and subsurface runoff runoff and groundwater parameterization option 3 surface runoff is a combination of saturation excess and infiltration excess runoff in the regional calibration study with runoff as one of the constraints we additionally calibrated two parameters slope parameter controlling subsurface runoff and surface runoff parameter refkdt schaake et al 1996 controlling surface runoff since we focused on evaluating the effectiveness of calibration using satellite based et data we used site measured or satellite derived leaf area index lai as model input instead of using lookup table based default lai to reduce uncertainties and simplify the problem 2 2 data 2 2 1 site data we chose eight ameriflux sites table 2 across the u s corn belt for this study either maize or soybean was grown at these sites representing major crops in the u s corn belt us ne1 and us ne2 are irrigated while others are rainfed eddy covariance systems were installed at each site to observe energy water and carbon fluxes six meteorological forcings are required to drive noah mp including surface air temperature k relative humidity downward shortwave radiation w m2 downward longwave radiation w m2 precipitation kg m 2 s 1 and wind speed m s 1 we acquired data from the fluxnet2015 database for us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 and from the ameriflux database for other sites the data from fluxnet2015 was gap filled we used era interim data to fill data gaps at other ameriflux sites following a similar approach used for fluxnet2015 vuichard and papale 2015 all data were aggregated to hourly interval for consistency we refer to these forcing as site forcing sf in the remainder of this paper lai is the key vegetational forcing to drive noah mp we used linearly interpolated field measured lai from the carbon sequestration program at unl ardc http csp unl edu public sites htm for us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 and satellite derived lai for other sites satellite lai was derived from daily 30 m resolution surface reflectance data fused from modis and landsat satellites luo et al 2018 a statistical model calibrated using field measured lai was employed for satellite lai estimation jiang et al 2019 site measured latent heat flux le w m2 was used as the benchmark for noah mp simulation similar to meteorological forcings we acquired le data from the fluxnet2015 database for us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 and from the ameriflux database for other sites we did not apply gap filling and only available observation data were used all data were aggregated to hourly interval for consistency 2 2 2 bess stair et data we investigated the effectiveness of using bess stair et in improving noah mp bess is a satellite driven biophysical model to monitor water and carbon fluxes jiang and ryu 2016 ryu et al 2011 it considers multiple physical constraints of et process with respect to energy water and carbon and uses environmental and vegetation information derived from multi satellite data as inputs to estimate et jiang and ryu 2016 stair is an algorithm fusing high spatial resolution landsat data and high temporal resolution modis data to generate daily 30 m resolution surface spectral reflectance luo et al 2018 which was used as inputs of bess jiang et al 2019 by integrating bess et model and stair fusion data the bess stair framework provides accurate cropland et estimations at 30 m resolution and daily interval 2 2 3 data for regional calibration aside from calibration experiments at site level using flux tower forcing we did additional experiments using regionally available forcing both at site level and in a region to further assess the benefits of bess stair et for calibration princeton university meteorological forcing dataset pumet provides all the meteorological variables required to run noah mp lsm at 4 km spatial resolution and hourly time scale beck et al 2019 pan et al 2016 pumet integrates reanalysis data with observations and uses downscaling to achieve higher spatial and temporal resolution in addition to estimating et bess has also been used to estimate downward shortwave radiation at 5 km resolution using modis atmospheric and land products ryu et al 2018 which achieved better performance than downward shortwave radiation in pumet meteorological forcing dataset see fig s1 in this study we thus used downward shortwave radiation from this bess derived product and other forcing variables from pumet as the regional forcing rf since us ne1 and us ne2 are irrigated sites and the irrigation amounts have been added to precipitation in fluxnet2015 dataset precipitation of these two sites was still from site forcing in the regional study the precipitation in the pumet forcing was bias corrected using the observed precipitation data from the noaa us1ilcp0031 weather station located in the study region crop types in each individual field were obtained from usda cropland data layer cdl the streamflow data at the watershed outlet for lumped calibration and evaluation was from the usgs 03 336 890 spoon river station 2 3 model simulations sensitivity analysis and calibration experiment the following experiments were conducted in this study default model simulations sensitivity analysis model calibration using flux tower et or bess stair et and a regional calibration study in the spoon river watershed fig 1 a 2 3 1 default model simulation to provide a performance baseline before calibration we ran noah mp with default model parameters i e cropland category in the lookup table for vegetation parameters polaris combined with ssurgo for soil parameters before each simulation one year spin up was conducted which is sufficient for simulating soil water dynamics in noah mp gutmann and small 2010 we ran default noah mp simulation with site forcing the original pumet and pumet bess derived downward shortwave radiation regional forcing the rmse bias and coefficient of determination r2 were calculated between the simulated hourly et and flux tower measurements from the peak growing season jun 15 sep 14 when comparing the performance of model simulations driven by different forcings we omitted us ne1 and us ne2 because the precipitation directly from pumet is unrealistic in the two irrigated sites the performance of default model simulations using different forcings are provided in the supplementary materials 2 3 2 parameter sensitivity analysis to identify the most sensitive parameters for calibration experiments we conducted sobo sensitivity analysis saltelli et al 2010 sobol 2001 to determine the sensitivities of the 9 parameters related to et calculation in noah mp table 1 sobol s method is a variance based global sensitivity analysis method that can determine the contributions from both the individual parameters and the interactions between them to calculate the first order and total order sensitivity indices we needed to sample n d 2 parameter sets where n is the number of samples generated each time d is the parameter space dimension the parameter sets were sampled from the sobol quasi random sequence following the monte carlo scheme with two ensembles of size n first sampled and then cross sampling performed by holding one parameter fixed at a time in our case d 9 and we set n 300 resulting in 3300 parameter sets in total the ranges of the parameters were shown in table 1 log space sampling was used for parameters covering 2 or more orders of magnitude we then ran the noah mp model continuously through all the available data at each site on all parameter sets the first order and total order sobol sensitivity indices were calculated based on the rmses between noah mp simulated hourly et and flux tower measurements 2 3 3 site level calibration experiments with the most sensitive parameters identified we first calibrated the model directly using flux tower measured et to test different calibration schemes we calibrated the chosen parameters by minimizing the rmse between model simulated hourly et and flux tower measurements we used the university of arizona shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm to search the parameter space with 200 400 iterations sce ua is a powerful and robust global optimization algorithm duan et al 1993 and has been widely used for parameter calibration in hydrological modeling duan et al 1992 sorooshian et al 1993 the default parameter values were used as the initial guess in the sce ua algorithm all metrics for both calibration and evaluation were calculated using the data from the peak growing season we first tested two calibration schemes using site et to assess the calibration and validation performance 1 year by year calibration and 2 multi year calibration year by year calibration used et observations in each growing season to constrain the parameters for any specific year and gives the calibration performance separately for each year multi year calibration used leave one year out validation method i e reserving one year for validation while using all other years with available data when the same crop was planted for parameter calibration multi year calibration provides the validation performance we compared the performance of multi year calibration and year by year calibration to evaluate the validation performance and calibration performance both multi year and year by year calibration experiments were implemented using a two step approach in the first step soil and vegetation parameters were calibrated simultaneously the median values of the calibrated soil parameters in the first step were directly used in the second step experiments in which we only calibrated sensitive vegetation parameters this two step approach was reasonable as we would not expect significant interannual variations in soil hydraulic properties or we just could not capture these variations through model parameter calibration if there is any final calibration performance was reported using the second step results in both the multi year and year by year calibration experiments at each site bess stair et data was then used to calibrate noah mp following the same procedures as using site et since bess stair only provides daily et instead of hourly et the objective function was changed to the rmse of daily et between noah mp simulation and bess satir estimation there was little difference between calibration using hourly et or daily et the rmse on average was 2 5 w m2 lower for calibration using hourly site et than using daily site et at ne1 ne2 and ne3 when the performance was evaluated using hourly site et so the time scale difference between daily and hourly for calibration should not be a major source of difference we evaluated the performance of default and calibrated models in simulating surface energy budgets for maize and soybean separately using three statistical metrics rmse r2 and bias we also analyzed the results of calibrated parameters and compared the difference between calibration using site et and bess stair et the simulated first layer swc before and after calibration at ne1 ne2 and ne3 was evaluated using in situ time domain reflectometry tdr sensor measurements ledieu et al 1986 in addition to rmse r2 and bias unbiased rmse ubrmse was also calculated for swc evaluation 2 3 4 regional calibration we then conducted a regional calibration study on the spoon river watershed located east of champaign county illinois fig 1 b the regional calibration study was intended to 1 evaluate the performance of the high resolution calibration in terms of spatial patterns 2 evaluate the performance of the simulation of regional water budgets runoff and 3 provide a concrete example of applying the high resolution calibration using bess stair et data at regional scales in the watershed field boundaries were extracted by combining the common land unit clu and multi year cdl data both from usda resulting in a total of 1215 fields the calibration was done at each individual field instead of individual pixels to reduce the computational cost the regional forcing data described in 2 2 3 was used to drive the model and the bess stair et data was aggregated to field level as the reference after the calibration each field has its own calibrated soil parameters and two sets of vegetation parameters for maize and soybean respectively we calibrated the model from 2004 to 2007 and the evaluation was done from 2014 to 2017 from two aspects first the model simulated et was evaluated again using bess stair et across the region and the performance metrics were calculated which allows us to examine the spatial patterns of the simulation performance second we evaluated the model simulated regional water budget using the streamflow data at the watershed outlet to evaluate the benefits of the spatially explicit calibration using high resolution et we further compared the performance of 1 traditional lumped calibration using streamflow only and 2 joint streamflow and et calibration with et calibrated in a spatially explicit manner in the lumped calibration the initial parameter values were different in different fields polaris for soil parameters but they moved in the same direction and the same relative magnitude during calibration the calibration and validation configurations are the same as before 3 results 3 1 parameter sensitivity analysis the first and total order sensitivity indices for related parameters are shown in fig 2 minimum stomatal resistance had the highest sensitivity in general while the other 4 vegetation parameters showed marginal effects three soil parameters i e k sat b and ψ sat also showed significant sensitivities while other soil parameters had non significant effects therefore we identified the 4 most sensitive parameters as r s m i n k sat b and ψ sat we only chose the most sensitive 4 parameters because the sensitivities of the remaining parameters were significantly smaller fig 2 we only calibrated those 4 parameters in the calibration experiments 3 2 site level calibration using flux tower and bess stair et 3 2 1 comparison of calibration and validation performance using flux tower et with site forcing both multi year and year by year calibration significantly improved the performance of simulated et the performance differences between these two calibration schemes were marginal which means the calibration and validation performances are similar fig 3 overall multi year and year by year calibrations improved the model performance in simulating et for maize rmses of et simulation decreased from 62 w m2 in default simulation to 46 and 45 w m2 in multi year and year by year calibrations respectively and for soybean rmses of et simulation decreased from 66 w m2 in default simulation to 52 and 48 w m2 in multi year and year by year calibrations respectively results for bias and r2 of et simulation are presented in fig s2 and s3 as the calibration and validation performances were similar and validation performance is more relevant to practical applications we will only show and analyze the validation performance in calibration using bess stair et 3 2 2 site level calibration using bess stair et product calibration using bess stair et achieved similar performance with calibration using site et fig 4 with site forcing rmses of et simulation on average were reduced from 61 w m2 in default model simulation to 46 and 47 w m2 in multi year calibration using site and bess stair et respectively for maize and from 66 w m2 in default model simulation to 53 and 53 w m2 for soybean with regional forcing rmses of et simulation were reduced from 92 w m2 in default model simulation to 63 and 64 w m2 in multi year calibration using site and bess stair et respectively for maize and from 93 w m2 to 65 and 66 w m2 for soybean the performance improvement was larger in calibration using bess stair et with regional forcing 30 and 29 reduction of rmses of et for maize and soybean respectively than with site forcing 23 and 20 reduction of rmses of et for maize and soybean respectively the kge performance is shown in fig s4 comparison between simulated and observed et time series show that calibration did not change much the short term variations of et however calibration was able to correct the bias of et as well as improve its long term dynamics fig 5 in us ne3 2012 the simulated et by default noah mp is higher in early growing season and lower in late growing season than observations which was partially corrected by calibration at ne1 ne2 and ne3 the performance of the simulated first layer swc was respectable with little change after calibration table s1 with site forcing there was barely any difference of ubrmse before and after calibration with regional forcing the ubrmse did improve from 0 43 to 0 36 or 0 37 after calibration using site et or bess stair et respectively however the swc performance improvement with regional forcing could be simply due to the transfer of uncertainties from forcing to calibrated parameters overall the calibration had little effect on swc simulations to further compare the difference of calibration using site et and using bess stair et the calibrated parameters from the two calibrations are shown in fig 6 the three soil parameters were similar between the two calibrations both the absolute values and the deviations from default values were mostly in line for the vegetation parameter r s m i n although the results showed some differences between calibration using site et and bess stair et across 8 sites at ne1 ne2 and ne3 sites where the forcing quality is high and there are relatively more data to get robust results the calibrated r s m i n were similar between the two calibrations for both maize and soybean this indicated that calibrations using site et and bess stair et not only led to similar performance but also mostly similar parameters the performances of bess stair et simulated et by calibrated noah mp models using bess stair and site et and the default noah mp model at ne1 ne2 and ne3 were compared in fig 7 the performances were assessed using flux tower et observations as the benchmark all metrics were calculated using daily et to match bess stair et s temporal resolution so the rmse and r2 are not comparable to those calculated using hourly et in previous sections we only did this comparison at ne1 ne2 and ne3 because those sites have gap free et data so that they could be aggregated to daily scale these results showed that 1 calibration using bess stair et could match the performance of calibration directly using flux tower et in terms of rmse 2 calibration improved the performance of model simulated et mainly through the reduction of bias with less significant change in r2 this comparison also revealed one major reason that bess stair et could improve the model performance as much as site et could is the low bias itself 3 3 regional calibration study the performance of the simulated et was significantly improved after the calibration across the region fig 8 a and c the average rmse between simulated daily growing season april 1 to october 31 et and bess stair et from 2014 to 2017 was reduced from 43 w m2 to 25 w m2 the performance improvement was primarily from the reduction of bias with moderate increase in r2 which is in line with site level studies the water budget analysis shows that the calibration improved the regional water balance over the four years fig 8 b the model simulated total runoff can better match the observed data this is because there was a positive bias of the simulated et with default parameters and calibration reduced the bias of et thus correcting the bias of simulated total runoff as well we note that the runoff dynamics did not change much after calibration fig s6 with little difference in terms of nse coefficient the comparison between the default model simulation lumped and spatially explicit calibration shows that both lumped and spatially explicit calibration improved the performance of et simulation and the distributed calibration provided better performance fig s7 however the distributed calibration did not show significant advantage over lumped calibration in terms of runoff performance fig s8 4 discussions 4 1 effectiveness of high resolution model calibration using bess stair et the results of the calibration experiments addressed several questions regarding the effectiveness of high resolution spatially explicit calibration using bess stair et to improve the performance of noah mp lsm 1 the calibration using bess stair et can significantly improve noah mp s simulation of et and mostly match the performance of calibrating directly using flux tower et 2 the field scale et performance can be significantly improved with the spatially explicit regional calibration and 3 the regional calibration can also improve the long term regional water budget simulation the site level calibration experiments showed that calibrating the most sensitive parameters r s m i n ksat b ψ sat using bess stair et could significantly improve the et performance of noah mp fig 4 at the same time the performance of the calibrated model using bess stair et can match that of calibration directly using site et in every aspect figs 4 6 7 the minimal difference between multi year and year by year calibration indicated similar performance between calibration and validation suggesting that the calibrated parameters can be well applied to other years when no et observations either from site or satellite are available the regional calibration study on the spoon river watershed demonstrated that field scale et simulation can be improved through spatially explicit calibration using high resolution data and better performance can be achieved than traditional lumped calibration only using streamflow et like many surface fluxes has large spatial heterogeneities especially in agricultural fields in land surface models the heterogeneities are primarily controlled by heterogeneous vegetation and soil parameters the high resolution spatially explicit calibration could be an effective way to capture and constrain the spatial heterogeneities of those parameters and improve land surface modeling at fine scales improved long term regional water budget simulation was also observed after the calibration which further validated the effectiveness of the regional calibration experiment 4 2 implications for hyper resolution modeling and model data integration the regional calibration study demonstrated the effectiveness of high resolution calibration using bess stair et in improving the simulation of noah mp and provided a concrete example of applying the calibration framework to agricultural fields theoretically calibration can be done at the same 30 m resolution as bess stair et itself however for agricultural applications this regional calibration study was done at individual field level using extracted field boundaries to reduce computational cost field boundary extraction is an important technique that can help better organize the heterogeneity in land surface models over agricultural areas yan and roy 2016 2014 in addition usda cdl data was used to distinguish different crop types at field scale which is largely absent in previous hydrological model simulation and calibration studies beyond the current regional study other spatially distributed hydrological land surface variables can be potentially combined with et for multi objective calibration to better constrain the model furthermore a dynamic crop model has been incorporated into noah mp recently liu et al 2016 so future work could investigate if the simulation of crop photosynthesis and yield guan et al 2017 could be improved with the constraint of bess stair et compared with previous studies the advantage of this study lies first and foremost in the high resolution of the satellite based data previous spatially explicit calibration studies were done at coarser resolutions like 36 km with smos soil moisture data shellito et al 2016 or even sub basin scale with modis et rajib et al 2018 the 30 m resolution bess stair et product is currently available primarily across the u s corn belt and can be applied to constrain models in those agricultural landscapes being able to resolve individual fields at this resolution the framework could be especially useful for precision agricultural applications another important advantage of this study is the efficacy of the remote sensing data in calibration as we have demonstrated the low bias feature of bess stair et fig 7 makes it a viable substitute for the ground truth data e g eddy covariance flux data in calibration at large scales this is in contrast with previous studies which either did not compare with calibration using ground truth data or found the satellite based data like smos soil moisture need to be bias corrected for it to be useful in improving model simulations through calibration shellito et al 2016 that the efficacy of bess stair et in calibration lied to a large extent in its low bias could be due to two possible reasons firstly three of the calibrated parameters were soil hydraulic properties soil moisture dynamics in the root zone is a relatively slowly varying process compared to other meteorological processes driving et thus the soil moisture control is likely to play a bigger role in seasonal variations than diurnal or day to day variations of et as the model performance was calibrated and evaluated at either hourly or daily scale in our study the correlation performance was dominated by diurnal or day to day variations therefore calibration of soil parameters leads to more improvements to the rmse or bias performance instead of correlation performance another possible reason is that the calibrated vegetation parameter r s m i n only changed the magnitude of stomatal resistance without changing its dynamics eq 3 so calibrating r s m i n would barely respond to the correlation performance either accordingly we can reasonably infer that as long as the satellite based data performs sufficiently good at longer time scales and can bring the model bias down to the same level as ground truth data does through calibration without hurting the correlation performance the satellite based data can match the performance of ground truth data in calibration bess stair et satisfies the conditions because of its low bias and excellent seasonal performance jiang et al 2019 encouragingly large sources of uncertainties in et simulation in land surface models are from stomatal and soil moisture controls on et egea et al 2011 keenan et al 2010 which are partially reflected in the 4 parameters in this study as demonstrated in the calibration experiments the uncertainties in these parameters could be well constrained by using satellite based bess stair et estimation even if the satellite based et estimation could not fully match the temporal dynamics of flux tower observed et at short time scales this provides an insight into model data integration that combining the strengths of model simulations and satellite based data at different time scales could potentially provide better estimations for instance as shown in this study when driven by good quality surface forcing default noah mp simulated et could already achieve good correlation with flux tower measurements and calibration using bess stair et further improved the performance by reducing the bias fig 7 as a result the calibrated model could have a superior performance than both bess stair et and default noah mp in terms of rmse performance fig 7 4 3 limitations and potential improvement several ways exist to potentially improve the current study we used the jarvis type stomatal resistance scheme for simplicity but it is insufficient to simulate many important processes such as canopy scale photosynthesis we turned it off in this study ball berry type ball et al 1987 or even more advanced stomatal resistance schemes manzoni et al 2011 medlyn et al 2011 could be more suitable for simulating canopy carbon uptake which would enable using et to constrain parameters related with canopy carbon assimilation another missing part in the noah mp model was the artificial tile drainage prevalent in some parts of the u s midwest which can modify hydrological and biogeochemical processes significantly across the agricultural landscape gentry et al 2007 green et al 2006 thus the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters in this study were essentially effective parameters not fully representing the soil physical properties although our model calibration scheme could lead to improved et simulation we admit that the processes related with tile drainage need to be explicitly represented in the model for realistic simulation of the agricultural ecosystems in the u s midwest boles et al 2015 guo et al 2018 li et al 2010 the relationship between et and soil moisture is another source of model uncertainty that could compromise the results of the calibration study noah mp uses an empirical linear soil water stress function to attenuate et when soil moisture is low studies have shown that this type of approaches tend to overestimate et sensitivity to insufficient soil moisture as shown in table s1 soil moisture dynamics has little improvement after calibration if the soil moisture et relationship is improved the high resolution et data could be potentially better utilized to improve the dynamics of other water cycle components including soil moisture therefore despite the increasing availability of high resolution and high accuracy remote sensing data land surface models still need to be continuously improved we also note that the calibration conducted in this study hardly improved model dynamics as demonstrated by the unchanged r2 performance even after calibration using flux tower measured et nor did it improve the simulation of swc and other energy balance terms except et in the regional calibration experiments although the long term water budget simulation was improved under the constraint of the high resolution et it is still difficult to improve runoff dynamics through the distributed calibration the nse coefficient of simulated streamflow evaluated with in situ measurements is relatively low regardless of calibration we also note that those fields that have higher rmse before calibration still have relatively higher rmse after calibration which means even the spatially explicit calibration cannot fully resolve the field scale dynamics aside from model physics improvement more advanced model data integration techniques such as multi objective calibration engeland et al 2006 yapo et al 1998 and constraining emergent relationships hall et al 2019 peng et al 2020 could be beneficial for reducing uncertainties of land surface models in sum field scale hydrological modeling remains a challenge and significant work needs to be done to resolve field scale dynamics of water and energy cycles 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the effectiveness of high resolution spatially explicit parameter calibration using bess stair et and the noah mp land surface model site level calibration experiments at eight flux tower sites in the u s corn belt and a regional study in the soon river watershed were conducted we demonstrated that the high resolution calibration using bess stair et can improve the et simulation of noah mp and found that calibration using bess stair et could match the results of calibration directly using flux tower measurements the performance of field scale et and long term regional water budget simulation was also observed in regional calibration experiments the high resolution distributed calibration offered superior performance than traditional lumped calibration using streamflow only further analysis revealed that bess stair et s low bias and excellent long term correlation performance could be the main contributors to its efficacy in constraining the model and the low bias performance of satellite based data and good correlation performance of model simulation can be potentially combined through model data integration overall our study provided a concrete example of improving field scale land surface modeling

4751,high resolution simulation of water budgets across the agricultural landscape is critically important to a variety of applications such as precision agriculture water resources management and environmental quality assessment model data integration has been shown to be an effective approach to reduce model uncertainties and there is a growing opportunity to improve land surface modeling through spatially explicit calibration with satellite data in recent decades recently a satellite based daily 30 m resolution evapotranspiration et product bess stair has been developed achieving a high performance and well capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of et across the u s corn belt to explore the potential of high resolution spatially explicit calibration for advancing land surface modeling at fine scales we carried out calibration experiments for the noah mp land surface model lsm over cropland using this newly developed bess stair et we first used sobol sensitivity analysis to identify the most sensitive parameters for the noah mp s et simulation the most sensitive vegetation minimum stomatal resistance and soil parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity saturated matric potential and a soil pore size distribution parameter were calibrated using bess stair et to improve model simulation of surface water balance we conducted calibration experiments at 8 eddy covariance flux tower sites that grew maize and soybean across the u s corn belt as well as a regional calibration study on the spoon river watershed in champaign illinois when benchmarked with flux tower measurements the bess stair et calibrated model driven by flux tower forcing on average reduced the rmse of hourly et from 61 w m2 to 47 w m2 for maize and from 66 w m2 to 53 w m2 for soybean and matched the performance of directly calibrating using flux tower measured et the regional study found that calibration using bess stair et also improved the simulation of long term regional water budgets and achieved better performance of et than traditionally lumped calibration using streamflow further analysis revealed that the high resolution calibration can resolve the spatial variations of et to a certain extent and the accuracy of the calibration can be largely attributed to the low bias and excellent long term correlation of the bess stair et data itself our study thus demonstrates the effectiveness of high resolution model calibration and provides important implications in field scale hydrological modeling and precision agricultural applications keywords high resolution modeling evapotranspiration land surface model bess stair parameter estimation 1 introduction high resolution simulation of surface energy and water budgets can benefit a variety of purposes wood and coauthors 2011 field scale modeling across the agricultural landscape in particular is of great interest for precision agricultural applications karthikeyan et al 2020 lobell et al 2015 wood and coauthors 2011 for instance simulations that resolve water and energy budgets in individual crop fields can be used to study crops response to various environmental factors and guide producers management practices like irrigation furthermore resolving water energy budgets is a prerequisite to simulate nutrient dynamics austin et al 2004 ciais et al 2013 which may provide implications for fertilization management a major source of uncertainty within land surface modeling lies in the parameters related with surface energy partitioning canopy dynamics and hydrological processes crow et al 2003 xia et al 2002 this is particularly true at high resolution due to the spatial heterogeneity of parameters certain parameters like those related with plant responses to abiotic stresses jarvis 1976 are inherently empirical and hard to measure directly other parameters like soil hydraulic properties are physically based and can be measured albeit at small support volumes from soil cores 250 cm3 however they are highly heterogeneous in space and still have high uncertainties due to limited sampling coverage as a result the successful application of land surface models to a large extent is contingent upon how well the parameters are calibrated traditionally calibration of hydrological models is conducted only at basin scales using streamflow observations pending on the availability of a stream gauge immerzeel and droogers 2008 rajib et al 2018 sutanudjaja et al 2014 this kind of calibration work usually results in an apparently accurate model giving acceptable stream simulation while unrealistically representing internal hydrological processes in individual model grids in addition the equifinality issue beven 2006 further complicates the model calibration problem as the degree of equifinality will significantly increase when observational constraints are limited while calibration using stream gauges at multiple locations can slightly mitigate the equifinality problem and improve the overall performance niraula et al 2012 the internal hydrological processes still cannot be fully represented parameter regionalization techniques can be used to estimate hydrologic parameters in ungauged areas even across scales beck et al 2016 but transferring parameters to finer resolutions is challenging and the modeling performance with regionalized parameters cannot match direct calibration beck et al 2016 samaniego et al 2010 moreover many hydrological variables e g evapotranspiration and parameters vegetation and soil parameters have large spatial heterogeneities at fine scales that traditional lumped calibration is unable to capture therefore it is still appealing to conduct spatially explicit calibration using distributed observations especially at high resolutions yang et al 2019 the advancement in satellite remote sensing has enabled hydrologists and environmental modelers to use remotely sensed measurements of water and energy balance components to constrain land surface models in a spatially explicit way remotely sensed soil moisture from passive microwave satellite is widely used to calibrate soil hydraulic parameters and improve model simulations houser et al 1998 kerr et al 2001 wanders et al 2014 however due to coarse resolutions tens of kilometers shallow penetration depths jackson et al 1997 peng et al 2017 and high uncertainties of microwave based satellite soil moisture products it is still challenging to calibrate a field scale model with satellite based soil moisture estimations over an extensive area satellite remote sensing can also provide estimation for evapotranspiration et a critical flux that connects surface energy and water budgets compared with soil moisture products et estimations from satellite can have a much higher spatial resolution and better accuracy anderson et al 2011 li et al 2009 liou and kar 2014 su 2002 previous studies have explored the potential of using satellite based et products for hydrological model calibration immerzeel and droogers 2008 rajib et al 2018 but they mainly focused on using modis et product which has been demonstrated to bear large uncertainties velpuri et al 2013 further very few of those studies focused on agricultural landscapes where field scale water management is crucial for crop growth and yield recently a satellite based daily cloud gap free 30 m resolution et product bess stair has been developed jiang et al 2019 validations showed that the carefully gap filled satellite data and physically based retrieval approach which considers multiple constraints energy water and carbon in the et process jiang et al 2019 provide an extremely powerful and reliable way to reconstruct et this is evidenced by bess stair s good accuracy with an overall r2 of 0 75 and root mean squared error rmse of 24 3 w m2 when benchmarked with daily eddy covariance measurements at 12 flux tower sites across the u s corn belt it also well captured the spatial and temporal patterns of et bess stair et provides a great opportunity to test whether and how satellite products could improve the performance of land surface models at fine scales the primary objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of high resolution spatially explicit land surface model calibration using bess stair et product and the noah mp land surface model lsm we aim to answer the following three science questions in this study 1 to what extent can calibration using the high resolution et data improve noah mp s simulation of surface water budgets 2 what are the benefits of spatially explicit model calibration at fine scales compared to traditional lumped calibration 3 what factors determine the effectiveness of the high resolution model calibration experiment and their implications to answer these questions we conducted model calibration experiments to constrain the most sensitive vegetation and soil parameters in noah mp using bess stair et at 8 ameriflux sites as well as a regional calibration study in the spoon river watershed in champaign illinois we evaluated the accuracy of the et simulation from calibrated models using flux tower measurements at the site level and its spatial patterns and comparison with traditional lumped calibration in the regional study simulations of other surface water budget components soil water content and runoff were also evaluated finally the effectiveness of the high resolution land surface model calibration and its implications were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 noah mp lsm and related parameters in this study we chose the widely used noah mp lsm for its relatively complete and parsimonious representation of surface water and energy budgets as well as its high computational efficiency noah mp is an improved version of the original noah model niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 that enhances the representation of physics and adds multi parameterization options in this study we ran noah mp in offline mode without coupling to atmospheric models we used default parameterization options except for stomatal resistance for which we used the javis scheme jarvis 1976 as the primary goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of high resolution calibration using bess stair et to improve noah mp s simulation of water and energy balances we reduced the model complexity by turning off carbon cycling of noah mp thus javis stomatal resistance scheme is deemed adequate and can be better constrained for this study in noah mp et is resolved as the sum of the three components canopy evaporation bare ground evaporation and transpiration during the growing season transpiration dominates et so we focused on parameterization schemes and parameters that control the transpiration process in noah mp the transpiration heat flux trv w m2 is calculated as 1 t r v f veg ρ air c p a i r c tw e sat t v e a h γ where f veg is the

depth m in noah mp soil moisture exerts its control on et through the soil water stress term aside from the two soil parameters θ ref and θ w that are directly involved in soil water stress calculation in eq 7 the soil water content in each layer also determines the term noah mp has four soil layers with thicknesses of 0 1 m 0 3 m 0 6 m and 1 m from top to bottom it solves the 1

properties between different layers so the six soil parameters are the same at different depths a total of nine relevant parameters to et calculation are summarized in table 1 default parameter values are needed to provide a prior distribution for calibration and a performance baseline in this study the default values for the five vegetation parameters rs min rs max rgl hs and topt were acquired from the cropland category in the default model parameter lookup table three soil parameters k sat θ max b were acquired from the probabilistic remapping of ssurgo polaris dataset chaney et al 2016 we calculated the weighted average from the six layers in polaris with thicknesses of 0 05 m 0 1 m 0 15 m 0 3 m 0 4 m 1 m to match the four layers defined in noah mp the saturated soil matric potential ψ sat was acquired from noah mp s lookup table according to the dominant soil type provided by the ssurgo soil texture database runoff in the noah mp model is calculated as the sum of surface runoff and subsurface runoff runoff and groundwater parameterization option 3 surface runoff is a combination of saturation excess and infiltration excess runoff in the regional calibration study with runoff as one of the constraints we additionally calibrated two parameters slope parameter controlling subsurface runoff and surface runoff parameter refkdt schaake et al 1996 controlling surface runoff since we focused on evaluating the effectiveness of calibration using satellite based et data we used site measured or satellite derived leaf area index lai as model input instead of using lookup table based default lai to reduce uncertainties and simplify the problem 2 2 data 2 2 1 site data we chose eight ameriflux sites table 2 across the u s corn belt for this study either maize or soybean was grown at these sites representing major crops in the u s corn belt us ne1 and us ne2 are irrigated while others are rainfed eddy covariance systems were installed at each site to observe energy water and carbon fluxes six meteorological forcings are required to drive noah mp including surface air temperature k relative humidity downward shortwave radiation w m2 downward longwave radiation w m2 precipitation kg m 2 s 1 and wind speed m s 1 we acquired data from the fluxnet2015 database for us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 and from the ameriflux database for other sites the data from fluxnet2015 was gap filled we used era interim data to fill data gaps at other ameriflux sites following a similar approach used for fluxnet2015 vuichard and papale 2015 all data were aggregated to hourly interval for consistency we refer to these forcing as site forcing sf in the remainder of this paper lai is the key vegetational forcing to drive noah mp we used linearly interpolated field measured lai from the carbon sequestration program at unl ardc http csp unl edu public sites htm for us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 and satellite derived lai for other sites satellite lai was derived from daily 30 m resolution surface reflectance data fused from modis and landsat satellites luo et al 2018 a statistical model calibrated using field measured lai was employed for satellite lai estimation jiang et al 2019 site measured latent heat flux le w m2 was used as the benchmark for noah mp simulation similar to meteorological forcings we acquired le data from the fluxnet2015 database for us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 and from the ameriflux database for other sites we did not apply gap filling and only available observation data were used all data were aggregated to hourly interval for consistency 2 2 2 bess stair et data we investigated the effectiveness of using bess stair et in improving noah mp bess is a satellite driven biophysical model to monitor water and carbon fluxes jiang and ryu 2016 ryu et al 2011 it considers multiple physical constraints of et process with respect to energy water and carbon and uses environmental and vegetation information derived from multi satellite data as inputs to estimate et jiang and ryu 2016 stair is an algorithm fusing high spatial resolution landsat data and high temporal resolution modis data to generate daily 30 m resolution surface spectral reflectance luo et al 2018 which was used as inputs of bess jiang et al 2019 by integrating bess et model and stair fusion data the bess stair framework provides accurate cropland et estimations at 30 m resolution and daily interval 2 2 3 data for regional calibration aside from calibration experiments at site level using flux tower forcing we did additional experiments using regionally available forcing both at site level and in a region to further assess the benefits of bess stair et for calibration princeton university meteorological forcing dataset pumet provides all the meteorological variables required to run noah mp lsm at 4 km spatial resolution and hourly time scale beck et al 2019 pan et al 2016 pumet integrates reanalysis data with observations and uses downscaling to achieve higher spatial and temporal resolution in addition to estimating et bess has also been used to estimate downward shortwave radiation at 5 km resolution using modis atmospheric and land products ryu et al 2018 which achieved better performance than downward shortwave radiation in pumet meteorological forcing dataset see fig s1 in this study we thus used downward shortwave radiation from this bess derived product and other forcing variables from pumet as the regional forcing rf since us ne1 and us ne2 are irrigated sites and the irrigation amounts have been added to precipitation in fluxnet2015 dataset precipitation of these two sites was still from site forcing in the regional study the precipitation in the pumet forcing was bias corrected using the observed precipitation data from the noaa us1ilcp0031 weather station located in the study region crop types in each individual field were obtained from usda cropland data layer cdl the streamflow data at the watershed outlet for lumped calibration and evaluation was from the usgs 03 336 890 spoon river station 2 3 model simulations sensitivity analysis and calibration experiment the following experiments were conducted in this study default model simulations sensitivity analysis model calibration using flux tower et or bess stair et and a regional calibration study in the spoon river watershed fig 1 a 2 3 1 default model simulation to provide a performance baseline before calibration we ran noah mp with default model parameters i e cropland category in the lookup table for vegetation parameters polaris combined with ssurgo for soil parameters before each simulation one year spin up was conducted which is sufficient for simulating soil water dynamics in noah mp gutmann and small 2010 we ran default noah mp simulation with site forcing the original pumet and pumet bess derived downward shortwave radiation regional forcing the rmse bias and coefficient of determination r2 were calculated between the simulated hourly et and flux tower measurements from the peak growing season jun 15 sep 14 when comparing the performance of model simulations driven by different forcings we omitted us ne1 and us ne2 because the precipitation directly from pumet is unrealistic in the two irrigated sites the performance of default model simulations using different forcings are provided in the supplementary materials 2 3 2 parameter sensitivity analysis to identify the most sensitive parameters for calibration experiments we conducted sobo sensitivity analysis saltelli et al 2010 sobol 2001 to determine the sensitivities of the 9 parameters related to et calculation in noah mp table 1 sobol s method is a variance based global sensitivity analysis method that can determine the contributions from both the individual parameters and the interactions between them to calculate the first order and total order sensitivity indices we needed to sample n d 2 parameter sets where n is the number of samples generated each time d is the parameter space dimension the parameter sets were sampled from the sobol quasi random sequence following the monte carlo scheme with two ensembles of size n first sampled and then cross sampling performed by holding one parameter fixed at a time in our case d 9 and we set n 300 resulting in 3300 parameter sets in total the ranges of the parameters were shown in table 1 log space sampling was used for parameters covering 2 or more orders of magnitude we then ran the noah mp model continuously through all the available data at each site on all parameter sets the first order and total order sobol sensitivity indices were calculated based on the rmses between noah mp simulated hourly et and flux tower measurements 2 3 3 site level calibration experiments with the most sensitive parameters identified we first calibrated the model directly using flux tower measured et to test different calibration schemes we calibrated the chosen parameters by minimizing the rmse between model simulated hourly et and flux tower measurements we used the university of arizona shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm to search the parameter space with 200 400 iterations sce ua is a powerful and robust global optimization algorithm duan et al 1993 and has been widely used for parameter calibration in hydrological modeling duan et al 1992 sorooshian et al 1993 the default parameter values were used as the initial guess in the sce ua algorithm all metrics for both calibration and evaluation were calculated using the data from the peak growing season we first tested two calibration schemes using site et to assess the calibration and validation performance 1 year by year calibration and 2 multi year calibration year by year calibration used et observations in each growing season to constrain the parameters for any specific year and gives the calibration performance separately for each year multi year calibration used leave one year out validation method i e reserving one year for validation while using all other years with available data when the same crop was planted for parameter calibration multi year calibration provides the validation performance we compared the performance of multi year calibration and year by year calibration to evaluate the validation performance and calibration performance both multi year and year by year calibration experiments were implemented using a two step approach in the first step soil and vegetation parameters were calibrated simultaneously the median values of the calibrated soil parameters in the first step were directly used in the second step experiments in which we only calibrated sensitive vegetation parameters this two step approach was reasonable as we would not expect significant interannual variations in soil hydraulic properties or we just could not capture these variations through model parameter calibration if there is any final calibration performance was reported using the second step results in both the multi year and year by year calibration experiments at each site bess stair et data was then used to calibrate noah mp following the same procedures as using site et since bess stair only provides daily et instead of hourly et the objective function was changed to the rmse of daily et between noah mp simulation and bess satir estimation there was little difference between calibration using hourly et or daily et the rmse on average was 2 5 w m2 lower for calibration using hourly site et than using daily site et at ne1 ne2 and ne3 when the performance was evaluated using hourly site et so the time scale difference between daily and hourly for calibration should not be a major source of difference we evaluated the performance of default and calibrated models in simulating surface energy budgets for maize and soybean separately using three statistical metrics rmse r2 and bias we also analyzed the results of calibrated parameters and compared the difference between calibration using site et and bess stair et the simulated first layer swc before and after calibration at ne1 ne2 and ne3 was evaluated using in situ time domain reflectometry tdr sensor measurements ledieu et al 1986 in addition to rmse r2 and bias unbiased rmse ubrmse was also calculated for swc evaluation 2 3 4 regional calibration we then conducted a regional calibration study on the spoon river watershed located east of champaign county illinois fig 1 b the regional calibration study was intended to 1 evaluate the performance of the high resolution calibration in terms of spatial patterns 2 evaluate the performance of the simulation of regional water budgets runoff and 3 provide a concrete example of applying the high resolution calibration using bess stair et data at regional scales in the watershed field boundaries were extracted by combining the common land unit clu and multi year cdl data both from usda resulting in a total of 1215 fields the calibration was done at each individual field instead of individual pixels to reduce the computational cost the regional forcing data described in 2 2 3 was used to drive the model and the bess stair et data was aggregated to field level as the reference after the calibration each field has its own calibrated soil parameters and two sets of vegetation parameters for maize and soybean respectively we calibrated the model from 2004 to 2007 and the evaluation was done from 2014 to 2017 from two aspects first the model simulated et was evaluated again using bess stair et across the region and the performance metrics were calculated which allows us to examine the spatial patterns of the simulation performance second we evaluated the model simulated regional water budget using the streamflow data at the watershed outlet to evaluate the benefits of the spatially explicit calibration using high resolution et we further compared the performance of 1 traditional lumped calibration using streamflow only and 2 joint streamflow and et calibration with et calibrated in a spatially explicit manner in the lumped calibration the initial parameter values were different in different fields polaris for soil parameters but they moved in the same direction and the same relative magnitude during calibration the calibration and validation configurations are the same as before 3 results 3 1 parameter sensitivity analysis the first and total order sensitivity indices for related parameters are shown in fig 2 minimum stomatal resistance had the highest sensitivity in general while the other 4 vegetation parameters showed marginal effects three soil parameters i e k sat b and ψ sat also showed significant sensitivities while other soil parameters had non significant effects therefore we identified the 4 most sensitive parameters as r s m i n k sat b and ψ sat we only chose the most sensitive 4 parameters because the sensitivities of the remaining parameters were significantly smaller fig 2 we only calibrated those 4 parameters in the calibration experiments 3 2 site level calibration using flux tower and bess stair et 3 2 1 comparison of calibration and validation performance using flux tower et with site forcing both multi year and year by year calibration significantly improved the performance of simulated et the performance differences between these two calibration schemes were marginal which means the calibration and validation performances are similar fig 3 overall multi year and year by year calibrations improved the model performance in simulating et for maize rmses of et simulation decreased from 62 w m2 in default simulation to 46 and 45 w m2 in multi year and year by year calibrations respectively and for soybean rmses of et simulation decreased from 66 w m2 in default simulation to 52 and 48 w m2 in multi year and year by year calibrations respectively results for bias and r2 of et simulation are presented in fig s2 and s3 as the calibration and validation performances were similar and validation performance is more relevant to practical applications we will only show and analyze the validation performance in calibration using bess stair et 3 2 2 site level calibration using bess stair et product calibration using bess stair et achieved similar performance with calibration using site et fig 4 with site forcing rmses of et simulation on average were reduced from 61 w m2 in default model simulation to 46 and 47 w m2 in multi year calibration using site and bess stair et respectively for maize and from 66 w m2 in default model simulation to 53 and 53 w m2 for soybean with regional forcing rmses of et simulation were reduced from 92 w m2 in default model simulation to 63 and 64 w m2 in multi year calibration using site and bess stair et respectively for maize and from 93 w m2 to 65 and 66 w m2 for soybean the performance improvement was larger in calibration using bess stair et with regional forcing 30 and 29 reduction of rmses of et for maize and soybean respectively than with site forcing 23 and 20 reduction of rmses of et for maize and soybean respectively the kge performance is shown in fig s4 comparison between simulated and observed et time series show that calibration did not change much the short term variations of et however calibration was able to correct the bias of et as well as improve its long term dynamics fig 5 in us ne3 2012 the simulated et by default noah mp is higher in early growing season and lower in late growing season than observations which was partially corrected by calibration at ne1 ne2 and ne3 the performance of the simulated first layer swc was respectable with little change after calibration table s1 with site forcing there was barely any difference of ubrmse before and after calibration with regional forcing the ubrmse did improve from 0 43 to 0 36 or 0 37 after calibration using site et or bess stair et respectively however the swc performance improvement with regional forcing could be simply due to the transfer of uncertainties from forcing to calibrated parameters overall the calibration had little effect on swc simulations to further compare the difference of calibration using site et and using bess stair et the calibrated parameters from the two calibrations are shown in fig 6 the three soil parameters were similar between the two calibrations both the absolute values and the deviations from default values were mostly in line for the vegetation parameter r s m i n although the results showed some differences between calibration using site et and bess stair et across 8 sites at ne1 ne2 and ne3 sites where the forcing quality is high and there are relatively more data to get robust results the calibrated r s m i n were similar between the two calibrations for both maize and soybean this indicated that calibrations using site et and bess stair et not only led to similar performance but also mostly similar parameters the performances of bess stair et simulated et by calibrated noah mp models using bess stair and site et and the default noah mp model at ne1 ne2 and ne3 were compared in fig 7 the performances were assessed using flux tower et observations as the benchmark all metrics were calculated using daily et to match bess stair et s temporal resolution so the rmse and r2 are not comparable to those calculated using hourly et in previous sections we only did this comparison at ne1 ne2 and ne3 because those sites have gap free et data so that they could be aggregated to daily scale these results showed that 1 calibration using bess stair et could match the performance of calibration directly using flux tower et in terms of rmse 2 calibration improved the performance of model simulated et mainly through the reduction of bias with less significant change in r2 this comparison also revealed one major reason that bess stair et could improve the model performance as much as site et could is the low bias itself 3 3 regional calibration study the performance of the simulated et was significantly improved after the calibration across the region fig 8 a and c the average rmse between simulated daily growing season april 1 to october 31 et and bess stair et from 2014 to 2017 was reduced from 43 w m2 to 25 w m2 the performance improvement was primarily from the reduction of bias with moderate increase in r2 which is in line with site level studies the water budget analysis shows that the calibration improved the regional water balance over the four years fig 8 b the model simulated total runoff can better match the observed data this is because there was a positive bias of the simulated et with default parameters and calibration reduced the bias of et thus correcting the bias of simulated total runoff as well we note that the runoff dynamics did not change much after calibration fig s6 with little difference in terms of nse coefficient the comparison between the default model simulation lumped and spatially explicit calibration shows that both lumped and spatially explicit calibration improved the performance of et simulation and the distributed calibration provided better performance fig s7 however the distributed calibration did not show significant advantage over lumped calibration in terms of runoff performance fig s8 4 discussions 4 1 effectiveness of high resolution model calibration using bess stair et the results of the calibration experiments addressed several questions regarding the effectiveness of high resolution spatially explicit calibration using bess stair et to improve the performance of noah mp lsm 1 the calibration using bess stair et can significantly improve noah mp s simulation of et and mostly match the performance of calibrating directly using flux tower et 2 the field scale et performance can be significantly improved with the spatially explicit regional calibration and 3 the regional calibration can also improve the long term regional water budget simulation the site level calibration experiments showed that calibrating the most sensitive parameters r s m i n ksat b ψ sat using bess stair et could significantly improve the et performance of noah mp fig 4 at the same time the performance of the calibrated model using bess stair et can match that of calibration directly using site et in every aspect figs 4 6 7 the minimal difference between multi year and year by year calibration indicated similar performance between calibration and validation suggesting that the calibrated parameters can be well applied to other years when no et observations either from site or satellite are available the regional calibration study on the spoon river watershed demonstrated that field scale et simulation can be improved through spatially explicit calibration using high resolution data and better performance can be achieved than traditional lumped calibration only using streamflow et like many surface fluxes has large spatial heterogeneities especially in agricultural fields in land surface models the heterogeneities are primarily controlled by heterogeneous vegetation and soil parameters the high resolution spatially explicit calibration could be an effective way to capture and constrain the spatial heterogeneities of those parameters and improve land surface modeling at fine scales improved long term regional water budget simulation was also observed after the calibration which further validated the effectiveness of the regional calibration experiment 4 2 implications for hyper resolution modeling and model data integration the regional calibration study demonstrated the effectiveness of high resolution calibration using bess stair et in improving the simulation of noah mp and provided a concrete example of applying the calibration framework to agricultural fields theoretically calibration can be done at the same 30 m resolution as bess stair et itself however for agricultural applications this regional calibration study was done at individual field level using extracted field boundaries to reduce computational cost field boundary extraction is an important technique that can help better organize the heterogeneity in land surface models over agricultural areas yan and roy 2016 2014 in addition usda cdl data was used to distinguish different crop types at field scale which is largely absent in previous hydrological model simulation and calibration studies beyond the current regional study other spatially distributed hydrological land surface variables can be potentially combined with et for multi objective calibration to better constrain the model furthermore a dynamic crop model has been incorporated into noah mp recently liu et al 2016 so future work could investigate if the simulation of crop photosynthesis and yield guan et al 2017 could be improved with the constraint of bess stair et compared with previous studies the advantage of this study lies first and foremost in the high resolution of the satellite based data previous spatially explicit calibration studies were done at coarser resolutions like 36 km with smos soil moisture data shellito et al 2016 or even sub basin scale with modis et rajib et al 2018 the 30 m resolution bess stair et product is currently available primarily across the u s corn belt and can be applied to constrain models in those agricultural landscapes being able to resolve individual fields at this resolution the framework could be especially useful for precision agricultural applications another important advantage of this study is the efficacy of the remote sensing data in calibration as we have demonstrated the low bias feature of bess stair et fig 7 makes it a viable substitute for the ground truth data e g eddy covariance flux data in calibration at large scales this is in contrast with previous studies which either did not compare with calibration using ground truth data or found the satellite based data like smos soil moisture need to be bias corrected for it to be useful in improving model simulations through calibration shellito et al 2016 that the efficacy of bess stair et in calibration lied to a large extent in its low bias could be due to two possible reasons firstly three of the calibrated parameters were soil hydraulic properties soil moisture dynamics in the root zone is a relatively slowly varying process compared to other meteorological processes driving et thus the soil moisture control is likely to play a bigger role in seasonal variations than diurnal or day to day variations of et as the model performance was calibrated and evaluated at either hourly or daily scale in our study the correlation performance was dominated by diurnal or day to day variations therefore calibration of soil parameters leads to more improvements to the rmse or bias performance instead of correlation performance another possible reason is that the calibrated vegetation parameter r s m i n only changed the magnitude of stomatal resistance without changing its dynamics eq 3 so calibrating r s m i n would barely respond to the correlation performance either accordingly we can reasonably infer that as long as the satellite based data performs sufficiently good at longer time scales and can bring the model bias down to the same level as ground truth data does through calibration without hurting the correlation performance the satellite based data can match the performance of ground truth data in calibration bess stair et satisfies the conditions because of its low bias and excellent seasonal performance jiang et al 2019 encouragingly large sources of uncertainties in et simulation in land surface models are from stomatal and soil moisture controls on et egea et al 2011 keenan et al 2010 which are partially reflected in the 4 parameters in this study as demonstrated in the calibration experiments the uncertainties in these parameters could be well constrained by using satellite based bess stair et estimation even if the satellite based et estimation could not fully match the temporal dynamics of flux tower observed et at short time scales this provides an insight into model data integration that combining the strengths of model simulations and satellite based data at different time scales could potentially provide better estimations for instance as shown in this study when driven by good quality surface forcing default noah mp simulated et could already achieve good correlation with flux tower measurements and calibration using bess stair et further improved the performance by reducing the bias fig 7 as a result the calibrated model could have a superior performance than both bess stair et and default noah mp in terms of rmse performance fig 7 4 3 limitations and potential improvement several ways exist to potentially improve the current study we used the jarvis type stomatal resistance scheme for simplicity but it is insufficient to simulate many important processes such as canopy scale photosynthesis we turned it off in this study ball berry type ball et al 1987 or even more advanced stomatal resistance schemes manzoni et al 2011 medlyn et al 2011 could be more suitable for simulating canopy carbon uptake which would enable using et to constrain parameters related with canopy carbon assimilation another missing part in the noah mp model was the artificial tile drainage prevalent in some parts of the u s midwest which can modify hydrological and biogeochemical processes significantly across the agricultural landscape gentry et al 2007 green et al 2006 thus the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters in this study were essentially effective parameters not fully representing the soil physical properties although our model calibration scheme could lead to improved et simulation we admit that the processes related with tile drainage need to be explicitly represented in the model for realistic simulation of the agricultural ecosystems in the u s midwest boles et al 2015 guo et al 2018 li et al 2010 the relationship between et and soil moisture is another source of model uncertainty that could compromise the results of the calibration study noah mp uses an empirical linear soil water stress function to attenuate et when soil moisture is low studies have shown that this type of approaches tend to overestimate et sensitivity to insufficient soil moisture as shown in table s1 soil moisture dynamics has little improvement after calibration if the soil moisture et relationship is improved the high resolution et data could be potentially better utilized to improve the dynamics of other water cycle components including soil moisture therefore despite the increasing availability of high resolution and high accuracy remote sensing data land surface models still need to be continuously improved we also note that the calibration conducted in this study hardly improved model dynamics as demonstrated by the unchanged r2 performance even after calibration using flux tower measured et nor did it improve the simulation of swc and other energy balance terms except et in the regional calibration experiments although the long term water budget simulation was improved under the constraint of the high resolution et it is still difficult to improve runoff dynamics through the distributed calibration the nse coefficient of simulated streamflow evaluated with in situ measurements is relatively low regardless of calibration we also note that those fields that have higher rmse before calibration still have relatively higher rmse after calibration which means even the spatially explicit calibration cannot fully resolve the field scale dynamics aside from model physics improvement more advanced model data integration techniques such as multi objective calibration engeland et al 2006 yapo et al 1998 and constraining emergent relationships hall et al 2019 peng et al 2020 could be beneficial for reducing uncertainties of land surface models in sum field scale hydrological modeling remains a challenge and significant work needs to be done to resolve field scale dynamics of water and energy cycles 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the effectiveness of high resolution spatially explicit parameter calibration using bess stair et and the noah mp land surface model site level calibration experiments at eight flux tower sites in the u s corn belt and a regional study in the soon river watershed were conducted we demonstrated that the high resolution calibration using bess stair et can improve the et simulation of noah mp and found that calibration using bess stair et could match the results of calibration directly using flux tower measurements the performance of field scale et and long term regional water budget simulation was also observed in regional calibration experiments the high resolution distributed calibration offered superior performance than traditional lumped calibration using streamflow only further analysis revealed that bess stair et s low bias and excellent long term correlation performance could be the main contributors to its efficacy in constraining the model and the low bias performance of satellite based data and good correlation performance of model simulation can be potentially combined through model data integration overall our study provided a concrete example of improving field scale land surface modeling

4752,the increase in dynamic interactions between climate and human activities threatens water security in terms of water quantity and quality most water security studies have focused on water quantity compared to water quality while both are equally important and vital for maintaining a healthy ecosystem and human well being the first part of the paper provides a review of the potential impacts of climate related extreme events i e drought flood and wildfires on different water quality indicators and the potential impact of cascading extreme events e g drought flood regimes on dynamics of water quality behavior in the second part of the paper we demonstrate the cascading impact of severe drought and an extreme historical flood event october 1 4 2015 in south carolina usa on water quality variables the effect of drought on water quality in contrasting land use settings is investigated finally water quality data was collected over a period of time in three types of land use settings to study the dynamics of multiple flood and drought events on microbial communities flooding conditions result in high levels of bacteria associated with fecal contamination especially in the stream setting where large differences between drought and flooding occur in the microbial communities the results highlight the significant impact of cascading events on water quality and microbial communities the effect of drought on water quality indicators in different land use settings can be different highlighting the dominant role of watershed characteristics overall it is essential to develop quantitative frameworks in the context of sustainability science to quantify the interaction between climate watershed and anthropogenic variables that control stream water quality this study highlights the importance of understanding the relationships between extreme events and water quality indicators as an important step to improve ecosystem health and sustainability finally some remarks are made on the knowledge gaps which need to be addressed in future studies keywords drought flood wildfire water quality microbial communities 1 introduction climate water and human activities are tightly connected due to large scale variability in their coupling behavior water security in terms of quantity and quality is a significant issue worldwide mishra and singh 2010 veettil and mishra 2020 although water quantity related problems get more attention water quality is equally important and vital for maintaining a healthy ecosystem and human well being the projected climate change will further alter the precipitation and evaporation at a global scale konapala et al 2020 that likely will increase climate extremes e g floods and droughts and result in higher streamflow dynamics that control the flow of nutrients and various water quality indicators the surface water quality is controlled by multiple variables including climatic hydrological and anthropogenic variables badruzzaman et al 2012 lintern et al 2018 abdul aziz and ahmed 2019 these variables can affect water quality at various temporal and spatial scales mosley 2015 lintern et al 2018 shoda et al 2019 recent evidence indicates an increase in extreme precipitation events prein et al 2017 vu and mishra 2020 flooding and droughts of greater intensity and duration ipcc 2014 konapala et al 2020 and these extremes impact water quality climate change is expected to bring more floods and droughts in the regions that are already witnessing these extremes on a global scale konapala et al 2020 the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are expected to increase in the future ipcc 2014 these extreme events can vary from wet e g flood extreme rainfall to extreme

2008 drought flood and wildfires occur in a different part of the world and they are more prominent in certain geographical regions fig 1 according to the colorado flood observatory data set several locations worldwide have experienced flood inundation events with a duration of more than 30 days between 1985 to january 2015 fig 1a the extreme droughts are more common in semiarid locations such as northern and southwestern africa central asia australia western u s and the iberian peninsula fig 1b these drought events may increase the likelihood of wildfires westerling and swetnam 2003 murphy et al 2015 2020 flash floods whitehead et al 2009 and dust storms hahnenberger and nicoll 2014 reheis and urban 2011 much of the western us has experienced severe droughts accompanied by an increase in massive wildfires rust et al 2018 murphy et al 2020 the fire weather index a key indicator of extreme fire behavior potential is shown in fig 1c the fire hazards are more common in the western usa australia the southern and central parts of africa the southern northeastern part of south america and central asia it is essential to highlight that many regions dominated by fire hazards also witnessing more numerous drought and flood events fig 1 which can result in cascading compound events therefore understanding the extreme weather and climate events and their cascading effects particularly on stream water quality is essential to eliminate any potential impact on human health reduce water treatment costs and develop mitigation strategies in response to future extreme events the above discussion highlights the potential impact of climate and anthropogenic variables on water quality however it is difficult to pinpoint the role of climate due to a delicate and complex interplay of anthropogenic variables e g variety of land use across local to regional scale michalak 2016 this challenge is compounded by the limited understanding of the potential impact of individual and cascading effects of climate extremes on water quality the role of cascading events e g drought flood regimes on water quality is often neglected in this regard the overall objective of this study are a to provide a review on the potential impact of climate related extreme events i e drought flood and wildfires as well as cascading events on different water quality indicators b to investigate the potential impact of droughts on water quality indicators in different land use settings c to demonstrate the potential impact of a severe drought and extreme flood cascading event on water quality and d the potential impact of drought and flood regimes on microbial communities in different land use settings 2 review of the impact of land use and extreme events on stream water quality 2 1 impact of land uses on water quality the widespread change in land use patterns can have a significant impact on water quality and ecological integrity around the globe specifically urbanization agriculture deforestation and pasture conversion all pose a threat to biodiversity and lotic ecosystems miserendino et al 2011 numerous studies have shown that the high nutrient loads from agricultural andurban areas have dramatically reduced the water quality in rivers and streams foote et al 2015 these studies highlighted the positive correlations between the anthropogenic variables such as grazing agriculture and urbanization with the concentration of total suspended sediments tss nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus and dissolved oxygen in a watershed allan 2004 giri and qiu 2016 lintern et al 2018 suarez and puertas 2005 more specifically the tss and nutrients concentrations were higher in urban watersheds than forest watersheds whitehead et al 2009 tu 2011 giri et al 2018 there is also a clear positive correlation between the removal of vegetation in a watershed and water quality degradation meybeck and helmer 1989 a smaller number of studies have acknowledged the role of other watershed characteristics and climatic variables on stream water quality e g tramblay et al 2010 young et al 2005 lintern et al 2018 alnahit et al 2020 all these variables can potentially impact stream water quality as they can affect the source mobilization process and the delivery of constituents into the receiving streams granger et al 2010 for example steep watersheds were observed to impact water quality since steep slope facilitates the mobilization of pollutants into streams leading to water quality degradation kang et al 2010 wan et al 2014 alnahit et al 2020 similarly geological features and soil type in a watershed may also affect water quality biggs and gerbeaux 1993 varanka et al 2015 lintern et al 2018 alnahit et al 2020 for example watersheds dominated by parent rock e g igneous rocks showed low export of dissolved ions in contrast watersheds dominated by soft sedimentary rock e g limestone showed higher transfer of dissolved ions young et al 2005 moreover higher phosphorus concentrations in streams were reported in a watershed with high sediment deposition kirchner and dillon 1975 there are also strong links between geology and stream water temperature in which groundwater interaction with streamflow may impact water temperature poole and berman 2001 in addition groundwater levels may also alter stream water quality menció and mas pla 2008 sprague 2005 for example groundwater was observed to control the concentration of dissolved nutrients and calcium bicarbonate in streams within the south platte river basin colorado usa sprague 2005 2 2 impact of drought on water quality hydrologic drought is defined as a period with inadequate surface and subsurface water availability mishra and singh 2010 periods of drought may lead to significant consequences for water quality and quantity gámez et al 2019 jones and van vliet 2018 li et al 2017 lehman et al 2017 djebou 2017a 2017b waste load allocation golladay and battle 2002 hernandez and uddameri 2014 momblanch et al 2015 aquatic ecosystems van dijk et al 2013 gibson et al 2020 and quality quantity of water for irrigation mosley 2015 the impact of drought on the surface and groundwater resources may result in low flows and water availability leading to deteriorated water quality mishra and singh 2010 hrdinka et al 2012 mosley 2015 momblanch et al 2015 for example drought induced low flow regimes increase the water detention period and contribute to an increase in algal blooms due to high nutrient concentrations less dilution van vliet and zwolsman 2008 mosley 2015 palmer and montagna 2015 additionally the drought waterlogging cycles may affect the water quality by enhancing the decomposition of organic matter and sediments and flushing them into receiving streams hrdinka et al 2012 gámez et al 2019 jones and van vliet 2018 the higher temperatures during extreme droughts may also influence the stream respiration and reaeration rates in rivers and streams mosley 2015 table 1 summarizes the potential impact of drought on multiple water quality indicators across different parts of the world in the following sections we present an overview of droughts possible effect on various water quality indicators in rivers and streams 2 2 1 algae and turbidity the combination of low flow and high temperature during drought events increase algal blooms and chlorophyll a concentrations in streams table 1 for example massive algae blooms during drought periods were documented in darling barwon river australia lower nakdong river south korea the river murray australia donnelly et al 1997 ha et al 1999 bowling et al 2013 many studies have reported high algal values during droughts in streams and rivers van vliet and zwolsman 2008 gilbert et al 2012 garcía prieto et al 2012 de barroso et al 2018 the observed algae values were mainly attributed to low flows water column stratification and clarification and sometimes high temperatures mosley 2015 conflicting opinions are observed related to the behavior of turbidity during the drought period many studies observed low turbidity values during droughts across many rivers and streams which can be attributed to the lack of watershed runoff caruso 2002a 2002b mosley et al 2012 van vliet and zwolsman 2008 however the presence of point source pollutions that produce high suspended particles may increase turbidity due to lack of dilation and low flows caruso 2002a 2002b 2 2 2 nutrients and salinity the impact of drought on nutrient concentrations in streams depends mainly on the land use settings in a watershed e g agriculture urban forest as well as types of point source pollution for example lower nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were observed during droughts in many rivers and streams e g morecroft et al 2000 caruso 2002a 2002b golladay and battle 2002 oelsner et al 2007 hrdinka et al 2012 mosley et al 2012 de barroso et al 2018 this may be due to the lack of watershed runoff and increased denitrification due to a longer water residence time andersen et al 2004 baurès et al 2013 mosley 2015 on the other hand the point source pollution facilities located in highly urbanized watersheds may result in increases in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the streams andersen et al 2004 sprague 2005 van vliet and zwolsman 2008 macintosh et al 2011 hrdinka et al 2012 this is especially true when the flow from these facilities remains relatively constant during droughts a few other studies have also reported higher nitrate concentrations in agricultural watersheds during low flows baurès et al 2013 mosley 2015 the higher nitrate concentrations may be due to the influence of sediment and nitrogen fluxes during the drought mosley 2015 high salinities were positively correlated with increasing drought in most streams rivers jones and van vliet 2018 li et al 2017 mosley 2015 this can be due to sustained evaporation of surface water and less dilution of more saline groundwater inputs caruso 2002a 2002b van vliet and zwolsman 2008 mosley et al 2012 mosley 2015 additionally the increase in pyrite oxidation during droughts may increase the sulfate concentration in the stream mast 2013 however when the contribution of groundwater and saline point source facilities are small compared to the surface runoff salinity did not increase during droughts wilbers et al 2009 2 2 3 dissolved oxygen and ph drought has different levels of impact on dissolved oxygen concentrations table 1 in shallow streams insignificant changes in dissolved oxygen during droughts were observed hudson et al 1978 caruso 2002a 2002b hrdinka et al 2012 on the other hand studies have reported an increase in the dissolved oxygen values during daytime in droughts ha et al 1999 sprague 2005 van vliet and zwolsman 2008 this may be related to the enhanced primary production during the day however in watersheds with point source pollution facilities a decrease in dissolved oxygen was observed anderson and faust 1972 chessman and robinson 1987 this may be attributed to the fact that increases in nutrients lead to algal blooms when the algae die or run out of nutrients the bacteria start decomposing the organic matter dead algae and that leads to decreased oxygen concentrations to anoxic conditions if there is enough organic matter to degrade mosley 2015 ylla et al 2010 a statistically significant decrease in ph during drought was observed in many studies e g zieliński et al 2009 mosley et al 2012 however an increase in ph and alkalinity was observed due to less dilution of bicarbonate that dominated in groundwater sprague 2005 li et al 2017 furthermore increased fecal coliform levels in some streams were observed during drought conditions table 1 this may be related to the lack of dilution and flushing processes caruso 2002a 2002b 2 3 impact of wildfire on water quality water from forest watersheds is widely used for water supply due to its high quality and lower treatment costs mast and clow 2008 miller et al 2013b murphy et al 2015 2020 rust et al 2018 however forest wildfires can significantly alter watershed hydrology stream water quality and stream ecosystems mast and clow 2008 shakesby and doerr 2006 costa et al 2014 reale et al 2015 emelko et al 2016 rust et al 2018 due to changes in the climate forest conditions and land use patterns the frequency and severity of wildfires have increased significantly andela et al 2017 dennison et al 2014 westerling 2016 radeloff et al 2018 wildfires can increase the total suspended solids mast and clow 2008 silins et al 2009 smith et al 2011 emmerton et al 2020 nutrients burke et al 2005 mast and clow 2008 writer et al 2012 son et al 2015 and metal transferred to rivers and streams burton et al 2016 costa et al 2014 emmerton et al 2020 the loss of forest cover due to wildfires can lower evapotranspiration interception and soil degradation neary 2011 ebel and moody 2017 wildfires can contribute to high ash and carbon particulates in watersheds due to combustion burton et al 2016 as a result of these changes a more significant proportion of rainfall with high ash and carbon particulates can be mobilized by overland runoff into streams leading to higher water quality degradation moody et al 2013 writer et al 2012 murphy et al 2012 writer and murphy 2012 son et al 2015 besides the changes in the flow paths along with the soil and organic matters can lead to impaired stream water quality and high costs for water treatment mataix solera et al 2011 emelko et al 2011 hallema et al 2019 2018 martin and hillen 2016 murphy et al 2018 robinne et al 2018 rust et al 2018 smith et al 2011 in this section we present post wildfire effects on water quality indicators in rivers and streams the potential impacts of wildfire on the water quality in different parts of the world are provided in table 2 higher levels of nitrogen phosphorus dissolved organic carbon doc and manganese mn and turbidity was reported in rivers and streams post wildfire events table 2 for example emelko et al 2011 observed higher turbidity dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved organic nitrogen don in streams from burned watersheds based on four years of monitoring additionally higher metal concentrations were reported either dissolved in water or attached to ash suspended sediments burke et al 2013 burton et al 2016 gallaher et al 2002 rust et al 2018 2019 smith et al 2011 this high level of nutrients e g organic carbon phosphorous nitrogen metal concentrations and dissolved organic matter in stream water may lead to excessive growth of algae and increased turbidity bladon et al 2014a 2014b smith et al 2011 tsai et al 2019 rust et al 2018 for example spencer et al 2003 observed massive algae blooms post wildfire the concentration of the suspended sediment in the streams post wildfire is influenced by several factors such as rainfall patterns watershed burn extent and severity erosion processes sediment sources and scale effects smith et al 2011 overall several studies highlighted that wildfires increase the concentration of suspended solids in the streams especially in the years following the wildfire smith et al 2011 emelko et al 2016 rust et al 2018 emmerton et al 2020 however the suspended solids may decrease after a year of the wildfire asvegetation coveris re established and fire impacts on soil and hillslope hydrological properties decline to the pre wildfire levels smith et al 2011 reneau et al 2007 2 4 impact of extreme rainfall and flooding on water quality extreme rainfall increases soil erosion chemical leaching urban waste and nutrient discharge from watersheds into streams and coastal aquifers mishra and singh 2010 heavy rainfall and subsequent stormwater runoff can mobilize pathogens and other microorganisms directly to streams which increases bacterial concentrations that in turn spread waterborne disease curriero et al 2001 schuster et al 2005 patz et al 2008 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc highlighted a 90 chance of increased frequency of extreme rainfall events in the 21st century and a potential increase in the higher latitude runoff by as much as 10 40 meehl et al 2007 the interaction between climate streamflow and water quality are investigated during the last decade oh and sankarasubramanian 2012 as well as the impacts of extreme flooding events on water quality ascott et al 2016 paerl et al 2019 zoppini et al 2019 hutchins et al 2020 in this section we discuss the potential impact of extreme flooding on water quality indicators in rivers and streams a summary of the potential impact of flooding on water quality worldwide is provided in table 3 the harmful algal blooms in lakes e g lake erie usa can be attributed to a series of intense rainstorms that led to record springtime discharge from rivers with a record amount of nutrients michalak 2016 on the other hand due to the extreme rainfall the high volume of water may dilute pollutants and flooding may increase sediment loads in streams and rivers hrdinka et al 2012 besides changes in precipitation patterns the time of occurrence along with the high frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events can significantly impact the physical and chemical characteristics of the water body brunetti et al 2001 bates et al 2008 as higher flows and velocity occur during a heavy rainfall event massive levels of particulate matter can be carried either in dissolved or suspended forms in river and streams braga et al 2017a 2017b joshi et al 2017 du et al 2018 the changes in stream water quality in terms of eutrophication and nutrient transport can be impacted by the changes in the flow level frisk et al 1997 kallio et al 1997 additionally alexander et al 1998 highlighted that nutrient loading to coastal zones likely varies primarily with flow volume extreme flooding can significantly alter stream water quality and stream ecosystems for example peng et al 2019 reported that flooding of restored wetlands has led to an increase in the phosphorous levels in streams however other studies reported a decrease in phosphorous content due to the absorption of iron and manganese oxides marrugo negrete et al 2019 hafeez et al 2019 furthermore extreme flooding can have different levels of impact on dissolved oxygen concentrations table 3 for example a few studies suggested a positive effect of flooding on dissolved oxygen ascott et al 2016 zoppini et al 2019 while others reported a negative impact e g paerl et al 2019 or a mixed response hutchins et al 2020 the extreme flooding may result in a more significant impact on water quality compared to droughts hrdinka et al 2012 2 5 impacts of climate extremes on microbial communities many environmental factors such as hydrology temperature nutrient availability land use and metal contamination affect the diversity and structure of microbial communities in lotic ecosystems most of the differences in diversity and community structure are found in different compartments within a stream e g benthic vs surface water driven by differences in organic matter e g zeglin 2015 in most lotic systems there is also decreasing microbial diversity and increasing evolution to typical freshwater microbes within the betaproteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes as streams turn into rivers read et al 2015 ruiz gonzález et al 2015 savio et al 2015 however few studies have examined changes in microbial communities regarding climate extremes such as during or after a flood or drought a disruption in typical microbial community structure including increased diversity across two of five stream networks was observed in a georgia usa study after increased precipitation and temperatures hassell et al 2018 in another study investigating microbial communities in the cache la poudre river watershed however decreased phylogenetic diversity was observed three months post flood and return of diversity after ten months garner et al 2016 changes in benthic microbial community diversity were also observed in desert streams after flooding and were linked to increased nutrients abed et al 2011 prolonged drought also may affect microbial communities although there are few studies that examined the entire microbial community a severe drought in the san francisco estuary dramatically increased microcystis and related toxin producing cyanobacteria likely due to increased residence time and temperature lehman et al 2017 in other stream environments during intermittent drought events microbial community diversity decreased in hyporheic habitats compared to surface water environments febria et al 2012 interestingly benthic biofilms changed from cyanobacterial to a diatom dominated community after a prolonged drought in a small scale experimental study likely due to changes in nutrients barthès et al 2015 3 analysis of impact of drought on water quality in different land use settings in this section we investigated the potential impact of droughts on water quality in two different types of watersheds these two watersheds were selected due to the long term availability of water quality data as well as they represent two different land use settings the first gauge usgs 03512000 lat 35 27 41 lon 83 21 13 is located in the oconaluftee river north carolina where forest lands dominate the watershed the second station usgs 02203873 lat 33 42 33 9 lon 84 14 21 0 is situated in cobbs creek georgia where urban lands dominate the watershed the data obtained from the two stations are daily streamflow turbidity tur dissolved oxygen do ph and specific conductance sc the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei was used vicente serrano et al 2010 to identify drought events the monthly time series 2015 to 2020 of spei streamflow and water quality indicators for forest and urban watersheds are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively both stations witnessed low flow during a drought period that continued through 2016 and 2017 which resulted in low tur and do values on the other hand an increase in tur and do values were observed during the wet periods the correlation between spei and flow tur and do were statistically significant at the two stations except for do values at oconaluftee river station which is dominated by forest lands on the other hand an increase in ph and sc values during droughts was observed at the watershed dominated by forest lands fig 2 however sc and ph showed an insignificant correlation with the droughts at the watershed dominated by urban lands fig 3 4 impact of cascading compound extreme events on water quality although the impacts of climate extremes on water quality indicators have been investigated the studies involving cascading compound events are limited these issues are highlighted in our recent projects mishra 2015 mishra and campbell 2017 in climate science compound events are characterized by two or more extreme events occurring simultaneously or successively seneviratne et al 2012 the compound event can also be a combination of human and natural related disasters mishra et al 2021 in simple terms a cascading compound event occurs due to the combination of two or more individual extreme events occurring successively simultaneously examples of cascading events are a a severe drought event followed by an extreme flood drought flood regime and b extreme drought followed by wildfire drought wildfire regimes which can be further compounded by flooding events the combination of drought and extreme rainfall can modulate water quality in which the deficit in precipitation and subsequent runoffs may lead to the deposition of pollutants within the soil during extreme rain events and subsequent flooding these pollutants are discharged into waterways with the result that stagnant water in urban areas can lead to severe issues of water quality a drought flood regime will affect water quality differently based on rural agriculture and urban landscape patterns the combination of extreme events is expected only to increase konapala et al 2020 therefore there is a need to advance our understanding of how these extreme rain and flooding events affect the dynamics of water quality the combined impact of drought and flood extremes on water quality is currently poorly understood and it is important to quantify how these combinations of climate extremes affect water quality in different types of landscape cascading of extreme events drought to wildfires is expected to change hydrology water quality and dynamics of microbial communities in watersheds it is essential to explore the change in water quality indicators within a watershed following the fire and the watershed conditions control them e g altered landscape and changing hydrology and changes in stream internal processes the consequences of drought wildfire regime also destroys the vegetation cover alters spatial soil properties e g infiltration and geomorphic features the results discussed in the following section are related to our research on drought flood regimes mishra 2015 4 1 analysis of drought flood cascading event on water quality south carolina usa experienced a severe drought followed by a historical extreme flooding event caused by hurricane joaquin during the 1st week of october 2015 this is a classic example of a cascading event where both types of hydrologic extremes extreme low and high flows were distinctly observed this section presents a synoptic overview of how historic rainfall and flooding have impacted the streamflow and water quality indicators the usgs station usgs 02110704 lat 33 49 58 lon 79 02 38 located in waccamaw river at conway marina in south carolina was selected to analyze the potential impact of cascading events on water quality indicators such as turbidity dissolved oxygen ph and specific conductance sc the timeline of the drought flood cascading event and its impact on water quality indicators are provided in figs 4 and 5 the daily streamflow due to severe drought was 12 m3 s october 1 which significantly changed to 525 m3 s october 7 during the extreme flooding event the extreme flooding event led to very high tur values in the streams of up to 40 fnu 400 higher than its values during droughts the do values also increased to 6 4 mg l during this extreme event october 4 2015 and then decreased to 3 mg l during the normal period november 18 both ph and sc values were reduced during the extreme flood event fig 4 higher amounts of sc were observed during the drought periods 16 μs mm compared to the flooding events 4 6 μs mm as shown in fig 4 fig 5 shows the cascading effects of the significant droughts and floods on the selected water quality indicators the highest tur values 40 fnu occurred during the rising limb before reaching the peak flow during the rising limb of the hydrograph tur and do values reached their peak values fig 5 the ph and sc values decreased significantly during the rising limb and remained constant at the peak discharge in the falling limb both ph and sc values increased slightly while tur and do mostly remained constant 5 analysis of drought and flood on microbial communities in different land use settings here we aim to assess the changes in microbial community structure from three different water sites in the congaree watershed near columbia south carolina under different water flow conditions the three were 1 pre urbanized congaree river site broad river bridge 2 post urbanized congaree river site congaree boat ramp and an urbanized small river site smith branch samples were collected in the spring and early summer april to june of 2016 changes in community structure in relation to water type river stream and flow rate were assessed by various indices of microbial diversity both alpha diversity richness and diversity and beta diversity similarities in communities between samples the flow rate is classified into three groups the standard flow is the mean of the daily mean discharges the low flow drought is the minimum 30 day mean of the daily mean discharges and the high flow flood is the maximum 30 day mean of the daily mean discharges we also assessed the impact of flow rate on microbial community composition within a water type 5 1 site descriptions and sample collection the congaree river basin is located in lexington richland and calhoun counties and covers 690 square miles the four watersheds are predominately within the sandhills region of the state but also are within the upper coastal plain near its convergence with the wateree river of the catawba river basin the urban land is comprised of the city of columbia of the 441 000 acres in the congaree river basin 34 6 is forested land 26 6 is agricultural land 19 0 is forested wetland 17 9 is urban land 0 3 is barren land 1 3 is water and 0 3 is non forested wetland meitzen and scdnr 2008 the urbanization percentage is encompassed mainly by the greater columbia metropolitan area the broad river and saluda river merge to form the congaree river which flows southeasterly for 50 miles and merges with the wateree river to form the santee river basin there are a total of 1 165 stream miles and 5 350 acres of lake waters in the congaree river basin meitzen and scdnr 2008 approximately 600 ml of congaree river basin water was collected within 1 l white high density polyethylene plastic bottles at upstream broad river bridge br 34 025929 81 070472 n 24 and downstream congaree river bridge crb 33 96491 81 036192 n 20 locations as well as at a tributary smith brank sb 34 038117 81 060088 n 20 from march june in 2016 for a total of 64 samples the bottles were stored in a cooler and driven to the life sciences facility at clemson university for analysis 5 2 sequencing prior to dna extraction 500 ml of each water sample was filtered through 0 22 µm and or 0 8 µm filters to collect the free living and particle attached bacterial communities respectively samples were stored at 80 c before nucleic acid extraction from the filters total dna was extracted from all samples using the qiagen allprep kit and was quantified with qubit fluorometric quantitation invitrogen using universal 16s rrna gene primers the v4 region of 16s rrna genes was amplified following previously published methods kozich et al 2013 the pcr conditions used consisted of 2 min at 95 c followed by 30 cycles of 95 c for 20 s 55 c for 15 s and 72 c for 5 min followed by 72 c for 10 min each pcr reaction was normalized using the sequalprep normalization plate kit thermo fisher scientific the concentrations of the extracted nucleic acid and pcr products were determined using qubit 2 0 after the cleanup process and normalization of the library pool sequencing was performed on the illumina miseq 4000 illumina san diego ca at clemson university using the 500 cycle miseq v2 reagent kit following the manufacturer s instructions with custom forward reverse and index primers added to the reagent cartridge 5 3 sequencing and statistical analyses the raw illumina fastq files were demultiplexed and the barcodes were removed on illumina basespace basespace illumina com preliminary screening of the raw sequence data resulted in trimming approximately 15 bp from the 5 and 20 50 bp from the 3 end of the sequence in order to remove low quality bases prior to joining the sequences were then analyzed using the latest qiime2 workflow bokulich et al 2018 briefly amplicon sequence variants asvs were determined in qiime2 via the dada2 pipeline using an open reference picking mode based on no more than 1 difference between sequences and likely represents strain to species level variation callahan et al 2016 taxonomic classification of the bacterial non chimeric denoised joined reads was performed using a qiime2 classifier sk learn pedregosa et al 2011 pre trained on silva v123 at 99 identity quast et al 2013 sequences that occurred 10 times in the entire dataset were removed using the filter table option additionally all taxa associated with chloroplast and mitochondria as well as unassigned taxa were removed representative bacterial asv sequences were further analyzed by multiple sequence alignment via mafft and fasttree to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree prior to beta diversity analyses katoh misawa et al 2002 the number of sequences in each sample were rarefied to 9900 prior to diversity analyses a comprehensive diversity analysis was performed using the diversity core metrics phylogenetic script in qiime2 bokulich et al 2018 data tables and shannon diversity index analysis shannon and weaver 1949 data were exported from qiime2 and further analyzed shannon diversity index estimates alpha diversity via a combination of the richness number of taxa in this case asvs and evenness of the asvs within a sample shannon and weaver 1949 to visualize the differences in asvs between samples and measure their significances principal coordinate analysis pcoa were performed in the vegan package oksanen et al 2015 on the r platform r core team 2017 and plotted with ggplot2 a significance test permanova test adonis tool with 999 permutations based on bray curtis distance was performed in qiime2 bokulich et al 2018 principle coordinate analyses takes the similarity or distance matrix generated from the asv taxa vs sample table and plots the relationships between the samples as an ordination in a lower dimensional space in this case in two dimensions legendre and legendre 2012 permanova permutational multivariate anova tests to see if the difference in the centroids of sample or treatment groups in an ordination plot are significantly different anderson 2005 linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse segata et al 2011 was used to identify bacterial taxa that were significantly different between sites and flow regimes within a site lda is similar to regression analysis or anova but the extent of difference is determined between two or more groups based on a linear relationship between continuous independent variables and a dependent variable that is categorical lda 2009 the kruskal wallis kw sum rank test p 0 05 was used in the lefse analysis to detect features with significantly different abundances between the specified categories and this was followed by an lda to estimate the effect size of each differentially abundant feature logarithmic lda score 3 0 through the on line galaxy platform http huttenhower sph harvard edu galaxy 5 4 microbial alpha diversity to visualize within sample diversity richness and evenness shannon diversity index was used as a nonparametric estimator of alpha diversity shannon and weaver 1949 overall samples from smith branch were more diverse than the broad river and congaree boat ramp and the highest diversity samples were at the smith branch and broad river bridge sites with high flow rates fig 6 the highest diversity values at all sites were in samples identified with high flow rates and these were significantly more diverse than the samples from the same site with either standard flow rates broad river bridge smith branch or low flow rates congaree boat ramp 5 5 microbial beta diversity we next wanted to determine if there were differences in microbial communities between samples and what was likely responsible for those differences samples collected from smith branch are distinct from those collected from broad river bridge and congaree boat ramp as assessed by bray curtis similarity with pcoa fig 7 additionally permanova analysis with bray curtis distances between locations indicated that microbial communities from the smith branch samples were significantly different than communities from the river sites f value of 18 6405 with p 0 001 the majority of explained variation 43 separated the communities by river type river vs stream along the x axis the second axis only explained 14 of the variation and was likely due to slight seasonal variations the effect of current flow intensity is subtler and more irregular than location or date however separate clustering occurred with microbial communities associated with low flow current compared to all other states of flow rate microbial communities associated with either standard flow or high flow also formed clusters more easily distinguishable from other groups 5 6 microbial composition the taxonomic makeup of the microbial communities from the broad river bridge and congaree boat ramp were generally consistent with each other and the dominant phyla were the bacteroidetes average relative abundance 29 2 actinobacteria 21 9 proteobacteria 19 7 and cyanobacteria 19 6 with lesser average abundances of verrucomicrobia 6 1 planctomycetes 0 8 and firmicutes 0 5 fig 8 in contrast the smith branch samples were dominated by proteobacteria 54 6 followed by bacteroidetes 17 9 with much less of the other phyla associated with the larger river sites actinobacteria 5 4 cyanobacteria 2 6 but with increased abundances of epsilonbacteraeota 4 2 and firmicutes 3 5 compared to the two river sites we next examined the abundance of different families associated with fecal contamination specifically the enterobacteraceae clostridia and bacteroidaceae which include many bacteria associated with human and animal microbiomes average abundances of these groups were generally much lower from both the broad river bridge and congaree boat ramp sites than the smith branch site fig 9 however at least one bacterial group the clostridia from four broad river bridge samples was greater than 10 times more abundant than all other samples from that site all four samples were taken during april during high flow regimes these bacterial groups were also at least twice as abundant from the smith branch samples characterized with high flow rates compared to low flow rates three of the orders families pseudomondales enterobacteraceae bacteroidaceae typically associated with fecal contamination were significantly more abundant in smith branch high flow samples vs standard or low flow samples fig 10 in addition the proteobacterial classes alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were also found to be significantly more abundant in high flow river samples compared to standard or low flow 5 7 discussion of the effect of drought and flood on microbial communities the microbial communities in the congaree river near columbia south carolina were somewhat diverse and compositionally similar to other large river and lake systems newton et al 2011 bacterial groups mainly associated with carbon and nutrient cycling from primary producers cyanobacteria to degraders bacteroidetes actinobacteria were found in relatively high abundance in the congaree river newton et al 2011 the community structure of the smith branch was much more diverse and different than that of the congaree river sites and was dominated by proteobacteria the structure of the microbial communities from the three sites were separated first by site broad river bridge and congaree boat ramp were clearly separate from the smith branch sample and then by month but less so by other factors such as size fraction however while flow regime did not explain the structure of the microbial communities flow rate was correlated to the diversity of microbes in a sample and certain samples characterized as having high flow rates from the smith branch and broad river bridge did have significantly higher abundances of bacteria associated with fecal contamination the types and percentages of microbes found in aquatic environments can tell us much about water quality ahmed et al 2016 certain normal river and lake phyla including the actinobacteria and cyanobacteria were generally more abundant in the congaree river sites than in the smith branch the overall composition of bacterial otus in the congaree river was similar to that observed in lakes newton et al 2011 indicating that the congaree river may be an important sink for co2 since up to 48 of the bacteria were classified as cyanobacteria which are primary producers actinobacteria which comprised between 9 and 37 of the microbes in the congaree river sample are normally found in well oxygenated lake and river waters and their abundance may decrease in oxygen poor environments newton et al 2011 the microbial communities in the smith branch were dominated by proteobacteria followed by the bacteroidetes phylum interestingly bacteria within the firmicutes and parcubacteria phyla were also increased in the smith branch these phyla are notably found in anoxic environments and many are found in association with fecal waste including the lactobacillales and clostridiales families within the firmicutes harris et al 2004 backhed et al 2005 in addition members of the enterobacteriaceae within the proteobacteria phylum as well as the bacteroideaceae family which includes bacteroides sp a very common species in the human gut microbiome were also variably present and most abundant during high flow regime samples 6 conclusions extreme weather events such as drought wildfires and flooding are predicted to increase throughout the world although the impacts of climate extremes on water quantity are widely studied their water quality assessment effects are limited this review highlighted the complex variety of water quality responses during extreme events in rivers streams in addition to climate variables and extremes the watershed characteristics such as geology slope land use and point or non point sources of pollutions play a significant role in controlling the stream water quality indicators the following conclusions can be drawn from this study several studies highlighted an increase in benthic algal levels in rivers and streams during the drought period the impact of drought on nutrient concentrations phosphorus and nitrogen and turbidity in streams can vary it mainly depends on the land use settings in a watershed e g agriculture urban forest specifically lower nutrient concentrations and turbidity were observed during droughts across several rivers and streams however point source facilities can increase the turbidity and nutrient concentrations during drought events mixed responses during droughts were observed for dissolved oxygen while the salinity and bacterial content showed a positive correlation in most streams rivers with the droughts the majority of studies examined the effects of wildfire on water quality suggested a significant increase in nutrient concentrations metal concentrations and mass loading rates of nitrite orthophosphate phosphate total and dissolved phosphorus post wildfire this change in water quality constituents relies mainly on the wildfire s severity and scale the timing of storm events and the post wildfire vegetation in a watershed additionally the biogeochemical processes can have ecological impacts on aquatic ecosystems flooding events can increase suspended particulate matter concentrations dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic carbon on the other hand mixed responses during floods were observed for phosphorous dissolved oxygen and nitrates there are significant and striking differences in the overall diversity and composition of the microbial communities observed between low and high urbanized areas only a subset of samples collected under high or very high flow rates tended to have significantly higher bacteria associated with fecal contamination indicators suggesting that flooding events correlate with poor water quality as hypothesized by us and others whitehead et al 2009 the cascading of extreme events e g drought flood regime can significantly affect water quality indicators however the knowledge is fragmented and limited about quantifying such impacts in real time conditions in the drought flood regime turbidity can substantially increase can be greater than 100 in streams this extreme regime can increase do and decrease the magnitude of ph and sc although the land use characteristics can also influence these characteristics overall the complex interaction between climate watershed and anthropogenic activities controls hydrologic extremes veettil and mishra 2020 konapala and mishra 2020 as well as water quality indicators alnahit et al 2020 therefore it is essential to develop robust frameworks in the context of sustainability science to quantify the interaction between different extreme events and coupled natural and human systems that influence stream water quality there is also a need to develop robust machine learning and process based models to generate water quality information in ungaugedriverbasins the remote sensing products can be useful especially for data scarce regions in many parts of the world chawla et al 2020 multidisciplinary efforts are necessary to integrate different systems e g watershed hydrology climate microbial communities and social systems to generate new knowledge about their

4752,the increase in dynamic interactions between climate and human activities threatens water security in terms of water quantity and quality most water security studies have focused on water quantity compared to water quality while both are equally important and vital for maintaining a healthy ecosystem and human well being the first part of the paper provides a review of the potential impacts of climate related extreme events i e drought flood and wildfires on different water quality indicators and the potential impact of cascading extreme events e g drought flood regimes on dynamics of water quality behavior in the second part of the paper we demonstrate the cascading impact of severe drought and an extreme historical flood event october 1 4 2015 in south carolina usa on water quality variables the effect of drought on water quality in contrasting land use settings is investigated finally water quality data was collected over a period of time in three types of land use settings to study the dynamics of multiple flood and drought events on microbial communities flooding conditions result in high levels of bacteria associated with fecal contamination especially in the stream setting where large differences between drought and flooding occur in the microbial communities the results highlight the significant impact of cascading events on water quality and microbial communities the effect of drought on water quality indicators in different land use settings can be different highlighting the dominant role of watershed characteristics overall it is essential to develop quantitative frameworks in the context of sustainability science to quantify the interaction between climate watershed and anthropogenic variables that control stream water quality this study highlights the importance of understanding the relationships between extreme events and water quality indicators as an important step to improve ecosystem health and sustainability finally some remarks are made on the knowledge gaps which need to be addressed in future studies keywords drought flood wildfire water quality microbial communities 1 introduction climate water and human activities are tightly connected due to large scale variability in their coupling behavior water security in terms of quantity and quality is a significant issue worldwide mishra and singh 2010 veettil and mishra 2020 although water quantity related problems get more attention water quality is equally important and vital for maintaining a healthy ecosystem and human well being the projected climate change will further alter the precipitation and evaporation at a global scale konapala et al 2020 that likely will increase climate extremes e g floods and droughts and result in higher streamflow dynamics that control the flow of nutrients and various water quality indicators the surface water quality is controlled by multiple variables including climatic hydrological and anthropogenic variables badruzzaman et al 2012 lintern et al 2018 abdul aziz and ahmed 2019 these variables can affect water quality at various temporal and spatial scales mosley 2015 lintern et al 2018 shoda et al 2019 recent evidence indicates an increase in extreme precipitation events prein et al 2017 vu and mishra 2020 flooding and droughts of greater intensity and duration ipcc 2014 konapala et al 2020 and these extremes impact water quality climate change is expected to bring more floods and droughts in the regions that are already witnessing these extremes on a global scale konapala et al 2020 the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are expected to increase in the future ipcc 2014 these extreme events can vary from wet e g flood extreme rainfall to extreme dry e g drought events which likely to impact water quantity quality as well as the soil physicochemical properties murdoch et al 2000 worrall et al 2009 senhorst and zwolsman 2005 kundzewicz et al 2008 drought flood and wildfires occur in a different part of the world and they are more prominent in certain geographical regions fig 1 according to the colorado flood observatory data set several locations worldwide have experienced flood inundation events with a duration of more than 30 days between 1985 to january 2015 fig 1a the extreme droughts are more common in semiarid locations such as northern and southwestern africa central asia australia western u s and the iberian peninsula fig 1b these drought events may increase the likelihood of wildfires westerling and swetnam 2003 murphy et al 2015 2020 flash floods whitehead et al 2009 and dust storms hahnenberger and nicoll 2014 reheis and urban 2011 much of the western us has experienced severe droughts accompanied by an increase in massive wildfires rust et al 2018 murphy et al 2020 the fire weather index a key indicator of extreme fire behavior potential is shown in fig 1c the fire hazards are more common in the western usa australia the southern and central parts of africa the southern northeastern part of south america and central asia it is essential to highlight that many regions dominated by fire hazards also witnessing more numerous drought and flood events fig 1 which can result in cascading compound events therefore understanding the extreme weather and climate events and their cascading effects particularly on stream water quality is essential to eliminate any potential impact on human health reduce water treatment costs and develop mitigation strategies in response to future extreme events the above discussion highlights the potential impact of climate and anthropogenic variables on water quality however it is difficult to pinpoint the role of climate due to a delicate and complex interplay of anthropogenic variables e g variety of land use across local to regional scale michalak 2016 this challenge is compounded by the limited understanding of the potential impact of individual and cascading effects of climate extremes on water quality the role of cascading events e g drought flood regimes on water quality is often neglected in this regard the overall objective of this study are a to provide a review on the potential impact of climate related extreme events i e drought flood and wildfires as well as cascading events on different water quality indicators b to investigate the potential impact of droughts on water quality indicators in different land use settings c to demonstrate the potential impact of a severe drought and extreme flood cascading event on water quality and d the potential impact of drought and flood regimes on microbial communities in different land use settings 2 review of the impact of land use and extreme events on stream water quality 2 1 impact of land uses on water quality the widespread change in land use patterns can have a significant impact on water quality and ecological integrity around the globe specifically urbanization agriculture deforestation and pasture conversion all pose a threat to biodiversity and lotic ecosystems miserendino et al 2011 numerous studies have shown that the high nutrient loads from agricultural andurban areas have dramatically reduced the water quality in rivers and streams foote et al 2015 these studies highlighted the positive correlations between the anthropogenic variables such as grazing agriculture and urbanization with the concentration of total suspended sediments tss nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus and dissolved oxygen in a watershed allan 2004 giri and qiu 2016 lintern et al 2018 suarez and puertas 2005 more specifically the tss and nutrients concentrations were higher in urban watersheds than forest watersheds whitehead et al 2009 tu 2011 giri et al 2018 there is also a clear positive correlation between the removal of vegetation in a watershed and water quality degradation meybeck and helmer 1989 a smaller number of studies have acknowledged the role of other watershed characteristics and climatic variables on stream water quality e g tramblay et al 2010 young et al 2005 lintern et al 2018 alnahit et al 2020 all these variables can potentially impact stream water quality as they can affect the source mobilization process and the delivery of constituents into the receiving streams granger et al 2010 for example steep watersheds were observed to impact water quality since steep slope facilitates the mobilization of pollutants into streams leading to water quality degradation kang et al 2010 wan et al 2014 alnahit et al 2020 similarly geological features and soil type in a watershed may also affect water quality biggs and gerbeaux 1993 varanka et al 2015 lintern et al 2018 alnahit et al 2020 for example watersheds dominated by parent rock e g igneous rocks showed low export of dissolved ions in contrast watersheds dominated by soft sedimentary rock e g limestone showed higher transfer of dissolved ions young et al 2005 moreover higher phosphorus concentrations in streams were reported in a watershed with high sediment deposition kirchner and dillon 1975 there are also strong links between geology and stream water temperature in which groundwater interaction with streamflow may impact water temperature poole and berman 2001 in addition groundwater levels may also alter stream water quality menció and mas pla 2008 sprague 2005 for example groundwater was observed to control the concentration of dissolved nutrients and calcium bicarbonate in streams within the south platte river basin colorado usa sprague 2005 2 2 impact of drought on water quality hydrologic drought is defined as a period with inadequate surface and subsurface water availability mishra and singh 2010 periods of drought may lead to significant consequences for water quality and quantity gámez et al 2019 jones and van vliet 2018 li et al 2017 lehman et al 2017 djebou 2017a 2017b waste load allocation golladay and battle 2002 hernandez and uddameri 2014 momblanch et al 2015 aquatic ecosystems van dijk et al 2013 gibson et al 2020 and quality quantity of water for irrigation mosley 2015 the impact of drought on the surface and groundwater resources may result in low flows and water availability leading to deteriorated water quality mishra and singh 2010 hrdinka et al 2012 mosley 2015 momblanch et al 2015 for example drought induced low flow regimes increase the water detention period and contribute to an increase in algal blooms due to high nutrient concentrations less dilution van vliet and zwolsman 2008 mosley 2015 palmer and montagna 2015 additionally the drought waterlogging cycles may affect the water quality by enhancing the decomposition of organic matter and sediments and flushing them into receiving streams hrdinka et al 2012 gámez et al 2019 jones and van vliet 2018 the higher temperatures during extreme droughts may also influence the stream respiration and reaeration rates in rivers and streams mosley 2015 table 1 summarizes the potential impact of drought on multiple water quality indicators across different parts of the world in the following sections we present an overview of droughts possible effect on various water quality indicators in rivers and streams 2 2 1 algae and turbidity the combination of low flow and high temperature during drought events increase algal blooms and chlorophyll a concentrations in streams table 1 for example massive algae blooms during drought periods were documented in darling barwon river australia lower nakdong river south korea the river murray australia donnelly et al 1997 ha et al 1999 bowling et al 2013 many studies have reported high algal values during droughts in streams and rivers van vliet and zwolsman 2008 gilbert et al 2012 garcía prieto et al 2012 de barroso et al 2018 the observed algae values were mainly attributed to low flows water column stratification and clarification and sometimes high temperatures mosley 2015 conflicting opinions are observed related to the behavior of turbidity during the drought period many studies observed low turbidity values during droughts across many rivers and streams which can be attributed to the lack of watershed runoff caruso 2002a 2002b mosley et al 2012 van vliet and zwolsman 2008 however the presence of point source pollutions that produce high suspended particles may increase turbidity due to lack of dilation and low flows caruso 2002a 2002b 2 2 2 nutrients and salinity the impact of drought on nutrient concentrations in streams depends mainly on the land use settings in a watershed e g agriculture urban forest as well as types of point source pollution for example lower nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were observed during droughts in many rivers and streams e g morecroft et al 2000 caruso 2002a 2002b golladay and battle 2002 oelsner et al 2007 hrdinka et al 2012 mosley et al 2012 de barroso et al 2018 this may be due to the lack of watershed runoff and increased denitrification due to a longer water residence time andersen et al 2004 baurès et al 2013 mosley 2015 on the other hand the point source pollution facilities located in highly urbanized watersheds may result in increases in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the streams andersen et al 2004 sprague 2005 van vliet and zwolsman 2008 macintosh et al 2011 hrdinka et al 2012 this is especially true when the flow from these facilities remains relatively constant during droughts a few other studies have also reported higher nitrate concentrations in agricultural watersheds during low flows baurès et al 2013 mosley 2015 the higher nitrate concentrations may be due to the influence of sediment and nitrogen fluxes during the drought mosley 2015 high salinities were positively correlated with increasing drought in most streams rivers jones and van vliet 2018 li et al 2017 mosley 2015 this can be due to sustained evaporation of surface water and less dilution of more saline groundwater inputs caruso 2002a 2002b van vliet and zwolsman 2008 mosley et al 2012 mosley 2015 additionally the increase in pyrite oxidation during droughts may increase the sulfate concentration in the stream mast 2013 however when the contribution of groundwater and saline point source facilities are small compared to the surface runoff salinity did not increase during droughts wilbers et al 2009 2 2 3 dissolved oxygen and ph drought has different levels of impact on dissolved oxygen concentrations table 1 in shallow streams insignificant changes in dissolved oxygen during droughts were observed hudson et al 1978 caruso 2002a 2002b hrdinka et al 2012 on the other hand studies have reported an increase in the dissolved oxygen values during daytime in droughts ha et al 1999 sprague 2005 van vliet and zwolsman 2008 this may be related to the enhanced primary production during the day however in watersheds with point source pollution facilities a decrease in dissolved oxygen was observed anderson and faust 1972 chessman and robinson 1987 this may be attributed to the fact that increases in nutrients lead to algal blooms when the algae die or run out of nutrients the bacteria start decomposing the organic matter dead algae and that leads to decreased oxygen concentrations to anoxic conditions if there is enough organic matter to degrade mosley 2015 ylla et al 2010 a statistically significant decrease in ph during drought was observed in many studies e g zieliński et al 2009 mosley et al 2012 however an increase in ph and alkalinity was observed due to less dilution of bicarbonate that dominated in groundwater sprague 2005 li et al 2017 furthermore increased fecal coliform levels in some streams were observed during drought conditions table 1 this may be related to the lack of dilution and flushing processes caruso 2002a 2002b 2 3 impact of wildfire on water quality water from forest watersheds is widely used for water supply due to its high quality and lower treatment costs mast and clow 2008 miller et al 2013b murphy et al 2015 2020 rust et al 2018 however forest wildfires can significantly alter watershed hydrology stream water quality and stream ecosystems mast and clow 2008 shakesby and doerr 2006 costa et al 2014 reale et al 2015 emelko et al 2016 rust et al 2018 due to changes in the climate forest conditions and land use patterns the frequency and severity of wildfires have increased significantly andela et al 2017 dennison et al 2014 westerling 2016 radeloff et al 2018 wildfires can increase the total suspended solids mast and clow 2008 silins et al 2009 smith et al 2011 emmerton et al 2020 nutrients burke et al 2005 mast and clow 2008 writer et al 2012 son et al 2015 and metal transferred to rivers and streams burton et al 2016 costa et al 2014 emmerton et al 2020 the loss of forest cover due to wildfires can lower evapotranspiration interception and soil degradation neary 2011 ebel and moody 2017 wildfires can contribute to high ash and carbon particulates in watersheds due to combustion burton et al 2016 as a result of these changes a more significant proportion of rainfall with high ash and carbon particulates can be mobilized by overland runoff into streams leading to higher water quality degradation moody et al 2013 writer et al 2012 murphy et al 2012 writer and murphy 2012 son et al 2015 besides the changes in the flow paths along with the soil and organic matters can lead to impaired stream water quality and high costs for water treatment mataix solera et al 2011 emelko et al 2011 hallema et al 2019 2018 martin and hillen 2016 murphy et al 2018 robinne et al 2018 rust et al 2018 smith et al 2011 in this section we present post wildfire effects on water quality indicators in rivers and streams the potential impacts of wildfire on the water quality in different parts of the world are provided in table 2 higher levels of nitrogen phosphorus dissolved organic carbon doc and manganese mn and turbidity was reported in rivers and streams post wildfire events table 2 for example emelko et al 2011 observed higher turbidity dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved organic nitrogen don in streams from burned watersheds based on four years of monitoring additionally higher metal concentrations were reported either dissolved in water or attached to ash suspended sediments burke et al 2013 burton et al 2016 gallaher et al 2002 rust et al 2018 2019 smith et al 2011 this high level of nutrients e g organic carbon phosphorous nitrogen metal concentrations and dissolved organic matter in stream water may lead to excessive growth of algae and increased turbidity bladon et al 2014a 2014b smith et al 2011 tsai et al 2019 rust et al 2018 for example spencer et al 2003 observed massive algae blooms post wildfire the concentration of the suspended sediment in the streams post wildfire is influenced by several factors such as rainfall patterns watershed burn extent and severity erosion processes sediment sources and scale effects smith et al 2011 overall several studies highlighted that wildfires increase the concentration of suspended solids in the streams especially in the years following the wildfire smith et al 2011 emelko et al 2016 rust et al 2018 emmerton et al 2020 however the suspended solids may decrease after a year of the wildfire asvegetation coveris re established and fire impacts on soil and hillslope hydrological properties decline to the pre wildfire levels smith et al 2011 reneau et al 2007 2 4 impact of extreme rainfall and flooding on water quality extreme rainfall increases soil erosion chemical leaching urban waste and nutrient discharge from watersheds into streams and coastal aquifers mishra and singh 2010 heavy rainfall and subsequent stormwater runoff can mobilize pathogens and other microorganisms directly to streams which increases bacterial concentrations that in turn spread waterborne disease curriero et al 2001 schuster et al 2005 patz et al 2008 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc highlighted a 90 chance of increased frequency of extreme rainfall events in the 21st century and a potential increase in the higher latitude runoff by as much as 10 40 meehl et al 2007 the interaction between climate streamflow and water quality are investigated during the last decade oh and sankarasubramanian 2012 as well as the impacts of extreme flooding events on water quality ascott et al 2016 paerl et al 2019 zoppini et al 2019 hutchins et al 2020 in this section we discuss the potential impact of extreme flooding on water quality indicators in rivers and streams a summary of the potential impact of flooding on water quality worldwide is provided in table 3 the harmful algal blooms in lakes e g lake erie usa can be attributed to a series of intense rainstorms that led to record springtime discharge from rivers with a record amount of nutrients michalak 2016 on the other hand due to the extreme rainfall the high volume of water may dilute pollutants and flooding may increase sediment loads in streams and rivers hrdinka et al 2012 besides changes in precipitation patterns the time of occurrence along with the high frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events can significantly impact the physical and chemical characteristics of the water body brunetti et al 2001 bates et al 2008 as higher flows and velocity occur during a heavy rainfall event massive levels of particulate matter can be carried either in dissolved or suspended forms in river and streams braga et al 2017a 2017b joshi et al 2017 du et al 2018 the changes in stream water quality in terms of eutrophication and nutrient transport can be impacted by the changes in the flow level frisk et al 1997 kallio et al 1997 additionally alexander et al 1998 highlighted that nutrient loading to coastal zones likely varies primarily with flow volume extreme flooding can significantly alter stream water quality and stream ecosystems for example peng et al 2019 reported that flooding of restored wetlands has led to an increase in the phosphorous levels in streams however other studies reported a decrease in phosphorous content due to the absorption of iron and manganese oxides marrugo negrete et al 2019 hafeez et al 2019 furthermore extreme flooding can have different levels of impact on dissolved oxygen concentrations table 3 for example a few studies suggested a positive effect of flooding on dissolved oxygen ascott et al 2016 zoppini et al 2019 while others reported a negative impact e g paerl et al 2019 or a mixed response hutchins et al 2020 the extreme flooding may result in a more significant impact on water quality compared to droughts hrdinka et al 2012 2 5 impacts of climate extremes on microbial communities many environmental factors such as hydrology temperature nutrient availability land use and metal contamination affect the diversity and structure of microbial communities in lotic ecosystems most of the differences in diversity and community structure are found in different compartments within a stream e g benthic vs surface water driven by differences in organic matter e g zeglin 2015 in most lotic systems there is also decreasing microbial diversity and increasing evolution to typical freshwater microbes within the betaproteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes as streams turn into rivers read et al 2015 ruiz gonzález et al 2015 savio et al 2015 however few studies have examined changes in microbial communities regarding climate extremes such as during or after a flood or drought a disruption in typical microbial community structure including increased diversity across two of five stream networks was observed in a georgia usa study after increased precipitation and temperatures hassell et al 2018 in another study investigating microbial communities in the cache la poudre river watershed however decreased phylogenetic diversity was observed three months post flood and return of diversity after ten months garner et al 2016 changes in benthic microbial community diversity were also observed in desert streams after flooding and were linked to increased nutrients abed et al 2011 prolonged drought also may affect microbial communities although there are few studies that examined the entire microbial community a severe drought in the san francisco estuary dramatically increased microcystis and related toxin producing cyanobacteria likely due to increased residence time and temperature lehman et al 2017 in other stream environments during intermittent drought events microbial community diversity decreased in hyporheic habitats compared to surface water environments febria et al 2012 interestingly benthic biofilms changed from cyanobacterial to a diatom dominated community after a prolonged drought in a small scale experimental study likely due to changes in nutrients barthès et al 2015 3 analysis of impact of drought on water quality in different land use settings in this section we investigated the potential impact of droughts on water quality in two different types of watersheds these two watersheds were selected due to the long term availability of water quality data as well as they represent two different land use settings the first gauge usgs 03512000 lat 35 27 41 lon 83 21 13 is located in the oconaluftee river north carolina where forest lands dominate the watershed the second station usgs 02203873 lat 33 42 33 9 lon 84 14 21 0 is situated in cobbs creek georgia where urban lands dominate the watershed the data obtained from the two stations are daily streamflow turbidity tur dissolved oxygen do ph and specific conductance sc the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei was used vicente serrano et al 2010 to identify drought events the monthly time series 2015 to 2020 of spei streamflow and water quality indicators for forest and urban watersheds are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively both stations witnessed low flow during a drought period that continued through 2016 and 2017 which resulted in low tur and do values on the other hand an increase in tur and do values were observed during the wet periods the correlation between spei and flow tur and do were statistically significant at the two stations except for do values at oconaluftee river station which is dominated by forest lands on the other hand an increase in ph and sc values during droughts was observed at the watershed dominated by forest lands fig 2 however sc and ph showed an insignificant correlation with the droughts at the watershed dominated by urban lands fig 3 4 impact of cascading compound extreme events on water quality although the impacts of climate extremes on water quality indicators have been investigated the studies involving cascading compound events are limited these issues are highlighted in our recent projects mishra 2015 mishra and campbell 2017 in climate science compound events are characterized by two or more extreme events occurring simultaneously or successively seneviratne et al 2012 the compound event can also be a combination of human and natural related disasters mishra et al 2021 in simple terms a cascading compound event occurs due to the combination of two or more individual extreme events occurring successively simultaneously examples of cascading events are a a severe drought event followed by an extreme flood drought flood regime and b extreme drought followed by wildfire drought wildfire regimes which can be further compounded by flooding events the combination of drought and extreme rainfall can modulate water quality in which the deficit in precipitation and subsequent runoffs may lead to the deposition of pollutants within the soil during extreme rain events and subsequent flooding these pollutants are discharged into waterways with the result that stagnant water in urban areas can lead to severe issues of water quality a drought flood regime will affect water quality differently based on rural agriculture and urban landscape patterns the combination of extreme events is expected only to increase konapala et al 2020 therefore there is a need to advance our understanding of how these extreme rain and flooding events affect the dynamics of water quality the combined impact of drought and flood extremes on water quality is currently poorly understood and it is important to quantify how these combinations of climate extremes affect water quality in different types of landscape cascading of extreme events drought to wildfires is expected to change hydrology water quality and dynamics of microbial communities in watersheds it is essential to explore the change in water quality indicators within a watershed following the fire and the watershed conditions control them e g altered landscape and changing hydrology and changes in stream internal processes the consequences of drought wildfire regime also destroys the vegetation cover alters spatial soil properties e g infiltration and geomorphic features the results discussed in the following section are related to our research on drought flood regimes mishra 2015 4 1 analysis of drought flood cascading event on water quality south carolina usa experienced a severe drought followed by a historical extreme flooding event caused by hurricane joaquin during the 1st week of october 2015 this is a classic example of a cascading event where both types of hydrologic extremes extreme low and high flows were distinctly observed this section presents a synoptic overview of how historic rainfall and flooding have impacted the streamflow and water quality indicators the usgs station usgs 02110704 lat 33 49 58 lon 79 02 38 located in waccamaw river at conway marina in south carolina was selected to analyze the potential impact of cascading events on water quality indicators such as turbidity dissolved oxygen ph and specific conductance sc the timeline of the drought flood cascading event and its impact on water quality indicators are provided in figs 4 and 5 the daily streamflow due to severe drought was 12 m3 s october 1 which significantly changed to 525 m3 s october 7 during the extreme flooding event the extreme flooding event led to very high tur values in the streams of up to 40 fnu 400 higher than its values during droughts the do values also increased to 6 4 mg l during this extreme event october 4 2015 and then decreased to 3 mg l during the normal period november 18 both ph and sc values were reduced during the extreme flood event fig 4 higher amounts of sc were observed during the drought periods 16 μs mm compared to the flooding events 4 6 μs mm as shown in fig 4 fig 5 shows the cascading effects of the significant droughts and floods on the selected water quality indicators the highest tur values 40 fnu occurred during the rising limb before reaching the peak flow during the rising limb of the hydrograph tur and do values reached their peak values fig 5 the ph and sc values decreased significantly during the rising limb and remained constant at the peak discharge in the falling limb both ph and sc values increased slightly while tur and do mostly remained constant 5 analysis of drought and flood on microbial communities in different land use settings here we aim to assess the changes in microbial community structure from three different water sites in the congaree watershed near columbia south carolina under different water flow conditions the three were 1 pre urbanized congaree river site broad river bridge 2 post urbanized congaree river site congaree boat ramp and an urbanized small river site smith branch samples were collected in the spring and early summer april to june of 2016 changes in community structure in relation to water type river stream and flow rate were assessed by various indices of microbial diversity both alpha diversity richness and diversity and beta diversity similarities in communities between samples the flow rate is classified into three groups the standard flow is the mean of the daily mean discharges the low flow drought is the minimum 30 day mean of the daily mean discharges and the high flow flood is the maximum 30 day mean of the daily mean discharges we also assessed the impact of flow rate on microbial community composition within a water type 5 1 site descriptions and sample collection the congaree river basin is located in lexington richland and calhoun counties and covers 690 square miles the four watersheds are predominately within the sandhills region of the state but also are within the upper coastal plain near its convergence with the wateree river of the catawba river basin the urban land is comprised of the city of columbia of the 441 000 acres in the congaree river basin 34 6 is forested land 26 6 is agricultural land 19 0 is forested wetland 17 9 is urban land 0 3 is barren land 1 3 is water and 0 3 is non forested wetland meitzen and scdnr 2008 the urbanization percentage is encompassed mainly by the greater columbia metropolitan area the broad river and saluda river merge to form the congaree river which flows southeasterly for 50 miles and merges with the wateree river to form the santee river basin there are a total of 1 165 stream miles and 5 350 acres of lake waters in the congaree river basin meitzen and scdnr 2008 approximately 600 ml of congaree river basin water was collected within 1 l white high density polyethylene plastic bottles at upstream broad river bridge br 34 025929 81 070472 n 24 and downstream congaree river bridge crb 33 96491 81 036192 n 20 locations as well as at a tributary smith brank sb 34 038117 81 060088 n 20 from march june in 2016 for a total of 64 samples the bottles were stored in a cooler and driven to the life sciences facility at clemson university for analysis 5 2 sequencing prior to dna extraction 500 ml of each water sample was filtered through 0 22 µm and or 0 8 µm filters to collect the free living and particle attached bacterial communities respectively samples were stored at 80 c before nucleic acid extraction from the filters total dna was extracted from all samples using the qiagen allprep kit and was quantified with qubit fluorometric quantitation invitrogen using universal 16s rrna gene primers the v4 region of 16s rrna genes was amplified following previously published methods kozich et al 2013 the pcr conditions used consisted of 2 min at 95 c followed by 30 cycles of 95 c for 20 s 55 c for 15 s and 72 c for 5 min followed by 72 c for 10 min each pcr reaction was normalized using the sequalprep normalization plate kit thermo fisher scientific the concentrations of the extracted nucleic acid and pcr products were determined using qubit 2 0 after the cleanup process and normalization of the library pool sequencing was performed on the illumina miseq 4000 illumina san diego ca at clemson university using the 500 cycle miseq v2 reagent kit following the manufacturer s instructions with custom forward reverse and index primers added to the reagent cartridge 5 3 sequencing and statistical analyses the raw illumina fastq files were demultiplexed and the barcodes were removed on illumina basespace basespace illumina com preliminary screening of the raw sequence data resulted in trimming approximately 15 bp from the 5 and 20 50 bp from the 3 end of the sequence in order to remove low quality bases prior to joining the sequences were then analyzed using the latest qiime2 workflow bokulich et al 2018 briefly amplicon sequence variants asvs were determined in qiime2 via the dada2 pipeline using an open reference picking mode based on no more than 1 difference between sequences and likely represents strain to species level variation callahan et al 2016 taxonomic classification of the bacterial non chimeric denoised joined reads was performed using a qiime2 classifier sk learn pedregosa et al 2011 pre trained on silva v123 at 99 identity quast et al 2013 sequences that occurred 10 times in the entire dataset were removed using the filter table option additionally all taxa associated with chloroplast and mitochondria as well as unassigned taxa were removed representative bacterial asv sequences were further analyzed by multiple sequence alignment via mafft and fasttree to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree prior to beta diversity analyses katoh misawa et al 2002 the number of sequences in each sample were rarefied to 9900 prior to diversity analyses a comprehensive diversity analysis was performed using the diversity core metrics phylogenetic script in qiime2 bokulich et al 2018 data tables and shannon diversity index analysis shannon and weaver 1949 data were exported from qiime2 and further analyzed shannon diversity index estimates alpha diversity via a combination of the richness number of taxa in this case asvs and evenness of the asvs within a sample shannon and weaver 1949 to visualize the differences in asvs between samples and measure their significances principal coordinate analysis pcoa were performed in the vegan package oksanen et al 2015 on the r platform r core team 2017 and plotted with ggplot2 a significance test permanova test adonis tool with 999 permutations based on bray curtis distance was performed in qiime2 bokulich et al 2018 principle coordinate analyses takes the similarity or distance matrix generated from the asv taxa vs sample table and plots the relationships between the samples as an ordination in a lower dimensional space in this case in two

a dependent variable that is categorical lda 2009 the kruskal wallis kw sum rank test p 0 05 was used in the lefse analysis to detect features with significantly different abundances between the specified categories and this was followed by an lda to estimate the effect size of each differentially abundant feature logarithmic lda score 3 0 through the on line galaxy platform http huttenhower

and weaver 1949 overall samples from smith branch were more diverse than the broad river and congaree boat ramp and the highest diversity samples were at the smith branch and broad river bridge sites with high flow rates fig 6 the highest diversity values at all sites were in samples identified with high flow rates and these were significantly more diverse than the samples from the same site with either standard flow rates broad river bridge smith branch or low flow rates congaree boat ramp 5 5 microbial beta diversity we next wanted to determine if there were differences in microbial communities between samples and what was likely responsible for those differences samples collected from smith branch are distinct from those collected from broad river bridge and congaree boat ramp as assessed by bray curtis similarity with pcoa fig 7 additionally permanova analysis with bray curtis distances between locations indicated that microbial communities from the smith branch samples were significantly different than communities from the river sites f value of 18 6405 with p 0 001 the majority of explained variation 43 separated the communities by river type river vs stream along the x axis the second axis only explained 14 of the variation and was likely due to slight seasonal variations the effect of current flow intensity is subtler and more irregular than location or date however separate clustering occurred with microbial communities associated with low flow current compared to all other states of flow rate microbial communities associated with either standard flow or high flow also formed clusters more easily distinguishable from other groups 5 6 microbial composition the taxonomic makeup of the microbial communities from the broad river bridge and congaree boat ramp were generally consistent with each other and the dominant phyla were the bacteroidetes average relative abundance 29 2 actinobacteria 21 9 proteobacteria 19 7 and cyanobacteria 19 6 with lesser average abundances of verrucomicrobia 6 1 planctomycetes 0 8 and firmicutes 0 5 fig 8 in contrast the smith branch samples were dominated by proteobacteria 54 6 followed by bacteroidetes 17 9 with much less of the other phyla associated with the larger river sites actinobacteria 5 4 cyanobacteria 2 6 but with increased abundances of epsilonbacteraeota 4 2 and firmicutes 3 5 compared to the two river sites we next examined the abundance of different families associated with fecal contamination specifically the enterobacteraceae clostridia and bacteroidaceae which include many bacteria associated with human and animal microbiomes average abundances of these groups were generally much lower from both the broad river bridge and congaree boat ramp sites than the smith branch site fig 9 however at least one bacterial group the clostridia from four broad river bridge samples was greater than 10 times more abundant than all other samples from that site all four samples were taken during april during high flow regimes these bacterial groups were also at least twice as abundant from the smith branch samples characterized with high flow rates compared to low flow rates three of the orders families pseudomondales enterobacteraceae bacteroidaceae typically associated with fecal contamination were significantly more abundant in smith branch high flow samples vs standard or low flow samples fig 10 in addition the proteobacterial classes alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were also found to be significantly more abundant in high flow river samples compared to standard or low flow 5 7 discussion of the effect of drought and flood on microbial communities the microbial communities in the congaree river near columbia south carolina were somewhat diverse and compositionally similar to other large river and lake systems newton et al 2011 bacterial groups mainly associated with carbon and nutrient cycling from primary producers cyanobacteria to degraders bacteroidetes actinobacteria were found in relatively high abundance in the congaree river newton et al 2011 the community structure of the smith branch was much more diverse and different than that of the congaree river sites and was dominated by proteobacteria the structure of the microbial communities from the three sites were separated first by site broad river bridge and congaree boat ramp were clearly separate from the smith branch sample and then by month but less so by other factors such as size fraction however while flow regime did not explain the structure of the microbial communities flow rate was correlated to the diversity of microbes in a sample and certain samples characterized as having high flow rates from the smith branch and broad river bridge did have significantly higher abundances of bacteria associated with fecal contamination the types and percentages of microbes found in aquatic environments can tell us much about water quality ahmed et al 2016 certain normal river and lake phyla including the actinobacteria and cyanobacteria were generally more abundant in the congaree river sites than in the smith branch the overall composition of bacterial otus in the congaree river was similar to that observed in lakes newton et al 2011 indicating that the congaree river may be an important sink for co2 since up to 48 of the bacteria were classified as cyanobacteria which are primary producers actinobacteria which comprised between 9 and 37 of the microbes in the congaree river sample are normally found in well oxygenated lake and river waters and their abundance may decrease in oxygen poor environments newton et al 2011 the microbial communities in the smith branch were dominated by proteobacteria followed by the bacteroidetes phylum interestingly bacteria within the firmicutes and parcubacteria phyla were also increased in the smith branch these phyla are notably found in anoxic environments and many are found in association with fecal waste including the lactobacillales and clostridiales families within the firmicutes harris et al 2004 backhed et al 2005 in addition members of the enterobacteriaceae within the proteobacteria phylum as well as the bacteroideaceae family which includes bacteroides sp a very common species in the human gut microbiome were also variably present and most abundant during high flow regime samples 6 conclusions extreme weather events such as drought wildfires and flooding are predicted to increase throughout the world although the impacts of climate extremes on water quantity are widely studied their water quality assessment effects are limited this review highlighted the complex variety of water quality responses during extreme events in rivers streams in addition to climate variables and extremes the watershed characteristics such as geology slope land use and point or non point sources of pollutions play a significant role in controlling the stream water quality indicators the following conclusions can be drawn from this study several studies highlighted an increase in benthic algal levels in rivers and streams during the drought period the impact of drought on nutrient concentrations phosphorus and nitrogen and turbidity in streams can vary it mainly depends on the land use settings in a watershed e g agriculture urban forest specifically lower nutrient concentrations and turbidity were observed during droughts across several rivers and streams however point source facilities can increase the turbidity and nutrient concentrations during drought events mixed responses during droughts were observed for dissolved oxygen while the salinity and bacterial content showed a positive correlation in most streams rivers with the droughts the majority of studies examined the effects of wildfire on water quality suggested a significant increase in nutrient concentrations metal concentrations and mass loading rates of nitrite orthophosphate phosphate total and dissolved phosphorus post wildfire this change in water quality constituents relies mainly on the wildfire s severity and scale the timing of storm events and the post wildfire vegetation in a watershed additionally the biogeochemical processes can have ecological impacts on aquatic ecosystems flooding events can increase suspended particulate matter concentrations dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic carbon on the other hand mixed responses during floods were observed for phosphorous dissolved oxygen and nitrates there are significant and striking differences in the overall diversity and composition of the microbial communities observed between low and high urbanized areas only a subset of samples collected under high or very high flow rates tended to have significantly higher bacteria associated with fecal contamination indicators suggesting that flooding events correlate with poor water quality as hypothesized by us and others whitehead et al 2009 the cascading of extreme events e g drought flood regime can significantly affect water quality indicators however the knowledge is fragmented and limited about quantifying such impacts in real time conditions in the drought flood regime turbidity can substantially increase can be greater than 100 in streams this extreme regime can increase do and decrease the magnitude of ph and sc although the land use characteristics can also influence these characteristics overall the complex interaction between climate watershed and anthropogenic activities controls hydrologic extremes veettil and mishra 2020 konapala and mishra 2020 as well as water quality indicators alnahit et al 2020 therefore it is essential to develop robust frameworks in the context of sustainability science to quantify the interaction between different extreme events and coupled natural and human systems that influence stream water quality there is also a need to develop robust machine learning and process based models to generate water quality information in ungaugedriverbasins the remote sensing products can be useful especially for data scarce regions in many parts of the world chawla et al 2020 multidisciplinary efforts are necessary to integrate different systems e g watershed hydrology climate microbial communities and social systems to generate new knowledge about their

4753,soil freezing thawing is an important mechanism to control soil water and heat redistribution in mid to high latitudes salt in the agricultural soil from mid to high latitudes can alter characteristics of soil freezing thawing cycle and then affect soil thermal and hydrological processes in winter and finally cause salinization in spring to quantify the impacts of soil salinization on soil water and heat transport in saline soils we conducted field experiments on soil water and heat dynamics in two typical agricultural regions of northern china with different climate and soil conditions the coupled soil heat and water model coupmodel has been extended to account for the dynamic impacts of salt on freezing point depression the newly added module improved the representation of soil freezing point depression by significantly improving model performance between simulated and measured soil temperatures especially around freezing point with mean error me for the soil temperature at various depths reduced by 16 to 77 for the entire winter period with a systematic model calibration approach processes related to energy balance and soil freezing thawing have been well constrained for both study sites with different characteristics for soil hydrology and energy balance the model generally showed good performance with respect to soil moisture and temperature for both the calibration and validation periods our study has demonstrated a new modeling approach to successfully account for the impacts of salt on soil freezing thawing and the new module can be a useful tool to address the salinization problems in mid to high latitudes with respect to climate change and water management keywords saline soil freezing point depression seasonal frost sensitivity analysis soil hydrology 1 introduction soil freezing and thawing processes have long been recognized for their importance in not only engineering applications e g construction of roads and pipelines hansson et al 2004 wettlaufer and worster 2006 but also environmental issues e g soil erosion flooding and pollutants migration baker and spaans 1997 mccauley et al 2002 particularly knowledge on soil freezing and thawing is crucial in the aspects of water and salt distribution in the soil baker and osterkamp 1989 frost heaving wettlaufer and worster 2006 as well as climate change and water management in cold regions lopez et al 2007 laboratory and field experiments have been conducted to investigate hydrological characteristics of soil freezing thawing in cold regions but most of them only focused on the soil freezing characteristics under various climate and soil conditions black and tice 1989 spaans and baker 1996 azmatch et al 2012 yu et al 2018 mwangi et al 2020 and regional water and energy balance in winter hayashi et al 2004 watanabe et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 some other studies have demonstrated the importance of accounting for salt impacts on water and energy transfer in frozen soils cary et al 1979 found salt can decrease frost heaving and increase infiltration in frozen soils based on observations konrad and mccammon 1990 found the expulsion of salt from ice is dependent on the freezing rate of soil wang et al 2016 compared water and salt fluxes in the same regions as our study and detected the different flow characteristics of salt during soil freezing and thawing seasons they demonstrated that the effects of salt expulsion and dispersion were not negligible in frozen soils wu et al 2016a found that evaporation during winter was controlled by soil salt and groundwater from the field frost tube experiments in inner mongolia china the measurements have indicated that water heat and salt transport in frozen soils are fully coupled despite large uncertainties exist in measurements due to the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties and technical difficulties hydrological models for instance the hspf bicknell et al 1997 sutra voss 2003 mike she graham and butts 2005 stemmus ft yu et al 2018 and hydrogeosphere schilling et al 2019 were often applied to the entire agricultural fields or watersheds for simulating hydrological processes and they have taken soil freezing and thawing into accounts however as these models were developed to represent water flows for the entire regions they used less rigorous mathematical implementations to simulate soil freezing thawing processes and few of them have accounted for the influences of salts on soil freezing thawing flerchinger and saxton 1989 one dimensional modeling approach was more common in cold regions vertical water and heat transport studies since more detailed processes were considered in frozen soils and parameters were much easier to control given enough observational data in this study we have chosen a process based model coupmodel as our modelling tool coupmodel is a process oriented model that explicitly simulates the coupled transfer of water heat and elements e g carbon nutrients and salts in a vertical atmosphere plant soil continuum jansson and karlberg 2004 this model is flexible to set up the simulation time step and the thickness of soil layers which should be consistent to what experimental data is based on moreover coupmodel is capable of conducting uncertainty analysis in the simulation of soil freezing and thawing due to the complexity of water ice phase change and the coupled thermal and hydrological transport processes to quantify or reduce the uncertainties in modeling a monte carlo ensemble based simulation method has been implemented into coupmodel by combining the experimental data with numerical models and using multiple model performance indices to constrain various model processes this method together with coupmodel has been applied to forests gustafsson et al 2004 wu et al 2013 agricultural fields wu et al 2011 2016b permafrost zhang et al 2012 scherler et al 2013 and other cold region ecosystems okkonen and kløve 2011 khoshkhoo et al 2015 rasmussen et al 2018 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 in this study we performed experiments on water and heat transport at two seasonal frost sites with different characteristics in climate and in soil conditions both sites are located in important agricultural regions of northern china the hetao irrigation district in china is a typical arid agricultural region suffering from soil salinization due to the saline water irrigation extensive evaporation as well as soil freezing thawing li et al 2012 the heidingzi river irrigation district is a typical paddy rice region in the northeastern part of china suffering from salinization due to over development of the salinized field into the agricultural field liu et al 2001 soils in both regions undergo seasonal freezing thawing under shallow groundwater in winter which always results in salinization in spring this salinization in spring will influence the sowing and reduce productivity during the growing season moreover both sites are crucial in water resources management in mid to high latitudes under the concept of water saving agriculture therefore it is important to study the water heat and salt transport processes in winter for better water management in these two regions some recent efforts have been taken to unveil the driving force of agricultural salinization in mid to high latitudes wu et al 2016b performed the calibration on soil water and heat transport based on one plot in the experimental field in hetao irrigation district located in inner mongolia and found that the influences of salt on soil freezing should be taken into account wang et al 2016 conducted field experiments and analyzed the water and solutes transport characteristics at both sites and demonstrated that salt transport in frozen soils is more complicated than in unfrozen soils due to the impacts of diffusion and salt expulsion previous studies have shown that model data is an efficient way of understanding complex processes in cold regions via the proper quantification of uncertainties both in the measurements and modeling wu et al 2011 2016b 2019 mwangi et al 2020 therefore a comprehensive understanding on the salt impacts on freezing thawing soils is meaningful with the coupmodel combined with field experiments in this work we first developed a new module in coupmodel to account for the impacts of salt on soil freezing thawing in the second step we calibrated the new model using measurements collected from two study sites to simulate soil moisture and temperatures in two seasonal frost agricultural soils lastly based on the improved modeling results we disentangled the impacts of salt on the coupled water and heat transport in seasonally frozen soils and revealed their implications for regional hydrological modeling in mid to high latitudes 2 coupmodel the model domain covers the top 6 m of the soil with water and energy balance considered in a unit area fig 1 the soil profile for each study site was discretized into 16 layers with a thickness of 10 cm for layers from surface to 40 cm a thickness of 20 cm for layers from 40 cm to 2 m and a thickness of 1 m for layers from 2 m to 6 m the model used hourly meteorological data as model input 2 1 water heat and salt transport processes in a seasonally frozen soil the transport of water heat and salt in soil profile is coupled with lower boundary groundwater and upper boundary atmosphere fig 1 water transport processes in coupmodel were simulated by

consideration see coupmodel manual soil evaporation snow and radiation processes jansson 2012 lower boundary was set as saturated soil layer at 6 m depth and lateral drainage was calculated by the combination of empirical drainage equation with hooghoudt drainage equation see coupmodel manual drainage and deep percolation jansson 2012 the most relevant modelling processes to this study are described in the appendix with equations for calculating parameters selected in the calibration scheme shown in table a1 depicted in table a2 for more detailed information on the coupmodel structure we refer to the coupmodel manual jansson 2012 2 2 salt induced freezing point depression function implementation to solve the coupled water and heat flow equations eqs 1 2 which contain three unknown variables i e θ θ ice and t we need a relation between soil temperature and ice content in frozen soil when soil temperature is below zero latent heat changes due to ice formation when soil

with the calculated total water content we then obtain the liquid water content θ θ ice in coupmodel the freezing point depression is related to soil heat storage as below 6 r 1 e e f d 2 λ d 3 min e

a dynamical relationship between and osmotic potential was proposed eq 7 according to banin and anderson 1974 the relationship between freezing point and salt solution could be written as below 7 t 0

constant for converting osmotic potential unit from cm to mpa soil salt and soil heat and water transport as well as soil freezing thawing are connected by eq 8 with osmotic potential π therefore freezing point would change as soil temperature and soil salt concentration change during simulation since the osmotic potential is determined by both soil temperature and salt concentration 8 π z r t

conducted at two agricultural sites in northern china fig 2 one site is located at yonglian experimental station in hetao irrigation district of inner mongolia autonomous region china lat 41 2on lon 108 0oe hereafter referred as site i fig 2 the field experiment at site i was conducted during 2012 2013 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 winter periods from october 1st to april 30th during 2012 2014 annual total precipitation at this site was around 140 mm and annual mean air temperature was 6 4 c the soil profile is heterogeneous with a porosity of 0 42 0 46 and a bulk density of 1 44 1 53 g cm 3 the soil has a higher fraction of silt for the upper layers 0 80 cm and a higher fraction of sand for the lower layers 80 140 cm the groundwater table depth fluctuates between 1 5 and 3 m below the soil surface during winter during the end of october and the beginning of november of each year flooding irrigation also called autumn irrigation with 250 mm water was applied to the field for leaching salt that accumulated during the growing season the soil profile mean salt content mainly characterized as nacl is 0 1 g g 1 for the study site and the irrigation water electrical conductivity is 0 5 m s cm 1 before autumn irrigation a plot 2 2 m2 with crops harvested and stubbles fully removed was selected for experiments in the agricultural field and ploughed to a depth of 20 cm the other site is located in heidingzi irrigation district of changchun jilin province china lat 43 5on lon 125 6oe hereafter referred as site ii fig 2 the field experiments at site ii were conducted during 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 winter periods spanning from october 1st of previous year to april 30th of the next year during 2013 to 2016 the annual precipitation at site ii was 625 mm and annual mean air temperature is 4 8 c the soil profile at site ii is homogeneous with a porosity of 0 46 a bulk density of 1 42 g cm 3 and the soil texture is characterized as clay loam table 1 the groundwater table depth fluctuated between 1 5 and 2 0 m below the soil surface during winter the maximum frost depth at site ii is 1 2 m one plot 2 2 m2 fig 2 was selected in a paddy field which was cultivated with paddy rice from may to october before experiments started stubbles were fully removed from the plot and surface was ploughed to a depth of 20 cm 3 2 experimental design at site i during the experimental period 2012 10 01 2015 04 30 hourly soil temperatures at 5 15 25 and 35 cm depth were recorded by the pt100 temperature sensors from the micro meteorological station in the field total water content from 0 to 100 cm with 10 cm intervals at site i were sampled at various dates during the winter with around 20 d intervals an electric drill 5 cm in diameter 10 cm in length for the sampler was used for sampling frozen soils every 10 cm depth the total water content was determined by an oven drying method then total water storage from various depths 0 10 cm 0 40 cm 0 100 cm was estimated with total water content sampled within each depth summed up assuming uniform soil water content within each 10 cm soil sample since site i had high groundwater levels after irrigation which could affect soil water and salt transport groundwater table depth was measured every day during the autumn irrigation and drainage period two weeks after irrigation and every five days during the rest time of the winter groundwater table depth measurement was conducted manually by putting a roped copper cup into the observation well and then measuring the rope length when the cup touched water soil temperature and total soil water content at 4 depths 5 15 25 and 35 cm and groundwater table depth during 2012 2013 winter period were used to calibrate the model and the data from 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 winter periods were used to validate the model at site i the major ion in soil profile was cl which caused the salinization in the study site the irrigation water also contained a certain amount of salt electrical conductivity of 0 5 ms cm 1 which might alter soil profile salt storage we took frequent measurements every 20 days of cl from soil samples at every 10 cm depth by diluting 50 g air dry soil into 250 ml deionized water and then measuring the electrical potential mv of the solution with an electrical potential meter mp523 06 during the soil freezing thawing period at site ii soil water and temperature from the same depths as at site i were collected soil temperatures from 5 15 25 and 35 cm depth were recorded with automatic temperature recorder at hourly interval from a meteorological station 1 km from the site due to the malfunctioning of the temperature sensors during 2013 2014 winter only soil temperature data for 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 winter were collected to obtain total water content from 0 to 100 cm depth the soil samples with 10 cm interval were taken during 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 winter periods no total water content data were collected during 2015 2016 winter due to the reduced observations from the study site in that winter therefore we used soil temperature and water data soil temperature at 5 15 25 and 35 cm depth and soil water storage from 0 to 10 cm 0 40 cm and 0 100 cm depth from 2014 2015 to calibrate the model whereas used soil water storage from 2013 2014 winter and soil temperature from 2015 2016 winter to validate the model salts at site ii was not measured because the aim of study at this site was to detect the impacts of climate and soil differences on soil hydrological processes in winter we mainly used soil salt content from site i to investigate the model performance on salt storage simulation meteorological data e g air temperature humidity radiation wind speed and precipitation were obtained from the meteorological station installed at each site run by local water management unit with hourly resolution at site i and daily resolution at site ii 3 3 model sensitivity analysis and calibration the sensitivity analysis and model calibration procedures are summarized in fig 3 however the set up of calibration is based on the parameterization using the new approach to account for the salt impacts on freezing point depression we selected 58 parameters that were thought important to determine water and heat dynamics according to previous modelling studies cf gustafsson et al 2001 wu et al 2011 metzger et al 2015 etc the 58 parameters represented the major processes related to soil water heat energy balance as well as salt transport i e 19 related to soil water process 8 related to soil heat process 19 related to soil salt process and 12 related to energy balance process table a1 we noticed that 58 parameters would make the calibration very inefficient since some of the parameters were assigned to different layers and some were not so sensitive in comparison with others we thus conducted the calibration in two steps with the first step to find out the most important parameters from different model processes based on sensitivity analysis and the second step to calibrate only these most important parameters in the first step the 58 parameters were tested for each site based on the monte carlo stochastic sampling approach as shown on the left part of fig 3 the simulation at each site was run 70 000 times with randomly selected uniformly distributed values for the 58 parameters within their pre defined ranges generating 70 000 realizations assigned to 7 processors in the computer with each processor running 10 000 realizations this made the calibration more efficient and only took one week for a one year simulation the most important model parameters were then identified for each site based on their relative importance on performance metrics e g r 2 determination coefficient between simulation and observations and me the mean errors between simulation and observations this was done by using the lgm lindeman gold and merenda method lindeman et al 1980 that averages the sequential sums of squares over all orderings of regressors which calculates the relative importance of each parameter on model performance metrics and ranks them based on the ranking of parameters 8 to 11 sensitive parameters i e 3 common parameters for two sites another 8 for site i and another 5 for site ii were then selected in the second step with 10 000 simulations for each site it is important to note that the sensitive parameters may be different from site to site depending on site specific characteristics although initial parameters and their ranges were equivalent for both sites from the 10 000 simulations of the second calibration step step ii in fig 3 acceptable ensemble of parameter sets for each site was then selected based on the statistical performance metrics determination coefficient r 2 and mean error me for temperature and water at various depths table 2 in addition to useful information about site specific processes and their representations in the model the ensemble simulation results 16 for site i 9 for site ii derived from the accepted parameter sets were used for evaluation of water energy and salt balance over the simulation period 4 results 4 1 impacts of freezing point depression on soil freezing thawing as a preliminary analysis of the model sensitivity with the new module the relationships reconstructed from the simulated hourly soil temperature and soil heat storage at site i with a single model run at 5 cm depth which denote the soil freezing characteristics in coupmodel are compared when various sc values are assigned fig 4 generally the soil temperature and soil heat storage show gradual changes when soil is freezing with soil temperature between freezing point t0 and tf 5 c at both sites when the soil is totally unfrozen soil temperature higher than t0 or totally frozen soil temperature is lower than 5 c there is not ice water phase change happening a nearly linear relationship between soil temperature and soil heat storage is obtained however noises are detected with the reconstructed relationships at both sites using hourly simulated data mainly due to the varied soil thermal and hydraulic properties as well as the daily scale freezing thawing sub cycle during soil status evolution in the winter wu et al 2016b nonetheless with the different sc values assigned representing different freezing point we clearly identified the differences in the relationships at site i me decreases from 2 54 c when sc is 0 higher freezing point see eq 7 to 2 14 c improved by 16 when sc is 1 lower freezing point see eq 7 similarly me reduces from 1 35 c to 0 64 c improved by 53 when sc changes from 0 to 1 at site ii this demonstrates that at both sites the freezing points are below zero due to the impacts of salts we further compared the time series soil temperature from site i before and after model development with a single simulation based on model default parameter setting during the whole period and a selected freezing period respectively figs a1 a2 the results also indicated that by adding the impacts of salt on soil freezing the newly developed model can represent soil temperature during freezing period much better than the original one meanwhile model performances in calibrating multi layer soil temperature before and after considering salt impacts are compared fig a3 the cumulative distribution of nse r 2 for soil temperature was obtained through re running the model at each site with 200 parameter values for each of the accepted parameters by randomly selecting their values within their accepted ranges derived from the step ii of model calibration this was done for the original module which assumed a freezing point of 0 c and for the new module which assumed a dynamical freezing point eq 7 respectively model performance is significantly improved for multiple soil depths at both sites when the detailed description in salt impacts on soil freezing thawing is considered indicating the new approach could reduce model structure uncertainty and improve model performance in simulating soil temperature 4 2 relative importance of parameters for various processes at site i the windless exchange coefficient r a m a x 1 is shown to be the most important parameter to soil temperature r 2 at 4 depths fig 5 a d the other important parameters

damping coefficient of frozen soil thermal conductivity ψ a air entry for soil total water content and groundwater table depth r 2 the important parameters from different groups are also important to

and r 2 fig 5 j m for soil total water content and groundwater table depth me fig 5 n r the most important parameters are s def soil surface maximum water deficit d 1 as well as ψ a from different soil depths at site ii the most important parameter contributing to the improvement of soil temperature r 2 at 4 depths fig a4 a d is z om s n o w momentum roughness length of snow which is used to estimate surface aerodynamic resistance the secondary important parameter related to soil temperature r 2 at 15 25 and 35 cm depths is c md used to adjust thermal conductivity of surface frozen layer

and water transport for soil temperature me at site ii fig a4 i l important parameters are similar to soil temperature r 2 except at 5 cm depth with s k showing the greatest importance fig a4 i which is used to estimate snow thermal conductivity and determine energy balance in snowpack at site ii important parameters for soil liquid water content me are similar to r 2 with parameters related to surface energy balance r a m a x 1 soil freezing characteristics d 1 and soil water characteristics ψ a having great importance to soil water transport 4 3 model calibration and validation performance at two sites 4 3 1 soil temperature since we noticed different sensitivities of parameters to r 2 and me the model performance indicator nse r 2 is used here to indicate the overall model performance if the model predicts the measurements perfectly we have nse r 2 1 in table 3 the accepted range ratio defined as the ratio of accepted parameter range to the prior parameter range for model performance for multi variable is depicted at site i the model performance is also well constrained to the best 30 of all the simulations soil temperature and total water content model performances are constrained to the best 5 which are higher than at site ii for groundwater table depth the best 23 of the simulations is obtained showing good constraint on this variable at site ii the accepted ratios for nse r 2 with respect to all the variables of interest are well constrained to the best 50 using the selected criteria the model performance nse r 2 for soil temperature at 4 selected layers is better constrained than total water content at respective layer at site i the accepted ensemble simulations generally can capture soil temperature dynamics and cover the observations within their ranges during both calibration and validation periods fig 6 a b after calibration the mean value of r 2 for soil temperature at 5 cm and 15 cm depth is over 0 87 for three winter periods at site ii mean r 2 of over 0 90 is achieved for the accepted simulations at 5 cm and 15 cm depth during two winter periods however soil temperature is underestimated from the end of november to middle of january fig 6 c d 4 3 2 soil water and salt storage comparison of simulated water storage with measured water storage at different soil depths is depicted in fig 7 at site i soil water storage is generally underestimated by the model for three winters mainly for the 0 100 cm soil depth fig 7 a model performs equally well at site i in the calibration and validation periods and larger deviations in the measured soil water storage than the modeled one are detected by the larger error bars at site ii model performs better in the calibration period 2014 2015 winter period than in the validation period 2013 2014 winter with the underestimations of soil water storage at various soil depths by the model fig 8 shows the comparison between the simulated and measured salt storage at various soil layers from site i the simulated cl storage at various layers is larger than measured cl storage the major differences between simulated and measured soil salt storage are found at 40 100 cm depth the simulated 0 100 cm soil salt storage is much larger than the measured salt storage whereas the differences are smaller at 0 10 cm and 0 40 cm depths 5 discussion 5 1 salt impacts on soil freezing thawing in modeling of transport processes in saline frozen soil the influence of salt on freezing point is a major source of uncertainty wu et al 2015 in the old version of coupmodel the formulation of freezing point depression only takes soil types into consideration while the salt has shown to be a more important factor in freezing point depression banin and anderson 1974 wu et al 2015 many models used the freezing point of soil as 0 c wu et al 2016b however this should not apply in most agricultural soils where minerals are commonly found stähli and stadler 1997 as depicted in section 4 1 the improvement in the modeled soil temperature with newly developed freezing point depression estimate approach indicates a proper estimate of soil freezing point would result in a better simulation on soil heat transport this confirmed the outlook by stähli and stadler 1997 who expected a better simulation with consideration of salt impacts on freezing point depression wu et al 2015 compared the soil freezing characteristic curves under various salt types and salt contents in laboratory they found the significant influences of both salt type and salt content on freezing point of soil as such the parameter sc is introduced in eq 7 and used in the calibration as a sensitive parameter this indicates that in calculation of the freezing point not only the salt content but also the salt type should be taken into consideration in this study we have implemented a dynamical approach in calculating freezing point of saline soils and improved the model performance we recommend this approach in frozen soil modeling since it considers the dynamics of soil water and salt during soil freezing thawing by relating freezing point to osmotic potential this dynamical relationship has considered soil freezing thawing conditions for all the layers at each computation iteration and would give a more precise calculation on the overall soil water and heat balance notwithstanding we only tested the overall model performance with field data due to technical problems in setting up laboratory soil column freezing experiments for simultaneous measurements of water temperature and salt dynamics under controlled environment this might introduce some uncertainties resulting from soil texture heterogeneity multiple salt types as well as varied boundary conditions e g snow cover groundwater recharge to the simulation results wu et al 2016b it is therefore necessary to conduct a series of well controlled experiments in laboratory to collect more precise data for model calibration and validation 5 2 sensitive parameters at two sites in table 4 the important parameters and their posterior ranges at two sites are depicted at both sites parameters related to energy balance r a m a x 1 and soil heat d 1 c md show obvious reductions in posterior ranges as mentioned in section 4 2 c md d 1 and r a m a x 1 are important parameters at both sites they control soil heat and energy balance and can influence soil freezing thawing thus the improvement of model performance will rely on better simulation of soil heat and energy balance in frozen soil besides we noticed some parameters that only show great importance at site ii for example parameters z 0 m s n o w and a scale at site ii has the rratio value of 0 54 and 0 68 respectively these two parameters control snow surface energy balance and soil infiltration respectively at site ii snow covered the soil surface for certain period of the experimental winter while nearly no snow was kept for longer than one week at site i snow covered on the soil surface at site ii would make the calculation of energy balance more complicated flerchinger and saxton 1989 moreover the snowmelt would infiltrate into deeper soil layer during the thawing period which may also affect soil water balance espeby 1992 mohammed et al 2018 watanabe and kugisaki 2017 therefore snow properties are critical for soil temperature and moisture simulations and snow depth should be included in our future measurement campaign salt adsorption coefficient s adc at four depths at site i show great importance with rratio from 0 74 to 0 93 mainly due to more severe salinity problems and more heterogeneous soil salt profiles at site i than at site ii the rratio of ψ a from four depths at site i vary from 0 36 to 0 81 while at site ii the rratio of ψ a from four depths vary from 0 18 to 0 50 the large differences in posterior ranges of these parameters indicate the model are sensitive to different processes at two sites site ii is more humid in winter and has more snow events while site i has very dry winter but more salt influences on freezing thawing due to higher salinity at this site therefore we should take the different characteristics at two sites into account in calibration generally a two step calibration procedure fig 3 introduced in this study is an efficient approach in identifying sensitive parameters in the model and quantifying their relative importance with respect to saline frozen soils under different climate and soil conditions nevertheless the transferring of parameter and their values from one site to another should be cautious because each site is unique in modeling and should be calibrated separately beven and freer 2001 wu et al 2019 5 3 uncertainties in simulated water heat and salt at two sites at site i drainage ditches were detected to maintain high water level during the experimental winters due to poor drainage system when the soil was thawing during spring lateral exchange would occur and impact soil profile water balance which is not considered in the model this is also indicated by the important parameters air entry values from different soil layers table 4 at site i air entry values in lower layer are shown very sensitive this indicated these parameters might be over tuned due to poor representation of lateral water exchange we thus recommend that in modeling frozen soils the proper representation of water flow in the whole soil profile and detailed consideration on boundary conditions are necessary at site ii the major impacts on soil water balance come from snowmelt this site had several snowfall events during the experimental period snowmelt runoff can have a great impact on soil profile water balance stähli et al 1996 in coupmodel even though a detailed two domain module was introduced to represent infiltration into frozen soils the water and energy balance for snow cover and infiltration remained uncertain at site ii as can be seen from the parameters z 0 m s n o w and a scale soil matric water adsorption coefficient which show high sensitivity in model calibration table 4 we noticed that the capillary model for two domain flows stähli et al 1996 was initially developed for sand soil at site ii the soil is clay loam with more clay content due to high porosity of clay soil the infiltration in unfrozen frozen conditions are expected to be more complicated than in sand therefore in the next step more attention should be put on understanding water and energy balance in the process of infiltration into clay soils during soil freezing and thawing moreover since the calibration was focusing on the surface water and energy balance and the upper layer water process is already shown to be well represented by the model the more detailed consideration of lower layer water processes exceeds the scope of this study nevertheless from the comparison of soil water storages at two sites we noticed that the large discrepancies mainly occur at the soil layers below the 40 cm depth this indicates that there might be some unforeseen processes in the lower soil layer e g lateral water exchange and they would influence the water transport processes in whole soil profile from surface to groundwater in the calibration results shown in fig 3 only outputs for soil heat e g soil temperature and soil water e g soil water liquid water groundwater processes at upper soil layers 0 40 cm were constrained with certain criteria this might cause the overestimation of cl storage between 40 and 100 cm soil depth additionally due to the assumption of only considering convection for salt transport in soil the simulated salt dynamics is tightly related to water dynamics it is known that during soil freezing period the upward of water and salt is the major process the over estimation of cl storage at various depths indicates that the upward movement of cl with water is over estimated even if an adsorption coefficient was assigned for each layer eq 3 this might be due to a neglect of diffusion and repulsion of solute in the model studies by cary and mayland 1972 have shown that the diffusion and expulsion processes in frozen soil actually play important roles in solute transport even though the convection is the major process the salt diffusion could happen in freezing soils when the soil solution is condensed due to decrease in liquid water content which would increase the salt concentration gradient between partly frozen layer and unfrozen layer moreover high salt concentration at low temperature would cause salt expulsion from solution due to the decrease in salt saturation with temperature however it is difficult to obtain the diffusion and expulsion of salt in frozen soil more detailed experiments on diffusion and expulsion of salt would be of high interest in study of water heat and salt coupled transport in frozen soils 6 conclusions in this study a salt induced freezing point depression function was implemented in coupmodel to simulate soil water temperature and salt transport for two seasonally frozen soils from two typical mid to high latitude agricultural regions of northern china uncertainties in the simulation results were well constrained using field data combined with the monte carlo ensemble based calibration method from this study we can conclude that 1 salts in soils impact freezing thawing the salt influences on soil freezing point depression are not negligible in mid to high latitudes while with the newly developed freezing point depression function the model can represent soil temperature much better 2 uncertainties in the simulating of water heat processes in frozen soils were well constrained with the systematic calibration approach proposed in this study the model performance in simulating soil water and temperature from two study sites was significantly improved during both calibration and validation periods 3 meanwhile salt storage was overestimated by the model because of the neglection of salt diffusion and expulsion in saline frozen soils the uncertainties in the simulated soil water temperature and salt transport from two sites were found mainly result from parameters that determine water and energy balance e g snow water infiltration surface albedo and from the lack of more detailed salt transport generally the study has demonstrated that with the newly developed module in the coupmodel to account for the impacts of salt on soil freezing point depression we significantly improved model performance and reduced modeling uncertainty under a well designed calibration scheme given the complexity of saline frozen soils detailed experiments on snowpack water and energy balance soil water and salt dynamics as well as model development on water energy balance e g snowmelt infiltration ice coverage are needed to improve the understanding about the influences of salinization on soil hydrology in mid to

4753,soil freezing thawing is an important mechanism to control soil water and heat redistribution in mid to high latitudes salt in the agricultural soil from mid to high latitudes can alter characteristics of soil freezing thawing cycle and then affect soil thermal and hydrological processes in winter and finally cause salinization in spring to quantify the impacts of soil salinization on soil water and heat transport in saline soils we conducted field experiments on soil water and heat dynamics in two typical agricultural regions of northern china with different climate and soil conditions the coupled soil heat and water model coupmodel has been extended to account for the dynamic impacts of salt on freezing point depression the newly added module improved the representation of soil freezing point depression by significantly improving model performance between simulated and measured soil temperatures especially around freezing point with mean error me for the soil temperature at various depths reduced by 16 to 77 for the entire winter period with a systematic model calibration approach processes related to energy balance and soil freezing thawing have been well constrained for both study sites with different characteristics for soil hydrology and energy balance the model generally showed good performance with respect to soil moisture and temperature for both the calibration and validation periods our study has demonstrated a new modeling approach to successfully account for the impacts of salt on soil freezing thawing and the new module can be a useful tool to address the salinization problems in mid to high latitudes with respect to climate change and water management keywords saline soil freezing point depression seasonal frost sensitivity analysis soil hydrology 1 introduction soil freezing and thawing processes have long been recognized for their importance in not only engineering applications e g construction of roads and pipelines hansson et al 2004 wettlaufer and worster 2006 but also environmental issues e g soil erosion flooding and pollutants migration baker and spaans 1997 mccauley et al 2002 particularly knowledge on soil freezing and thawing is crucial in the aspects of water and salt distribution in the soil baker and osterkamp 1989 frost heaving wettlaufer and worster 2006 as well as climate change and water management in cold regions lopez et al 2007 laboratory and field experiments have been conducted to investigate hydrological characteristics of soil freezing thawing in cold regions but most of them only focused on the soil freezing characteristics under various climate and soil conditions black and tice 1989 spaans and baker 1996 azmatch et al 2012 yu et al 2018 mwangi et al 2020 and regional water and energy balance in winter hayashi et al 2004 watanabe et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 some other studies have demonstrated the importance of accounting for salt impacts on water and energy transfer in frozen soils cary et al 1979 found salt can decrease frost heaving and increase infiltration in frozen soils based on observations konrad and mccammon 1990 found the expulsion of salt from ice is dependent on the freezing rate of soil wang et al 2016 compared water and salt fluxes in the same regions as our study and detected the different flow characteristics of salt during soil freezing and thawing seasons they demonstrated that the effects of salt expulsion and dispersion were not negligible in frozen soils wu et al 2016a found that evaporation during winter was controlled by soil salt and groundwater from the field frost tube experiments in inner mongolia china the measurements have indicated that water heat and salt transport in frozen soils are fully coupled despite large uncertainties exist in measurements due to the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties and technical difficulties hydrological models for instance the hspf bicknell et al 1997 sutra voss 2003 mike she graham and butts 2005 stemmus ft yu et al 2018 and hydrogeosphere schilling et al 2019 were often applied to the entire agricultural fields or watersheds for simulating hydrological processes and they have taken soil freezing and thawing into accounts however as these models were developed to represent water flows for the entire regions they used less rigorous mathematical implementations to simulate soil freezing thawing processes and few of them have accounted for the influences of salts on soil freezing thawing flerchinger and saxton 1989 one dimensional modeling approach was more common in cold regions vertical water and heat transport studies since more detailed processes were considered in frozen soils and parameters were much easier to control given enough observational data in this study we have chosen a process based model coupmodel as our modelling tool coupmodel is a process oriented model that explicitly simulates the coupled transfer of water heat and elements e g carbon nutrients and salts in a vertical atmosphere plant soil continuum jansson and karlberg 2004 this model is flexible to set up the simulation time step and the thickness of soil layers which should be consistent to what experimental data is based on moreover coupmodel is capable of conducting uncertainty analysis in the simulation of soil freezing and thawing due to the complexity of water ice phase change and the coupled thermal and hydrological transport processes to quantify or reduce the uncertainties in modeling a monte carlo ensemble based simulation method has been implemented into coupmodel by combining the experimental data with numerical models and using multiple model performance indices to constrain various model processes this method together with coupmodel has been applied to forests gustafsson et al 2004 wu et al 2013 agricultural fields wu et al 2011 2016b permafrost zhang et al 2012 scherler et al 2013 and other cold region ecosystems okkonen and kløve 2011 khoshkhoo et al 2015 rasmussen et al 2018 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 in this study we performed experiments on water and heat transport at two seasonal frost sites with different characteristics in climate and in soil conditions both sites are located in important agricultural regions of northern china the hetao irrigation district in china is a typical arid agricultural region suffering from soil salinization due to the saline water irrigation extensive evaporation as well as soil freezing thawing li et al 2012 the heidingzi river irrigation district is a typical paddy rice region in the northeastern part of china suffering from salinization due to over development of the salinized field into the agricultural field liu et al 2001 soils in both regions undergo seasonal freezing thawing under shallow groundwater in winter which always results in salinization in spring this salinization in spring will influence the sowing and reduce productivity during the growing season moreover both sites are crucial in water resources management in mid to high latitudes under the concept of water saving agriculture therefore it is important to study the water heat and salt transport processes in winter for better water management in these two regions some recent efforts have been taken to unveil the driving force of agricultural salinization in mid to high latitudes wu et al 2016b performed the calibration on soil water and heat transport based on one plot in the experimental field in hetao irrigation district located in inner mongolia and found that the influences of salt on soil freezing should be taken into account wang et al 2016 conducted field experiments and analyzed the water and solutes transport characteristics at both sites and demonstrated that salt transport in frozen soils is more complicated than in unfrozen soils due to the impacts of diffusion and salt expulsion previous studies have shown that model data is an efficient way of understanding complex processes in cold regions via the proper quantification of uncertainties both in the measurements and modeling wu et al 2011 2016b 2019 mwangi et al 2020 therefore a comprehensive understanding on the salt impacts on freezing thawing soils is meaningful with the coupmodel combined with field experiments in this work we first developed a new module in coupmodel to account for the impacts of salt on soil freezing thawing in the second step we calibrated the new model using measurements collected from two study sites to simulate soil moisture and temperatures in two seasonal frost agricultural soils lastly based on the improved modeling results we disentangled the impacts of salt on the coupled water and heat transport in seasonally frozen soils and revealed their implications for regional hydrological modeling in mid to high latitudes 2 coupmodel the model domain covers the top 6 m of the soil with water and energy balance considered in a unit area fig 1 the soil profile for each study site was discretized into 16 layers with a thickness of 10 cm for layers from surface to 40 cm a thickness of 20 cm for layers from 40 cm to 2 m and a thickness of 1 m for layers from 2 m to 6 m the model used hourly meteorological data as model input 2 1 water heat and salt transport processes in a seasonally

combination of empirical drainage equation with hooghoudt drainage equation see coupmodel manual drainage and deep percolation jansson 2012 the most relevant modelling processes to this study are described in the appendix with equations for calculating parameters selected in the calibration scheme shown in table a1 depicted in table a2 for more detailed information on the coupmodel structure we refer to the coupmodel manual jansson 2012 2 2 salt induced freezing point depression function implementation to solve the coupled water and heat flow equations eqs 1 2 which contain three unknown

a dynamical relationship between and osmotic potential was proposed eq 7 according to banin and anderson 1974 the relationship between freezing point and salt solution could be written as below 7 t 0

constant for converting osmotic potential unit from cm to mpa soil salt and soil heat and water transport as well as soil freezing thawing are connected by eq 8 with osmotic potential π therefore freezing point would change as soil temperature and soil salt concentration change during simulation since the osmotic potential is determined by both soil temperature and salt concentration 8 π z r t

air temperature is 4 8 c the soil profile at site ii is homogeneous with a porosity of 0 46 a bulk density of 1 42 g cm 3 and the soil texture is characterized as clay loam table 1 the groundwater table depth fluctuated between 1 5 and 2 0 m below the soil surface during winter the maximum frost depth at site ii is 1 2 m one plot 2 2 m2 fig 2 was selected in a paddy field which was cultivated with paddy rice from may to october before experiments started stubbles were fully removed from the plot and surface was ploughed to a depth of 20 cm 3 2 experimental design at site i during the experimental period 2012 10 01 2015 04 30 hourly soil temperatures at 5 15 25 and 35 cm depth were recorded by the pt100 temperature sensors from the micro meteorological station in the field total water content from 0 to 100 cm with 10 cm intervals at site i were sampled at various dates during the winter with around 20 d intervals an electric drill 5 cm in diameter 10 cm in length for the sampler was used for sampling frozen soils every 10 cm depth the total water content was determined by an oven drying method then total water storage from various depths 0 10 cm 0 40 cm 0 100 cm was estimated with total water content sampled within each depth summed up assuming uniform soil water content within each 10 cm soil sample since site i had high groundwater levels after irrigation which could affect soil water and salt transport groundwater table depth was measured every day during the autumn irrigation and drainage period two weeks after irrigation and every five days during the rest time of the winter groundwater table depth measurement was conducted manually by putting a roped copper cup into the observation well and then measuring the rope length when the cup touched water soil temperature and total soil water content at 4 depths 5 15 25 and 35 cm and groundwater table depth during 2012 2013 winter period were used to calibrate the model and the data from 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 winter periods were used to validate the model at site i the major ion in soil profile was cl which caused the salinization in the study site the irrigation water also contained a certain amount of salt electrical conductivity of 0 5 ms cm 1 which might alter soil profile salt storage we took frequent measurements every 20 days of cl from soil samples at every 10 cm depth by diluting 50 g air dry soil into 250 ml deionized water and then measuring the electrical potential mv of the solution with an electrical potential meter mp523 06 during the soil freezing thawing period at site ii soil water and temperature from the same depths as at site i were collected soil temperatures from 5 15 25 and 35 cm depth were recorded with automatic temperature recorder at hourly interval from a meteorological station 1 km from the site due to the malfunctioning of the temperature sensors during 2013 2014 winter only soil temperature data for 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 winter were collected to obtain total water content from 0 to 100 cm depth the soil samples with 10 cm interval were taken during 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 winter periods no total water content data were collected during 2015 2016 winter due to the reduced observations from the study site in that winter therefore we used soil temperature and water data soil temperature at 5 15 25 and 35 cm depth and soil water storage from 0 to 10 cm 0 40 cm and 0 100 cm depth from 2014 2015 to calibrate the model whereas used soil water storage from 2013 2014 winter and soil temperature from 2015 2016 winter to validate the model salts at site ii was not measured because the aim of study at this site was to detect the impacts of climate and soil differences on soil hydrological processes in winter we mainly used soil salt content from site i to investigate the model performance on salt storage simulation meteorological data e g air temperature humidity radiation wind speed and precipitation were obtained from the meteorological station installed at each site run by local water management unit with hourly resolution at site i and daily resolution at site ii 3 3 model sensitivity analysis and calibration the sensitivity analysis and model calibration procedures are summarized in fig 3 however the set up of calibration is based on the parameterization using the new approach to account for the salt impacts on freezing point depression we selected 58 parameters that were thought important to determine water and heat dynamics according to previous modelling studies cf gustafsson et al 2001 wu et al 2011 metzger et al 2015 etc the 58 parameters represented the major processes related to soil water heat energy balance as well as salt transport i e 19 related to soil water process 8 related to soil heat process 19 related to soil salt process and 12 related to energy balance process table a1 we noticed that 58 parameters would make the calibration very inefficient since some of the parameters were assigned to different layers and some were not so sensitive in comparison with others we thus conducted the calibration in two steps with the first step to find out the most important parameters from different model processes based on sensitivity analysis and the second step to calibrate only these most important parameters in the first step the 58 parameters were tested for each site based on the monte carlo stochastic sampling approach as shown on the left part of fig 3 the simulation at each site was run 70 000 times with randomly selected uniformly distributed values for the 58 parameters within their pre defined ranges generating 70 000 realizations assigned to 7 processors in the computer with each processor running 10 000 realizations this made the calibration more efficient and only took one week for a one year simulation the most important model parameters were then identified for each site based on their relative importance on performance metrics e g r 2 determination coefficient between simulation and observations and me the mean errors between simulation and observations this was done by using the lgm lindeman gold and merenda method lindeman et al 1980 that averages the sequential sums of squares over all orderings of regressors which calculates the relative importance of each parameter on model performance metrics and ranks them based on the ranking of parameters 8 to 11 sensitive parameters i e 3 common parameters for two sites another 8 for site i and another 5 for site ii were then selected in the second step with 10 000 simulations for each site it is important to note that the sensitive parameters may be different from site to site depending on site specific characteristics although initial parameters and their ranges were equivalent for both sites from the 10 000 simulations of the second calibration step step ii in fig 3 acceptable ensemble of parameter sets for each site was then selected based on the statistical performance metrics determination coefficient r 2 and mean error me for temperature and water at various depths table 2 in addition to useful information about site specific processes and their representations in the model the ensemble simulation results 16 for site i 9 for site ii derived from the accepted parameter sets were used for evaluation of water energy and salt balance over the simulation period 4 results 4 1 impacts of freezing point depression on soil freezing thawing as a preliminary analysis of the model sensitivity with the new module the relationships reconstructed from the simulated hourly soil temperature and soil heat storage at site i with a single model run at 5 cm depth which denote the soil freezing characteristics in coupmodel are compared when various sc values are assigned fig 4 generally the soil temperature and soil heat storage show gradual changes when soil is freezing with soil temperature between freezing point t0 and tf 5 c at both sites when the soil is totally unfrozen soil temperature higher than t0 or totally frozen soil temperature is lower than 5 c there is not ice water phase change happening a nearly linear relationship between soil temperature and soil heat storage is obtained however noises are detected with the reconstructed relationships at both sites using hourly simulated data mainly due to the varied soil thermal and hydraulic properties as well as the daily scale freezing thawing sub cycle during soil status evolution in the winter wu et al 2016b nonetheless with the different sc values assigned representing different freezing point we clearly identified the differences in the relationships at site i me decreases from 2 54 c when sc is 0 higher freezing point see eq 7 to 2 14 c improved by 16 when sc is 1 lower freezing point see eq 7 similarly me reduces from 1 35 c to 0 64 c improved by 53 when sc changes from 0 to 1 at site ii this demonstrates that at both sites the freezing points are below zero due to the impacts of salts we further compared the time series soil temperature from site i before and after model development with a single simulation based on model default parameter setting during the whole period and a selected freezing period respectively figs a1 a2 the results also indicated that by adding the impacts of salt on soil freezing the newly developed model can represent soil temperature during freezing period much better than the original one meanwhile model performances in calibrating multi layer soil temperature before and after considering salt impacts are compared fig a3 the cumulative distribution of nse r 2 for soil temperature was obtained through re running the model at each site with 200 parameter values for each of the accepted parameters by randomly selecting their values within their accepted ranges derived from the step ii of model calibration this was done for the original module which assumed a freezing point of 0 c and for the new module which assumed a dynamical freezing point eq 7 respectively model performance is significantly improved for multiple soil depths at both sites when the detailed description in salt impacts on soil freezing thawing is considered indicating the new approach could reduce model structure uncertainty and improve model performance in simulating soil temperature 4 2 relative importance of parameters for various processes at site i the windless exchange coefficient r a m a x 1 is shown to be the most important parameter to soil temperature r 2 at 4 depths fig 5 a d the other important parameters are related to soil frost and soil water characteristics e g α thermal conductivity estimate coefficient d 1 coefficient for determining liquid water content when soil is frozen at 5 c c md maximum damping coefficient of frozen soil thermal conductivity ψ a air entry for soil total water content and groundwater table depth r 2 the important parameters from different groups are also important to soil temperature r 2 we can see that except for ψ a at various depths the most important parameters are related to energy balance and soil heat transport in frozen soils e g k b 1 ratio of momentum and heat roughness length r a m a x 1 d 1 c md α h heat transfer coefficient for re freezing of water in high flow domain fig 5 e i for soil temperature the important parameters are the same for me and r 2 fig 5 j m for soil total water content and groundwater table depth me fig 5 n r the most important parameters are s def soil surface maximum water deficit d 1 as well as ψ a from different soil depths at site ii the most important parameter contributing to the improvement of soil temperature r 2 at 4 depths fig a4 a d is z om s n o w momentum roughness length of snow which is used to estimate surface aerodynamic resistance the secondary important parameter related to soil temperature r 2 at 15 25 and 35 cm depths is c md used to adjust thermal conductivity of surface frozen layer for liquid water content r 2 at four depths fig a4 e h the relatively important parameters are z 0 m s n o w r a m a x 1 d 1 and ψ a of different depths that are related to energy balance soil heat and water transport for soil temperature me at site ii fig a4 i l important parameters are similar to soil temperature r 2 except at 5 cm depth with s k showing the greatest importance fig a4 i which is used to estimate snow thermal conductivity and determine energy balance in snowpack at site ii important parameters for soil liquid water content me are similar to r 2 with parameters related to surface energy balance r a m a x 1 soil freezing characteristics d 1 and soil water characteristics ψ a having great importance to soil water transport 4 3 model calibration and validation performance at two sites 4 3 1 soil temperature since we noticed different sensitivities of parameters to r 2 and me the model performance indicator nse r 2 is used here to indicate the overall model performance if the model predicts the measurements perfectly we have nse r 2 1 in table 3 the accepted range ratio defined as the ratio of accepted parameter range to the prior parameter range for model performance for multi variable is depicted at site i the model performance is also well constrained to the best 30 of all the simulations soil temperature and total water content model performances are constrained to the best 5 which are higher than at site ii for groundwater table depth the best 23 of the simulations is obtained showing good constraint on this variable at site ii the accepted ratios for nse r 2 with respect to all the variables of interest are well constrained to the best 50 using the selected criteria the model performance nse r 2 for soil temperature at 4 selected layers is better constrained than total water content at respective layer at site i the accepted ensemble simulations generally can capture soil temperature dynamics and cover the observations within their ranges during both calibration and validation periods fig 6 a b after calibration the mean value of r 2 for soil temperature at 5 cm and 15 cm depth is over 0 87 for three winter periods at site ii mean r 2 of over 0 90 is achieved for the accepted simulations at 5 cm and 15 cm depth during two winter periods however soil temperature is underestimated from the end of november to middle of january fig 6 c d 4 3 2 soil water and salt storage comparison of simulated water storage with measured water storage at different soil depths is depicted in fig 7 at site i soil water storage is generally underestimated by the model for three winters mainly for the 0 100 cm soil depth fig 7 a model performs equally well at site i in the calibration and validation periods and larger deviations in the measured soil water storage than the modeled one are detected by the larger error bars at site ii model performs better in the calibration period 2014 2015 winter period than in the validation period 2013 2014 winter with the underestimations of soil water storage at various soil depths by the model fig 8 shows the comparison between the simulated and measured salt storage at various soil layers from site i the simulated cl storage at various layers is larger than measured cl storage the major differences between simulated and measured soil salt storage are found at 40 100 cm depth the simulated 0 100 cm soil salt storage is much larger than the measured salt storage whereas the differences are smaller at 0 10 cm and 0 40 cm depths 5 discussion 5 1 salt impacts on soil freezing thawing in modeling of transport processes in saline frozen soil the influence of salt on freezing point is a major source of uncertainty wu et al 2015 in the old version of coupmodel the formulation of freezing point depression only takes soil types into consideration while the salt has shown to be a more important factor in freezing point depression banin and anderson 1974 wu et al 2015 many models used the freezing point of soil as 0 c wu et al 2016b however this should not apply in most agricultural soils where minerals are commonly found stähli and stadler 1997 as depicted in section 4 1 the improvement in the modeled soil temperature with newly developed freezing point depression estimate approach indicates a proper estimate of soil freezing point would result in a better simulation on soil heat transport this confirmed the outlook by stähli and stadler 1997 who expected a better simulation with consideration of salt impacts on freezing point depression wu et al 2015 compared the soil freezing characteristic curves under various salt types and salt contents in laboratory they found the significant influences of both salt type and salt content on freezing point of soil as such the parameter sc is introduced in eq 7 and used in the calibration as a sensitive parameter this indicates that in calculation of the freezing point not only the salt content but also the salt type should be taken into consideration in this study we have implemented a dynamical approach in calculating freezing point of saline soils and improved the model performance we recommend this approach in frozen soil modeling since it considers the dynamics of soil water and salt during soil freezing thawing by relating freezing point to osmotic potential this dynamical relationship has considered soil freezing thawing conditions for all the layers at each computation iteration and would give a more precise calculation on the overall soil water and heat balance notwithstanding we only tested the overall model performance with field data due to technical problems in setting up laboratory soil column freezing experiments for simultaneous measurements of water temperature and salt dynamics under controlled environment this might introduce some uncertainties resulting from soil texture heterogeneity multiple salt types as well as varied boundary conditions e g snow cover groundwater recharge to the simulation results wu et al 2016b it is therefore necessary to conduct a series of well controlled experiments in laboratory to collect more precise data for model calibration and validation 5 2 sensitive parameters at two sites in table 4 the important parameters and their posterior ranges at two sites are depicted at both sites parameters related to energy balance r a m a x 1 and soil heat d 1 c md show obvious reductions in posterior ranges as mentioned in section 4 2 c md d 1 and r a m a x 1 are important parameters at both sites they control soil heat and energy balance and can influence soil freezing thawing thus the improvement of model performance will rely on better simulation of soil heat and energy balance in frozen soil besides we noticed some parameters that only show great importance at site ii for example parameters z 0 m s n o w and a scale at site ii has the rratio value of 0 54 and 0 68 respectively these two parameters control snow surface energy balance and soil infiltration respectively at site ii snow covered the soil surface for certain period of the experimental winter while nearly no snow was kept for longer than one week at site i snow covered on the soil surface at site ii would make the calculation of energy balance more complicated flerchinger and saxton 1989 moreover the snowmelt would infiltrate into deeper soil layer during the thawing period which may also affect soil water balance espeby 1992 mohammed et al 2018 watanabe and kugisaki 2017 therefore snow properties are critical for soil temperature and moisture simulations and snow depth should be included in our future measurement campaign salt adsorption coefficient s adc at four depths at site i show great importance with rratio from 0 74 to 0 93 mainly due to more severe salinity problems and more heterogeneous soil salt profiles at site i than at site ii the rratio of ψ a from four depths at site i vary from 0 36 to 0 81 while at site ii the rratio of ψ a from four depths vary from 0 18 to 0 50 the large differences in posterior ranges of these parameters indicate the model are sensitive to different processes at two sites site ii is more humid in winter and has more snow events while site i has very dry winter but more salt influences on freezing thawing due to higher salinity at this site therefore we should take the different characteristics at two sites into account in calibration generally a two step calibration procedure fig 3 introduced in this study is an efficient approach in identifying sensitive parameters in the model and quantifying their relative importance with respect to saline frozen soils under different climate and soil conditions nevertheless the transferring of parameter and their values from one site to another should be cautious because each site is unique in modeling and should be calibrated separately beven and freer 2001 wu et al 2019 5 3 uncertainties in simulated water heat and salt at two sites at site i drainage ditches were detected to maintain high water level during the experimental winters due to poor drainage system when the soil was thawing during spring lateral exchange would occur and impact soil profile water balance which is not considered in the model this is also indicated by the important parameters air entry values from different soil layers table 4 at site i air entry values in lower layer are shown very sensitive this indicated these parameters might be over tuned due to poor representation of lateral water exchange we thus recommend that in modeling frozen soils the proper representation of water flow in the whole soil profile and detailed consideration on boundary conditions are necessary at site ii the major impacts on soil water balance come from snowmelt this site had several snowfall events during the experimental period snowmelt runoff can have a great impact on soil profile water balance stähli et al 1996 in coupmodel even though a detailed two domain module was introduced to represent infiltration into frozen soils the water and energy balance for snow cover and infiltration remained uncertain at site ii as can be seen from the parameters z 0 m s n o w and a scale soil matric water adsorption coefficient which show high sensitivity in model calibration table 4 we noticed that the capillary model for two domain flows stähli et al 1996 was initially developed for sand soil at site ii the soil is clay loam with more clay content due to high porosity of clay soil the infiltration in unfrozen frozen conditions are expected to be more complicated than in sand therefore in the next step more attention should be put on understanding water and energy balance in the process of infiltration into clay soils during soil freezing and thawing moreover since the calibration was focusing on the surface water and energy balance and the upper layer water process is already shown to be well represented by the model the more detailed consideration of lower layer water processes exceeds the scope of this study nevertheless from the comparison of soil water storages at two sites we noticed that the large discrepancies mainly occur at the soil layers below the 40 cm depth this indicates that there might be some unforeseen processes in the lower soil layer e g lateral water exchange and they would influence the water transport processes in whole soil profile from surface to groundwater in the calibration results shown in fig 3 only outputs for soil heat e g soil temperature and soil water e g soil water liquid water groundwater processes at upper soil layers 0 40 cm were constrained with certain criteria this might cause the overestimation of cl storage between 40 and 100 cm soil depth additionally due to the assumption of only considering convection for salt transport in soil the simulated salt dynamics is tightly related to water dynamics it is known that during soil freezing period the upward of water and salt is the major process the over estimation of cl storage at various depths indicates that the upward movement of cl with water is over estimated even if an adsorption coefficient was assigned for each layer eq 3 this might be due to a neglect of diffusion and repulsion of solute in the model studies by cary and mayland 1972 have shown that the diffusion and expulsion processes in frozen soil actually play important roles in solute transport even though the convection is the major process the salt diffusion could happen in freezing soils when the soil solution is condensed due to decrease in liquid water content which would increase the salt concentration gradient between partly frozen layer and unfrozen layer moreover high salt concentration at low temperature would cause salt expulsion from solution due to the decrease in salt saturation with temperature however it is difficult to obtain the diffusion and expulsion of salt in frozen soil more detailed experiments on diffusion and expulsion of salt would be of high interest in study of water heat and salt coupled transport in frozen soils 6 conclusions in this study a salt induced freezing point depression function was implemented in coupmodel to simulate soil water temperature and salt transport for two seasonally frozen soils from two typical mid to high latitude agricultural regions of northern china uncertainties in the simulation results were well constrained using field data combined with the monte carlo ensemble based calibration method from this study we can conclude that 1 salts in soils impact freezing thawing the salt influences on soil freezing point depression are not negligible in mid to high latitudes while with the newly developed freezing point depression function the model can represent soil temperature much better 2 uncertainties in the simulating of water heat processes in frozen soils were well constrained with the systematic calibration approach proposed in this study the model performance in simulating soil water and temperature from two study sites was significantly improved during both calibration and validation periods 3 meanwhile salt storage was overestimated by the model because of the neglection of salt diffusion and expulsion in saline frozen soils the uncertainties in the simulated soil water temperature and salt transport from two sites were found mainly result from parameters that determine water and energy balance e g snow water infiltration surface albedo and from the lack of more detailed salt transport generally the study has demonstrated that with the newly developed module in the coupmodel to account for the impacts of salt on soil freezing point depression we significantly improved model performance and reduced modeling uncertainty under a well designed calibration scheme given the complexity of saline frozen soils detailed experiments on snowpack water and energy balance soil water and salt dynamics as well as model development on water energy balance e g snowmelt infiltration ice coverage are needed to improve the understanding about the influences of salinization on soil hydrology in mid to

4754,simulating soil hydrological processes at the plot or field scale requires using spatially representative values of the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks sampling campaigns should yield a reliable mean of ks with a sustainable workload since measuring ks at many points is challenging uncertainty analysis can be used to determine the lowest number of measurements that yield a mean ks value with a specified accuracy level potential and limitations of this analysis were tested in this investigation for different extents of the sampled area and sampling densities a clay soil was sampled intensively on two plots plot area 44 m2 two dates and using both small 0 15 m in diameter and large 0 30 m rings with the small rings intensively sampling an appropriate portion of the total plot area should be enough to establish the number of measurements yielding a certain accuracy level for the entire plot since this level remained nearly constant when the same number of measurements was performed on larger areas moreover for these areas the spatial resolution of the measurements did not influence appreciably the width of the confidence interval of the mean ks value however working with larger rings was recommended since in this case the sampled area did not affect at all normalized confidence levels that in addition varied only a little with the number of the considered measurements of ks in practice characterizing the plots required about 20 and 10 measurements with the smaller and the larger rings respectively the uncertainty analysis appears promising to plan practically sustainable soil sampling campaigns keywords saturated soil hydraulic conductivity fine textured soils simplified falling head technique bootstrap method 1 introduction determining areally representative values of the soil hydraulic properties such as the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks is necessary in many circumstances and several individual determinations of the considered parameter for the area of interest have to be averaged at this aim for example means are commonly reported in investigations on the dependence of the measured soil hydraulic properties on different factors such as rainfall soil type land use tillage practices soil compaction or soil water content somaratne and smettem 1993 ciollaro and lamaddalena 1998 ndiaye et al 2005 azam et al 2008 hardie et al 2012 capello et al 2019 ghosh and pekkat 2019 picciafuoco et al 2019 temporal variability of soil structural parameters prieksat et al 1994 logsdon and jaynes 1996 mubarak et al 2009 votrubova et al 2017 the effects of the soil hydraulic properties on crop yield keller et al 2012 servadio et al 2016 measurement methods and data analysis procedures for determination of soil hydraulic properties lee et al 1985 reynolds and zebchuk 1996 reynolds et al 2000 verbist et al 2010 2013 soil physical quality reynolds et al 2009 iovino et al 2016 simulation of surface soil hydrological processes white et al 1989 govindaraju et al 2006 and morbidelli et al 2006 formulated a conceptual semi analytical modeling for the estimate of areal average infiltration rate at hillslope scale assuming for ks a random field log normally distributed in such a type of modeling the determination of the first two moments of ks is therefore crucial moreover a watershed has to be divided into elements to apply a distributed hydrological model each element varying in size between dozens and hundreds of square meters morgan and duzant 2008 has to be reasonably uniform in soil type steepness and land cover so that it can be characterized by a single and areally representative value of each input parameter including ks developing criteria for synthetic soil characterization of a plot or a field can therefore be of interest also for parameterizing distributed hydrological models taking into account that a plot or a field could be considered a physical model of a single overland flow element bagarello et al 2010 however estimating a spatially representative value of ks is not easy because this soil hydrodynamic parameter is highly variable mallants et al 1997 warrick 1998 reynolds et al 2000 das et al 2006 papanicolau et al 2015 guzman et al 2019 in principle the number of replicated measurements should be established taking into account that soil hydraulic characterization depends on the average distance between the samples spacing the size of the sampled domain extent and the average area of a single sample support known as the scale triplet blöschl and sivapalan 1995 skøien and blöschl 2006 however in practice there is no way of predetermining the number of ks data that have to be collected as it depends on the unknown variability encountered reynolds et al 2002 the number of replicated measurements is often fixed in advance mainly on the basis of constraints of a practical nature such as available staff water or time for the field campaign regardless of the local variability sometimes some literature suggestions are taken into account to plan a sampling campaign for example reynolds et al 2002 suggested that at least 10 20 replicated field measurements of ks should be carried out for agronomic plot scale work of course the higher the number of measurements the higher is the confidence that the estimated mean is representative for the area of interest however since field measurements are practically onerous and time consuming it makes sense establishing if a reliable mean value can also be obtained on the basis of a relatively small dataset developing this topic could improve the planning of the measurement campaigns with reduced realization times picciafuoco et al 2019 and could also be helpful to make judgments on the confidence that should be attributed to an existing ks dataset uncertainty analysis appears an attractive tool for developing practical suggestions about the minimum number of measurements necessary to obtain a representative ks value for a given area for example ahmed et al 2015 suggested that approximately 20 measurements could be necessary to obtain ks for a less than 350 m long swale with an acceptable level of uncertainty picciafuoco et al 2019 developed practically relevant relationships between the confidence interval of the mean ks and both the number of measurements and the size of the sampled plot moreover they also demonstrated that the benefit of any extra measurement could be small beyond a plot size dependent number of measurements because all local soil heterogeneities characterizing the plot have been captured generally the uncertainty level of the estimate should be defined on the basis of the practical hydrological application ahmed et al 2015 picciafuoco et al 2019 however uncertainty analyses on ks do not seem very common in the scientific literature probably because they require large datasets that are not easy to develop especially in the field consequently several questions still need to be addressed to better understand what confidence can be assigned to an uncertainty analysis carried out with a particular experimental methodology in a given period of the year and with reference to a specific scale triplet a question needing consideration is the validity of an uncertainty analysis performed on a given plot for other similar plots in the neighborhood supporting the generality of the results at least under certain limits would obviously strengthen the general interest for this kind of analysis if instead the results are strictly plot specific performing an uncertainty analysis could have less practical interest establishing how the confidence interval of the areal average value of ks varies with both the extent and the sampling density is also necessary taking into account that different sampling scenarios could be delineated with reference to a presumably more or less homogeneous area many investigations have demonstrated that ks measurements are temporally variable e g prieksat et al 1994 bagarello and sgroi 2004 2007 rienzner and gandolfi 2014 morbidelli et al 2011 and they depend on the support area e g youngs 1987 lauren et al 1988 lai and ren 2007 therefore it can be presumed that the minimum number of samples needed to characterize an area of interest with a given confidence level could vary with both the sampling time and the surface area sampled with an individual ks measurement to the best of our knowledge time and support area effects on the results of the uncertainty analysis are still unknown a rather large ks dataset was developed by bagarello et al 2010 2013 at the surface of two adjacent 44 m2 plots realized on the clay soil of the sparacia experimental station for runoff and soil loss measurement both plots were sampled twice to obtain 176 ks data for each plot and each sampling date therefore the developed dataset at sparacia appears usable to check potential and limitations of an uncertainty analysis of saturated soil hydraulic conductivity data the general objective of this investigation was to test procedures for determining a representative geometric mean value of ks at the plot scale with the least possible experimental effort the specific objectives were to i verify if an uncertainty analysis is strictly plot specific or it can be considered valid for a nearby plot ii test extent and sampling density effects on the ks uncertainty analysis iii verify if the minimum number of samples for a specified confidence level varies with time and iv test support area effects on the minimum number of samples all the aforementioned objectives were pursued by applying the non parametric bootstrap technique of uncertainty analysis to ks datasets of specified spatial resolution specific spacing among measurements an analysis of the role played by the spatial resolution of the original datasets was also performed 2 materials and methods 2 1 field

21 8 sand 16 1 the soil shows a massive consistency in winter when it is wet and fully swelled but it develops a polygonal pattern of surface shrinkage cracks in late spring or early summer as the soil dries soil sampling and ks calculation were described in detail by bagarello et al 2010 2013 and consequently they were only summarized here two plots of 4 11 m2 named m plot and n plot respectively were sampled on may 2007 bagarello et al 2010 these plots were maintained continuously bare by means of frequent tillage operations and the soil was sampled one month after the last milling for a given plot 176 ks measurements were carried out by the simplified falling head sfh technique bagarello et al 2004 which is based on the philip 1992 analytical representation of a one dimensional transient falling head infiltration process the plot area was subdivided into squares of 0 5 0 5 m2 and a stainless steel cylinder wall thickness 2 mm inner diameter 0 15 m height 0 25 m sharp cutting edge at the bottom end was inserted vertically to a depth of 0 12 m by gently using a rubber hammer at the centre of each square after removing the top 2 3 cm of soil fig 1b a total of 88 undisturbed soil cores were also collected at a depth of 0 03 0 08 m these cores were transported to the laboratory for determining the dry soil bulk density ρ b and the antecedent volumetric soil water content θ i that were used for the ks calculations all field experimental work was conducted in one week without rain the two plots that were maintained bare were sampled again on february march of 2008 using identical measurement techniques data collection procedures and sample sizes bagarello et al 2013 the only difference between the two sampling campaigns was that a cylinder with an inner diameter of 0 30 m instead of 0 15 m was used on the second sampling date to measure ks in the n plot table 1 summarizes the ρ b and θ i data used for the ks calculations the ks data collected at sparacia were expected to be representative of the bare soil surface in a near undisturbed condition that is a possible soil condition at the initial stage of rainfall when macropores are active and surface seal has not developed assouline and mualem 2002 for the following reasons i the median ks values were not lower than approximately 600 mm h table 2 but rainfall intensities of no more than 100 mm h produced runoff at the base of the plot and ii determination of ks with the sfh technique should not appreciably be influenced by soil disturbance due to water application bagarello et al 2014 2 2 preliminary statistical and spatial analysis descriptive statistics were computed to summarize each ks dataset a comparison was then developed between the m and n plots to verify if the ks data collected on the two plots on a given sampling date came from a unique population at this aim the normality hypothesis of the ks distributions was initially tested by the shapiro wilk test homogeneity of variances was then checked by the levene test and an anova was finally carried out a similar comparison was carried out between the two sampling dates for plot m but not for plot n since in this last case both time and ring size changed the existence of a spatial structure of ks was investigated by calculating the moran statistic the moran autocorrelation coefficient often denoted as i is an extension of the pearson product moment correlation coefficient to a univariate series specifically the moran statistic computes a weighted pearson product moment correlation of a variable against itself where the weight relates to the variable s spatial arrangement barca et al 2019 moran index i allows investigating correlation within a single variable due to the spatial relationship among its observations the weights ω i j are a function of the distance between each pair of observations of the variable under study x i x j and they are sometimes referred to as a neighboring function in its simplest form weights will take a value of 1 for close neighbors and 0 otherwise setting ω i j 0 for all the couples i j falling in a particular distance class means neglecting that distance in this case the moran local index is calculated moran index i is represented by the following equation 1 i n s 0 i 1 n j 1 n ω i j z i z j i 1 n z i 2 where n is the number of measurements z i and zj are the deviations of an attribute from its mean and s 0 is the aggregate of all the spatial weights ω i j since i structurally resembles the classic correlation coefficient it is an index of the larger the better kind its theoretical domain ranges from 1 to 1 but values less than 0 should be considered meaningless the r library used to perform the abovementioned analysis is spdep bivand and piras 2015 2 3 uncertainty analysis 2 3 1 theoretical approach considering a specific level of uncertainty an analysis directed to estimate the ks geometric mean k s for a field area containing experimental observations was carried out the geometric mean was considered to summarize the ks data since this property is often found or assumed to be log normally distributed lee et al 1985 mallants et al 1996 govindaraju et al 2006 morbidelli et al 2006 and also because geometric means were considered in the uncertainty analyses performed by ahmed et al 2015 and picciafuoco et al 2019 therefore considering geometric means assured consistency with these previous investigations following ahmed et al 2015 and picciafuoco et al 2019 the selected approach was the non parametric bootstrap method carpenter and bithell 2000 useful for estimating uncertainty intervals around the geometric mean for different numbers of measurements this approach is based on a re sampling procedure and it does not require adopting a specific probability density function for the variable the basic assumption for applying this approach is the independency of measurements the re sampling procedure was performed with replacement repeating the process for 2000 times for deriving 95 confidence intervals carpenter and bithell 2000 in particular this approach was applied for each fixed number of observations n ranging from a minimum of four measurements to the maximum number of observations to obtain a set of 2000 geometric mean values that were then used for deriving 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles the width of the 95 confidence interval was calculated as the difference between the 97 5 and 2 5 percentiles to be clearer in case of n ns 176 each of the 2000 sets of 176 samples used to calculate the 95 confidence interval was developed by randomly extracting each ks value from the complete dataset of 176 ks values and repeating this extraction 176 times 2 3 2 steps of data analysis in order to address the selected open problems on the reliability and utility of the uncertainty analysis the following procedure was adopted as a first step the uncertainty analysis was applied to the ks datasets collected in the m and n plots each of 44 m2 during the first sampling campaign with the same device support area 0 018 m2 and the same spatial resolution of measurements 4 measurements m2 this analysis was expected to be useful to indicate if results obtained in a plot can be transferred to another nearby plot with the same soil type and land cover and maintained in the same conditions at the same time a second step of the procedure consisted of investigating the dependency of uncertainty analysis results on plot extent to this aim the data collected on the first sampling campaign were further considered and the non parametric bootstrap method was applied to sub areas of both m and n plots with extent ranging from 6 to 44 m2 in each sub area the dataset selected for the analysis was the ensemble of all the available measurements with spatial resolution always equal to 4 measurements m2 for a deeper investigation on this aspect the uncertainty analysis was also applied to the ensemble of the m and n datasets considering the two plots as a unique plot of 88 m2 characterized by a total number of measurements equal to 352 with spatial resolution of 4 measurements m2 and to selected sub areas with extent variable from 8 to 88 m2 the choice of the minimum sub area extension 6 m2 and 8 m2 in the two cases was linked to the sub area tracking procedure described in the following further two steps of the procedure were finalized to establish if the results of uncertainty analysis can be considered time independent and if they are affected by the test support area for the first objective the results obtained in plot m on the second sampling campaign were compared with those obtained earlier to address the second issue the datasets developed for plots m and n on the second campaign with different device support areas 0 018 and 0 071 m2 were analyzed the last stage of the applied procedure was directed to clarify if the spatial resolution of the available ks dataset could affect the uncertainty analysis starting from the dataset of 352 measurements with resolution of 4 measurements m2 characterizing the mn plot of 88 m2 on the first sampling date two further datasets were derived composed by 88 and 44 measurements with spatial resolution of 1 measurement m2 and 0 5 measurement m2 respectively the uncertainty analysis was then applied to the two new datasets to answer to the open aforementioned question 3 results 3 1 preliminary statistical analysis the preliminary statistical analysis aimed to summarize the four ks datasets collected by bagarello et al 2010 2013 and to compare one dataset with the other highlighted some departure from normal distribution table 2 in particular ks showed a right tail due to some outlying observations for both plots and both sampling dates moreover the shapiro wilk test indicated a significant departure from normality in all cases table 2 consequently the levene test was used to check homogeneity of variances since this test does not require that data come from a normal distribution with reference to the first sampling date the levene test yielded a p value of 0 4552 indicating that the two ks datasets m and n plots had homogeneous variances the kruskal wallis test which is a form of distribution free anova yielded a p value 0 368 indicating that the collected data on the two plots came from the same population for the two ks datasets m and n plots obtained on the second sampling date the levene test yielded a p value of 0 00017 consequently the assumption of variance homogeneity was rejected an anova with unequal variances yielded a p value 4 90 10 9 signaling significant differences between the two ks datasets therefore a single experimental field plot m plot n was definable for the first sampling date table 2 but not for the second one since in this case the two datasets were extracted from two different populations this last result did not surprise because rings of two different diameters were used in the two plots and ks measurements can vary with the individual sample size due to soil heterogeneity e g youngs 1987 lauren et al 1988 vepraskas and williams 1995 bagarello and provenzano 1996 with reference to the two sampling dates for plot m the gaussian assumption was rejected because the p value of the shapiro wilk test was significant p value 6 28 10 14 and the levene test yielded a p value of 0 00324 therefore the assumption of equal variances was rejected finally the unequal variances anova test applied on the same plot at the two different sampling dates rejected the mean equality hypothesis p value 7 56 10 8 table 2 also yields the values of the moran index for each plot and each sampling date the p values signaled occurrence of auto correlation at a significance level α 0 05 however auto correlation was weak given that the i values were small therefore the ks data appeared to be nearly independent from each other or no more than weakly related to one another this result supported the uncertainty analysis procedure applied in this investigation 3 2 uncertainty analysis 3 2 1 comparing plots on the basis of the checked independency of observations the non parametric bootstrap method was applied to the ks datasets collected during the first sampling date in the plots m and n m i and n i datasets characterized by the same soil type area 44 m2 land cover bare surface and spatial resolution 4 measurements m2 for a total number of measurements for each plot equal to 176 the two datasets were characterized by similar statistics in terms of geometric mean median and dispersion degree table 2 for n ranging from a minimum of 4 to the maximum number of available data in each plot the uncertainty analysis allowed to derive the 95 confidence interval around the geometric mean for the two plots to make the comparison between the two plots easier the 95 confidence intervals were normalized by the ks geometric mean of each plot and they were shown in fig 2 as expected the width of the 95 confidence interval decreased with an increasing number of observations up to an almost constant value in addition the figure highlights a similar behavior of the two datasets related to the first sampling date even if for each fixed number of measurements the confidence interval width of plot m i dataset was always slightly smaller than the corresponding one for plot n i dataset as an example for n equal to 24 samples the normalized confidence interval width for plot m dataset was 1 3 while for plot n dataset it was 1 6 in accordance with the slightly higher ks variability in the latter plot table 2 therefore the outcome of an uncertainty analysis in terms of normalized confidence around k s obtained in a specific plot was transferable to another nearby plot with the same soil type and land cover maintained in the same conditions at the same time in the future it should be established if this result could be expected to remain stable with time 3 2 2 plot extent to investigate the role of plot extent for each plot ten sub areas ranging from 6 to 44 m2 were selected and the uncertainty analysis was applied to each of them by considering a number of measurements n varying between 6 and 24 representing common sample sizes for plot scale characterization the procedure performed to track sub areas contour in plots m and n is shown in fig 3 a sub areas were contoured with a fixed width of 4 m and increasing lengths from a minimum of 1 5 m in each sub area the dataset selected for the uncertainty analysis and for normalizing the 95 confidence interval of k s was the ensemble of all the available measurements with a spacing of 0 5 m the choice of a minimum sub area length equal to 1 5 m allowed to include in the smaller sub area of 6 m2 a number of measurements 24 reasonable for applying the bootstrap method an alternative procedure for this analysis could have been taking into account with reference to a small area all possible sub plots that can be defined for that area and then considering the mean results this procedure was not applied because for a given plot size sampling is performed in practice on pre established plots rather than on all plots of that size that could be identified in the field another reason was that with the alternative procedure there is more information for a small plot than a large plot the results expressed as width of the normalized 95 confidence interval for specific n and sub area are shown in fig 4 a and 4b these figures allow to derive the minimum number of measurements that guarantees in a specific sub area a fixed level of accuracy for the estimate of k s i e a fixed value of confidence uncertainty expressed as width of the normalized 95 confidence interval in both cases m and n datasets the confidence in the estimate decreased when a fixed number of measurements was performed on a larger sub area within values of approximately 14 18 m2 instead an almost invariant trend of uncertainty was detected for larger sub areas and this trend was clearer with the largest sample sizes for a specific sub area greater confidence on the estimate required increasing n the values of the normalized 95 confidence interval width for the plot m dataset were slightly lower than those of the plot n dataset but the order of magnitude remained similar for example from fig 4a and 4b it can be deduced that in both cases an uncertainty around the estimated k s in terms of normalized 95 confidence interval width equal to 1 could only be obtained if more than 24 measurements were considered on sub areas ranging from 14 m2 to 44 m2 table 3 shows some quantitative results derived from this analysis in order to complete the investigation on plot extent effects the uncertainty analysis was also applied to the dataset composed by the ensemble of both m and n datasets developed on the first sampling date mn i dataset considering the two plots as a unique plot of 88 m2 the dataset used for this step was composed by 352 measurements with same spacing 0 5 m and spatial resolution 4 measurements m2 of the two origin datasets this was possible on the basis of the statistical similarity found between the two datasets and the adjacent location of the two plots the result shown in fig 5 a highlighted as the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval exhibited values intermediate with respect to those determined for the separate datasets when identical n values were considered this means that the uncertainty analysis provided for fixed values of n a similar level of uncertainty in the estimate of k s in plots characterized by different extent 44 m2 and 88 m2 furthermore in mn plot 21 sub areas were countered with fixed width of 8 m and increasing lengths from a minimum of 1 m fig 3b so to have the smaller one of 8 m2 with 32 included observations applying the uncertainty analysis fig 5b was obtained if compared with fig 4a and 4b fig 5b exhibited a similar behavior with an almost invariant trend of the uncertainty curves for sub areas larger than about 28 m2 and especially with reference to the largest sample sizes this result confirmed that beyond a threshold area the level of accuracy obtained with a specific n is almost constant due to the capability of capturing all the random variability sources naturally present in the plot therefore the uncertainty analysis results can be considered approximately plot area invariant for a range of plot extents above a threshold area that guarantees to include all the possible random sources of ks variability in this investigation the threshold values of 14 m2 and 28 m2 found for the m and n plots and the mn plot respectively were linked by a common sub area length of 3 5 m see also fig 3 the length of the sub area was the main element determining the threshold value in this study 3 2 3 temporal variability in order to check if the results of the uncertainty analysis performed in a specific plot can be considered time independent the following step was to apply the non parametric bootstrap method to the m ii dataset collected with the same spatial resolution 4 measurements m2 and with the same device cylinder inner diameter equal to 0 15 m but 9 months later development of the first dataset for the same plot the results of this investigation were reported in fig 2 table 3 and fig 4a and 4c from the comparison between the m i and m ii datasets it was clear that the second one exhibited a greater level of uncertainty for fixed extent and n table 3 and fig 2 for example the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval increased in time from 0 6 to 1 3 for an area of 6 m2 and n 10 and from 2 to 3 1 for an area of 44 m2 and n 10 these appreciably different findings probably derived from the modified statistical characteristics of the datasets collected in the plot m in the two different sampling dates as clearly highlighted by the values of geometric mean and coefficient of variation reported in table 2 as an example the geometric mean of ks measurements performed in plot m during the second campaign was more than halved with respect to that of previous sampling consequently the results of the uncertainty analysis are not valid when soil hydraulic properties change in time their spatial structure and magnitude from the analysis of fig 4c it can again be detected that the confidence of k s estimate is invariant with sub area extension above the same area threshold value 14 18 m2 detected on the same plot during the first sampling campaign this means that the aforementioned threshold is a time invariant characteristic 3 2 4 support area to investigate how the support area affects the statistical dataset characteristics and consequently the results of the uncertainty analysis the non parametric bootstrap method was applied to the n ii dataset recorded through the same sfh technique but using a ring with a larger diameter 0 30 m than that used for the other sampling campaign 0 15 m in this context fig 2 highlighted that doubling the diameter of the device changed completely the outcomes in particular the uncertainty decreased significantly not only with respect to n i dataset that was expected for soil modifications due to the time lapse between the two campaigns but also with respect to m ii dataset simultaneously monitored as shown in table 2 the two datasets of the second sampling date exhibited completely different statistics and this can mainly be ascribed to the different support area table 3 and fig 4b and 4d provided clear evidence that the uncertainty of k s derived from the n ii dataset was very low with values of 0 5 0 9 for the examined interval of n 6 24 sub area 6 44 m2 and a complete invariance with respect to the extent for fixed n according to these results using a larger test support area is recommended in the light to increase the confidence on the mean ks calculations in agreement with other investigations suggesting that large rings should be used when soil spatial variability is high lai and ren 2007 3 2 5 spatial resolution all the afore described outcomes derived from uncertainty analysis application to datasets characterized by a specific and constant spatial resolution of measurements 4 measurements m2 with a spacing of 0 5 m the last effort was directed to check if this property of the original datasets had a role in defining the confidence levels of k s to this aim the uncertainty analysis was applied to two mn i sub datasets extracted from the original one of 352 measurements so that the measurement densities were equal to 1 measurement per square meter total number of measurements 88 and 0 5 measurement per square meter total number of measurements 44 respectively as it can be seen from table 4 and fig 6 a decrease of dataset spatial resolution determined an increase of the uncertainty for selected n and extent however this effect appeared to become negligible when larger sub areas and greater n were considered so that the results previously described can be considered reliable independently of the spatial resolution of the performed measurements at least in the density range investigated 3 2 6 planning monitoring campaigns an additional tool useful in planning monitoring campaigns consists of plotting the reduction of the non normalized 95 confidence interval width against the number of performed measurements the reduction is determined as the difference between the interval width related to n and n 1 measurements fig 7 shows this plot obtained for m i mn i and n ii datasets for n i and m ii datasets trends very similar to fig 7a were obtained and are not included as expected the reduction of confidence interval width decreased in absolute value with increasing n in all cases up to an asymptotic zero value this result can be useful to select the number of measurements over which the benefit produced by an additional measurement does not justify the cost of performing it what can be deduced from fig 7 is that in all datasets collected with an inner diameter of 0 15 m about 20 measurements represent the limit value of a tradeoff between cost and benefit in the case of the n ii dataset obtained with an inner diameter of 0 30 m this number decreases to 10 15 as expected by the lower uncertainty range previously described 4 discussion the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity is generally spatially and temporally variable e g prieksat et al 1994 logsdon and jaynes 1996 warrick 1998 variations can be particularly noticeable for clay soils with coefficients of variations of even several hundreds percent lee et al 1985 bagarello et al 1999 and means varying by even orders of magnitude seasonally messing and jarvis 1990 jabro 1996 bagarello and sgroi 2004 but also within hours favre et al 1997 however saturated hydraulic conductivity of a clay soil can also remain nearly stable in time when the clay minerals are non swelling and or roots stabilize the soil peds and aggregates reynolds and zebchuk 1996 this large variety of situations implies that an appropriate characterization of a clay soil requires an intensive sampling both in space and in time with considerable experimental efforts in this context establishing the confidence that can be attributed to any estimate of the mean ks value can become very challenging and perhaps even prohibitive since uncertainty analyses should be repeated both in space and time the analysis performed in this investigation attempted to give some useful indications on the strategies that could be applied in the perspective to obtain reliable mean saturated soil hydraulic conductivity values with the lowest number of samples picciafuoco et al 2019 according to this investigation checking the stability of the summary parameters of the ks distribution could be enough to plan the required experimental efforts for characterizing a clay soil the uncertainty analysis performed on a given plot and a particular sampling date remains valid for a nearby plot or another sampling date if the summary parameters of ks do not vary or at least they vary only a little table 2 and fig 2 this result indicating that the uncertainty analysis could be unnecessary in some cases makes a detailed description of the soil hydrodynamic behavior simpler without any loss of information of course a possible concern about this suggestion is that an intensive soil sampling remains necessary in any case representing the starting point to later conclude that sampling intensively the soil was not strictly necessary this is a general way to proceed in this kind of investigations for example vieira et al 1981 had the need to collect 1280 samples to verify that nearly the same information could be obtained with 128 samples however this investigation also suggested that sampling strategies could be adapted in an attempt to reduce experimental efforts in the field in particular for a given extent the greater the number of measurements the greater the confidence on the estimated mean of ks as expected fig 4 however the normalized uncertainty corresponding to a given number of measurements does not change with the extent above a threshold area fig 4a b and this extent invariance also seems time invariant fig 4a c therefore the width of the normalized confidence interval determined on a small area greater than a threshold is also representative for a larger area probably because a relatively small plot contains all the variability that can be found in a larger plot picciafuoco et al 2019 if the sampled area is large using a large number of measurements per unit area could not be advantageous since the width of the normalized confidence interval does not vary with the data spatial resolution fig 6 in practice the total number of measurements is more important than the closeness between measurements if instead the objective is to establish the width of the normalized confidence interval for a small area then the suggestion should be using an information with a high spatial resolution because otherwise the risk is to obtain a higher uncertainty fig 6 the effect of the number of measurements on the behavior of the confidence interval width reduction appears similar for different plots extents and sampling dates fig 7 therefore the relationship between width reduction and number of measurements determined once does not need to be repeated since it seems to have a general validity at least for the sampled site moreover this result supports the existence in the literature of a few general suggestions about an appropriate sample size for plot scale determination of a representative mean saturated conductivity value since the indication of this study was not far from that given by reynolds et al 2002 summarizing these arguments with reference to an area of interest one could work on a portion of this area possibly realizing a locally intensive soil sampling to establish an appropriate number of measurements to obtain a certain accuracy level ahmed et al 2015 picciafuoco et al 2019 the expectation is that this accuracy level remains nearly unchanged if the same number of measurements are performed on a larger area if a larger plot with homogeneous soil type and conditions has to be sampled an equally intensive sampling could not be necessary since more experimental work does not induce an appreciable decrease of the confidence interval with a larger support area 0 30 m rings a threshold area in the relationship between the width of the normalized confidence interval and the plot area is no more detectable fig 4d which suggests that a sampling performed on even a small portion of the plot is representative in terms of expected normalized confidence of the entire plot under homogeneous soil type and conditions moreover the dependence of the normalized confidence interval on the number of measurements decreases and this confidence steadily settles on smaller values in the passage from a small to a large ring probably these results are a consequence of the smaller relative variability of the ks data collected with the larger ring table 2 which is well documented in the literature e g young 1987 lai and ren 2007 although an opposite trend could also be detected occasionally bagarello et al 2012 khodaverdiloo et al 2017 with reference to the ks datasets used in this investigation bagarello et al 2013 suggested that a plausible explanation of the detected ring size effect was that the probability not to sample a representative elementary volume lauren et al 1988 vepraskas and williams 1995 was higher with the small ring than the large one according to this investigation a large ring a small sampled area and a relatively small number of measurements yield a normalized confidence that can be transferred to larger areas and also at least to some extent to different numbers of measurements in summary a few measurements with a large ring are better than many measurements with a small ring 5 conclusions according to this investigation a way to characterize an area of interest with a single ks value could be applying an uncertainty analysis for determining the lowest number of required measurements yielding a mean ks value with a pre established accuracy level therefore the expected reliability of the mean should be fixed in advance instead of the number of measurements as more common looking at the problem from this perspective is unavoidably challenging from an experimental point of view since in principle a robust uncertainty analysis requires working with rather large datasets to later perhaps conclude that they were too large to obtain a representative ks value however a conclusion of this investigation was that very large datasets are not always necessary to perform a reliable uncertainty analysis performing an intensive soil sampling on only a portion of an area of interest should be enough to establish the required number of measurements yielding a certain accuracy level for the entire area since the expectation is that this accuracy level remains nearly constant even if the same number of measurements is carried out on a larger area if a larger plot has to be sampled an intensive sampling could not be necessary since more experimental work above a threshold does not induce an appreciable decrease of the confidence interval of the mean ks values however another conclusion of this investigation was that a large support area for each individual measurement has to be recommended in general since in this case sampling small areas and performing a relatively small number of measurements can be enough to obtain a normalized confidence interval of the mean of ks that can be transferred to larger areas and also at least to some extent to different sample sizes the results of this investigation were representative of a nearly undisturbed soil condition but the surface soil characteristics could differ in a condition of greater propensity of the soil to runoff formation therefore the uncertainty analysis should also be repeated in this condition soil disturbance favoring runoff occurrence is expected to induce a structure homogenization in many instances which could make the uncertainty analysis performed on the undisturbed soil indicative of the highest uncertainty that can be expected in general however this suggestion needs experimental testing in future research in addition other uncertainty analyses should be performed on other soils and also on larger areas since a limit of this investigation was that all data were collected on small plots of 44 m2 characterizing these plots with a reliable mean ks value requires about 20 measurements with the rings of 0 15 m but about half data could be enough if the larger ring is used of course the results of this investigation were specific for the sampled site and perhaps for the applied data analysis methodology notwithstanding this the results should be of rather general interest since this investigation represents one of the few investigations making use of multiple large datasets and also because to the best of our knowledge some issues such as the link between ring size and the performed uncertainty analysis were investigated for the first time moreover the circumstance that other investigations corroborated some of the results obtained here induces us to suggest that our results could have a larger relevance than exclusively the local one credit

4754,simulating soil hydrological processes at the plot or field scale requires using spatially representative values of the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks sampling campaigns should yield a reliable mean of ks with a sustainable workload since measuring ks at many points is challenging uncertainty analysis can be used to determine the lowest number of measurements that yield a mean ks value with a specified accuracy level potential and limitations of this analysis were tested in this investigation for different extents of the sampled area and sampling densities a clay soil was sampled intensively on two plots plot area 44 m2 two dates and using both small 0 15 m in diameter and large 0 30 m rings with the small rings intensively sampling an appropriate portion of the total plot area should be enough to establish the number of measurements yielding a certain accuracy level for the entire plot since this level remained nearly constant when the same number of measurements was performed on larger areas moreover for these areas the spatial resolution of the measurements did not influence appreciably the width of the confidence interval of the mean ks value however working with larger rings was recommended since in this case the sampled area did not affect at all normalized confidence levels that in addition varied only a little with the number of the considered measurements of ks in practice characterizing the plots required about 20 and 10 measurements with the smaller and the larger rings respectively the uncertainty analysis appears promising to plan practically sustainable soil sampling campaigns keywords saturated soil hydraulic conductivity fine textured soils simplified falling head technique bootstrap method 1 introduction determining areally representative values of the soil hydraulic properties such as the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks is necessary in many circumstances and several individual determinations of the considered parameter for the area of interest have to be averaged at this aim for example means are commonly reported in investigations on the dependence of the measured soil hydraulic properties on different factors such as rainfall soil type land use tillage practices soil compaction or soil water content somaratne and smettem 1993 ciollaro and lamaddalena 1998 ndiaye et al 2005 azam et al 2008 hardie et

random field log normally distributed in such a type of modeling the determination of the first two moments of ks is therefore crucial moreover a watershed has to be divided into elements to apply a distributed hydrological model each element varying in size between dozens and hundreds of square meters morgan and duzant 2008 has to be reasonably uniform in soil type steepness and land cover so that it can be characterized by a single and areally representative value of each input parameter including ks developing criteria for synthetic soil characterization of a plot or a field can therefore be of interest also for parameterizing distributed hydrological models taking into account that a plot or a field could be considered a physical model of a single overland flow element bagarello et al 2010 however estimating a spatially representative value of ks is not easy because this soil hydrodynamic parameter is highly variable mallants et al 1997 warrick 1998 reynolds et al 2000 das et al 2006 papanicolau et al 2015 guzman et al 2019 in principle the number of replicated measurements should be established taking into account that soil hydraulic characterization depends on the average distance between the samples spacing the size of the sampled domain extent and the average area of a single sample support known as the scale triplet blöschl and sivapalan 1995 skøien and blöschl 2006 however in practice there is no way of predetermining the number of ks data that have to be collected as it depends on the unknown variability encountered reynolds et al 2002 the number of replicated measurements is often fixed in advance mainly on the basis of constraints of a practical nature such as available staff water or time for the field campaign regardless of the local variability sometimes some literature suggestions are taken into account to plan a sampling campaign for example reynolds et al 2002 suggested that at least 10 20 replicated field measurements of ks should be carried out for agronomic plot scale work of course the higher the number of measurements the higher is the confidence that the estimated mean is representative for the area of interest however since field measurements are practically onerous and time consuming it makes sense establishing if a reliable mean value can also be obtained on the basis of a relatively small dataset developing this topic could improve the planning of the measurement campaigns with reduced realization times picciafuoco et al 2019 and could also be helpful to make judgments on the confidence that should be attributed to an existing ks dataset uncertainty analysis appears an attractive tool for developing practical suggestions about the minimum number of measurements necessary to obtain a representative ks value for a given area for example ahmed et al 2015 suggested that approximately 20 measurements could be necessary to obtain ks for a less than 350 m long swale with an acceptable level of uncertainty picciafuoco et al 2019 developed practically relevant relationships between the confidence interval of the mean ks and both the number of measurements and the size of the sampled plot moreover they also demonstrated that the benefit of any extra measurement could be small beyond a plot size dependent number of measurements because all local soil heterogeneities characterizing the plot have been captured generally the uncertainty level of the estimate should be defined on the basis of the practical hydrological application ahmed et al 2015 picciafuoco et al 2019 however uncertainty analyses on ks do not seem very common in the scientific literature probably because they require large datasets that are not easy to develop especially in the field consequently several questions still need to be addressed to better understand what confidence can be assigned to an uncertainty analysis carried out with a particular experimental methodology in a given period of the year and with reference to a specific scale triplet a question needing consideration is the validity of an uncertainty analysis performed on a given plot for other similar plots in the neighborhood supporting the generality of the results at least under certain limits would obviously strengthen the general interest for this kind of analysis if instead the results are strictly plot specific performing an uncertainty analysis could have less practical interest establishing how the confidence interval of the areal average value of ks varies with both the extent and the sampling density is also necessary taking into account that different sampling scenarios could be delineated with reference to a presumably more or less homogeneous area many investigations have demonstrated that ks measurements are temporally variable e g prieksat et al 1994 bagarello and sgroi 2004 2007 rienzner and gandolfi 2014 morbidelli et al 2011 and they depend on the support area e g youngs 1987 lauren et al 1988 lai and ren 2007 therefore it can be presumed that the minimum number of samples needed to characterize an area of interest with a given confidence level could vary with both the sampling time and the surface area sampled with an individual ks measurement to the best of our knowledge time and support area effects on the results of the uncertainty analysis are still unknown a rather large ks dataset was developed by bagarello et al 2010 2013 at the surface of two adjacent 44 m2 plots realized on the clay soil of the sparacia experimental station for runoff and soil loss measurement both plots were sampled twice to obtain 176 ks data for each plot and each sampling date therefore the developed dataset at sparacia appears usable to check potential and limitations of an uncertainty analysis of saturated soil hydraulic conductivity data the general objective of this investigation was to test procedures for determining a representative geometric mean value of ks at the plot scale with the least possible experimental effort the specific objectives were to i verify if an uncertainty analysis is strictly plot specific or it can be considered valid for a nearby plot ii test extent and sampling density effects on the ks uncertainty analysis iii verify if the minimum number of samples for a specified confidence level varies with time and iv test support area effects on the minimum number of samples all the aforementioned objectives were pursued by applying the non parametric bootstrap technique of uncertainty analysis to ks datasets of specified spatial resolution specific spacing among measurements an analysis of the role played by the spatial resolution of the original datasets was also performed 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and sampling campaigns data for this investigation were collected at the experimental station for soil erosion measurement sparacia of the university of palermo located in western sicily italy 37 38 12 48 n 13 45 57 71 e approximately 100 km south of palermo fig 1 a the soil is a vertic haploxerept soil survey staff 2006 with a clay texture according to the usda classification clay 62 1 silt 21 8 sand 16 1 the soil shows a massive consistency in winter when it is wet and fully swelled but it develops a polygonal pattern of surface shrinkage cracks in late spring or early summer as the soil dries soil sampling and ks calculation were described in detail by bagarello et al 2010 2013 and consequently they were only summarized here two plots of 4 11 m2 named m plot and n plot respectively were sampled on may 2007 bagarello et al 2010 these plots were maintained continuously bare by means of frequent tillage operations and the soil was sampled one month after the last milling for a given plot 176 ks measurements were carried out by the simplified falling head sfh technique bagarello et al 2004 which is based on the philip 1992 analytical representation of a one dimensional transient falling head infiltration process the plot area was subdivided into squares of 0 5 0 5 m2 and a stainless steel cylinder wall thickness 2 mm inner diameter 0 15 m height 0 25 m sharp cutting edge at the bottom end was inserted vertically to a depth of 0 12 m by gently using a rubber hammer at the centre of each square after removing the top 2 3 cm of soil fig 1b a total of 88 undisturbed soil cores were also collected at a depth of 0 03 0 08 m these cores were transported to the laboratory for determining the dry soil bulk density ρ b and the antecedent volumetric soil water content θ i that were used for the ks calculations all field experimental work was conducted in one week without rain the two plots that were maintained bare were sampled again on february march of 2008 using identical measurement techniques data collection procedures and sample sizes bagarello et al 2013 the only difference between the two sampling campaigns was that a cylinder with an inner diameter of 0 30 m instead of 0 15 m was used on the second sampling date to measure ks in the n plot table 1 summarizes the ρ b and θ i data used for the ks calculations the ks data collected at sparacia were expected to be representative of the bare soil surface in a near undisturbed condition that is a possible soil condition at the initial stage of rainfall when macropores are active and surface seal has not developed assouline and mualem 2002 for the following reasons i the median ks values were not lower than approximately 600 mm h table 2 but rainfall intensities of no more than 100 mm h produced runoff at the base of the plot and ii determination of ks with the sfh technique should not appreciably be influenced by soil disturbance due to water application bagarello et al 2014 2 2 preliminary statistical and spatial analysis descriptive statistics were computed to summarize each ks dataset a comparison was then developed between the m and n plots to verify if the ks data collected on the two plots on a given sampling date came from a unique population at this aim the normality hypothesis of the ks distributions was initially tested by the shapiro wilk test homogeneity of variances was then checked by the levene test and an anova was finally carried out a similar comparison was carried out between the two sampling dates for plot m but not for plot n since in this last case both time and ring size changed the existence of a spatial structure of ks was investigated by calculating the moran statistic the moran autocorrelation coefficient often denoted as i is an extension of the pearson product moment correlation coefficient to a univariate series specifically the moran statistic computes a weighted pearson product moment correlation of a variable against itself where the weight relates to the variable s spatial arrangement barca et al 2019 moran index i allows investigating correlation within a single variable due to the spatial relationship among its observations the weights ω i j are a function of the distance between each pair of observations of the variable under study x i x j and they are sometimes referred to as a neighboring function in its simplest form weights will take a value of 1 for close neighbors and 0 otherwise setting ω i j 0 for all the couples i j falling in a particular distance class means neglecting that distance in this case the moran local index is calculated moran index i is represented by the following equation 1 i n s 0 i 1 n j 1 n ω i j z i z j i 1 n z i 2 where n is the number of measurements z i and zj are the deviations of an attribute from its mean and s 0 is the aggregate of all the spatial weights ω i j since i structurally resembles the classic correlation coefficient it is an index of the larger the better kind its theoretical domain ranges from 1 to 1 but values less than 0 should be considered meaningless the r library used to perform the abovementioned analysis is spdep bivand and piras 2015 2 3 uncertainty analysis 2 3 1 theoretical approach considering a specific level of uncertainty an analysis directed to estimate the ks geometric mean k s for a field area containing experimental observations was carried out the geometric mean was considered to summarize the ks data since this property is often found or assumed to be log normally distributed lee et al 1985 mallants et al 1996 govindaraju et al 2006 morbidelli et al 2006 and also because geometric means were considered in the uncertainty analyses performed by ahmed et al 2015 and picciafuoco et al 2019 therefore considering geometric means assured consistency with these previous investigations following ahmed et al 2015 and picciafuoco et al 2019 the selected approach was the non parametric bootstrap method carpenter and bithell 2000 useful for estimating uncertainty intervals around the geometric mean for different numbers of measurements this approach is based on a re sampling procedure and it does not require adopting a specific probability density function for the variable the basic assumption for applying this approach is the independency of measurements the re sampling procedure was performed with replacement repeating the process for 2000 times for deriving 95 confidence intervals carpenter and bithell 2000 in particular this approach was applied for each fixed number of observations n ranging from a minimum of four measurements to the maximum number of observations to obtain a set of 2000 geometric mean values that were then used for deriving 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles the width of the 95 confidence interval was calculated as the difference between the 97 5 and 2 5 percentiles to be clearer in case of n ns 176 each of the 2000 sets of 176 samples used to calculate the 95 confidence interval was developed by randomly extracting each ks value from the complete dataset of 176 ks values and repeating this extraction 176 times 2 3 2 steps of data analysis in order to address the selected open problems on the reliability and utility of the uncertainty analysis the following procedure was adopted as a first step the uncertainty analysis was applied to the ks datasets collected in the m and n plots each of 44 m2 during the first sampling campaign with the same device support area 0 018 m2 and the same spatial resolution of measurements 4 measurements m2 this analysis was expected to be useful to indicate if results obtained in a plot can be transferred to another nearby plot with the same soil type and land cover and maintained in the same conditions at the same time a second step of the procedure consisted of investigating the dependency of uncertainty analysis results on plot extent to this aim the data collected on the first sampling campaign were further considered and the non parametric bootstrap method was applied to sub areas of both m and n plots with extent ranging from 6 to 44 m2 in each sub area the dataset selected for the analysis was the ensemble of all the available measurements with spatial resolution always equal to 4 measurements m2 for a deeper investigation on this aspect the uncertainty analysis was also applied to the ensemble of the m and n datasets considering the two plots as a unique plot of 88 m2 characterized by a total number of measurements equal to 352 with spatial resolution of 4 measurements m2 and to selected sub areas with extent variable from 8 to 88 m2 the choice of the minimum sub area extension 6 m2 and 8 m2 in the two cases was linked to the sub area tracking procedure described in the following further two steps of the procedure were finalized to establish if the results of uncertainty analysis can be considered time independent and if they are affected by the test support area for the first objective the results obtained in plot m on the second sampling campaign were compared with those obtained earlier to address the second issue the datasets developed for plots m and n on the second campaign with different device support areas 0 018 and 0 071 m2 were analyzed the last stage of the applied procedure was directed to clarify if the spatial resolution of the available ks dataset could affect the uncertainty analysis starting from the dataset of 352 measurements with resolution of 4 measurements m2 characterizing the mn plot of 88 m2 on the first sampling date two further datasets were derived composed by 88 and 44 measurements with spatial resolution of 1 measurement m2 and 0 5 measurement m2 respectively the uncertainty analysis was then applied to the two new datasets to answer to the open aforementioned question 3 results 3 1 preliminary statistical analysis the preliminary statistical analysis aimed to summarize the four ks datasets collected by bagarello et al 2010 2013 and to compare one dataset with the other highlighted some departure from normal distribution table 2 in particular ks showed a right tail due to some outlying observations for both plots and both sampling dates moreover the shapiro wilk test indicated a significant departure from normality in all cases table 2 consequently the levene test was used to check homogeneity of variances since this test does not require that data come from a normal distribution with reference to the first sampling date the levene test yielded a p value of 0 4552 indicating that the two ks datasets m and n plots had homogeneous variances the kruskal wallis test which is a form of distribution free anova yielded a p value 0 368 indicating that the collected data on the two plots came from the same population for the two ks datasets m and n plots obtained on the second sampling date the levene test yielded a p value of 0 00017 consequently the assumption of variance homogeneity was rejected an anova with unequal variances yielded a p value 4 90 10 9 signaling significant differences between the two ks datasets therefore a single experimental field plot m plot n was definable for the first sampling date table 2 but not for the second one since in this case the two datasets were extracted from two different populations this last result did not surprise because rings of two different diameters were used in the two plots and ks measurements can vary with the individual sample size due to soil heterogeneity e g youngs 1987 lauren et al 1988 vepraskas and williams 1995 bagarello and provenzano 1996 with reference to the two sampling dates for plot m the gaussian assumption was rejected because the p value of the shapiro wilk test was significant p value 6 28 10 14 and the levene test yielded a p value of 0 00324 therefore the assumption of equal variances was rejected finally the unequal variances anova test applied on the same plot at the two different sampling dates rejected the mean equality hypothesis p value 7 56 10 8 table 2 also yields the values of the moran index for each plot and each sampling date the p values signaled occurrence of auto correlation at a significance level α 0 05 however auto correlation was weak given that the i values were small therefore the ks data appeared to be nearly independent from each other or no more than weakly related to one another this result supported the uncertainty analysis procedure applied in this investigation 3 2 uncertainty analysis 3 2 1 comparing plots on the basis of the checked independency of observations the non parametric bootstrap method was applied to the ks datasets collected during the first sampling date in the plots m and n m i and n i datasets characterized by the same soil type area 44 m2 land cover bare surface and spatial resolution 4 measurements m2 for a total number of measurements for each plot equal to 176 the two datasets were characterized by similar statistics in terms of geometric mean median and dispersion degree table 2 for n ranging from a minimum of 4 to the maximum number of available data in each plot the uncertainty analysis allowed to derive the 95 confidence interval around the geometric mean for the two plots to make the comparison between the two plots easier the 95 confidence intervals were normalized by the ks geometric mean of each plot and they were shown in fig 2 as expected the width of the 95 confidence interval decreased with an increasing number of observations up to an almost constant value in addition the figure highlights a similar behavior of the two datasets related to the first sampling date even if for each fixed number of measurements the confidence interval width of plot m i dataset was always slightly smaller than the corresponding one for plot n i dataset as an example for n equal to 24 samples the normalized confidence interval width for plot m dataset was 1 3 while for plot n dataset it was 1 6 in accordance with the slightly higher ks variability in the latter plot table 2 therefore the outcome of an uncertainty analysis in terms of normalized confidence around k s obtained in a specific plot was transferable to another nearby plot with the same soil type and land cover maintained in the same conditions at the same time in the future it should be established if this result could be expected to remain stable with time 3 2 2 plot extent to investigate the role of plot extent for each plot ten sub areas ranging from 6 to 44 m2 were selected and the uncertainty analysis was applied to each of them by considering a number of measurements n varying between 6 and 24 representing common sample sizes for plot scale characterization the procedure performed to track sub areas contour in plots m and n is shown in fig 3 a sub areas were contoured with a fixed width of 4 m and increasing lengths from a minimum of 1 5 m in each sub area the dataset selected for the uncertainty analysis and for normalizing the 95 confidence interval of k s was the ensemble of all the available measurements with a spacing of 0 5 m the choice of a minimum sub area length equal to 1 5 m allowed to include in the smaller sub area of 6 m2 a number of measurements 24 reasonable for applying the bootstrap method an alternative procedure for this analysis could have been taking into account with reference to a small area all possible sub plots that can be defined for that area and then considering the mean results this procedure was not applied because for a given plot size sampling is performed in practice on pre established plots rather than on all plots of that size that could be identified in the field another reason was that with the alternative procedure there is more information for a small plot than a large plot the results expressed as width of the normalized 95 confidence interval for specific n and sub area are shown in fig 4 a and 4b these figures allow to derive the minimum number of measurements that guarantees in a specific sub area a fixed level of accuracy for the estimate of k s i e a fixed value of confidence uncertainty expressed as width of the normalized 95 confidence interval in both cases m and n datasets the confidence in the estimate decreased when a fixed number of measurements was performed on a larger sub area within values of approximately 14 18 m2 instead an almost invariant trend of uncertainty was detected for larger sub areas and this trend was clearer with the largest sample sizes for a specific sub area greater confidence on the estimate required increasing n the values of the normalized 95 confidence interval width for the plot m dataset were slightly lower than those of the plot n dataset but the order of magnitude remained similar for example from fig 4a and 4b it can be deduced that in both cases an uncertainty around the estimated k s in terms of normalized 95 confidence interval width equal to 1 could only be obtained if more than 24 measurements were considered on sub areas ranging from 14 m2 to 44 m2 table 3 shows some quantitative results derived from this analysis in order to complete the investigation on plot extent effects the uncertainty analysis was also applied to the dataset composed by the ensemble of both m and n datasets developed on the first sampling date mn i dataset considering the two plots as a unique plot of 88 m2 the dataset used for this step was composed by 352 measurements with same spacing 0 5 m and spatial resolution 4 measurements m2 of the two origin datasets this was possible on the basis of the statistical similarity found between the two datasets and the adjacent location of the two plots the result shown in fig 5 a highlighted as the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval exhibited values intermediate with respect to those determined for the separate datasets when identical n values were considered this means that the uncertainty analysis provided for fixed values of n a similar level of uncertainty in the estimate of k s in plots characterized by different extent 44 m2 and 88 m2 furthermore in mn plot 21 sub areas were countered with fixed width of 8 m and increasing lengths from a minimum of 1 m fig 3b so to have the smaller one of 8 m2 with 32 included observations applying the uncertainty analysis fig 5b was obtained if compared with fig 4a and 4b fig 5b exhibited a similar behavior with an almost invariant trend of the uncertainty curves for sub areas larger than about 28 m2 and especially with reference to the largest sample sizes this result confirmed that beyond a threshold area the level of accuracy obtained with a specific n is almost constant due to the capability of capturing all the random variability sources naturally present in the plot therefore the uncertainty analysis results can be considered approximately plot area invariant for a range of plot extents above a threshold area that guarantees to include all the possible random sources of ks variability in this investigation the threshold values of 14 m2 and 28 m2 found for the m and n plots and the mn plot respectively were linked by a common sub area length of 3 5 m see also fig 3 the length of the sub area was the main element determining the threshold value in this study 3 2 3 temporal variability in order to check if the results of the uncertainty analysis performed in a specific plot can be considered time independent the following step was to apply the non parametric bootstrap method to the m ii dataset collected with the same spatial resolution 4 measurements m2 and with the same device cylinder inner diameter equal to 0 15 m but 9 months later development of the first dataset for the same plot the results of this investigation were reported in fig 2 table 3 and fig 4a and 4c from the comparison between the m i and m ii datasets it was clear that the second one exhibited a greater level of uncertainty for fixed extent and n table 3 and fig 2 for example the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval increased in time from 0 6 to 1 3 for an area of 6 m2 and n 10 and from 2 to 3 1 for an area of 44 m2 and n 10 these appreciably different findings probably derived from the modified statistical characteristics of the datasets collected in the plot m in the two different sampling dates as clearly highlighted by the values of geometric mean and coefficient of variation reported in table 2 as an example the geometric mean of ks measurements performed in plot m during the second campaign was more than halved with respect to that of previous sampling consequently the results of the uncertainty analysis are not valid when soil hydraulic properties change in time their spatial structure and magnitude from the analysis of fig 4c it can again be detected that the confidence of k s estimate is invariant with sub area extension above the same area threshold value 14 18 m2 detected on the same plot during the first sampling campaign this means that the aforementioned threshold is a time invariant characteristic 3 2 4 support area to investigate how the support area affects the statistical dataset characteristics and consequently the results of the uncertainty analysis the non parametric bootstrap method was applied to the n ii dataset recorded through the same sfh technique but using a ring with a larger diameter 0 30 m than that used for the other sampling campaign 0 15 m in this context fig 2 highlighted that doubling the diameter of the device changed completely the outcomes in particular the uncertainty decreased significantly not only with respect to n i dataset that was expected for soil modifications due to the time lapse between the two campaigns but also with respect to m ii dataset simultaneously monitored as shown in table 2 the two datasets of the second sampling date exhibited completely different statistics and this can mainly be ascribed to the different support area table 3 and fig 4b and 4d provided clear evidence that the uncertainty of k s derived from the n ii dataset was very low with values of 0 5 0 9 for the examined interval of n 6 24 sub area 6 44 m2 and a complete invariance with respect to the extent for fixed n according to these results using a larger test support area is recommended in the light to increase the confidence on the mean ks calculations in agreement with other investigations suggesting that large rings should be used when soil spatial variability is high lai and ren 2007 3 2 5 spatial resolution all the afore described outcomes derived from uncertainty analysis application to datasets characterized by a specific and constant spatial resolution of measurements 4 measurements m2 with a spacing of 0 5 m the last effort was directed to check if this property of the original datasets had a role in defining the confidence levels of k s to this aim the uncertainty analysis was applied to two mn i sub datasets extracted from the original one of 352 measurements so that the measurement densities were equal to 1 measurement per square meter total number of measurements 88 and 0 5 measurement per square meter total number of measurements 44 respectively as it can be seen from table 4 and fig 6 a decrease of dataset spatial resolution determined an increase of the uncertainty for selected n and extent however this effect appeared to become negligible when larger sub areas and greater n were considered so that the results previously described can be considered reliable independently of the spatial resolution of the performed measurements at least in the density range investigated 3 2 6 planning monitoring campaigns an additional tool useful in planning monitoring campaigns consists of plotting the reduction of the non normalized 95 confidence interval width against the number of performed measurements the reduction is determined as the difference between the interval width related to n and n 1 measurements fig 7 shows this plot obtained for m i mn i and n ii datasets for n i and m ii datasets trends very similar to fig 7a were obtained and are not included as expected the reduction of confidence interval width decreased in absolute value with increasing n in all cases up to an asymptotic zero value this result can be useful to select the number of measurements over which the benefit produced by an additional measurement does not justify the cost of performing it what can be deduced from fig 7 is that in all datasets collected with an inner diameter of 0 15 m about 20 measurements represent the limit value of a tradeoff between cost and benefit in the case of the n ii dataset obtained with an inner diameter of 0 30 m this number decreases to 10 15 as expected by the lower uncertainty range previously described 4 discussion the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity is generally spatially and temporally variable e g prieksat et al 1994 logsdon and jaynes 1996 warrick 1998 variations can be particularly noticeable for clay soils with coefficients of variations of even several hundreds percent lee et al 1985 bagarello et al 1999 and means varying by even orders of magnitude seasonally messing and jarvis 1990 jabro 1996 bagarello and sgroi 2004 but also within hours favre et al 1997 however saturated hydraulic conductivity of a clay soil can also remain nearly stable in time when the clay minerals are non swelling and or roots stabilize the soil peds and aggregates reynolds and zebchuk 1996 this large variety of situations implies that an appropriate characterization of a clay soil requires an intensive sampling both in space and in time with considerable experimental efforts in this context establishing the confidence that can be attributed to any estimate of the mean ks value can become very challenging and perhaps even prohibitive since uncertainty analyses should be repeated both in space and time the analysis performed in this investigation attempted to give some useful indications on the strategies that could be applied in the perspective to obtain reliable mean saturated soil hydraulic conductivity values with the lowest number of samples picciafuoco et al 2019 according to this investigation checking the stability of the summary parameters of the ks distribution could be enough to plan the required experimental efforts for characterizing a clay soil the uncertainty analysis performed on a given plot and a particular sampling date remains valid for a nearby plot or another sampling date if the summary parameters of ks do not vary or at least they vary only a little table 2 and fig 2 this result indicating that the uncertainty analysis could be unnecessary in some cases makes a detailed description of the soil hydrodynamic behavior simpler without any loss of information of course a possible concern about this suggestion is that an intensive soil sampling remains necessary in any case representing the starting point to later conclude that sampling intensively the soil was not strictly necessary this is a general way to proceed in this kind of investigations for example vieira et al 1981 had the need to collect 1280 samples to verify that nearly the same information could be obtained with 128 samples however this investigation also suggested that sampling strategies could be adapted in an attempt to reduce experimental efforts in the field in particular for a given extent the greater the number of measurements the greater the confidence on the estimated mean of ks as expected fig 4 however the normalized uncertainty corresponding to a given number of measurements does not change with the extent above a threshold area fig 4a b and this extent invariance also seems time invariant fig 4a c therefore the width of the normalized confidence interval determined on a small area greater than a threshold is also representative for a larger area probably because a relatively small plot contains all the variability that can be found in a larger plot picciafuoco et al 2019 if the sampled area is large using a large number of measurements per unit area could not be advantageous since the width of the normalized confidence interval does not vary with the data spatial resolution fig 6 in practice the total number of measurements is more important than the closeness between measurements if instead the objective is to establish the width of the normalized confidence interval for a small area then the suggestion should be using an information with a high spatial resolution because otherwise the risk is to obtain a higher uncertainty fig 6 the effect of the number of measurements on the behavior of the confidence interval width reduction appears similar for different plots extents and sampling dates fig 7 therefore the relationship between width reduction and number of measurements determined once does not need to be repeated since it seems to have a general validity at least for the sampled site moreover this result supports the existence in the literature of a few general suggestions about an appropriate sample size for plot scale determination of a representative mean saturated conductivity value since the indication of this study was not far from that given by reynolds et al 2002 summarizing these arguments with reference to an area of interest one could work on a portion of this area possibly realizing a locally intensive soil sampling to establish an appropriate number of measurements to obtain a certain accuracy level ahmed et al 2015 picciafuoco et al 2019 the expectation is that this accuracy level remains nearly unchanged if the same number of measurements are performed on a larger area if a larger plot with homogeneous soil type and conditions has to be sampled an equally intensive sampling could not be necessary since more experimental work does not induce an appreciable decrease of the confidence interval with a larger support area 0 30 m rings a threshold area in the relationship between the width of the normalized confidence interval and the plot area is no more detectable fig 4d which suggests that a sampling performed on even a small portion of the plot is representative in terms of expected normalized confidence of the entire plot under homogeneous soil type and conditions moreover the dependence of the normalized confidence interval on the number of measurements decreases and this confidence steadily settles on smaller values in the passage from a small to a large ring probably these results are a consequence of the smaller relative variability of the ks data collected with the larger ring table 2 which is well documented in the literature e g young 1987 lai and ren 2007 although an opposite trend could also be detected occasionally bagarello et al 2012 khodaverdiloo et al 2017 with reference to the ks datasets used in this investigation bagarello et al 2013 suggested that a plausible explanation of the detected ring size effect was that the probability not to sample a representative elementary volume lauren et al 1988 vepraskas and williams 1995 was higher with the small ring than the large one according to this investigation a large ring a small sampled area and a relatively small number of measurements yield a normalized confidence that can be transferred to larger areas and also at least to some extent to different numbers of measurements in summary a few measurements with a large ring are better than many measurements with a small ring 5 conclusions according to this investigation a way to characterize an area of interest with a single ks value could be applying an uncertainty analysis for determining the lowest number of required measurements yielding a mean ks value with a pre established accuracy level therefore the expected reliability of the mean should be fixed in advance instead of the number of measurements as more common looking at the problem from this perspective is unavoidably challenging from an experimental point of view since in principle a robust uncertainty analysis requires working with rather large datasets to later perhaps conclude that they were too large to obtain a representative ks value however a conclusion of this investigation was that very large datasets are not always necessary to perform a reliable uncertainty analysis performing an intensive soil sampling on only a portion of an area of interest should be enough to establish the required number of measurements yielding a certain accuracy level for the entire area since the expectation is that this accuracy level remains nearly constant even if the same number of measurements is carried out on a larger area if a larger plot has to be sampled an intensive sampling could not be necessary since more experimental work above a threshold does not induce an appreciable decrease of the confidence interval of the mean ks values however another conclusion of this investigation was that a large support area for each individual measurement has to be recommended in general since in this case sampling small areas and performing a relatively small number of measurements can be enough to obtain a normalized confidence interval of the mean of ks that can be transferred to larger areas and also at least to some extent to different sample sizes the results of this investigation were representative of a nearly undisturbed soil condition but the surface soil characteristics could differ in a condition of greater propensity of the soil to runoff formation therefore the uncertainty analysis should also be repeated in this condition soil disturbance favoring runoff occurrence is expected to induce a structure homogenization in many instances which could make the uncertainty analysis performed on the undisturbed soil indicative of the highest uncertainty that can be expected in general however this suggestion needs experimental testing in future research in addition other uncertainty analyses should be performed on other soils and also on larger areas since a limit of this investigation was that all data were collected on small plots of 44 m2 characterizing these plots with a reliable mean ks value requires about 20 measurements with the rings of 0 15 m but about half data could be enough if the larger ring is used of course the results of this investigation were specific for the sampled site and perhaps for the applied data analysis methodology notwithstanding this the results should be of rather general interest since this investigation represents one of the few investigations making use of multiple large datasets and also because to the best of our knowledge some issues such as the link between ring size and the performed uncertainty analysis were investigated for the first time moreover the circumstance that other investigations corroborated some of the results obtained here induces us to suggest that our results could have a larger relevance than exclusively the local one credit
