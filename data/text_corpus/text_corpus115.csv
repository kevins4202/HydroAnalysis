575,anomalous diffusion can be multiple dimensional and space dependent in large scale natural media with evolving nonstationary heterogeneity whose quantification requires an efficient technique this research paper develops evaluates and applies variable order vector spatial fractional derivative equation fde models with a kansa solver to capture spatiotemporal variation of super diffusion along arbitrary angles i e preferential pathways in complex geological media the kansa approach is superior to the traditional eulerian solvers in solving the vector fde models because it is meshless and can be conveniently extended to multi dimensional transport processes numerical experiments show that the shape parameter one critical parameter used in the kansa solver significantly affects the accuracy and convergence of the numerical solutions in addition the collocation nodes need to be assigned uniformly in the model domain to improve the numerical accuracy real world applications also test the feasibility of this novel technique hence the variable order vector fde model and the kansa numerical solver developed in this study can provide a convenient tool to quantify complex anomalous transport in multi dimensional and non stationary media with continuously or abruptly changing heterogeneity filling the knowledge gap in parsimonious non local transport models developed in the last decades keywords heterogeneity kansa method numerical accuracy shape parameter variable order space fde 1 introduction fractional derivative equation fde models which were built upon the promising fractional calculus miller and ross 1993 metzler and klafter 2000 have been developed for two decades to quantify anomalous or non fickian transport in heterogeneous media within and across scales see the extensive review of fdes by zhang et al 2009 2017 most of the applications of fdes were limited to one dimensional transport processes as extensively reviewed and compared with the other time nonlocal transport models by lu et al 2018 while real world transport can be multi dimensional with direction dependent spreading rates zhang and benson 2008 efficient numerical approximation of the vector fde however has been proved to be a difficult issue meerschaert and mortenson 2004 pang et al 2013 in addition anomalous diffusion in natural media can be space and or time dependent sun et al 2014 wang et al 2017 similar to the sub basin dependent rainfall runoff processes in watershed modeling srinivasan and arnold 1994 knebl et al 2005 whose quantification requires an efficient technique developing efficient solvers for vector fdes motivated this study the same challenges persisted for most stochastic hydrologic models developed in the last three decades as commented recently by hydrologists cirpka and valocchi 2016 fiori et al 2016 fogg and zhang 2016 rajaram 2016 sanchez vila and fernandez garcia 2016 nonlocal transport models are upscaling stochastic models whose index is the average over a region and or time for example the change of boundary conditions in regional scale aquifers can change the vertical hydraulic gradient and the overall pattern of the velocity field which may change the anomalous dynamics and therefore requires a variable such as transient index for the nonlocal transport models fogg and zhang 2016 in addition zonal effect for solute transport in non stationary aquifers may require a space dependent index in the spatial nonlocal transport models zhang et al 2017 examples of the zonal effect of solute transport may also include the well known natural gradient field tracer test sites including the borden cape cod and made sites mackay et al 1986 leblanc et al 1991 boggs et al 1992 as discussed by fogg and zhang 2016 both the borden and cape cod experiments were run mainly in the very homogeneous glacio fluvial outwash sands and the made plume was mainly in a quaternary fluvial sand gravel deposit the made plume exhibits rapid heavy tailed downstream transport with possible spatial variation of depositional structures due to the meandering river boggs et al 1992 tracer plumes at the three sites have limited sizes ranging from 20 to 300 m due to the limited monitoring period 2 years it is a logic expectation that the tracer plume at all the three field test sites would eventually experience quite different transport dynamics after it entered the adjacent deposits with significantly different hydraulic properties which may require a nonlocal transport model with a zonal dependent index fogg and zhang 2016 most of the previous nonlocal transport models however were not designed to account for the nonstationary evolution of anomalous transport zhang et al 2017 lu et al 2018 meanwhile the variable order fractional derivative model which was reviewed extensively by sun et al 2019 including the mathematical definitions of the variable order fractional derivative and the derivation of the models was found to be valid in simulating transport of contaminants through non stationary media where the order of the fractional derivative can change with time and or coordinates sun et al 2014 to address the above historical challenges this study develops the kansa approach kansa 1990 to solve the variable order vector space fractional advection dispersion equation fade model the goal is to provide the hydrologic community a viable computational tool to capture spatiotemporal variation of super diffusion along any angles i e arbitrary preferential pathways in multi dimensional geological media with evolving non stationary heterogeneity or discrete interfaces of hydrological properties as seen in typical fluvial settings zhang et al 2018 the kansa method is selected because it is inherently meshless and easy to program kansa 1990 and was found to be efficient for complex problems with varying coefficients chen et al 2010a jankowska et al 2018 this work is organized as follows section 2 introduces the general variable order fractional derivative and the variable order space fade the kansa method and the corresponding numerical schemes are then developed in section 3 the proposed numerical scheme is then verified against relatively simple cases where the analytical solution is available and the numerical accuracy and convergence rate are also investigated numerical examples and real world applications are then given in section 4 to validate the feasibility of the proposed technique including the multi dimensional anomalous transport at the made test site mississippi and one recently monitored field tracer test at tongzhou beijing china properties of the present model solver and the model parameter sensitivity are further discussed in section 5 conclusions are finally drawn in section 6 2 methodology development variable order vector model and its kansa solver 2 1 variable order space fractional advection dispersion equation fade we consider the following multi dimensional variable order fade model 1a with the general initial condition 1b and boundary condition 1c by generalizing the standard fractional derivative in the cartesian coordinate system 1a u x y t t v u x y t k d m α x y t u x y t f x y t 1b u x y t 0 u 0 x y 1c u x y t ω u b x y t where the domain x y ω α 1 α x y t 2 denotes the spatiotemporally variable index order of the fractional derivative u x y t denotes the solute concentration v and k are the flow velocity column vector and the diffusion coefficient scalar respectively and f x y t is the source sink term in this study the variable order fractional derivative with index α x y t takes the caputo type which can be defined as sun et al 2009 2 d α x y t u x d x α x y t 1 γ 2 α x y t 0 x u ξ x ξ α x y t d ξ with 1 α x y t 2 the generalized vector fractional derivative d m α 1 α 2 can be written as 3 d m α x y t u x y t 0 2 π d θ α x y t u x y t m θ d θ continuous case i d θ i α x y t u x y t m θ i d i s c r e t e c a s e where m θ and m θi denote the weight of the probability for solute particles jumping along the radial direction θ continuous meerschaert et al 1999 and θi discrete respectively pang et al 2015 note that the total weight m which is also called the measure meerschaert et al 1999 must integrate or sum to one the vector derivative reduces to the left side fractional derivative along x and y directions when θ is 0 and 2 it is noteworthy that the order of the fractional derivative can also vary with direction to capture the direction dependent scaling rates of pollutants because of the anisotropic and heterogeneous media here we consider the variable order fractional derivative along θ direction meerschaert and mortenson 2004 roop 2006 4 d θ α x y t u i θ 2 α x y t d θ 2 u where the symbol i θ 2 σ denotes the fractional integral which is given by 5 i θ σ v x y 1 γ σ 0 d x y θ ξ σ 1 v x ζ cos θ y ζ sin θ d ζ with σ 0 1 where d x y θ is the inverse distance from the internal position x y to the boundary ω along the direction of cosθ sinθ it is also noteworthy that although the fade 1a assumes that the index can change in space the historical challenge in the definition of the exact length scale for the fractional operator to be valid remains unsolved this open research question is beyond the major focus of this study as shown in introduction our motivation was due to geology where the dramatical change of depositional processes can result in spatially non stationary media which can then alter the power law asymptotic of a continuous time random walk ctrw in space the same concept of a zone dependent power law tail was also proposed by berkowitz et al 2006 for their well known ctrw framework this study will check the feasibility of the variable order fade 1a against transport observed in real world aquifers where the results may shed light on the future study of the length scale for the nonlocal fractional operator in model 1 2 2 development of the kansa approach based numerical algorithm we apply the kansa method to solve the fade model in the kansa method the numerical solution of model 1 can be written as the weighted average of the radial basis function rbf φ r chen et al 2010a 6 u x y t i 1 m n λ i t ϕ r i r i x x i 2 y y i 2 where the point xi yi represents the i th collocation node i e the node assigned by the user as a member of a collocation group when approximating the solute concentration located in the model domain m and n represent the number of inner nodes and boundary nodes respectively and ri denotes the distance in this study we adopt one efficient kansa method called the hardy s multiquadric mq which contains various rbfs franke 1982 kansa 1990 7 ϕ r i r i 2 c 2 where c denotes the shape parameter in the following of this section we develop the numerical scheme to approximate the fade 1 to illustrate the implementation of the method mentioned above we consider the following simplified variable order space fade with orthogonal dispersion along x and y directions where the vector diffusion term can be replaced with d θ 0 α x y t and d θ π 2 β x y t the fade 1 can then be written as 8 u x y t t v u x y t d α x y t u x y t x α x y t e β x y t u x y t y β x y t f x y t i n ω 0 t u x y 0 u 0 x y u x y t ω u b x y t where 1 α β 2 and d and e are fractional diffusion coefficients here v represents the column vector of water flow velocity along x and y directions and the symbol denotes the gradient operator it should be mentioned that we adopt the caputo definition in eq 8 notably for a large domain i e a regional scale aquifer with a zero concentration or gradient at the boundary the definitions of caputo and riemann liouville fractional derivatives are same pang et al 2015 in addition the one side fractional derivative was selected in this study because contaminant transport in geological media including natural soil rivers streams land slopes and aquifers may not have unlimited backward jumps large displacements of contaminant particles are usually downgradient i e forward due for example to the downstream preferential flow paths in heterogeneous geological media this was also explained by zhang et al 2009 applying the interpolation formula expressed by eq 5 model 8 can be discretized at m n collocation points 9 j 1 m n ϕ i j d d t λ j n j 1 m n d α x y t ϕ x

denote the sequence of the collocation nodes the matrix form of eq 9 can be written as 10 ϕ d δ t d α x x α x ϕ d δ t e β y x β y ϕ d v e ϕ d ϕ b λ n ϕ d 0 λ n 1 f n u b n n 2 3 t here the δt represents the time step ϕ d ϕ ij for i 1 2 m and j 1 2 m n while ϕ b ϕ ij for i m 1 m 2 m n and j 1 2 m n and ve represents the m m diagonal matrices of velocity coefficient parameter α x x α x ϕ and β y x β y ϕ are m m n matrices derived from the fractional partial derivatives of the method meanwhile it is convenient to evaluate the initial coefficient vector λ 0 by interpolation ϕ d ϕ b λ 0 u 0 the fractional derivative α x y t ϕ x α x y t can then be calculated by 11 α x y t ϕ x α x y t i j 1 γ 1 α x y t 0 x i ζ 1 α x y t 2 ϕ x x i 2 y y i 2 x 2 x x i ζ d ζ after changing variable ζ xi 1 ξ

the gauss jacobi quadrature rule written as 13 α x y t ϕ x α x y t x i 2 2 α x y t γ 2 α x y t ω k χ ξ k where χ ξ k 2 ϕ r j x 2 x x i x i 1 ξ 2 in the following we apply the generalized mq method of rbf the fractional derivative part can be written as r i j x i cos θ d x i y i θ x j 2 y i sin θ d x i y i θ y j 2 and 14 d θ α x y t ϕ i j d x i y i θ 2 2 α x y t γ 2 α x y t ω k χ ξ k to select the radial basic function φ we choose the classical definition of mq ϕ i j r i j 2 c 2 and then ϕ i j x x i x j r i j 2 c 2 χ ξ 1 r i j 2 c 2 a 2 r i j 2 c 2 3 c 0 where a x i x j 2 cos θ y i y j 2 sin θ d x i y i θ 2 1 ξ 3 verification and analysis of the kansa solver for the vector model we verify and explore properties of the meshless method proposed above using two examples with different indexes these tests are carried out using matlab r2012a in a desktop computer lenovo yangtian t4990 with intel r core tm i5 4590 cpu 3 30 ghz and ram 16 g here we apply the gauss jacobi quadrature rules with 20 quadrature points the same number of quadrature points are used for most cases unless otherwise specified 3 1 verification example 1 one dimensional case example 1 considers a one dimensional simplification of the space fractional advection diffusion equation 8 15 u x t t v u x t x k α x u x t x α x f x t x 0 1 t 0 1 1 α x 2 u 0 t e t u 1 t 2 e t u x 0 x 1 1 2 when the diffusion

long as the source term f x t changes with α x table 1 shows that the proposed method exhibits a super linear convergence rate when the index α remains constant i e α 1 6 contrarily numerical results of the variable order index model exhibit a sub linear convergence rate with a larger maximum relative error mre expanding with the range of the variable order index we then plot fig 1 to further explore the influence of model parameters and various orders on model solutions fig 1a evaluates the faster diffusive process with a smaller space fractional index this plot builds the relationship between the accuracy fig 1a and the condition number fig 1b the term nodes listed in the x axis represents the number of the collocation nodes and the condition number used in the y axis in fig 1b describes the sensitivity of errors when calculating the matrix or in other words the condition number measures how much the output value can change for a small change in the input a high condition number means that the matrix is ill conditioned fig 1a shows that the selection of the shape parameter can have a significant impact on the accuracy and convergence rate of the kansa method which will be discussed further in section 5 2 combing fig 1a and fig 1b we find that when the condition number is larger than 2 106 the increase of the collocation node number can no longer significantly improve the solution accuracy or convergence rate 3 2 verification example 2 optimize modes of node distributions on two dimension we then consider the following two dimensional fractional dispersion with variable order indexes in a rectangular domain 16 u x t t k x α x y u x y t x α x y k y β x y u x y t y β x y f x y t x y ω t 0 1 1 α x y β x y 2 ω 0 1 2 u x y 0 x 1 1 2 y 1 1 2 u 0 y t y 1 1 2 e

term f x y t x 1 0 5 y 1 0 5 γ 1 5 γ 1 5 α x y x 1 0 5 α x y y 1 0 5 γ 1 5 2γ 1 5 β x x 1 0 5 y 1 0 5 β x y e t the corresponding analytical solution for this problem is u x t x 1 1 2 y 1 1 2 e t which is valid for a variable β x y we solve eq 16 in the rectangular domain ω 0 1 2 although the rbf method does not require any specific mesh distribution modes for the collocation nodes here we examine the possible effects of the collocation distribution mode on the accuracy of numerical results four modes are selected for the node distributions sun et al 2017 a irregular mode derived by jiggling the uniform nodes i e assigning a perturbation on the originally uniform nodes along x and y directions b latin hypercube sampling mode which is an improved algorithm for node random distribution see helton and davis 2003 c random nodes d regular modes with uniform distributions in space the relative density and error distributions for the above four modes are depicted in fig 2 the plots i iv in fig 2 show the relative density distribution for different modes all the four node distribution modes produce reasonably well numerical solutions for model 16 since all the relative errors are below 1 10 2 the red region shown in fig 2 which represents the area with the largest relative error is relatively large for the random distribution mode fig 2c and the latin hypercube sampling mode fig 2b note that fig 2b has the largest relative error 4 5 10 3 the uniform mode fig 2a and the jiggling mode fig 2d have the similar area for the largest relative error distribution 4 applications superdiffusion can be space dependent due to the local variation of aquifer properties for example the scaling rate or the displacement strength can be enhanced when groundwater flow becomes more channelized along the solute particle trajectory or decreased when the surrounding abundant low permeable deposits separate or change the direction of groundwater flow depending on the plume position and architecture of the medium zhang et al 2017 this section applies the fde model and the kansa solver developed above to simulate multi dimensional anomalous diffusion in either composite or real world nonstationary media first we evaluate solute transport dynamics driven by a continuous varying β in section 4 1 we then explore the impacts of the discrete interface of the fractional order β on plume transport in two dimensional domains in sections 4 2 and 4 3 abrupt change of transport properties for pollutants in subsurface may be caused by spatial change of deposits such as the interface between coarse sand and clay which is common in fluvial depositional settings where the high permeability ancient channel deposits are surrounded by the typically abundant low permeability floodplain deposits fogg et al 2000 feasibility of the vector fde model and its kansa solver will be checked against field tracer transport experiments in sections 4 4 and 4 5 4 1 super diffusion with a continuous index this example considers a two dimensional space fde with an initial point source 17 u x y t t k 1 β x y t u x y t r θ π 4 β x y t k 2 β x y u x y t r θ 7 π 4 β x y x y ω 0 40 0 40 r x 12 2 y 20 2 u 0 y t 0 u 40 y t 0 u x 0 t 0 u x 40 t 0 u x y 0 10 r 0 1 if 3 r 0 0 otherwise where k 1 and k 2 are the diffusion coefficients along the direction θ 1 π 4 and θ 2 7π 4 respectively note that dispersion of solutes in natural media may not be limited to be orthogonal since for example the fracture orientation can cause solute transport along various directions in discrete fracture networks reeves et al 2008 here we consider two arbitrary angles θ 1 and θ 2 with direction dependent spreading rates we consider three types of fractional order β constant varying in time and varying in space to capture variations of the internal structure properties and or hydraulic conditions of the heterogeneous media following the conclusion in section 3 2 here the uniform collocation approach with a total of 6241 nodes is used to solve the vector model 17 numerical results are shown in fig 3 we first use fig 3a and b to evaluate the influence of the time dependent fractional order β on solute transport the faster decline rate of β in time can produce a stronger super diffusive plume front as expected since the smaller index β represents stronger super diffusion with a higher probability for large diffusive jumps fig 3c and d show the impacts of the space dependent fractional order β on transport fig 3c shows that the contaminant plume moves relatively faster at the location where the fractional order is smaller fig 3d shows that the contaminant transports faster on top position due to the lower variable order β β 1 8 0 003 x y at the right top region an impact of regional dependent super diffusion 4 2 super diffusion in a composition medium with four sub regions we consider a 2 d composite medium with four sub domains fig 4 all solute particles are initially located in a small circle centered at 12 20 the plume expands in space and reaches the discrete interface of β if the order β on the other side of the interface is relatively smaller representing a stronger super diffusion the solute particles crossing the interface tend to expand to a wider domain on the other side and the particles remaining in the original sub domain tend to accumulate around the interface therefore the sub region with a relatively smaller β can amplify the spatial distribution of solutes by accelerating the motion of solute particles while the sub region with a larger β tends to constrain and compress the plume near the interface 4 3 super diffusion across a high permeability lenses we consider a sandwich structure where the middle part representing a high permeability lens allows stronger super diffusion fig 5 results show that the transport behavior is the same as that observed above i e the plume tends to expand if the index β decreases and shrink if β increases 4 4 super diffusion at the made site mississippi the macrodispersion experiment made was conducted from 1986 to 1997 at the columbus air force base mississippi using multiple tracers including tritium to explore the scale dependent dispersion under natural gradient flow conditions boggs et al 1992 rehfeldt et al 1992 the made site deposits contain mainly a range of unconsolidated and interconnected sand and gravel grain surrounded by thin clay lenses resulting in a high variance of the logarithm hydrologic conductivity 4 5 6 6 rehfeldt et al 1992 the spatial variation of hydrofacies along the travel path of tritium may cause the scale dependent anomalous dispersion for the tracer which was injected into the channel sand as a point source and then encountered the other hydrofacies downstream fogg and zhang 2016 as well as the spatial variation of the overall anomalous dynamics at locations where the average hydrological property structure changes dramatically i e from channel to riverbank or from channel to point bar in a meandering river the observed plume snapshots which are less than 300 m along the longitudinal direction fig 6 show clearly the change of plume shape i e radiation downstream which cannot be reliably captured by the vector fde with constant parameters zhang and benson 2008 we apply the following vector fde model to simulate the observed tritium plumes 18 u x y t t 0 2 u x y t x 0 2 β u x y t r θ β x y ω 0 400 0 100 r x 18 2 y 50 2 u 0 y t 0 u 400 y t y 0 u x 0 t x 0 u x 100 t x 0 u x y 0 10 i f 8 r 0 0 o t h e r

pattern of the plume evolution in this highly heterogeneous alluvial aquifer with a possible piecewise structure it is noteworthy that the motion of the plume center with the highest concentration is enhanced by model 18 see fig 6c and d this discrepancy is due to the fact that model 18 ignores solute mass exchange between the mobile zone and the relatively immobile domains in a future study we will add the temporal fractional derivative term in model 18 to account for the retention of the plume 4 5 super diffusion at the tongzhou site beijing china sodium bromide was injected into groundwater through an injection well and the following plume was monitored with a well cluster at an alluvial aquifer located at tongzhou district beijing china to explore the impact of subsurface heterogeneity on conservative tracer transport by zheng et al 2015 the tongzhou site deposits are composed of a wide range of sand very coarse to fine sand and gravel with an average thickness of 10 m surrounded by i e overlying and underlying clay layers with the thickness varying from 5 to 10 m the sand gravel hydrofacies have an average hydraulic conductivity k 20 40 m d as shown by the pumping test and the estimated k for the clay is 0 002 m d detailed geological and hydrogeological conditions for this study site can be found in zheng et al 2015 the observed bromide plumes such as the one depicted in fig 7 exhibit strong channeling and spatial variation motivating the application of the vector fde with variable indexes we adopt the following fde model to simulate the plumes for the tongzhou site 19 u x z t t d 1 1 97 u x z t x 1 97 d 2 α u x z t r θ α d 3 1 9 u x z t r π 4 1 9 x z ω 0 50 20 40 r x 9 2 z 9 2 u 0 z t z 0 u 40 z t z 0 u x 0 t x 0 u x 40 t x 0 u x z 0 1 r 0 1 if 2 r

day 34 fig 7 shows that the fde model 19 can capture the overall pattern of the plume evolution at the tongzhou site especially the direction dependent super diffusive spreading which cannot be efficiently captured by a space nonlocal transport model with constant parameters 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of the kansa numerical approach the kansa numerical approach developed in this study is superior to the traditional eulerian approaches in solving the space fde models due to two reasons first the kansa approach is a global meshless method and it is more efficient than the classical numerical approach in handling a dense matrix when solving the spatial fdes this is because compared to the classical approach the kansa approach captures better the global correlation and can easily generate the spatial nodes without tedious prior implementation the nodes generated by the kansa approach can also change more conveniently with the boundary than those generated by the classical numerical approach second applicability of the kansa approach does not depend on the dimension of the model chen et al 2010a 2010b pang et al 2015 and hence it can be expanded conveniently to multi dimensional models and processes 5 2 sensitivity of model parameters to numerical solutions first the shape parameter c plays an important role in affecting the numerical accuracy and convergence rate of the kansa solutions which is consistent with the finding in sun et al 2017 as depicted in fig 1a a relatively larger shape parameter leads to a better solution i e a smaller mre after c is selected the increase of the node number can improve accuracy of the numerical solutions probably due to the better approximation using eq 5 with more weighting points and the mre reaches stable faster representing a faster convergence rate if the fixed c is larger fig 1a second numerical experiments imply that there might be a threshold of the condition number affecting the mre as shown by the horizontal dashed line in fig 1b when the condition number increases to a value around 2 106 the mre reaches its asymptote for all shape parameters see fig 1a and no longer decreases with the increasing node number therefore the condition number is the major parameter constraining the upper limit of the mre which represents the accuracy of the numerical solution third the distribution mode of nodes has a complicated impact on numerical solutions as shown by example 2 and fig 2 the random distribution mode generates the largest area with high relative errors for numerical solutions this might be due to the clusters of nodes produced by the random distribution mode resulting in ill posed conditions hence the regularly distributed nodes are recommended for the kansa method note that the numerical scheme of the variable order fde differs from that for the constant order fde as listed in table 1 the variable order fde requires more distributed nodes than the constant order fde to reliably capture the spatial variation of the fractional index and its strong impact on the super diffusive dynamics of pollutants 5 3 capturing pollutant transport in non stationary geological media the zonal delineation of non fickian transport which separates the study area into sub domains and then quantify the sub domain dependent transport dynamics is an interesting concept in subsurface hydrology zhang et al 2017 in surface hydrology this concept is also attractive since a large complex watershed can typically be separated into sub basins each of which exhibiting distinct hydrological properties and surface runoff infiltration kinetics the variable order fde model and the kansa numerical solver developed in this study provide an applicable tool to capture complex non fickian transport of pollutants in non stationary geological media or depositional systems with abrupt spatial change of hydrological properties the variable order fde may conveniently capture the spatial variation of plume spreading rates due to the variation of media properties either evolving smoothly or changing abruptly in space the approach developed in this study can also characterize the temporal variation of non fickian transport which can expand the concept of transient diffusion meaning that the pre asymptotic transport has a time dependent anomalous dynamics proposed by meerschaert et al 2008 6 conclusion this research paper develops a kansa approach to approximate the variable order space fractional derivative model to capture multi dimensional non fickian transport of pollutants in complex media with potentially evolving heterogeneity this model can capture spatiotemporal variation of super diffusive spreading rates along any direction proving the flexibility in modeling complicated plumes in nature three major conclusions are drawn regarding properties of this novel technique first the kansa approach is superior to the traditional finite element or difference method meerschaert and tadjeran 2006 jia and wang 2015 in solving the space vector fde models because it is a meshless solver and it does not depend on the dimension of the model or process second numerical experiments show that the shape parameter significantly affects the accuracy and convergence of the numerical solutions and the computational nodes can distribute regularly inside the model domain to improve the accuracy of the numerical solutions third the variable order fde model and the kansa numerical solver developed in this study may provide a convenient tool to quantify anomalous transport in non stationary media with either smoothly or abruptly changing heterogeneity field applications show that the new technique can efficiently capture the overall pattern of the complex plume distribution in the made and tongzhou test sites more real world applications with longer sampling cycles are needed to further test the feasibility of this technique for regional scale

575,anomalous diffusion can be multiple dimensional and space dependent in large scale natural media with evolving nonstationary heterogeneity whose quantification requires an efficient technique this research paper develops evaluates and applies variable order vector spatial fractional derivative equation fde models with a kansa solver to capture spatiotemporal variation of super diffusion along arbitrary angles i e preferential pathways in complex geological media the kansa approach is superior to the traditional eulerian solvers in solving the vector fde models because it is meshless and can be conveniently extended to multi dimensional transport processes numerical experiments show that the shape parameter one critical parameter used in the kansa solver significantly affects the accuracy and convergence of the numerical solutions in addition the collocation nodes need to be assigned uniformly in the model domain to improve the numerical accuracy real world applications also test the feasibility of this novel technique hence the variable order vector fde model and the kansa numerical solver developed in this study can provide a convenient tool to quantify complex anomalous transport in multi dimensional and non stationary media with continuously or abruptly changing heterogeneity filling the knowledge gap in parsimonious non local transport models developed in the last decades keywords heterogeneity kansa method numerical accuracy shape parameter variable order space fde 1 introduction fractional derivative equation fde models which were built upon the promising fractional calculus miller and ross 1993 metzler and klafter 2000 have been developed for two decades to quantify anomalous or non fickian transport in heterogeneous media within and across scales see the extensive review of fdes by zhang et al 2009 2017 most of the applications of fdes were limited to one dimensional transport processes as extensively reviewed and compared with the other time nonlocal transport models by lu et al 2018 while real world transport can be multi dimensional with direction dependent spreading rates zhang and benson 2008 efficient numerical approximation of the vector fde however has been proved to be a difficult issue meerschaert and mortenson 2004 pang et al 2013 in addition anomalous diffusion in natural media can be space and or time dependent sun et al 2014 wang et al 2017 similar to the sub basin dependent rainfall runoff processes in watershed modeling srinivasan and arnold 1994 knebl et al 2005 whose quantification requires an efficient technique developing efficient solvers for vector fdes motivated this study the same challenges persisted for most stochastic hydrologic models developed in the last three decades as commented recently by hydrologists cirpka and valocchi 2016 fiori et al 2016 fogg and zhang 2016 rajaram 2016 sanchez vila and fernandez garcia 2016 nonlocal transport models are upscaling stochastic models whose index is the average over a region and or time for example the change of boundary conditions in regional scale aquifers can change the vertical hydraulic gradient and the overall pattern of the velocity field which may change the anomalous dynamics and therefore requires a variable such as transient index for the nonlocal transport models fogg and zhang 2016 in addition zonal effect for solute transport in non stationary aquifers may require a space dependent index in the spatial nonlocal transport models zhang et al 2017 examples of the zonal effect of solute transport may also include the well known natural gradient field tracer test sites including the borden cape cod and made sites mackay et al 1986 leblanc et al 1991 boggs et al 1992 as discussed by fogg and zhang 2016 both the borden and cape cod experiments were run mainly in the very homogeneous glacio fluvial outwash sands and the made plume was mainly in a quaternary fluvial sand gravel deposit the made plume exhibits rapid heavy tailed downstream transport with possible spatial variation of depositional structures due to the meandering river boggs et al 1992 tracer plumes at the three sites have limited sizes ranging from 20 to 300 m due to the limited monitoring period 2 years it is a logic expectation that the tracer plume at all the three field test sites would eventually experience quite different transport dynamics after it entered the adjacent deposits with significantly different hydraulic properties which may require a nonlocal transport model with a zonal dependent index fogg and zhang 2016 most of the previous nonlocal transport models however were not designed to account for the nonstationary evolution of anomalous transport zhang et al 2017 lu et al 2018 meanwhile the variable order fractional derivative model which was reviewed extensively by sun et al 2019 including the mathematical definitions of the variable order fractional derivative and the derivation of the models was found to be valid in simulating transport of contaminants through non stationary media where the order of the fractional derivative can change with time and or coordinates sun et al 2014 to address the above historical challenges this study develops the kansa approach kansa 1990 to solve the variable order vector space fractional advection dispersion equation fade model the goal is to provide the hydrologic community a viable computational tool to capture spatiotemporal variation of super diffusion along any angles i e arbitrary preferential pathways in multi dimensional geological media with evolving non stationary heterogeneity or discrete interfaces of hydrological properties as seen in typical fluvial settings zhang et al 2018 the kansa method is selected because it is inherently meshless and easy to program kansa 1990 and was found to be efficient for complex problems with varying coefficients chen et al 2010a jankowska et al 2018 this work is organized as follows section 2 introduces the general variable order fractional derivative and the variable order space fade the kansa method and the corresponding numerical schemes are then developed in section 3 the proposed numerical scheme is then verified against relatively simple cases where the analytical solution is available and the numerical accuracy and convergence rate are also investigated numerical examples and real world applications are then given in section 4 to validate the feasibility of the proposed technique including the multi dimensional anomalous transport at the made test site mississippi and one recently monitored field tracer test at tongzhou beijing china properties of the present model solver and the model parameter sensitivity are further discussed in section 5 conclusions are finally drawn in section 6 2 methodology development variable order vector model and its kansa solver 2 1 variable order space fractional advection dispersion equation fade we consider the following multi dimensional variable order fade model 1a with the general initial condition 1b and boundary condition 1c by generalizing the standard fractional derivative in the cartesian coordinate system 1a u x y t t v u x y t k d m α x y t u x y t f x y t 1b u x y t 0 u 0 x y 1c u x y t ω u b x y t where the domain x y ω α 1 α x y t 2 denotes the spatiotemporally variable index order of the fractional derivative u x y t denotes the solute concentration v and k are the flow velocity column vector and the diffusion coefficient scalar respectively and f x y t is the source sink term in this study the variable order fractional derivative with index α x y t takes the caputo type which can be defined as sun et al 2009 2 d α x y t u x d x α x y t 1 γ 2 α x y t 0 x u ξ x ξ α x y t d ξ with 1 α x y t 2 the generalized vector fractional derivative d m α 1 α 2 can be written as 3 d m α x y t u x y t 0 2 π d θ α x y t u x y t m θ d θ continuous case i d θ i α x y t u x y t m θ i d i s c r e t e c a s e where m θ and m θi denote the weight of the probability for solute particles jumping along the radial direction θ continuous meerschaert et al 1999 and θi discrete respectively pang et al 2015 note that the total weight m which is also called the measure meerschaert et al 1999 must integrate or sum to one the vector derivative reduces to the left side fractional derivative along x and y directions when θ is 0 and 2 it is noteworthy that the order of the fractional derivative can also vary with direction to capture the direction dependent scaling rates of pollutants because of the anisotropic and heterogeneous media here we consider the variable order fractional derivative along θ direction meerschaert and mortenson 2004 roop 2006 4 d θ α x y t u i θ 2 α x y t d θ 2 u where the symbol i θ 2 σ denotes the fractional integral which is given by 5 i θ σ v x y 1 γ σ 0 d x y θ ξ σ 1 v x ζ cos θ y ζ sin θ d ζ with σ 0 1 where d x y θ is the inverse distance from the internal position x y to the boundary ω along the direction of cosθ sinθ it is also noteworthy that although the fade 1a assumes that the index can change in space the historical challenge in the definition of the exact length scale for the fractional operator to be valid remains unsolved this open research question is beyond the major focus of this study as shown in introduction our motivation was due to geology where the dramatical change of depositional processes can result in spatially non stationary media which can then alter the power law asymptotic of a continuous time random walk ctrw in space the same concept of a zone dependent power law tail was also proposed by berkowitz et al 2006 for their well known ctrw framework this study will check the feasibility of the variable order fade 1a against transport observed in real world aquifers where the results may shed light on the future study of the length scale for the nonlocal fractional operator in model 1 2 2 development of the kansa approach based numerical algorithm we apply the kansa method to solve the fade model in the kansa method the numerical solution of model 1 can be written as the weighted average of the radial basis function rbf φ r chen et al 2010a 6 u x y t i 1 m n λ i t ϕ r i r i x x i 2 y y i 2 where the point xi yi represents the i th collocation node i e the node assigned by the user as a member of a collocation group when approximating the solute concentration located in the model domain m and n represent the number of inner nodes and boundary nodes respectively and ri denotes the distance in this study we adopt one efficient kansa method called the hardy s multiquadric mq which contains various rbfs franke 1982 kansa 1990 7 ϕ r i r i 2 c 2 where c denotes the shape parameter in the following of this section we develop the numerical scheme to approximate the fade 1 to illustrate the implementation of the method mentioned above we consider the following simplified variable order space fade with orthogonal dispersion along x and y directions where the vector diffusion term can be replaced with d θ 0 α x y t and d θ π 2 β x y t the fade 1 can then be written as 8 u x y t t v u x y t d α x y t u x y t x α x y t e β x y t u x y t y β x y t f x y t i n ω 0 t u x y 0 u 0 x y u x y t ω u b x y t where 1 α β 2 and d and e are fractional diffusion coefficients here v represents the column vector of water flow velocity along x and y directions and the symbol denotes the gradient operator it should be mentioned that we adopt the caputo definition in eq 8 notably for a large domain i e a regional scale aquifer with a zero concentration or gradient at the boundary the definitions of caputo and riemann liouville fractional derivatives are same pang et al 2015 in addition the one side fractional derivative was selected in this study because contaminant transport in geological media including natural soil rivers streams land slopes and aquifers may not have unlimited backward jumps large displacements of contaminant particles are usually downgradient i e forward due for example to the downstream preferential flow paths in heterogeneous geological media this was also explained by zhang et al 2009 applying the interpolation formula expressed by eq 5 model 8 can be discretized at m n collocation points 9 j 1 m n ϕ i j d d t λ j n j 1 m n d α x y t ϕ x

denote the sequence of the collocation nodes the matrix form of eq 9 can be written as 10 ϕ d δ t d α x x α x ϕ d δ t e β y x β y ϕ d v e ϕ d ϕ b λ n ϕ d 0 λ n 1 f n u b n n 2 3 t here the δt represents the time step ϕ d ϕ ij for i 1 2 m and j 1 2 m n while ϕ b ϕ ij for i m 1 m 2 m n and j 1 2 m n and ve represents the m m diagonal matrices of velocity coefficient parameter α x x α x ϕ and β y x β y ϕ are m m n matrices derived from the fractional partial derivatives of the method meanwhile it is convenient to evaluate the initial coefficient vector λ 0 by interpolation ϕ d ϕ b λ 0 u 0 the fractional derivative α x y t ϕ x α x y t can then be calculated by 11 α x y t ϕ x α x y t i j 1 γ 1 α x y t 0 x i ζ 1 α x y t 2 ϕ x x i 2 y y i 2 x 2 x x i ζ d ζ after changing variable ζ xi 1 ξ

the gauss jacobi quadrature rule written as 13 α x y t ϕ x α x y t x i 2 2 α x y t γ 2 α x y t ω k χ ξ k where χ ξ k 2 ϕ r j x 2 x x i x i 1 ξ 2 in the following we apply the generalized mq method of rbf the fractional derivative part can be written as r i j x i cos θ d x i y i θ x j 2 y i sin θ d x i y i θ y j 2 and 14 d θ α x y t ϕ i j d x i y i θ 2 2 α x y t γ 2 α x y t ω k χ ξ k to select the radial basic function φ we choose the classical definition of mq ϕ i j r i j 2 c 2 and then ϕ i j x x i x j r i j 2 c 2 χ ξ 1 r i j 2 c 2 a 2 r i j 2 c 2 3 c 0 where a x i x j 2 cos θ y i y j 2 sin θ d x i y i θ 2 1 ξ 3 verification and analysis of the kansa solver for the vector model we verify and explore properties of the meshless method proposed above using two examples with different indexes these tests are carried out using matlab r2012a in a desktop computer lenovo yangtian t4990 with intel r core tm i5 4590 cpu 3 30 ghz and ram 16 g here we apply the gauss jacobi quadrature rules with 20 quadrature points the same number of quadrature points are used for most cases unless otherwise specified 3 1 verification example 1 one dimensional case example 1 considers a one dimensional simplification of the space fractional advection diffusion equation 8 15 u x t t v u x t x k α x u x t x α x f x t x 0 1 t 0 1 1 α x 2 u 0 t e t u 1 t 2 e t u x 0 x 1 1 2 when the diffusion

long as the source term f x t changes with α x table 1 shows that the proposed method exhibits a super linear convergence rate when the index α remains constant i e α 1 6 contrarily numerical results of the variable order index model exhibit a sub linear convergence rate with a larger maximum relative error mre expanding with the range of the variable order index we then plot fig 1 to further explore the influence of model parameters and various orders on model solutions fig 1a evaluates the faster diffusive process with a smaller space fractional index this plot builds the relationship between the accuracy fig 1a and the condition number fig 1b the term nodes listed in the x axis represents the number of the collocation nodes and the condition number used in the y axis in fig 1b describes the sensitivity of errors when calculating the matrix or in other words the condition number measures how much the output value can change for a small change in the input a high condition number means that the matrix is ill conditioned fig 1a shows that the selection of the shape parameter can have a significant impact on the accuracy and convergence rate of the kansa method which will be discussed further in section 5 2 combing fig 1a and fig 1b we find that when the condition number is larger than 2 106 the increase of the collocation node number can no longer significantly improve the solution accuracy or convergence rate 3 2 verification example 2 optimize modes of node distributions on two dimension we then consider the following two dimensional fractional dispersion with variable order indexes in a rectangular domain 16 u x t t k x α x y u x y t x α x y k y β x y u x y t y β x y f x y t x y ω t 0 1 1 α x y β x y 2 ω 0 1 2 u x y 0 x 1 1 2 y 1 1 2 u 0 y t y 1 1 2 e

term f x y t x 1 0 5 y 1 0 5 γ 1 5 γ 1 5 α x y x 1 0 5 α x y y 1 0 5 γ 1 5 2γ 1 5 β x x 1 0 5 y 1 0 5 β x y e t the corresponding analytical solution for this problem is u x t x 1 1 2 y 1 1 2 e t which is valid for a variable β x y we solve eq 16 in the rectangular domain ω 0 1 2 although the rbf method does not require any specific mesh distribution modes for the collocation nodes here we examine the possible effects of the collocation distribution mode on the accuracy of numerical results four modes are selected for the node distributions sun et al 2017 a irregular mode derived by jiggling the uniform nodes i e assigning a perturbation on the originally uniform nodes along x and y directions b latin hypercube sampling mode which is an improved algorithm for node random distribution see helton and davis 2003 c random nodes d regular modes with uniform distributions in space the relative density and error distributions for the above four modes are depicted in fig 2 the plots i iv in fig 2 show the relative density distribution for different modes all the four node distribution modes produce reasonably well numerical solutions for model 16 since all the relative errors are below 1 10 2 the red region shown in fig 2 which represents the area with the largest relative error is relatively large for the random distribution mode fig 2c and the latin hypercube sampling mode fig 2b note that fig 2b has the largest relative error 4 5 10 3 the uniform mode fig 2a and the jiggling mode fig 2d have the similar area for the largest relative error distribution 4 applications superdiffusion can be space dependent due to the local variation of aquifer properties for example the scaling rate or the displacement strength can be enhanced when groundwater flow becomes more channelized along the solute particle trajectory or decreased when the surrounding abundant low permeable deposits separate or change the direction of groundwater flow depending on the plume position and architecture of the medium zhang et al 2017 this section applies the fde model and the kansa solver developed above to simulate multi dimensional anomalous diffusion in either composite or real world nonstationary media first we evaluate solute transport dynamics driven by a continuous varying β in section 4 1 we then explore the impacts of the discrete interface of the fractional order β on plume transport in two dimensional domains in sections 4 2 and 4 3 abrupt change of transport properties for pollutants in subsurface may be caused by spatial change of deposits such as the interface between coarse sand and clay which is common in fluvial depositional settings where the high permeability ancient channel deposits are surrounded by the typically abundant low permeability floodplain deposits fogg et al 2000 feasibility of the vector fde model and its kansa solver will be checked against field tracer transport experiments in sections 4 4 and 4 5 4 1 super diffusion with a continuous index this example considers a two dimensional space fde with an initial point source 17 u x y t t k 1 β x y t u x y t r θ π 4 β x y t k 2 β x y u x y t r θ 7 π 4 β x y x y ω 0 40 0 40 r x 12 2 y 20 2 u 0 y t 0 u 40 y t 0 u x 0 t 0 u x 40 t 0 u x y 0 10 r 0 1 if 3 r 0 0 otherwise where k 1 and k 2 are the diffusion coefficients along the direction θ 1 π 4 and θ 2 7π 4 respectively note that dispersion of solutes in natural media may not be limited to be orthogonal since for example the fracture orientation can cause solute transport along various directions in discrete fracture networks reeves et al 2008 here we consider two arbitrary angles θ 1 and θ 2 with direction dependent spreading rates we consider three types of fractional order β constant varying in time and varying in space to capture variations of the internal structure properties and or hydraulic conditions of the heterogeneous media following the conclusion in section 3 2 here the uniform collocation approach with a total of 6241 nodes is used to solve the vector model 17 numerical results are shown in fig 3 we first use fig 3a and b to evaluate the influence of the time dependent fractional order β on solute transport the faster decline rate of β in time can produce a stronger super diffusive plume front as expected since the smaller index β represents stronger super diffusion with a higher probability for large diffusive jumps fig 3c and d show the impacts of the space dependent fractional order β on transport fig 3c shows that the contaminant plume moves relatively faster at the location where the fractional order is smaller fig 3d shows that the contaminant transports faster on top position due to the lower variable order β β 1 8 0 003 x y at the right top region an impact of regional dependent super diffusion 4 2 super diffusion in a composition medium with four sub regions we consider a 2 d composite medium with four sub domains fig 4 all solute particles are initially located in a small circle centered at 12 20 the plume expands in space and reaches the discrete interface of β if the order β on the other side of the interface is relatively smaller representing a stronger super diffusion the solute particles crossing the interface tend to expand to a wider domain on the other side and the particles remaining in the original sub domain tend to accumulate around the interface therefore the sub region with a relatively smaller β can amplify the spatial distribution of solutes by accelerating the motion of solute particles while the sub region with a larger β tends to constrain and compress the plume near the interface 4 3 super diffusion across a high permeability lenses we consider a sandwich structure where the middle part representing a high permeability lens allows stronger super diffusion fig 5 results show that the transport behavior is the same as that observed above i e the plume tends to expand if the index β decreases and shrink if β increases 4 4 super diffusion at the made site mississippi the macrodispersion experiment made was conducted from 1986 to 1997 at the columbus air force base mississippi using multiple tracers including tritium to explore the scale dependent dispersion under natural gradient flow conditions boggs et al 1992 rehfeldt et al 1992 the made site deposits contain mainly a range of unconsolidated and interconnected sand and gravel grain surrounded by thin clay lenses resulting in a high variance of the logarithm hydrologic conductivity 4 5 6 6 rehfeldt et al 1992 the spatial variation of hydrofacies along the travel path of tritium may cause the scale dependent anomalous dispersion for the tracer which was injected into the channel sand as a point source and then encountered the other hydrofacies downstream fogg and zhang 2016 as well as the spatial variation of the overall anomalous dynamics at locations where the average hydrological property structure changes dramatically i e from channel to riverbank or from channel to point bar in a meandering river the observed plume snapshots which are less than 300 m along the longitudinal direction fig 6 show clearly the change of plume shape i e radiation downstream which cannot be reliably captured by the vector fde with constant parameters zhang and benson 2008 we apply the following vector fde model to simulate the observed tritium plumes 18 u x y t t 0 2 u x y t x 0 2 β u x y t r θ β x y ω 0 400 0 100 r x 18 2 y 50 2 u 0 y t 0 u 400 y t y 0 u x 0 t x 0 u x 100 t x 0 u x y 0 10 i f 8 r 0 0 o t h e r

pattern of the plume evolution in this highly heterogeneous alluvial aquifer with a possible piecewise structure it is noteworthy that the motion of the plume center with the highest concentration is enhanced by model 18 see fig 6c and d this discrepancy is due to the fact that model 18 ignores solute mass exchange between the mobile zone and the relatively immobile domains in a future study we will add the temporal fractional derivative term in model 18 to account for the retention of the plume 4 5 super diffusion at the tongzhou site beijing china sodium bromide was injected into groundwater through an injection well and the following plume was monitored with a well cluster at an alluvial aquifer located at tongzhou district beijing china to explore the impact of subsurface heterogeneity on conservative tracer transport by zheng et al 2015 the tongzhou site deposits are composed of a wide range of sand very coarse to fine sand and gravel with an average thickness of 10 m surrounded by i e overlying and underlying clay layers with the thickness varying from 5 to 10 m the sand gravel hydrofacies have an average hydraulic conductivity k 20 40 m d as shown by the pumping test and the estimated k for the clay is 0 002 m d detailed geological and hydrogeological conditions for this study site can be found in zheng et al 2015 the observed bromide plumes such as the one depicted in fig 7 exhibit strong channeling and spatial variation motivating the application of the vector fde with variable indexes we adopt the following fde model to simulate the plumes for the tongzhou site 19 u x z t t d 1 1 97 u x z t x 1 97 d 2 α u x z t r θ α d 3 1 9 u x z t r π 4 1 9 x z ω 0 50 20 40 r x 9 2 z 9 2 u 0 z t z 0 u 40 z t z 0 u x 0 t x 0 u x 40 t x 0 u x z 0 1 r 0 1 if 2 r

day 34 fig 7 shows that the fde model 19 can capture the overall pattern of the plume evolution at the tongzhou site especially the direction dependent super diffusive spreading which cannot be efficiently captured by a space nonlocal transport model with constant parameters 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of the kansa numerical approach the kansa numerical approach developed in this study is superior to the traditional eulerian approaches in solving the space fde models due to two reasons first the kansa approach is a global meshless method and it is more efficient than the classical numerical approach in handling a dense matrix when solving the spatial fdes this is because compared to the classical approach the kansa approach captures better the global correlation and can easily generate the spatial nodes without tedious prior implementation the nodes generated by the kansa approach can also change more conveniently with the boundary than those generated by the classical numerical approach second applicability of the kansa approach does not depend on the dimension of the model chen et al 2010a 2010b pang et al 2015 and hence it can be expanded conveniently to multi dimensional models and processes 5 2 sensitivity of model parameters to numerical solutions first the shape parameter c plays an important role in affecting the numerical accuracy and convergence rate of the kansa solutions which is consistent with the finding in sun et al 2017 as depicted in fig 1a a relatively larger shape parameter leads to a better solution i e a smaller mre after c is selected the increase of the node number can improve accuracy of the numerical solutions probably due to the better approximation using eq 5 with more weighting points and the mre reaches stable faster representing a faster convergence rate if the fixed c is larger fig 1a second numerical experiments imply that there might be a threshold of the condition number affecting the mre as shown by the horizontal dashed line in fig 1b when the condition number increases to a value around 2 106 the mre reaches its asymptote for all shape parameters see fig 1a and no longer decreases with the increasing node number therefore the condition number is the major parameter constraining the upper limit of the mre which represents the accuracy of the numerical solution third the distribution mode of nodes has a complicated impact on numerical solutions as shown by example 2 and fig 2 the random distribution mode generates the largest area with high relative errors for numerical solutions this might be due to the clusters of nodes produced by the random distribution mode resulting in ill posed conditions hence the regularly distributed nodes are recommended for the kansa method note that the numerical scheme of the variable order fde differs from that for the constant order fde as listed in table 1 the variable order fde requires more distributed nodes than the constant order fde to reliably capture the spatial variation of the fractional index and its strong impact on the super diffusive dynamics of pollutants 5 3 capturing pollutant transport in non stationary geological media the zonal delineation of non fickian transport which separates the study area into sub domains and then quantify the sub domain dependent transport dynamics is an interesting concept in subsurface hydrology zhang et al 2017 in surface hydrology this concept is also attractive since a large complex watershed can typically be separated into sub basins each of which exhibiting distinct hydrological properties and surface runoff infiltration kinetics the variable order fde model and the kansa numerical solver developed in this study provide an applicable tool to capture complex non fickian transport of pollutants in non stationary geological media or depositional systems with abrupt spatial change of hydrological properties the variable order fde may conveniently capture the spatial variation of plume spreading rates due to the variation of media properties either evolving smoothly or changing abruptly in space the approach developed in this study can also characterize the temporal variation of non fickian transport which can expand the concept of transient diffusion meaning that the pre asymptotic transport has a time dependent anomalous dynamics proposed by meerschaert et al 2008 6 conclusion this research paper develops a kansa approach to approximate the variable order space fractional derivative model to capture multi dimensional non fickian transport of pollutants in complex media with potentially evolving heterogeneity this model can capture spatiotemporal variation of super diffusive spreading rates along any direction proving the flexibility in modeling complicated plumes in nature three major conclusions are drawn regarding properties of this novel technique first the kansa approach is superior to the traditional finite element or difference method meerschaert and tadjeran 2006 jia and wang 2015 in solving the space vector fde models because it is a meshless solver and it does not depend on the dimension of the model or process second numerical experiments show that the shape parameter significantly affects the accuracy and convergence of the numerical solutions and the computational nodes can distribute regularly inside the model domain to improve the accuracy of the numerical solutions third the variable order fde model and the kansa numerical solver developed in this study may provide a convenient tool to quantify anomalous transport in non stationary media with either smoothly or abruptly changing heterogeneity field applications show that the new technique can efficiently capture the overall pattern of the complex plume distribution in the made and tongzhou test sites more real world applications with longer sampling cycles are needed to further test the feasibility of this technique for regional scale

576,clogging due to transport and accumulation of the colloids in the pore space has been recognized as one of the most significant challenges in water management research and environmental engineering this paper proposes an inversion algorithm in time lapse mode to track that complex process through the assessment of alteration in the transmissivity field produced by the injection of colloids the concept is based on a joint inversion of hydraulic head and colloidal particles concentration data acquired during the injection of colloids in the porous aquifer to reconstruct the spatial variability of the transmissivity field at different times the inversion code is deterministic and was implemented in the time lapse scheme by adding in the objective function a temporal geostatistical constraint to control changes of the hydraulic transmissivity this algorithm is linked to a forward problem that consists of the groundwater flow and transport equations which were solved numerically and jointly by considering the effect of particles deposition on the decrease of hydraulic properties as the inverse problem is deterministic and underdetermined we have opted to use the efficient adjoint state technique to derive the sensitivity matrices the approach has been successfully applied to a theoretical case in which the hydraulic head responses have been used alone and jointly to assess the evolution of the clogging impact on hydraulic transmissivity keywords clogging colloid injection colloid transport hydraulic tomography joint inversion time lapse inverse problem 1 introduction for decades the understanding of the mechanisms of colloidal particle migration in porous or fractured aquifers has aroused the interest of geoscientists especially for addressing certain issues that may affect the sustainability of the exploitation of groundwater resources such as clogging and turbidity phenomena jeong et al 2018 clogging is one of the main causes of damage to the productivity of groundwater wells by reducing the hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the wells the mobilization and then the retention of the colloidal particles may imply a costly rehabilitation operation or early abandonment of wells de zwart 2007 the turbidity of the groundwater is mainly associated with an instantaneous and highly dynamic transport of fine particles during rainfall events on the karstic catchments where the sinkholes and karstic conduits facilitate the introduction resuspension and the mobility of particles in the subsurface pronk et al 2009 recently the interest of the geoscientists has shifted to the comprehension of the role of colloidal particles in the spreading of organic and inorganic contaminants in the subsurface to address the environmental issues related to anthropogenic contamination of water resources the studies focus on the main underlying mechanisms that control the migration of particles such as the chemical nature of the colloids and interstitial water ionic strength and ph the chemical interactions between the contaminants organic or inorganic and colloids the concentration of the colloids in the soil and the water velocity that depends on the hydraulic conductivity of the soil mccarthy and mckay 2004 sen and khilar 2006 flury and qiu 2008 among these works saiers and his co authors who focused on studying the effect of colloidal particles on the transport of contaminants such as hydroxyatrazine and cesium through sand column experience saiers and hornberger 1999 cheng and saiers 2009 short et al 1988 showed that the colloidal particles rich in fe and si have a high ability to accelerate the migration of the uranium and the thorium species short et al 1988 ribeiro et al 2014 discussed the role of the colloidal particles in the e coli bacteria transfer into a karstic aquifer during rainy events abdel salam and chrysikopoulos 1995 proposed a mathematical approach to numerically simulate the transport of colloids in the fractured medium other works have treated the transfer modalities of active colloids such as the nanoscale zero valent used as cleaning agents for aquifers contaminated with chlorinated hydrocarbons mueller et al 2012 strutz et al 2016 the effectiveness of these injected active colloids strongly depends on the hydraulic conditions around the injection well and its clogging can block the operation of rehabilitation by contrast in some situations the clogging may be a positive measure to prevent leakage of contaminants persoff et al 1995 in that regard the artificial injection of colloids can be considered as an alternative to limit the spreading of pathogenic microorganisms or radioactive substances peterson 1994 iaea 2001 in general the clogging of the porous medium results from a complex combination of physical chemical and biological processes that manifests itself through a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity of the soil torkzaban et al 2015 sharma and yortsos 1987 we believe that the monitoring of this hydraulic conductivity change associated with clogging plays a key role in the design of remediation techniques in this manuscript we present and discuss the pertinence of an inversion algorithm formulated in time lapse mode to follow the spatio temporal evolutions of the clogging driven by a colloidal injection in a confined aquifer inverse algorithms have been broadly applied during the last decades in the modeling of groundwater flows and particularly to image the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity in 3d or transmissivity in 2d zimmerman et al 1998 yeh 1986 kitanidis 1996 this spatial imaging of hydraulic parameters is known as hydraulic tomography which results from the cross interpretation of a set of piezometric data collected during multiple pumping tests using an inversion algorithm soueid et al 2015 however to our knowledge this method is not yet extended to time lapse inversion by combining spatio temporal data to bring out the dynamic changes of hydraulic properties caused by clogging processes time lapse inversion scheme is commonly applied in the geophysics discipline to study the dynamic change of physical properties such as electrical conductivity and dielectric constant in the subsurface associated for instance with water infiltration salt water intrusion hermans et al 2012 salt tracer experiment johnson et al 2010 karaoulis et al 2011 jardani et al 2013 and temperature changes legaz et al 2009 in this paper we formulate a hydraulic tomography algorithm in time lapse form to image spatio temporal variations in the transmissivity field that occurred during the injection of colloids by inverting the hydraulic head data alone or jointly with the colloid concentrations these data are obtained by solving numerically and sequentially a coupled system of groundwater flow and transport equations built in a way to reproduce a temporal change in the hydraulic transmissivity of a confined aquifer via colloidal injections on several wells the hydraulic head and concentrations data recovered on virtual piezometers at different instants indirectly reflect the evolution of hydraulic conditions of the aquifer during the injections the inversion of these data relies on a deterministic and nonlinear algorithm in which the sensitivity matrices also called jacobian matrices connecting the transmissivity field considered here as unknown parameters and the numerical data are computed from the adjoint state formulations the efficiency and the limit of this algorithm are revealed by its application to theoretical cases in the first case we survey in 2d the change of transmissivity field over time using only the hydraulic head data in the time lapse inversion algorithm however in the second case we use the same data but this time the inverse formulation does not take into account the time lapse term which allows us to include in the inverse process the dynamic effect in the last case we investigate the efficiency of the combination of the hydraulic and concentration data in the monitoring of transmissivity changes 2 theoretical background in this section we introduce the equations governing the transport of colloidal particles in a heterogeneous porous media in 2d the equation system consists of the groundwater flow and transport equations solved numerically in iterative mode by using a finite element approach and considering the effects of colloids injection on the variation of the hydraulic conductivity during the transport process 2 1 colloid transport the macroscopic transport equation can be derived from mass balance of colloids over a representative element volume rev in the medium three main mechanisms control the evolution of the system including convective flow hydrodynamic dispersion and colloid suspended mass exchange through attachment and detachment processes on the fluid solid interfaces the transport in the aqueous phase hence can be described by an advection dispersion form sun et al 2001 de marsily 1986 1 c t d c v c r where c represents the colloid concentration in the aqueous phase mol m3 t is the time s d denotes the particle hydrodynamic dispersion m2 s and v is the particle velocity m s r is the colloid mass change related to the attachment and detachment mol m3 s 2 2 colloid attachment and detachment generally the variation of colloid mass is expressed in terms of attachment and detachment of particles in the pore space that have been widely formulated in the transport equation under a linear kinetic forms gruesbeck and collins 1982 civan and nguyen 2005 civan 2016 lohne et al 2010 wang and civan 2005a b the attachment is supposed proportional to the concentration of colloids in the aqueous phase as gruesbeck and collins 1982 2 r a t t a c h k d c where rattach mol m 3 s 1 is the attachment rate k d 1 s refers to the attachment coefficient which can vary in time and space and depends on the water velocity pore size and other physico chemical properties of matrix such as ph zeta potential temperature etc ikni et al 2013 civan 2016 commonly this parameter is inferred from the adjustment of experimental clogging data and the estimated values most often vary between 1 10 3 5 10 2 1 s zheng et al 2014 in the literature there are many forms to express detachment rate in function of water velocity among them gruesbeck and collins 1982 wang and civan 2005a b lohne et al 2010 3 r d e t a c h α ε v u c v u c 0 v u c where the detachment occurs only when the local fluid velocity overpasses a critical velocity uc that can vary between 0 05 to 0 1 cm s according to the experimental clogging data on a column with unconsolidated sand with grain diameters ranging from 840 to 2000 µm and suspended particles with a mean diameter of 8 0 µm gruesbeck and collins 1982 reddi et al 2000 the removal mass is proportional to the net volume occupied by the particles ε ϕ ϕ0 ϕ and ϕ0 are the instantaneous and initial porosity of the medium respectively α denotes the constant rate detachment that can be reformulated as function of ionic strength of water gruesbeck and collins 1982 wang and civan 2005a b lohne et al 2010 once the two phenomena attachment and detachment are simultaneously considered that produces 4 r r a t t a c h r d e t a c h in this study the seepage velocity in the medium is much smaller than the critical velocity thus the detachment is negligible under the influence of colloid kinetics the spatial distribution of porosity evolves in time corresponding to the attachment and detachment processes by 5 d ϕ d t m ρ s r with ρs is the solid density close to 2600 kg m3 m is the molar mass of colloids kg mol variation of local porosity results in the change of permeability in turn the change will affect the flow field behaviors such as the velocity and dynamic viscosity of the fluid phase flow field modifications hence control the transport of colloid and clogging phenomena may occur around the injection point 2 3 flow field in this study we assume that deposition of the particles in the aquifer occurs slowly and the groundwater flow is close to the steady state in a confined aquifer that is usually written as bear 1972 6a t h q 0 δ x x 0 subjected to the following boundary conditions 6b h h d a t γ d where t denotes the heterogeneous transmissivity m2 s h is the hydraulic head m q0 represents the injection source term m2 s at various well positions x 0 δ is kronecker delta assuming that the aquifer has a constant thickness b m hence 7 t b k where k m s is the hydraulic conductivity related to the intrinsic permeability k m2 by 8 k k g ρ w μ with ρw kg m3 and µ kg m s are the density and the dynamic viscosity of fluid respectively g m s2 is the gravity acceleration the intrinsic permeability is in relationship with the porosity as proposed in carman 1997 kozeny 1927 and can be rewritten as follows 9 k k 0 1 ϕ 0 2 ϕ 0 3 ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 where k0 is the initial permeability m2 ϕ0 and ϕ are initial and instantaneous porosities of the medium this analytical relationship provides a practical approach to theoretically quantify the effect of the clogging on the permeability field in the simulations however in the real field conditions the formulation may underestimate the decrease of the conductivity due to the complexity of the deposition in the pore space mays and krauss 2014 to overcome this issue some empirical equations have been suggested in which the fitting parameters are obtained using experiments yang et al 2019 vaz et al 2016 in this theoretical study the design aims to access an extreme condition when the clogging is completely reached to block the injected well the specific deposit simulated probably occupies the total pore space that may exceed 30 of the total volume at the vicinity of the injected well the dynamic viscosity of the fluid evolves proportionally to the colloid concentration and can be accessed by einstein s formula einstein 1906 10 μ μ 0 1 m ρ s c 2 5 where µ0 is initial dynamic viscosity for low concentration of the dilute suspension the first order approximation yields 11 μ μ 0 1 2 5 m ρ s c 2 4 coupled inverse problem to monitor the evolution of the clogging effect on the transmissivity field we implement a time lapse inversion code assuming that two successive transmissivity changes in time follow certain statistical characteristics expressed via a covariance function the inverse problem is an undetermined formulation and based on minimizing the following objective function 12 l h o b s h s t g 1 h o b s h s c o b s c s t w 1 c o b s c s s t δ t s t π δ s 1 s t δ t s t where hobs n 1 is the observation

unknown parameters regarded as unknown field the s t δt m 1 and s t m 1 are parameter vectors at successive time steps π δ s m m is the covariance matrix derived from a geostatistical variogram that is introduced as a priori information to constraint the evolution in time of the transmissivity field in this paper we used a gaussian variogram 13 γ x t d a x t 1 e 3 d 2 r x t 2 where a x t and r x t are the sill and range at the position x and time t respectively d is the distance to x the variation of the transmissivity neighboring the colloid injection well is the largest that corresponds to the largest sill and it is set to a maximum value ranging from 0 1 to 0 2 in this model the range r was chosen equal to 8 m at the injected well and increase to 20 m at far away locations solving the inverse problem relies on an iterative process to estimate the new step s k 1 14 s k 1 s k ξ δ s where 15 δ s j h t g 1 j h π δ s 1 1 j h t h o b s h s j c t w 1 j c π δ s 1 1 j c t c o b s c s with ξ

forward model for each perturbation δsj for each iteration thus the approach is very time consuming particularly for an underdetermined inverse problem number of unknown parameters number of data to overcome this issue we used the adjoint equations to determine the sensitivity coefficients h s and c s with the following integration sun and yeh 1990 17a h s ω log 10 t h φ 1 k f c φ 2 k c h φ 2 d ω

kronecker delta e is a tensor with components eij dil vj c xl the summation for l 1 2 is implied in this study we only focus on the determination of the transmissivity field the transport parameters such as dispersivities are assumed to be known and are reported in table 1 the set of equations is solved using the pde coefficient form in comsol and the inversion process is implemented with matlab the formulation in those softwares provides a flexible solution which could be adopted for a variety of physical problems including the advective diffusive equations the model can be also coupled with a variety of boundary conditions such as dirichlet neumann or mixed 3 numerical applications in this section we present and discuss the results of the application of the inverse protocol on theoretical cases this discussion is built around the analysis of the algorithm s ability to retrieve the time variations of hydraulic conductivity field induced during the colloidal injections before injecting the colloids in the aquifer we should identify the initial transmissivity field of the aquifer which is the starting point of the whole process for this purpose we realize a conventional sequential series of pumping tests to derive the spatial heterogeneity of this initial transmissivity field by applying a geostatistical inverse process once the initial transmissivity is determined the injections of colloids are then performed in the three wells the evolution of the field in time and space will be estimated using directly the measurement collected during injecting the colloids in one well we assume that the clogging will proceed slowly so that all the measurements are in a quasi stationary state the inverse problem will be solved first to interpret the hydraulic head data then the hydraulic head and the concentration jointly 3 1 description of the case study in this study we used a regular array of 13 wells separated with 5 m see fig 1 to cover a confined aquifer with heterogeneous transmissivity and porosity fields generated geostatistically with the mgstat software deutsch and journel 1997 the true initial fields of transmissivity and porosity used before any disturbance by the colloid injections are supposed to obey gaussian distributions with the following characteristics γt r 1 0 1 exp r 10 and γε r 0 2 1 exp r 10 respectively the study area is bordered by the wells in a square of 20 20 m discretized into 1 1 m blocks equal to 400 unknown variables where the injections of colloids are carried out later to limit the influence of the boundary conditions the computed area is of 25 times larger than the study area we consider that the effect of background gradient within the study area is negligible compared to water flow due to the injection source the initial transmissivity field is shown in the fig 2 in which the transmissivity values varies between 10 6 10 2 m2 s first we characterize the initial transmissivity field before processing the colloid injections a series of pumping tests with a rate of 15 m3 day is imposed sequentially in the 13 wells and the hydraulic head responses are numerically computed in the steady state at various wells gaussian noise with σ 2 of measured values is added to the data as a measurement error the characterization of this initial field is performed by interpreting the hydraulic responses using a geostatistical inverse algorithm in which the unknown parameters of transmissivities are constrained by a geostatistical variogram the details of this inversion solving refers to the works in kitanidis 1995 cardiff and kitanidis 2008 the inverse process starts from the mean of initial hydraulic transmissivity 10 4 m2 s regarded as a prior information the inversion result is shown in the fig 3 a obtained after 5 iterations and the comparison between the true and inverted fields is presented in fig 3b the main aspect of the heterogeneity is well mapped with a certain smoothness this estimated initial field becomes an initial input for the time lapse inversion algorithm to image the transmissivity at the next time step impacted by particle injections for this test we use three wells to sequentially inject fine particles with low concentration the first injection is carried out in the well 5 at the center of the medium during 60 days in the other wells 11 and 12 each injection lasts 40 days sequentially this alternation of injection wells is due to a significant decrease in hydraulic conditions around the wells over time preventing the continuation of injections moreover in the remediation operations the increase of the number of injected wells is an effective strategy to build broader geochemical barriers for better containment of contaminated areas the injection process is derived from the numerical resolution of the transport and groundwater flow equations with physical properties listed in table 1 then we extract the numerical measurements of the hydraulic head and colloid concentration at each well during the injection process these data will be used in the inverse algorithm to predict the evolution of the hydraulic transmissivity the inverse problem deals with a parameter vector i e s which represents an unknown and distributed transmissivity field in space containing hundreds of elements the problem is undetermined and the hydraulic data are not sufficient to arrive at a unique solution this difficulty is generally overcome by adding in the objective function the constraints and the prior information about the unknown parameters cardiff and kitanidis 2008 or by increasing the measurement data in our case we test both approaches in the first case we include in the objective function the time lapse term π δ s to control the evolution of the transmissivity field in time and space in the second we combine in the inverse process the hydraulic head and concentration the effectiveness of the additional field data is discussed later in the comparison between both results 3 2 time lapse inversion using only hydraulic head data to start the numerical investigation we inject the fine particles for 60 days in the well 5 at the center of the medium at the end of the injection process the deposition of the fines clogs the neighborhood of the injection well leading to a reduction in hydraulic conductivity in and around the well the resulting transmissivity at the clogging state is of around three orders of magnitude lower than the initial transmissivity see fig 4 the hydraulic head data collected at 13 wells resulting from these hydraulic modifications are used in the time lapse inversion algorithm to identify the zones impacted by the injection of colloids through the reconstruction of the evolution of transmissivity in time we assume that the hydraulic measurements evolve slowly enough to be considered in a quasi stationary state and an error of 5 is added to the measurements to get close to real field conditions the inversion is performed with hydraulic data sampled over two periods t 40 days and t 60 days by comparison between the true and estimated transmissivity fields we can conclude that the inverse solution can reproduce the clogging phenomenon at the injected well and that the decrease in time of transmissivity was well identified to have a better view of the evolution of the transmissivity we map the differences between the transmissivity field obtained at different steps of clogging and the initial field see eq 20 these are illustrated in fig 5 20a δ s t r u e s t r u e t s t r u e t 0 20b δ s i n v s i n v t s i n v t 0 with s t r u e t 0 and s t r u e t are the initial true parameter and the one at time t respectively s i n v t 0 and s i n v t are the initial inverse parameter and the one at time t respectively the representations in terms of differences provide a clearer view of the evolution of hydraulic transmissivity presented on the right side of fig 5 on which we observe that the injections performed over 60 days permitted to reduce the transmissivity hydraulic of an order of 10 2 m2 s mainly around the injection wells inverse estimation seems to reflect this trend of evolution in the medium with variations located only around the injection well to highlight the advantages of the time lapse inversion algorithm compared to the classical geostatistical algorithm without temporal variogram we applied this latter method to inverse independently the hydraulic data collected at different periods t 40 and 60 days by using only the spatial statistical characteristics as prior information in objective function such as 21 l h o b s h s t r 1 h o b s h s s s 0 t q 1 s s 0 where s 0 denotes the mean of the unknown parameters introduced here with the covariance matrix q 1 as prior parameters the same one used for the inversion of initial model fig 6 shows the results of the geostatistical inversion scheme which separately restructures the transmissivity field at each time in contrast to the time lapse scheme the classical algorithm failed to map the main heterogeneities of the two fields as shown by the true and inverse field comparison curves fig 6 the absence of a relationship between both periods in the inverse formulation leads to results that present no similarity between the two inverted fields in particular in the zones not affected by the particle injections the temporal covariance matrix hence plays as an extra constraint to include memory effect in the optimization process which permits to provide realistic and coherence changes of hydraulic properties over time this implies an accumulation of the uncertainties from the previous steps to the next estimations in the following steps we sequentially perform the colloid injections in the wells 11 12 at the corners of the area for 40 days these new injections significantly reduced the transmissivity values resulting in the disappearance of the main permeable zone at the center of domain see fig 7 true fields the time lapse inversion algorithm has also successfully delineated the main areas disturbed by the new injections figs 7 and 8 in these inverted fields it can be seen that the decrease in transmissivity in the vicinity of the injected wells is visible however the results also show certain smoothness at the center of the injection wells the sensitivity of the method depends on the spatial disposition of the wells where a change of transmissivity directly induces a strong modification in the measurements compared to the areas not covered by the wells 3 3 time lapse inversion using both hydraulic head and concentration data in this case the measurements of both hydraulic head and concentration in the wells are used in the inversion process the details of the method are presented in section 2 4 with the same parametrization as that applied in the previous time lapse inversion the concentration data are sampled at the end of each injection when the system reaches the clogging situation and the concentration in the injected well tends to reach a quasi stable state the measurement error of concentration is set at 2 we illustrate only the results of inversion at the end of each injection as shown in the fig 9 variations of the transmissivity field over time is detailed in the fig 10 at 60 days 100 days and 140 days the comparisons between the true field and predictions shown on the right side of fig 10 prove some improvement of this inversion compared to the time lapse method with only hydraulic data as shown in fig 8 as they show less discrepancy however the improvement is narrow as shown in table 2 which is due to the fact that the concentration and hydraulic data are not independent and there is some redundancy in the information provided with the both sources of data hydraulic conditions play a key role in the transport of solute consequently it determines the distribution of the concentration field for that reason the importance of hydraulic data on the inverted outcomes prevails over the one of solute concentration data the measurement of colloid concentration though enhances the precision of solutions by providing more data the estimations over time of the joint inversion appear better in comparison to the results from the previous inversion used only hydraulic heads in addition to visual comparison we will address a normalized misfit formula between the true field and inversion prediction for both approaches the misfit bases on a squared root form as following 22 misfit s inv s true s true 2 m 100 where sinv is the inverse parameter and strue is the corresponding true parameter the comparison between two results is presented in the fig 11 the misfit value provides a global view of the quality of the inversion process the precision of time lapse inversion using only hydraulic heads and coupled inversion are of the same order with the geostatistical inversion used as the starting field at t 0 the former inversion process uses fewer measurement data hence it will lose some precision and it takes a higher misfit the accuracy of the inverse problem also depends on the number of wells used in the reconstruction and the a priori constraint imposed in our case it is the temporal covariance matrix 4 conclusion and discussion in this manuscript we presented a new inverse approach to identify and track the changes in hydraulic transmissivity during the clogging operation from the inversion of hydraulic head and solute transport data this hydraulic tomography algorithm is based on a time lapse regularization which allows to control the evolution of the hydraulic transmissivity over time this inverse problem relies on a coupled forward problem in which groundwater flow and transport equations are solved numerically by a finite element technique to simulate the consequences of the particles injected on the modifications of the transmissivity field and afterward on the hydraulic head data however for the sake of simplicity in this article the groundwater flow equation was solved in steady state conditions the inverse problem is nonlinear and is formulated with a deterministic quasi newton scheme in which the sensitivity matrices were determined from the adjoint state equations which help to improve the efficiency of this underdetermined problem number of data number of unknown parameters as many other inverse problems in geosciences the process is still ill posed with an insufficient number and source of data to cover faithfully the main heterogeneities of the subsurface for tackling the issue of the multiplicity of solutions and including the memory effect in the evolution of the transmissivity field during the injections a temporal constraint was included in the objective function this temporal constraint was imposed to control the pattern of change of the transmissivity in time via statistical features introduced via a covariance matrix this formulation permits to infer a current model of transmissivity from the previous one by using it as a priori information which reduces the computation time needed to reach the convergence particularly for the deterministic algorithms and provides realistic and smooth changes of the transmissivity values these advantages aren t offered by the traditional algorithm in which the variation of the hydraulic data at different moments are used independently to monitor the transmissivity changes the both approaches were confronted on a hypothetical aquifer with 13 wells installed for injection of fine particles and collecting hydraulic and concentration data to follow the clogging effect the results prove that the time lapse inversions of the hydraulic data have ability to track the evolution of transmissivity in the medium which can fall to 100 order particularly around the injection wells therefore this significant deterioration of hydraulic conditions around the wells reduces the effectiveness of the injection which pushes us to use another well for the injections and the process was done on 3 wells in 140 days the multiplication of injection operations over time has utterly modified the initial transmissivity field leading to the disappearance of the permeable zones most of these changes in the transmissivity field have been well identified from the inversion of the hydraulic data alone or in combination with the concentration data however the joint inversion of hydraulic and concentration data has brought some improvements in the reconstruction of heterogeneities of the transmissivity field with respect to the individual inversion of hydraulic data on the other hand the application of the traditional geostatistical approach has not made it possible to describe the main variations of transmissivity values that occurred during injections we recall that the efficiency of time lapse inversion to track the effect of clogging remains dependent as any type of inversion techniques to the number of wells used to collect data and the quality of the reconstruction of background initial transmissivity field we believe that the formulation of hydraulic tomography in time lapse mode can be used as a powerful strategy in the field to track the hydraulic modifications induced by physical chemical or biological clogging mechanisms the monitoring of changes in hydraulic conditions can be performed by inverting only the water pressure which remains a simple parameter to record when we have a series of monitoring piezometers in the field the interpretation of these hydraulic head data can be achieved in a steady or transient state to derive both transmissivity and storativity parameters in 2d or hydraulic conductivity and specific storage in 3d if the hydraulic data are sampled at different depths by isolating multiple discrete zones in the wells via packer devices the accuracy of time lapse hydraulic imaging is based on the quality and quantity of hydraulic data i e the number of wells used in the survey as well as the prior information added for limiting the number of solutions and providing a realistic distribution of hydraulic properties in our case the spatio temporal covariances in the field conditions the variogram parameters can be inferred using one of the approaches discussed in the literature such as the exploitation of data from lithological geological hydrogeological and geophysical investigations conducted on the aquifer or considering these parameters as unknowns in the inversion process jardani et al 2012 soueid ahmed et al 2018 kitanidis and vomvoris 1983 in this manuscript we have proposed adding the colloid concentration data to hydraulic measurements to improve the hydraulic characterization however for a field application the acquisition of concentration data is an expensive operation that demands either the deployment at each well an optical probe or multiplication of water sampling for laboratory analysis besides the inverse formulation must take into account all parameters controlling the mechanisms of clogging such as retention and detachment in general these parameters vary in space and time and depend on the hydrodynamic and chemical conditions of the medium and their evaluations in the field is a challenge in fact if they are expressed as unknown parameters in the inversion process the problem will become nonlinear and more complex due to their dependence on the water velocity if they are considered as known parameters derived from laboratory experiments at a column scale they can generate uncertainties for a field scale application to overcome these complexities we can opt for the dye tracing test instead of tracking fine particles which can provide additional information on the hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer without the need to include clogging mechanisms or even modifying the mathematical formulation of the joint inversion that remains valid for dye transfer the dye tracing test is a simple tool to set up in the field to track the hydrodynamic changes regardless the clogging causes biological chemical or mechanical the geophysical methods including the self potential induced polarization and electrical resistivity tomography which are very sensitive to the physicochemical modifications of the medium during the clogging also represent an interesting alternative to enhance the monitoring of the change in hydraulic properties

engineering this paper proposes an inversion algorithm in time lapse mode to track that complex process through the assessment of alteration in the transmissivity field produced by the injection of colloids the concept is based on a joint inversion of hydraulic head and colloidal particles concentration data acquired during the injection of colloids in the porous aquifer to reconstruct the spatial variability of the transmissivity field at different times the inversion code is deterministic and was implemented in the time lapse scheme by adding in the objective function a temporal geostatistical constraint to control changes of the hydraulic transmissivity this algorithm is linked to a forward problem that consists of the groundwater flow and transport equations which were solved numerically and jointly by considering the effect of particles deposition on the decrease of hydraulic properties as the inverse problem is deterministic and underdetermined we have opted to use the efficient adjoint state technique to derive the sensitivity matrices the approach has been successfully applied to a theoretical case in which the hydraulic head responses have been used alone and jointly to assess the evolution of the clogging impact on hydraulic transmissivity keywords clogging colloid injection colloid transport hydraulic tomography joint inversion time lapse inverse problem 1 introduction for decades the understanding of the mechanisms of colloidal particle migration in porous or fractured aquifers has aroused the interest of geoscientists especially for addressing certain issues that may affect the sustainability of the exploitation of groundwater resources such as clogging and turbidity phenomena jeong et al 2018 clogging is one of the main causes of damage to the productivity of groundwater wells by reducing the hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the wells the mobilization and then the retention of the colloidal particles may imply a costly rehabilitation operation or early abandonment of wells de zwart 2007 the turbidity of the groundwater is mainly associated with an instantaneous and highly dynamic transport of fine particles during rainfall events on the karstic catchments where the sinkholes and karstic conduits facilitate the introduction resuspension and the mobility of particles in the subsurface pronk et al 2009 recently the interest of the geoscientists has shifted to the comprehension of the role of colloidal particles in the spreading of organic and inorganic contaminants in the subsurface to address the environmental issues related to anthropogenic contamination of water resources the studies focus on the main underlying mechanisms that control the migration of particles such as the chemical nature of the colloids and interstitial water ionic strength and ph the chemical interactions between the contaminants organic or inorganic and colloids the concentration of the colloids in the soil and the water velocity that depends on the hydraulic conductivity of the soil mccarthy and mckay 2004 sen and khilar 2006 flury and qiu 2008 among these works saiers and his co authors who focused on studying the effect of colloidal particles on the transport of contaminants such as hydroxyatrazine and cesium through sand column experience saiers and hornberger 1999 cheng and saiers 2009 short et al 1988 showed that the colloidal particles rich in fe and si have a high ability to accelerate the migration of the uranium and the thorium species short et al 1988 ribeiro et al 2014 discussed the role of the colloidal particles in the e coli bacteria transfer into a karstic aquifer during rainy events abdel salam and chrysikopoulos 1995 proposed a mathematical approach to numerically simulate the transport of colloids in the fractured medium other works have treated the transfer modalities of active colloids such as the nanoscale zero valent used as cleaning agents for aquifers contaminated with chlorinated hydrocarbons mueller et al 2012 strutz et al 2016 the effectiveness of these injected active colloids strongly depends on the hydraulic conditions around the injection well and its clogging can block the operation of rehabilitation by contrast in some situations the clogging may be a positive measure to prevent leakage of contaminants persoff et al 1995 in that regard the artificial injection of colloids can be considered as an alternative to limit the spreading of pathogenic microorganisms or radioactive substances peterson 1994 iaea 2001 in general the clogging of the porous medium results from a complex combination of physical chemical and biological processes that manifests itself through a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity of the soil torkzaban et al 2015 sharma and yortsos 1987 we believe that the monitoring of this hydraulic conductivity change associated with clogging plays a key role in the design of remediation techniques in this manuscript we present and discuss the pertinence of an inversion algorithm formulated in time lapse mode to follow the spatio temporal evolutions of the clogging driven by a colloidal injection in a confined aquifer inverse algorithms have been broadly applied during the last decades in the modeling of groundwater flows and particularly to image the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity in 3d or transmissivity in 2d zimmerman et al 1998 yeh 1986 kitanidis 1996 this spatial imaging of hydraulic parameters is known as hydraulic tomography which results from the cross interpretation of a set of piezometric data collected during multiple pumping tests using an inversion algorithm soueid et al 2015 however to our knowledge this method is not yet extended to time lapse inversion by combining spatio temporal data to bring out the dynamic changes of hydraulic properties caused by clogging processes time lapse inversion scheme is commonly applied in the geophysics discipline to study the dynamic change of physical properties such as electrical conductivity and dielectric constant in the subsurface associated for instance with water infiltration salt water intrusion hermans et al 2012 salt tracer experiment johnson et al 2010 karaoulis et al 2011 jardani et al 2013 and temperature changes legaz et al 2009 in this paper we formulate a hydraulic tomography algorithm in time lapse form to image spatio temporal variations in the transmissivity field that occurred during the injection of colloids by inverting the hydraulic head data alone or jointly with the colloid concentrations these data are obtained by solving numerically and sequentially a coupled system of groundwater flow and transport equations built in a way to reproduce a temporal change in the hydraulic transmissivity of a confined aquifer via colloidal injections on several wells the hydraulic head and concentrations data recovered on virtual piezometers at different instants indirectly reflect the evolution of hydraulic conditions of the aquifer during the injections the inversion of these data relies on a deterministic and nonlinear algorithm in which the sensitivity matrices also called jacobian matrices connecting the transmissivity field considered here as unknown parameters and the numerical data are computed from the adjoint state formulations the efficiency and the limit of this algorithm are revealed by its application to theoretical cases in the first case we survey in 2d the change of transmissivity field over time using only the hydraulic head data in the time lapse inversion algorithm however in the second case we use the same data but this time the inverse formulation does not take into account the time lapse term which allows us to include in the inverse process the dynamic effect in the last case we investigate the efficiency of the combination of the hydraulic and concentration data in the monitoring of transmissivity changes 2 theoretical background in this section we introduce the equations governing the transport of colloidal particles in a heterogeneous porous media in 2d the equation system consists of the groundwater flow and transport equations solved numerically in iterative mode by using a finite element approach and considering the effects of colloids injection on the variation of the hydraulic conductivity during the transport process 2 1 colloid transport the macroscopic transport equation can be derived from mass balance of colloids over a representative element volume rev in the medium three main mechanisms control the evolution of the system including convective flow hydrodynamic dispersion and colloid suspended mass exchange through attachment and detachment processes on the fluid solid interfaces the transport in the aqueous phase hence can be described by an advection dispersion form sun et al 2001 de marsily 1986 1 c t d c v c r where c represents the colloid concentration in the aqueous phase mol m3 t is the time s d denotes the particle hydrodynamic dispersion m2 s and v is the particle velocity m s r is the colloid mass change related to the attachment and detachment mol m3 s 2 2 colloid attachment and detachment generally the variation of colloid mass is expressed in terms of attachment and detachment of particles in the pore space that have been widely formulated in the transport equation under a linear kinetic forms gruesbeck and collins 1982 civan and nguyen 2005 civan 2016 lohne et al 2010 wang and civan 2005a b the attachment is supposed proportional to the concentration of colloids in the aqueous phase as gruesbeck and collins 1982 2 r a t t a c h k d c where rattach mol m 3 s 1 is the attachment rate k d 1 s refers to the attachment coefficient which can vary in time and space and depends on the water velocity pore size and other physico chemical properties of matrix such as ph zeta potential temperature etc ikni et al 2013 civan 2016 commonly this parameter is inferred from the adjustment of experimental clogging data and the estimated values most often vary between 1 10 3 5 10 2 1 s zheng et al 2014 in the literature there are many forms to express detachment rate in function of water velocity among them gruesbeck and collins 1982 wang and civan 2005a b lohne et al 2010 3 r d e t a c h α ε v u c v u c 0 v u c where the detachment occurs only when the local fluid velocity overpasses a critical velocity uc that can vary between 0 05 to 0 1 cm s according to the experimental clogging data on a column with unconsolidated sand with grain diameters ranging from 840 to 2000 µm and suspended particles with a mean diameter of 8 0 µm gruesbeck and collins 1982 reddi et al 2000 the removal mass is proportional to the net volume occupied by the particles ε ϕ ϕ0 ϕ and ϕ0 are the instantaneous and initial porosity of the medium respectively α denotes the constant rate detachment that can be reformulated as function of ionic strength of water gruesbeck and collins 1982 wang and civan 2005a b lohne et al 2010 once the two phenomena attachment and detachment are simultaneously considered that produces 4 r r a t t a c h r d e t a c h in this study the seepage velocity in the medium is much smaller than the critical velocity thus the detachment is negligible under the influence of colloid kinetics the spatial distribution of porosity evolves in time corresponding to the attachment and detachment processes by 5 d ϕ d t m ρ s r with ρs is the solid density close to 2600 kg m3 m is the molar mass of colloids kg mol variation of local porosity results in the change of permeability in turn the change will affect the flow field behaviors such as the velocity and dynamic viscosity of the fluid phase flow field modifications hence control the transport of colloid and clogging phenomena may occur around the injection point 2 3 flow field in this study we assume that deposition of the particles in the aquifer occurs slowly and the groundwater flow is close to the steady state in a confined aquifer that is usually written as bear 1972 6a t h q 0 δ x x 0 subjected to the following boundary conditions 6b h h d a t γ d where t denotes the heterogeneous transmissivity m2 s h is the hydraulic head m q0 represents the injection source term m2 s at various well positions x 0 δ is kronecker delta assuming that the aquifer has a constant thickness b m hence 7 t b k where k m s is the hydraulic conductivity related to the intrinsic permeability k m2 by 8 k k g ρ w μ with ρw kg m3 and µ kg m s are the density and the dynamic viscosity of fluid respectively g m s2 is the gravity acceleration the intrinsic permeability is in relationship with the porosity as proposed in carman 1997 kozeny 1927 and can be rewritten as follows 9 k k 0 1 ϕ 0 2 ϕ 0 3 ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 where k0 is the initial permeability m2 ϕ0 and ϕ are initial and instantaneous porosities of the medium this analytical relationship provides a practical approach to theoretically quantify the effect of the clogging on the permeability field in the simulations however in the real field conditions the formulation may underestimate the decrease of the conductivity due to the complexity of the deposition in the pore space mays and krauss 2014 to overcome this issue some empirical equations have been suggested in which the fitting parameters are obtained using experiments yang et al 2019 vaz et al 2016 in this theoretical study the design aims to access an extreme condition when the clogging is completely reached to block the injected well the specific deposit simulated probably occupies the total pore space that may exceed 30 of the total volume at the vicinity of the injected well the dynamic viscosity of the fluid evolves proportionally to the colloid concentration and can be accessed by einstein s formula einstein 1906 10 μ μ 0 1 m ρ s c 2 5 where µ0 is initial dynamic viscosity for low concentration of the dilute suspension the first order approximation yields 11 μ μ 0 1 2 5 m ρ s c 2 4 coupled inverse problem to monitor the evolution of the clogging effect on the transmissivity field we implement a time lapse inversion code assuming that two successive transmissivity changes in time follow certain statistical characteristics expressed via a covariance function the inverse problem is an undetermined

is introduced as a priori information to constraint the evolution in time of the transmissivity field in this paper we used a gaussian variogram 13 γ x t d a x t 1 e 3 d 2 r x t 2 where a x t and r x t are the sill and range at the position x and time t respectively d is the distance to x the variation of the transmissivity neighboring the colloid injection well is the largest that corresponds to the largest sill and it is set to a maximum value ranging from 0 1 to 0 2 in this model the range r was chosen equal to 8 m at the injected well and increase to 20 m at far away locations solving the inverse problem relies on an iterative process to estimate the new step s k 1 14 s k 1 s k ξ δ s where 15 δ s j h t g 1 j h π δ s 1 1 j h t h o b s h s j c t w 1 j c π δ s 1 1 j c t c o b s c s with ξ

overcome this issue we used the adjoint equations to determine the sensitivity coefficients h s and c s with the following integration sun and yeh 1990 17a h s ω log 10 t h φ 1 k f c φ 2 k c h φ 2 d ω

kronecker delta e is a tensor with components eij dil vj c xl the summation for l 1 2 is implied in this study we only focus on the determination of the transmissivity field the transport parameters such as dispersivities are assumed to be known and are reported in table 1 the set of equations is solved using the pde coefficient form in comsol and the inversion process is implemented with matlab the formulation in those softwares provides a flexible solution which could be adopted for a variety of physical problems including the advective diffusive equations the model can be also coupled with a variety of boundary conditions such as dirichlet neumann or mixed 3 numerical applications in this section we present and discuss the results of the application of the inverse protocol on theoretical cases this discussion is built around the analysis of the algorithm s ability to retrieve the time variations of hydraulic conductivity field induced during the colloidal injections before injecting the colloids in the aquifer we should identify the initial transmissivity field of the aquifer which is the starting point of the whole process for this purpose we realize a conventional sequential series of pumping tests to derive the spatial heterogeneity of this initial transmissivity field by applying a geostatistical inverse process once the initial transmissivity is determined the injections of colloids are then performed in the three wells the evolution of the field in time and space will be estimated using directly the measurement collected during injecting the colloids in one well we assume that the clogging will proceed slowly so that all the measurements are in a quasi stationary state the inverse problem will be solved first to interpret the hydraulic head data then the hydraulic head and the concentration jointly 3 1 description of the case study in this study we used a regular array of 13 wells separated with 5 m see fig 1 to cover a confined aquifer with heterogeneous transmissivity and porosity fields generated geostatistically with the mgstat software deutsch and journel 1997 the true initial fields of transmissivity and porosity used before any disturbance by the colloid injections are supposed to obey gaussian distributions with the following characteristics γt r 1 0 1 exp r 10 and γε r 0 2 1 exp r 10 respectively the study area is bordered by the wells in a square of 20 20 m discretized into 1 1 m blocks equal to 400 unknown variables where the injections of colloids are carried out later to limit the influence of the boundary conditions the computed area is of 25 times larger than the study area we consider that the effect of background gradient within the study area is negligible compared to water flow due to the injection source the initial transmissivity field is shown in the fig 2 in which the transmissivity values varies between 10 6 10 2 m2 s first we characterize the initial transmissivity field before processing the colloid injections a series of pumping tests with a rate of 15 m3 day is imposed sequentially in the 13 wells and the hydraulic head responses are numerically computed in the steady state at various wells gaussian noise with σ 2 of measured values is added to the data as a measurement error the characterization of this initial field is performed by interpreting the hydraulic responses using a geostatistical inverse algorithm in which the unknown parameters of transmissivities are constrained by a geostatistical variogram the details of this inversion solving refers to the works in kitanidis 1995 cardiff and kitanidis 2008 the inverse process starts from the mean of initial hydraulic transmissivity 10 4 m2 s regarded as a prior information the inversion result is shown in the fig 3 a obtained after 5 iterations and the comparison between the true and inverted fields is presented in fig 3b the main aspect of the heterogeneity is well mapped with a certain smoothness this estimated initial field becomes an initial input for the time lapse inversion algorithm to image the transmissivity at the next time step impacted by particle injections for this test we use three wells to sequentially inject fine particles with low concentration the first injection is carried out in the well 5 at the center of the medium during 60 days in the other wells 11 and 12 each injection lasts 40 days sequentially this alternation of injection wells is due to a significant decrease in hydraulic conditions around the wells over time preventing the continuation of injections moreover in the remediation operations the increase of the number of injected wells is an effective strategy to build broader geochemical barriers for better containment of contaminated areas the injection process is derived from the numerical resolution of the transport and groundwater flow equations with physical properties listed in table 1 then we extract the numerical measurements of the hydraulic head and colloid concentration at each well during the injection process these data will be used in the inverse algorithm to predict the evolution of the hydraulic transmissivity the inverse problem deals with a parameter vector i e s which represents an unknown and distributed transmissivity field in space containing hundreds of elements the problem is undetermined and the hydraulic data are not sufficient to arrive at a unique solution this difficulty is generally overcome by adding in the objective function the constraints and the prior information about the unknown parameters cardiff and kitanidis 2008 or by increasing the measurement data in our case we test both approaches in the first case we include in the objective function the time lapse term π δ s to control the evolution of the transmissivity field in time and space in the second we combine in the inverse process the hydraulic head and concentration the effectiveness of the additional field data is discussed later in the comparison between both results 3 2 time lapse inversion using only hydraulic head data to start the numerical investigation we inject the fine particles for 60 days in the well 5 at the center of the medium at the end of the injection process the deposition of the fines clogs the neighborhood of the injection well leading to a reduction in hydraulic conductivity in and around the well the resulting transmissivity at the clogging state is of around three orders of magnitude lower than the initial transmissivity see fig 4 the hydraulic head data collected at 13 wells resulting from these hydraulic modifications are used in the time lapse inversion algorithm to identify the zones impacted by the injection of colloids through the reconstruction of the evolution of transmissivity in time we assume that the hydraulic measurements evolve slowly enough to be considered in a quasi stationary state and an error of 5 is added to the measurements to get close to real field conditions the inversion is performed with hydraulic data sampled over two periods t 40 days and t 60 days by comparison between the true and estimated transmissivity fields we can conclude that the inverse solution can reproduce the clogging phenomenon at the injected well and that the decrease in time of transmissivity was well identified to have a better view of the evolution of the transmissivity we map the differences between the transmissivity field obtained at different steps of clogging and the initial field see eq 20 these are illustrated in fig 5 20a δ s t r u e s t r u e t s t r u e t 0 20b δ s i n v s i n v t s i n v t 0 with s t r u e t 0 and s t r u e t are the initial true parameter and the one at time t respectively s i n v t 0 and s i n v t are the initial inverse parameter and the one at time t respectively the representations in terms of differences provide a clearer view of the evolution of hydraulic transmissivity presented on the right side of fig 5 on which we observe that the injections performed over 60 days permitted to reduce the transmissivity hydraulic of an order of 10 2 m2 s mainly around the injection wells inverse estimation seems to reflect this trend of evolution in the medium with variations located only around the injection well to highlight the advantages of the time lapse inversion algorithm compared to the classical geostatistical algorithm without temporal variogram we applied this latter method to inverse independently the hydraulic data collected at different periods t 40 and 60 days by using only the spatial statistical characteristics as prior information in objective function such as 21 l h o b s h s t r 1 h o b s h s s s 0 t q 1 s s 0 where s 0 denotes the mean of the unknown parameters introduced here with the covariance matrix q 1 as prior parameters the same one used for the inversion of initial model fig 6 shows the results of the geostatistical inversion scheme which separately restructures the transmissivity field at each time in contrast to the time lapse scheme the classical algorithm failed to map the main heterogeneities of the two fields as shown by the true and inverse field comparison curves fig 6 the absence of a relationship between both periods in the inverse formulation leads to results that present no similarity between the two inverted fields in particular in the zones not affected by the particle injections the temporal covariance matrix hence plays as an extra constraint to include memory effect in the optimization process which permits to provide realistic and coherence changes of hydraulic properties over time this implies an accumulation of the uncertainties from the previous steps to the next estimations in the following steps we sequentially perform the colloid injections in the wells 11 12 at the corners of the area for 40 days these new injections significantly reduced the transmissivity values resulting in the disappearance of the main permeable zone at the center of domain see fig 7 true fields the time lapse inversion algorithm has also successfully delineated the main areas disturbed by the new injections figs 7 and 8 in these inverted fields it can be seen that the decrease in transmissivity in the vicinity of the injected wells is visible however the results also show certain smoothness at the center of the injection wells the sensitivity of the method depends on the spatial disposition of the wells where a change of transmissivity directly induces a strong modification in the measurements compared to the areas not covered by the wells 3 3 time lapse inversion using both hydraulic head and concentration data in this case the measurements of both hydraulic head and concentration in the wells are used in the inversion process the details of the method are presented in section 2 4 with the same parametrization as that applied in the previous time lapse inversion the concentration data are sampled at the end of each injection when the system reaches the clogging situation and the concentration in the injected well tends to reach a quasi stable state the measurement error of concentration is set at 2 we illustrate only the results of inversion at the end of each injection as shown in the fig 9 variations of the transmissivity field over time is detailed in the fig 10 at 60 days 100 days and 140 days the comparisons between the true field and predictions shown on the right side of fig 10 prove some improvement of this inversion compared to the time lapse method with only hydraulic data as shown in fig 8 as they show less discrepancy however the improvement is narrow as shown in table 2 which is due to the fact that the concentration and hydraulic data are not independent and there is some redundancy in the information provided with the both sources of data hydraulic conditions play a key role in the transport of solute consequently it determines the distribution of the concentration field for that reason the importance of hydraulic data on the inverted outcomes prevails over the one of solute concentration data the measurement of colloid concentration though enhances the precision of solutions by providing more data the estimations over time of the joint inversion appear better in comparison to the results from the previous inversion used only hydraulic heads in addition to visual comparison we will address a normalized misfit formula between the true field and inversion prediction for both approaches the misfit bases on a squared root form as following 22 misfit s inv s true s true 2 m 100 where sinv is the inverse parameter and strue is the corresponding true parameter the comparison between two results is presented in the fig 11 the misfit value provides a global view of the quality of the inversion process the precision of time lapse inversion using only hydraulic heads and coupled inversion are of the same order with the geostatistical inversion used as the starting field at t 0 the former inversion process uses fewer measurement data hence it will lose some precision and it takes a higher misfit the accuracy of the inverse problem also depends on the number of wells used in the reconstruction and the a priori constraint imposed in our case it is the temporal covariance matrix 4 conclusion and discussion in this manuscript we presented a new inverse approach to identify and track the changes in hydraulic transmissivity during the clogging operation from the inversion of hydraulic head and solute transport data this hydraulic tomography algorithm is based on a time lapse regularization which allows to control the evolution of the hydraulic transmissivity over time this inverse problem relies on a coupled forward problem in which groundwater flow and transport equations are solved numerically by a finite element technique to simulate the consequences of the particles injected on the modifications of the transmissivity field and afterward on the hydraulic head data however for the sake of simplicity in this article the groundwater flow equation was solved in steady state conditions the inverse problem is nonlinear and is formulated with a deterministic quasi newton scheme in which the sensitivity matrices were determined from the adjoint state equations which help to improve the efficiency of this underdetermined problem number of data number of unknown parameters as many other inverse problems in geosciences the process is still ill posed with an insufficient number and source of data to cover faithfully the main heterogeneities of the subsurface for tackling the issue of the multiplicity of solutions and including the memory effect in the evolution of the transmissivity field during the injections a temporal constraint was included in the objective function this temporal constraint was imposed to control the pattern of change of the transmissivity in time via statistical features introduced via a covariance matrix this formulation permits to infer a current model of transmissivity from the previous one by using it as a priori information which reduces the computation time needed to reach the convergence particularly for the deterministic algorithms and provides realistic and smooth changes of the transmissivity values these advantages aren t offered by the traditional algorithm in which the variation of the hydraulic data at different moments are used independently to monitor the transmissivity changes the both approaches were confronted on a hypothetical aquifer with 13 wells installed for injection of fine particles and collecting hydraulic and concentration data to follow the clogging effect the results prove that the time lapse inversions of the hydraulic data have ability to track the evolution of transmissivity in the medium which can fall to 100 order particularly around the injection wells therefore this significant deterioration of hydraulic conditions around the wells reduces the effectiveness of the injection which pushes us to use another well for the injections and the process was done on 3 wells in 140 days the multiplication of injection operations over time has utterly modified the initial transmissivity field leading to the disappearance of the permeable zones most of these changes in the transmissivity field have been well identified from the inversion of the hydraulic data alone or in combination with the concentration data however the joint inversion of hydraulic and concentration data has brought some improvements in the reconstruction of heterogeneities of the transmissivity field with respect to the individual inversion of hydraulic data on the other hand the application of the traditional geostatistical approach has not made it possible to describe the main variations of transmissivity values that occurred during injections we recall that the efficiency of time lapse inversion to track the effect of clogging remains dependent as any type of inversion techniques to the number of wells used to collect data and the quality of the reconstruction of background initial transmissivity field we believe that the formulation of hydraulic tomography in time lapse mode can be used as a powerful strategy in the field to track the hydraulic modifications induced by physical chemical or biological clogging mechanisms the monitoring of changes in hydraulic conditions can be performed by inverting only the water pressure which remains a simple parameter to record when we have a series of monitoring piezometers in the field the interpretation of these hydraulic head data can be achieved in a steady or transient state to derive both transmissivity and storativity parameters in 2d or hydraulic conductivity and specific storage in 3d if the hydraulic data are sampled at different depths by isolating multiple discrete zones in the wells via packer devices the accuracy of time lapse hydraulic imaging is based on the quality and quantity of hydraulic data i e the number of wells used in the survey as well as the prior information added for limiting the number of solutions and providing a realistic distribution of hydraulic properties in our case the spatio temporal covariances in the field conditions the variogram parameters can be inferred using one of the approaches discussed in the literature such as the exploitation of data from lithological geological hydrogeological and geophysical investigations conducted on the aquifer or considering these parameters as unknowns in the inversion process jardani et al 2012 soueid ahmed et al 2018 kitanidis and vomvoris 1983 in this manuscript we have proposed adding the colloid concentration data to hydraulic measurements to improve the hydraulic characterization however for a field application the acquisition of concentration data is an expensive operation that demands either the deployment at each well an optical probe or multiplication of water sampling for laboratory analysis besides the inverse formulation must take into account all parameters controlling the mechanisms of clogging such as retention and detachment in general these parameters vary in space and time and depend on the hydrodynamic and chemical conditions of the medium and their evaluations in the field is a challenge in fact if they are expressed as unknown parameters in the inversion process the problem will become nonlinear and more complex due to their dependence on the water velocity if they are considered as known parameters derived from laboratory experiments at a column scale they can generate uncertainties for a field scale application to overcome these complexities we can opt for the dye tracing test instead of tracking fine particles which can provide additional information on the hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer without the need to include clogging mechanisms or even modifying the mathematical formulation of the joint inversion that remains valid for dye transfer the dye tracing test is a simple tool to set up in the field to track the hydrodynamic changes regardless the clogging causes biological chemical or mechanical the geophysical methods including the self potential induced polarization and electrical resistivity tomography which are very sensitive to the physicochemical modifications of the medium during the clogging also represent an interesting alternative to enhance the monitoring of the change in hydraulic properties

577,the particle tracking method was recently extended to allow inter particle mass transfer and arbitrarily complex reactions by allowing each particle to represent any number of distinct chemical compounds this methodology allows the tracking and broadening due to mixing of the age probability density function pdf on each particle aquifer heterogeneity leads to channeling and multi modal age pdfs in stream samples this observation supports the concept of age classes but clearly shows the more complicated interplay of dispersion mixing and travel times on the age distributions keywords particle methods mixing aging age distribution 1 introduction direct simulation of age in hydrologic systems is often necessary when interpreting environmental tracers assessing water quality and evaluating contamination risks among other possible needs both eulerian and lagrangian methods have been used for these purposes in the past and each method has tradeoffs eulerian simulations goode 1996 varni and carrera 1998 cornaton and perrochet 2006 can simulate the moments of the age distribution or the full distribution in each cell of the model but these are computationally expensive generate overly diffuse probability density functions pdfs because of the numerical dispersion inherent in heterogeneous velocity fields and are difficult to generalize to transient fields cornaton 2012 classical lagrangian particle tracking eliminates the numerical dispersion by design labolle et al 1996 and reduces the computational load because each particle in a classical particle tracking

put simply eulerian techniques overestimate age mixing while classical pt techniques underestimate mixing a compromise between these end members would more closely represent reality i e limiting numerical dispersion while still allowing evolution of age pdfs as waters from different sources mix but this is a deficiency in the capabilities of the currently available methods for simulating age the classical pt method is limited to a dirac delta distribution for the age of each particle but simulating age mixing requires storing a representative age pdf on each particle and also a dynamic

change to each particle s mass keeping the size of the particle ensemble constant over time the last necessary algorithm benson and bolster 2016 allows any number of chemical species and reactions on particles each particle is treated as a moving container that carries an arbitrary number of chemical components the masses of each component are exchanged between different particles to represent mixing the degree of mixing remains a function of the particle particle co location probability conservative quantities can be represented this way so that the algorithm can be extended to represent dynamic water age mixing between particles this technical note proposes a modification of the recent reactive pt methods where chemical components are replaced with the bins of a discrete age pdf and aging is represented as a pseudo reaction each particle is initialized as a dirac delta distribution when it enters the domain and functions as a clock where all of its age mass increases by one time unit every time step importantly this satisfies the requirement that there can be no artificial dispersion in the age dimension ginn 1999 engdahl et al 2012 however diffusive mixing between particles allows each pdf to evolve away from its initial dirac delta into an arbitrary non parametric pdf as long as the number of bins is sufficient enough to hold all the ages since the aging velocity is always the same as the time step a unit courant number is achieved along the age dimension thus the proposed scheme achieves the goal of eliminating numerical dispersion while allowing age mixing between streamlines the approach is demonstrated on an idealized hillslope domain with distributed recharge under homogeneous and heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity k fields the latter fields

simulation time t define an age discretization k 0 1 k and denote these species ρk with age kδa without loss of generality we use equal age and timestep sizes δ a δ t the mixing at each time step follows 3 the aging reaction ρ k ρ k 1 simply moves all water mass from each bin k to bin k 1 see also massoudieh et al 2017 engdahl et al 2012 any new particles introduced to the domain have a certain mass given by the specifics of the problem and all mass in those particles is placed in bin k 0 any particles removed from the domain cease aging here we use unit initial mass for ρ 0 and conservation of mass implies that ρk ρ a t is a numerical approximation of the continuous pdf of age a at a given time t clearly if no mixing between particles takes place the simulated mass pdf on each particle remains a dirac delta function of the particle s elapsed time in the system as has been done in prior pt simulations e g weissmann et al 2002 however if mixing between particles takes place then water of different ages will with some probability move around the domain between particles in exact accordance with the specified local physics of mixing 4 numerical implementation considerations one of the advantages of the classical particle tracking algorithm is that the courant number stability requirement inherent in eulerian grid based codes is lifted the particles may be moved for different timesteps δt with no instability because of the potentially large discrepancy of particle velocities immense computational gains may be had by allowing slower particles to move for longer times between re calculating local velocity or dispersion coefficients however this invites two complications in the present model first the aging algorithm given above assumes that the timestep size and the age bins are equal and the same for all particles then the hyperbolic wave equation ρ t ρ a is solved exactly with no numerical age dispersion using first differences and setting δ a δ t various higher order techniques may be used if δt δa on any particle see the review of second order techniques in the appendix of benson et al 2017 this equation does carry a courant number type restriction that δt δa so that the discretization of the age pdf should be done with care if variable timesteps are used second choosing the same timestep for all particles allows 2 to be implemented as is for the inter particle mixing but recognizing that 2 is simply the convolution of the ith and jth particle location densities lets us expand somewhat to 4 v i j 4 π d i δ t i d j δ t j d 2 exp x i x j 2 4 d i δ t i d j δ t j which allows each particle to use its unique optimal timestep δti ideally one would choose to classify the particles into integer classes of mixing calculation frequency the fastest class of particles are calculated every timestep the second class would be calculated every other timestep etc because the timesteps are not all equal an occasional short timestep is implemented to sync all particles to the same elapsed time while we did not choose variable timesteps in the examples that follow we have implemented such an algorithm as proof of concept the mixing algorithm itself and therefore the entire model is accurate to o δ t so enlarging the timesteps of some particles may engender errors that are transferred between particles there are also several technical details that are outside the scope of this study a detailed analysis of the magnitude of computational gains and increase in errors among the advection dispersion mixing and aging algorithms is the subject of a future manuscript it is also difficult to directly compare the accuracy and computational demands of lagrangian versus eulerian methods adding the many age bins has an equal effect on both in terms of added memory and calculations in heterogeneous velocity fields the eulerian methods suffer significantly from numerical dispersion and therefore typically require much finer spatial discretization i e more nodes than particles see benson et al 2017 for high peclet number flows the grid peclet number requirement in eulerian methods can be much more restrictive than any courant number restrictions shared by both in some cases a super computer may be required for eulerian simulation of mixing limited reaction benson et al 2019a while the same problem using the newer lagrangian methods can be run in minutes on a laptop pc 5 examples to illustrate the functioning of the model we use a very simple conceptualization of water transport in a perfectly rectangular hillslope aquifer that has uniform recharge from above and discharges to a completely penetrating stream on the right fig 2a the aquifer is given a width of x 0 l m a height of z 0 h m and a uniform porosity of ϕ 0 25 because the water table is conceptualized as flat the divergence free condition for an incompressible fluid gives each streamline an analytic solution for velocity v x i l x h ϕ v z i z ϕ where we set i 2 5 10 4 m d as the vertical recharge into the aquifer for these simulations l 100 m h 25 m particles are advected by this velocity field by forward euler methods the infiltration in each timestep is split among 100 evenly spaced particles along the top boundary diffusive mass transfer is by 3 alone i e no random walks are used to disperse particles schmidt et al 2018 the simulations were run for 250 000 d 684 yr with timesteps of 500 d giving 500 age bins on each particle two simulations were run with spatially uniform dispersion one with local dispersion coefficient set to approximately that of molecular diffusion d 10 4 m2 d fig 2 and another with a larger d 2 5 10 3 m2 d fig 3 these values give approximate aquifer average peclet numbers of 250 and 10 respectively see appendix for derivation of the peclet number each simulation gives about the same calculated stream sample mean age 24 803 and 24 786 days 67 9 years for lower and higher d respectively because the average pdfs are reasonably close to an exponential function over the majority of age which agrees with the pure advection case see the appendix the standard deviations are also close to the means 23 597 and 24 625 days respectively these statistics are calculated by averaging the pdfs for all particles exiting the system in a single timestep after the system has equilibrated heavy black plus symbols in figs 3b and 2b for the lower dispersion coefficient the age pdf for each particle is narrower as is average stream sample pdf however in this simple system the average pdf is primarily based on the peak or mean age of each particle in the case of higher d even the fastest moving particles exchange significant older water among nearby particles it is highly likely that many factors that influence segregation of waters will change this mixing dynamic here we only look at the combined effect of two velocity dependent dispersion and heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity k both of which should lead to channeling of flow and poorer mixing of slower moving older water especially with higher k variability here we chose an isotropic velocity dependent dispersion coefficient d α v with an approximate peclet number of 250 see appendix which gives an isotropic dispersivity of α 0 1 m first we used finite differences to solve the steady velocity field within a heterogeneous k field with anisotropic exponential correlation function fig 4 a the k correlation lengths in the horizontal and vertical directions are 9 and 3 m and the standard deviation of the natural logarithm of k was set to unity the heterogeneous field gives rise to focusing of flow into preferential flow paths fig 4b that are discernible at steady state fig 4c the high speed channels lead to well mixed and distinct age modes that enter the stream but also leaves distinct poorly mixed slow paths e g see very bottom of fig 4c inspection of the pdfs of particles entering the stream reveals a multi modal travel time pdf with clear groups of younger versus older water that correspond to the modes of the average pdf fig 4d furthermore the standard deviation of travel time has increased by 20 over the homogeneous case with the same aquifer wide peclet number we may compare the pdfs that arise during inter particle mixing to those that must be inferred when using the previous method of non interacting dirac delta function particles fig 5 in this case the delta particles give similar estimates of mean and standard deviation of age but it is nearly impossible to discern the several distinct age modes that are found in the interacting particle case fig 4d here a relatively large number of particles 100 are used to represent a stream sample and the creation of the average age pdf in order to discern any structure in the real pdf one would have to arbitrarily choose an interpolation kernel that almost certainly lacks the details of the mixing processes that are unique to each particle in other words due to particle particle dependence the shape of each particle age pdf i e the kernel function needed post process each dirac delta particle is too complex to capture by intuition see also benson et al 2019b we expect that other parameters that influence this mixing such as aquifer aspect ratio and heterogeneity anisotropic dispersion k heterogeneity statistics partitioning to immobile water phase s and spatio temporal variability of recharge for recent examples see massoudieh et al 2017 engdahl et al 2012 green et al 2018 koh et al 2018 will significantly change the pdfs and will be explored in a future paper 6 conclusion the particle mixing method for chemical reactions can simulate age distributions upon particles these ages must mix between particles which represent parcels of water therefore the pdf of age must be tracked on each particle in order to accurately simulate the age distribution of aquifer and stream water when spatial heterogeneity of k and or d is present the age distribution becomes multi modal which is difficult or impossible to discern solely from particle transit times i e

anisotropy factors fluid fluid displacement in these fractures is simulated by a modified invasion percolation model it is found that the spatiotemporal distribution of fluid phases is strongly influenced by the aperture field anisotropy on average both the nonwetting phase saturation and the entrapped wetting phase saturations at breakthrough decrease with increasing anisotropy factor but the specific interfacial area is larger for a higher anisotropy ratio relative permeabilities to both phases in the direction parallel to the displacement increase with the anisotropy factor indicating a reduced phase interference due to aperture field anisotropy empirical equations are proposed to link the relative permeabilities to the anisotropy factor these results improve our understanding of immiscible displacement in rough fractures and can be useful for predicting two phase flow in fractured media at the large scale where geomechanical and chemical processes produce anisotropic roughness keywords fractured medium rough walls anisotropy immiscible displacement simulation 1 introduction a number of important engineering and environmental applications such as geological storage of co2 nuclear waste disposal petroleum recovery and non aqueous phase liquid contamination and remediation often encounter subsurface environments characterized by fractured media common in these applications is the involvement of the process of two phase flow in fractured media due to the complex interplay between the void space geometries and the physics of two phase flow challenges arise in predicting the flow behavior and evaluating the efficiency and environmental impact of the engineering activities a thorough understanding of two phase flow behavior in single fractures is fundamental and critical for accurate prediction and process optimization of field scale applications the present study addresses the effect of anisotropic aperture fields on two phase flow in single fractures natural fractures are generally rough walled brown et al 1986 glover et al 1998 resulting in variable apertures within a fracture over the last three decades considerable effort has been devoted to characterization of the complex geometries and wall topographies of natural rock fractures and to measurement of fracture aperture fields a number of approaches have been

modern visualization techniques especially for transparent fracture replicas has allowed for fundamental and detailed investigations of two phase flow in single fractures a basic process underlying two phase flow is immiscible displacement that is the displacement of one fluid by another immiscible one immiscible displacement in individual variable aperture fractures is mainly controlled by the interplay between capillary gravitational and viscous forces detwiler et al 2009 giving rise to various regimes of flow dynamics and phase distributions hu et al 2018 experimental studies using

on fluid fluid displacement patterns saturation profiles entrapped fluid saturations and relative permeabilities 2 methodology 2 1 modeling immiscible displacement in variable aperture fractures being able to computationally model immiscible displacement is essential for further understanding of multi phase flow properties of fractures immiscible displacement in rough fractures has been modeled by several approaches in the past including invasion percolation ip models e g pyrak nolte et al 1992 meakin et al 1992 glass et al 1998 neuweiler et al 2004 yang et al 2012 li et al 2014 huo and benson 2016 pore scale models e g dou et al 2013 chen et al 2018 pore network models e g hughes and blunt 2001 karpyn and piri 2007 ferer et al 2011 and continuum based models e g murphy and thomson 1993 yang et al 2013a wang and cardenas 2018 each approach has its range of applicability among these approaches invasion percolation ip being simple and physically sound for slow flows has been extensively applied to modeling immiscible displacement during the last three decades e g pyrak nolte et al 1992 meakin et al 1992 glass et al 1998 neuweiler et al 2004 yang et al 2012 which has contributed to the majority of the modeling work for immiscible two phase flow in rough fractures in this study we use a modified ip model yang et al 2012 to simulate immiscible displacement in variable aperture fractures we focus on the drainage process that is displacement of a wetting fluid by a non wetting one capillary dominated flow condition is assumed meaning that the effect of viscous forces on the displacement is negligible compared to that of capillary forces equivalently the capillary number μinvv γ is assumed to be sufficiently small where μinv is the invading phase viscosity γ is the interfacial tension and v is the mean flow velocity we consider horizontal fractures so gravity effects due to density difference in the two fluids are ignored the void space between the two fracture walls is represented as an ensemble of parallelepipedic boxes on a two dimensional 2d lattice over the mean fracture plane each box is denoted by a site in the following the sites are assumed to have locally parallel plates representing the fracture wall surfaces the fracture wall roughness or topography is represented in the spatially varying aperture b each site is characterized by its side length l and the associated aperture b i j in ip the fluid fluid displacement is simulated as a quasi static interface advancement problem the interface advancement is given by a sequence of discrete invasion steps the location of each invasion step is determined by ranking of capillary pressure threshold pc at all sites occupied by the defending fluid on the fluid fluid interface the site with the smallest capillary pressure threshold is selected at each step proper calculation of the capillary pressure between the wetting and nonwetting fluids is of utmost importance for simulating fluid invasion and determining phase distribution and structures capillary pressure depends on the interfacial tension and the curvature of the fluid fluid interface the young laplace equation glass et al 1998 gives the local capillary pressure threshold pc for a given site 1 p c γ κ 1 κ 2 γ 1 r 1 1 r 2 γ 2 cos θ b 1 r 2 where κ 1 and κ 2 are the two principal curvatures at the position considered r 1 and r 2 are the two principal radii of curvature and θ is the equilibrium contact angle a schematic of the interface curvatures is shown in fig 1 we refer to κ 1 as out of plane curvature and to κ 2 as in plane curvature accordingly r 1 and r 2 are termed as the out of plane and in plane radius of curvature respectively the out of plane radius of curvature r 1 is related to the local aperture b it is spatially varying but constant throughout the simulation for a given aperture field however the in plane radius of curvature r 2 is non local and depends on the interface configuration along the fracture plane it is invading history dependent the aperture variability of a fracture influencing the out of plane curvature tends to promote interface roughening while the in plane curvature tends to smoothen the interface it is the competition between the effects of aperture variability and the in plane smoothening that controls capillary dominated displacements in rough fractures glass et al 2003 it should be noted that a standard ip model wilkinson and willemsen 1983 does not taken into account the non local in plane radius of curvature r 2 it has been shown that the experimentally observed displacement patterns can be well reproduced by simulations with modification of the standard ip model to account for the effect of in plane curvature yang et al 2012 to calculate the in plane curvatures in a modified ip model glass et al 1998 proposed to use an empirical length scale half of the correlation length of the aperture field and an average angle extracted from the local phase occupancy configuration however this method would then not be applicable for cases with anisotropic aperture correlation and cases without finite correlation length a generalized method based on geometric arguments is proposed in ref yang et al 2012 by implementing a procedure called adaptive circle fitting to obtain the in plane curvatures during each invasion step thus overcoming the limitation of the approach using an empirical length scale related to the correlation length defending phase trapping yang et al 2016 is also considered in this study using an efficient bidirectional search algorithm the following assumptions are invoked in this study gravity and viscous forces are not considered in this study film flow and corner flow are not taken into account and contact pinning are not considered either 2 2 fracture aperture fields measurements and analysis of surface profiles of natural fractures have established that fracture surface topography can be represented in terms of self affine geometries brown 1995 schmittbuhl et al 1995 to describe fracture wall surfaces brown 1995 defined a power spectrum for surface roughness of the form 2 g ξ ξ 1 2 h where ξ is the wavenumber in the spatial frequency domain h is the hurst exponent which is characteristic of the fracture walls self affinity typically in the rang of 0 5 h 1 to consider anisotropic roughness eq 2 is modified as follows 3 g ξ ξ x 2 ξ y a 2 1 2 h where ξx and ξy are the wavenumbers in the x and y directions respectively a is the anisotropy factor of a fracture wall surface for a 1 the anisotropy is parallel to the x direction for a 1 the wall surface is isotropic and for a 1 the anisotropy is transverse to the x direction using eq 3 for amplitude on grid points together with random numbers for phase angles we obtain a field of complex numbers which after an inverse fourier transform corresponds to heights of a self affine surface the two opposing surfaces of a natural rock fracture do not have a perfect match brown et al 1986 it is well established that the two surfaces are correlated at large wavelengths but below a certain length scale are increasingly uncorrelated brown 1995 glover et al 1998 this length scale is called a mismatch or cutoff length scale lc the corresponding cutoff wavenumber is ξc the mismatch can be caused by a number of factors including surface damage during the fracturing thermal effects and plastic deformation chemical reaction and gouge formation due to load change the aperture field is the height between the two surfaces of a fracture due to the mismatch characteristic the aperture profile of fracture lacks large roughness features lang et al 2018 implementing the theory of brown brown 1995 we generate sixty realizations of aperture fields 1024 256 for each of a 1 2 4 and 8 the other parameters are the same for each set h 0 8 ξ c 64 the mean aperture b 0 3 mm the standard deviation of apertures σ b 0 07 mm and the uniform grid spacing l 0 2 mm the values of these parameters all fall within the range reported by brown brown 1995 who investigated a large number of natural joint samples with different rock types including tuff granite basalt granodiorite rhyolitic dike siltstone and sandstone since we present a generic study the parameters are not specific to a certain rock type the anisotropy of wall surfaces represented by the anisotropy factor a is often also manifested in the aperture fields thompson and brown 1991 the anisotropy of which may need to be defined differently it should be noted that the anisotropy factor a may differ from the anisotropy of the hydraulic properties of the fractures in this study we also calculate the ratio between the correlation lengths in the x and y directions λx λy as another representation of the anisotropy of the aperture fields here the correlation length is defined as the separation distance at which the gaussian semivariogram reaches 95 percent of its sill we use the ratio between the permeabilities in the x and y directions kx ky to represent the anisotropy in the hydraulic property see table 1 example aperture fields with different anisotropy factors are shown in fig 2 one can clearly observe the long channels of large apertures for high anisotropy ratio a 2 3 simulation scenario we consider quasi static drainage in horizontal fractures of dimensions l x l y 204 8 mm 51 2 mm in the following we set the length of the fracture l l x the nonwetting fluid invades from the short edge on the left and displaces the wetting fluid through the short edge on the right the two long edges are closed boundaries the displacement continues until the invading phase reach the short edge on the right i e breakthrough the displacement could also be simulated by forcing the nonwetting fluid along the y direction but this would be not representative of natural conditions free of boundary effects where the displacement is expected to mainly follow the direction of the longer correlation length 2 4 fracture permeability for single phase flow a depth averaged steady state fluid pressure field p x y can be obtained by solving the reynolds equation eq 4 detwiler et al 2009 which is 4 b x y v 0 where b x y is the aperture field and the flow velocity is given by the local cubic law 5 v b 2 12 μ p x y where μ is the viscosity of the fluid over the two dimensional rectangular domain we solve the reynolds equation using a finite volume method we do so for both the x and y directions for example in the case of main flow parallel to the x direction we specify two constant pressure boundaries along the two edges perpendicular to the x direction and assign no flow boundaries to the other two edges parallel to the main flow the permeability kx of the fracture can be obtained by jaeger et al 2009 6 k x μ q p i n p o u t a where pin is the specified inlet pressure pout is the specified outlet pressure q is the total inflow rate through the inlet edge obtained by solving eq 4 and then integrating the volumetric flux along the inlet and a is the area of the inlet the permeability along the y direction ky can be obtained in a similar way we compute kx and ky for all the 240 fracture aperture fields fig 3 gives the arithmetic mean of 60 realizations of aperture fields for each anisotropy factor a the computed ensemble mean of permeability kx for the isotropic case can be compared to the approximate solution by zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 for a 1 we obtain k x 6 6 10 9 which is very close to the value 6 3 10 9 according to eq 48 in zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 theoretical and numerical works in the literature have also explored the ratio between permeabilities in two different directions for anisotropy hydraulic conductivity permeability fields in heterogeneous porous media e g dagan 1986 gelhar 1986 bear et al 1987 zarlenga et al 2018 and rough fractures e g auradou et al 2005 for a 8 we have k x k y 1 70 which is within the range 1 1 75 obtained in an experimental and numerical study auradou et al 2005 our result of kx ky is somewhat larger than that 1 30 estimated by a closed form equation ref zarlenga et al 2018 eq 6 recently obtained for heterogeneous porous media this discrepancy might be attributed to two important differences between porous media and rough fractures in the governing equations for flow and in the dimensionality 3d versus 2d in particular in contrast to the porous media flow equation the reynolds equation eq 4 used to solve for pressure contains the aperture as a spatially varying coefficient to the velocity 2 5 relative permeability simulations of the fluid fluid displacement in a fracture produce a phase distribution using the information of phase distribution we can compute the relative permeabilities of the nonwetting k rn and wetting k rw phases in this study we use the single phase flow averaging method eichel et al 2005 to calculate relative permeabilities this method assumes that the flow of one fluid has no impact on that of the other this allows us to compute the relative permeability of one phase while treating the area occupied by the other phase as impermeable imposing a pressure gradient along one direction we solve the reynolds equation using the aperture fields and phase geometries separately for the nonwetting phase and the wetting phase from the total flow rate at the inlet and the pressure gradient we obtain the effective permeability of the phase considered k eff each effective permeability is associated with its underlying phase distribution from which a saturation s of the considered phase can be calculated the relative permeability is defined as the ratio between the values of k eff at s and at full saturation s 1 performing the above procedure for all sub domains of size 256 256 of each simulated displacement patterns we obtain relative permeability data for both the nonwetting and wetting phases and for all cases of surface anisotropy factors it should be noted that relative permeabilities in our cases should generally be expected to be a tensor rather than a scalar keilegavlen et al 2012 wolff et al 2012 yang et al 2013c however it is still a challenging issue to properly handle tensorial relative permeabilities in macroscopic two phase flow numerical models bear et al 1987 wolff et al 2012 here we only calculate the relative permeabilities for both phases in the principal directions of flow k rn and k rw for the x direction and k rn and k rw for the y direction 3 results in this section we first present the fluid fluid displacement patterns for the example aperture fields and analyze the characteristics of the spatiotemporal evolution of invading fluid distribution then we investigate the ensemble characteristics of fluid saturation profile fractal dimension of the invading phase and interfacial tension for each set of stochastic simulations we also study the dependence of relative permeabilities on the anisotropy factor a these characteristics are chosen because they may be of importance for understanding of two phase flow behavior at the continuum fracture scale 3 1 displacement patterns fig 4 presents the simulated displacement patterns at breakthrough corresponding to the example aperture fields fig 2 it can be seen that when the aperture field is isotropic fig 4a the invasion pattern is characterized by tortuous fingers as the anisotropy factor increases the fingers become less and less tortuous this is an expected result since the large aperture zones become longer with increasing a and the invading nonwetting fluid prefers large aperture regions in the case of the highest anisotropy factor considered fig 4d the invading fluid produces a dendritic structure initially and then percolates the fracture with an almost straight finger the invading phase saturation at breakthrough s n bt for these example patterns from fig 4a to d is 0 50 0 45 0 27 and 0 27 respectively the effect of aperture field anisotropy on s n bt will be examined more carefully in the following subsections visual inspection of the example patterns also suggests that capillary dominated displacement in a rough fracture is strongly controlled by the aperture field geometry the displacement pattern of the isotropic aperture field see fig 4a resembles the classical capillary fingering pattern for porous media wilkinson and willemsen 1983 ferer et al 2003 the box counting fractal dimension d f of the invading phase at breakthrough is 1 80 for this pattern fig 4a which is close to the established value 1 82 for invasion percolation with trapping wilkinson and willemsen 1983 for random porous media however for the strongly anisotropic aperture field fig 2d the resemblance is destroyed by the long correlation length of apertures in the displacement direction with a fractal dimension d f of 1 68 of the invading phase the fractal dimensions d f computed by the box counting method of the simulated invading patterns at breakthrough are presented in fig 5 generally d f decreases with increasing anisotropy factor with the median values of d f being 1 79 for a 1 and 1 70 for a 8 in addition the inter realization variability also becomes stronger as a increases the dependence of fractal dimension on the correlation structure and the inter realization variability may suggest that the use of fractal dimension for quantitative comparison between experiments of different pore geometries should be performed more carefully by considering the difference in the underlying void geometries and correlation lengths knackstedt et al 2001 3 2 invading phase saturation the front propagation of the displacement can also be examined by a spatiotemporal plot of the saturation profile along the x direction s n y x see fig 6 here s n y x is calculated as the number of sites occupied by the invading phase at a given location of x divided by the total number of sites in the y direction in fig 6 the leading front the edge of the black region starts from normalized position x l 0 at beginning t t bt 0 of the displacement towards breakthrough x l 1 and t t bt 1 one can observe that for the isotropic aperture field see fig 6a the spatiotemporal evolution of s n y is featured by gradual advancement of the leading front increasing the degree of anisotropy of aperture fields leads to larger jumps of the invading tip location this is expected as the large aperture regions becomes elongated with increasing anisotropy factor besides the values of the overall invading phase saturation in the fracture at breakthrough s n bt for four individual simulations given previously the ensemble characteristics of s n bt needs to be compared fig 7 shows that in general s n bt decreases with increasing anisotropy factor the arithmetic means of s n bt for a 1 2 4 and 8 are 0 52 0 42 0 36 and 0 31 the decreasing trend implies that given the same volume of the invading nonwetting phase the fluid is expected to travel on average longer distances in the fractures with a larger anisotropy factor fig 8 presents the invading phase saturation profile s n y x for both individual realizations and their ensemble averages from the four individual saturation profiles fig 8a d it is hard to pinpoint the impact of anisotropy on the s n y x due to the randomness however ensemble average saturation profiles show clear dependence on the anisotropy for isotropic aperture fields the ensemble average of s n y x fluctuates around 0 54 except near the inlet and outlet boundaries fig 8e when the aperture field is anisotropic a 2 the ensemble average of s n y x shows a decreasing trend from the inlet to the outlet boundaries leading to a smaller overall saturation at breakthrough s n bt than that in the isotropic case the individual saturation profiles are further explored in terms of their power spectral density γ ω where ω is the normalized spatial frequency we use the welch method welch 1967 to compute γ ω for each simulated saturation profile the saturation profiles are trimmed by 10 of the data on both ends to eliminate the influence of the left and right boundaries of the domain fig 9 shows that for all anisotropy factors γ ω of s n y x decays as a power law with ω in addition the aperture anisotropy does not affect the power law exponent i e γ ω ω β with β 2 5 for all cases this result is indicative of a self organization of phase distribution for two phase flow in heterogeneous media 3 3 entrapped saturation and interfacial area fluid trapping during immiscible displacement is an important microscale process that is responsible for the effect of residual saturations in multiphase flow at the macroscale here we study the defending fluid wetting phase trapping in the capillary dominated flow entrapped wetting phase saturation s w ent is computed as the volume occupied the trapped fluid at breakthrough of the invading phase divided by the total volume of the fracture fig 10 a shows that ensemblewise the defending fluid trapping becomes less prominent as the anisotropy factor increases the median value of s w ent decreases by over a factor of 10 from 0 35 for a 1 to 0 029 for a 8 the strong dependence of fluid trapping on the anisotropy of the aperture field can be explained straightforwardly fluid trapping results either from the merge of two portions of the fluid fluid interface that travel ahead of the rest of the interface or from the intersection of the fluid fluid interface with the closed boundaries increasing the correlation length of aperture field in the displacement direction means a decreased probability of the invading fluid to travel in the transverse direction leading to fewer events of merging and intersecting with the closed boundaries fluid fluid interfacial area is a critical parameter controlling the inter phase mass transfer processes important in contaminant remediation problems detwiler et al 2009 yang et al 2013b for comparison of interfacial areas the specific interfacial area is usually used which is defined as the interfacial area divided by the invading fluid volume in this study we compute the specific interfacial area at breakthrough a int for all simulations it should be noted that only the propagating interface between the invading phase and the non trapped defending phase is taken into account for the calculation that is the interface between the invading fluid and the trapped fluid is excluded because its contribution to inter phase mass transfer is negligible compared with that of the propagating interface fig 10b shows that in general a int is larger for higher anisotropy ratios meanwhile the inter realization variation increases with an increasing degree of anisotropy the fact that a int increases with a is a result of the long fingers stretching in the displacement direction 3 4 relative permeabilities relative permeability to the nonwetting phase in the direction parallel to the main displacement direction k rn as a function of the wetting phase saturation is plotted in fig 11 the anisotropy of the aperture field strongly influences the relative permeability generally increasing the anisotropy factor of the aperture field leads to higher k rn the larger the anisotropy factor the closer the relative permeability to the linear relationship between k rn and 1 s w s n it is interesting to observe that some data points of k rn for a 4 are even above the 1 1 line this is because in these situations the nonwetting fluid occupies the long channels of large aperture high permeability and forms straight fingers i e no phase obstruction due to the wetting fluid the relative permeability data k rn for the nonwetting phase can be well fitted with a simple relationship 7 k rn 1 s w 1 1 8 a where the anisotropy factor a is a parameter this relationship captures the observation that the exponent to the nonwetting phase saturation 1 s w decreases with increasing a indicating that the relative permeability k rn approaches a linear relationship with s w for high anisotropy ratios a 4 and 8 relative permeability to the nonwetting phase in the direction perpendicular to the main displacement direction k rn as a function of the wetting phase saturation is plotted in fig 12 again the anisotropy of the aperture field strongly influences k rn contrary to the results for k rn increasing the anisotropy factor of the aperture field leads to lower k rn interestingly the k rn data can be fitted by an equation similar to eq 7 only with the anisotropy ratio replaced by its inverse 8 k rn 1 s w 1 1 8 a relative permeability to the wetting phase in the direction parallel to the main displacement direction k rw as a function of the wetting phase saturation is plotted in fig 13 it can be observed that increasing the anisotropy factor of the aperture field leads to higher k rw again this result suggests the weaker phase interference for higher degree of anisotropy in the aperture field we simply fit the relative permeability data for the wetting phase with the following relationship 9 k rw max 0 s w 0 55 a 0 22 1 0 55 a 0 22 relative permeability to the wetting phase in the direction perpendicular to the main displacement direction k rw is zero for all simulations this is because the nonwetting phase invades along the x direction and connects the inlet and outlet which results in no continuous path for the wetting phase between the two lateral boundaries 4 discussion we have investigated the effect of anisotropic aperture fields on two phase flow in rough fractures using numerical simulations capillary dominated fluid fluid displacement has been simulated for synthetic rough fractures with aperture fields of various anisotropic factors the results show that the aperture field anisotropy promotes elongated capillary fingers leading to different phase structures and spatiotemporal evolution of saturation profiles than those in the isotropic case aperture anisotropy significantly reduces the nonwetting phase saturation at breakthrough this means that for a given volume of the nonwetting fluid earlier breakthrough is expected for a rough fracture with a higher degree of aperture anisotropy entrapped wetting phase saturation also decreases with increasing anisotropy factor the specific fluid fluid interfacial area is found to be larger for higher anisotropy factor in the limit of strong anisotropy the displacement pattern characterized by long straight fingers is a result of the increased correlation length in the displacement direction previous works in the literature e g knackstedt et al 2001 in the isotropic case has demonstrated that spatial correlation strongly influences the invasion behavior in ip even small scale correlations can have a profound effect on the saturation measured at large scales knackstedt et al 2001 the hypothesis is that the site occupation probability is modified by the correlation length increasing the correlation length in the flow direction favors the invasion of large apertures for a given number of invaded sites in natural conditions free of the influence of boundaries the displacement is expected to mainly follow the direction of the longer correlation length however there can be situations where why fluid fluid displacement perpendicular to the direction of larger aperture channels can happen one example is the injection of fluid to a fault zone that has experience slip motivated by this scenario we have also simulated displacement along the y direction see supplementary material fig s1 in this simulation scenario when the anisotropy ratio is high 4 the invading fluid will preferentially extend along the large aperture channels parallel to the x direction until blocked by the no flow boundary i e the two short edges of the domain with the forced flow along the y direction the invading fluid eventually connects in a zig zag manner to the outlet at the breakthrough this scenario results in significantly larger nonwetting phase saturations for anisotropy aperture fields a 1 than those in the scenario of displacing along the x direction due to the channelized displacement pattern for anisotropy ratio a 4 and a 8 the ensemble average saturation profiles at breakthrough show a continuously decreasing trend with the distance we have performed additional simulations with elongated domains l x a l and l 1024 l according to the anisotropy ratio such that in each case the same number of horizontal correlation lengths has been passed by the displacing fluid at the time of breakthrough we find that the saturation eventually stabilizes with the distance see fig 14 a the overall saturations for a 1 are smaller than those in the simulations with fixed domain length l x 1024 l in addition it is shown that when ignoring the in plane curvature the behavior is similar but with smaller saturations see fig 14b due to the lack of interface smoothening effect yang et al 2016 the effect of aperture field anisotropy on relative permeabilities has been quantitatively analyzed the results show that in the x direction the relative permeabilities both to the nonwetting and wetting phases are higher for aperture fields with a stronger degree of anisotropy this effect is a result of the presence of long straight fingers for the strongly anisotropic case which suppress phase interference on the contrary in the y direction the relative permeability to the nonwetting phase decreases with increasing anisotropy ratio in effect the aperture field anisotropy causes a strong directional dependence of the relative permeabilities the influence of aperture field anisotropy on relative permeability is larger than on the fully saturated permeability for instance the fully saturated permeability kx increases by a factor of 1 3 from a 1 to a 8 the fitted relative permeability of the nonwetting phase k rn at s w 0 5 increases by a factor of 2 9 from a 1 to a 8 it should be noted that the calculation of relative permeabilities is performed on subdomains the reason for performing the calculation of relative permeability in subdomains is to allow the relative permeabilities to be computed for cases with small anisotropy ratios because the width of the simulation domain ly is finite the invading nonwetting phase will almost inevitably touch the transverse boundaries in cases of small anisotropy ratios a 2 thus there will be no continuous pathways of wetting fluid connecting the inlet and the outlet if the relative permeability calculations are performed on the entire domain we will obtain zero wetting phase permeability for all simulations with a 2 which is clearly not physical to circumvent this issue the relative permeability calculations have been performed in subdomains in this study however one needs to be careful about the domain size and the scale effect for the relative permeability calculations to be valid the fluid phase distribution needs to cover a sufficiently large volume area typically a domain length of several correlation lengths is enough for the calculation of macroscale quantities in our simulations the subdomains used for calculating the relative permeability meet this requirement with the exception of the case a 8 by performing the relative permeability calculations based on simulations with the elongated domains the subdomains are extended proportionately we confirm that the obtained relative permeability saturation relations previously are still valid the calculated relative permeabilities as a function of saturation are fitted using equations eqs 7 9 where the anisotropy factor is a parameter the obtained empirical equations link fracture scale relative permeabilities to aperture anisotropy for the first time and are useful for predicting two phase flow in fractured media at the large scale where the anisotropy producing mechanisms are a concern it should be pointed out that macro scale constitutive relationships are also a function of statistical parameters of the isotropic aperture field such as the mean aperture standard deviation and the hurst exponent e g ye et al 2015 wang and cardenas 2018 how these parameters affect the two phase flow properties in the anisotropic case remains to be investigated the anisotropic factor a in the power spectrum function eq 3 essentially reflects the ratio between correlation lengths in the x and y directions see table 1 even though a varies by a factor of 8 the ratio between absolute permeability k x k y only changes within a factor of 1 70 this is mainly because even in the strongly anisotropic case here a 8 the aperture coefficient of variation σ b b 0 07 0 3 is not very big and the large aperture regions remain well connected despite the small anisotropy ratio in terms of absolute permeability the relative permeabilities show a strong dependence on the anisotropy figs 11 13 this indicates that anisotropy often overlooked might partly explain the large variability in relative permeabilities for different rock samples it should be pointed out that this study assumes capillary dominated condition in simulating fluid fluid displacement in the rough fractures this simplification is commonly taken to save computational time especially in cases where in total hundreds of simulations are needed for stochastically generated random aperture fields when viscous forces are taken into account the displacement patterns also depend on the flow rate and viscosity ratio giving rise to viscous fingering and compact displacement patterns the combined influence of capillary and viscous forces on two phase flow properties in anisotropic fractures needs further experimental and modeling studies furthermore this study focuses on drainage future work is needed to obtain capillary pressure and relative permeability curves under imbibition conditions and to study their hysteretic behavior 5 conclusions in summary the impact of aperture field anisotropy on two phase flow properties in rough fractures has been studied it is found that the spatiotemporal distribution of fluid phases is strongly influenced by the aperture field anisotropy leading to lower nonwetting phase saturation and entrapped wetting phase saturation at breakthrough and higher specific interfacial area the aperture field anisotropy also leads to increased relative permeabilities to both phases in the direction parallel to the displacement and decreased relative permeabilities in the direction perpendicular to the displacement empirical equations are proposed to link the relative permeabilities to the anisotropy factor these results are especially useful for predicting two phase flow in fractured media at the large scale where geomechanical and chemical processes produce anisotropic aperture fields acknowledgment financial support from national natural

578,the void space geometry of rough fractures is one of most important factors controlling two phase flow in fractured media this paper presents a numerical study on the effect of aperture field anisotropy on two phase flow properties in rough fractures by using a power spectrum based method we generate multiple realizations of synthetic rough fractures with aperture fields of different anisotropy factors fluid fluid displacement in these fractures is simulated by a modified invasion percolation model it is found that the spatiotemporal distribution of fluid phases is strongly influenced by the aperture field anisotropy on average both the nonwetting phase saturation and the entrapped wetting phase saturations at breakthrough decrease with increasing anisotropy factor but the specific interfacial area is larger for a higher anisotropy ratio relative permeabilities to both phases in the direction parallel to the displacement increase with the anisotropy factor indicating a reduced phase interference due to aperture field anisotropy empirical equations are proposed to link the relative permeabilities to the anisotropy factor these results improve our understanding of immiscible displacement in rough fractures and can be useful for predicting two phase flow in fractured media at the large scale where geomechanical and chemical processes produce anisotropic roughness keywords fractured medium rough walls anisotropy immiscible displacement simulation 1 introduction a number of important engineering and environmental applications such as geological storage of co2 nuclear waste disposal petroleum recovery and non aqueous phase liquid contamination and remediation often encounter subsurface environments characterized by fractured media common in these applications is the involvement of the process of two phase flow in fractured media due to the complex interplay between the void space geometries and the physics of two phase flow challenges arise in predicting the flow behavior and evaluating the efficiency and environmental impact of the engineering activities a thorough understanding of two phase flow behavior in single fractures is fundamental and critical for accurate prediction and process optimization of field scale applications the present study addresses the effect of anisotropic aperture fields on two phase flow in single fractures natural fractures are generally rough walled brown et al 1986 glover et al 1998 resulting in variable apertures within a fracture over the last three decades considerable effort has been devoted to characterization of the complex geometries and wall topographies of natural rock fractures and to measurement of fracture aperture fields a number of approaches have been

modern visualization techniques especially for transparent fracture replicas has allowed for fundamental and detailed investigations of two phase flow in single fractures a basic process underlying two phase flow is immiscible displacement that is the displacement of one fluid by another immiscible one immiscible displacement in individual variable aperture fractures is mainly controlled by the interplay between capillary gravitational and viscous forces detwiler et al 2009 giving rise to various regimes of flow dynamics and phase distributions hu et al 2018 experimental studies using

aperture fields on the immiscible displacement in rough fractures we focus on the capillary dominated drainage process by using numerical simulations we analyze the effect of aperture field anisotropy on fluid fluid displacement patterns saturation profiles entrapped fluid saturations and relative permeabilities 2 methodology 2 1 modeling immiscible displacement in variable aperture fractures being able to computationally model immiscible displacement is essential for further understanding of multi phase flow properties of fractures immiscible displacement in rough fractures has been modeled by several approaches in the past including invasion percolation ip models e g pyrak nolte et al 1992 meakin et al 1992 glass et al 1998 neuweiler et al 2004 yang et al 2012 li et al 2014 huo and benson 2016 pore scale models e g dou et al 2013 chen et al 2018 pore network models e g hughes and blunt 2001 karpyn and piri 2007 ferer et al 2011 and continuum based models e g murphy and thomson 1993 yang et al 2013a wang and cardenas 2018 each approach has its range of applicability among these approaches invasion percolation ip being simple and physically sound for slow flows has been extensively applied to modeling immiscible displacement during the last three decades e g pyrak nolte et al 1992 meakin et al 1992 glass et al 1998 neuweiler et al 2004 yang et al 2012 which has contributed to the majority of the modeling work for immiscible two phase flow in rough fractures in this study we use a modified ip model yang et al 2012 to simulate immiscible displacement in variable aperture fractures we focus on the drainage process that is displacement of a wetting fluid by a non wetting one capillary dominated flow condition is assumed meaning that the effect of viscous forces on the displacement is negligible compared to that of capillary forces equivalently the capillary number μinvv γ is assumed to be sufficiently small where μinv is the invading phase viscosity γ is the interfacial tension and v is the mean flow velocity we consider horizontal fractures so gravity effects due to density difference in the two fluids are ignored the void space between the two fracture walls is represented as an ensemble of parallelepipedic boxes on a two dimensional 2d lattice over the mean fracture plane each box is denoted by a site in the following the sites are assumed to have locally parallel plates representing the fracture wall surfaces the fracture wall roughness or topography is represented in the spatially varying aperture b each site is characterized by its side length l and the associated aperture b i j in ip the fluid fluid displacement is simulated as a quasi static interface advancement problem the interface advancement is given by a sequence of discrete invasion steps the location of each invasion step is determined by ranking of capillary pressure threshold pc at all sites occupied by the defending fluid on the fluid fluid interface the site with the smallest capillary pressure threshold is selected at each step proper calculation of the capillary pressure between the wetting and nonwetting fluids is of utmost importance for simulating fluid invasion and determining phase distribution and structures capillary pressure depends on the interfacial tension and the curvature of the fluid fluid interface the young laplace equation glass et al 1998 gives the local capillary pressure threshold pc for a given site 1 p c γ κ 1 κ 2 γ 1 r 1 1 r 2 γ 2 cos θ b 1 r 2 where κ 1 and κ 2 are the two principal curvatures at the position considered r 1 and r 2 are the two principal radii of curvature and θ is the equilibrium contact angle a schematic of the interface curvatures is shown in fig 1 we refer to κ 1 as out of plane curvature and to κ 2 as in plane curvature accordingly r 1 and r 2 are termed as the out of plane and in plane radius of curvature respectively the out of plane radius of curvature r 1 is related to the local aperture b it is spatially varying but constant throughout the simulation for a given aperture field however the in plane radius of curvature r 2 is non local and depends on the interface configuration along the fracture plane it is invading history dependent the aperture variability of a fracture influencing the out of plane curvature tends to promote interface roughening while the in plane curvature tends to smoothen the interface it is the competition between the effects of aperture variability and the in plane smoothening that controls capillary dominated displacements in rough fractures glass et al 2003 it should be noted that a standard ip model wilkinson and willemsen 1983 does not taken into account the non local in plane radius of curvature r 2 it has been shown that the experimentally observed displacement patterns can be well reproduced by simulations with modification of the standard ip model to account for the effect of in plane curvature yang et al 2012 to calculate the in plane curvatures in a modified ip model glass et al 1998 proposed to use an empirical length scale half of the correlation length of the aperture field and an average angle extracted from the local phase occupancy configuration however this method would then not be applicable for cases with anisotropic aperture correlation and cases without finite correlation length a generalized method based on geometric arguments is proposed in ref yang et al 2012 by implementing a procedure called adaptive circle fitting to obtain the in plane curvatures during each invasion step thus overcoming the limitation of the approach using an empirical length scale related to the correlation length defending phase trapping yang et al 2016 is also considered in this study using an efficient bidirectional search algorithm the following assumptions are invoked in this study gravity and viscous forces are not considered in this study film flow and corner flow are not taken into account and contact pinning are not considered either 2 2 fracture aperture fields measurements and analysis of surface profiles of natural fractures have established that fracture surface topography can be represented in terms of self affine geometries brown 1995 schmittbuhl et al 1995 to describe fracture wall surfaces brown 1995 defined a power spectrum for surface roughness of the form 2 g ξ ξ 1 2 h where ξ is the wavenumber in the spatial frequency domain h is the hurst exponent which is characteristic of the fracture walls self affinity typically in the rang of 0 5 h 1 to consider anisotropic roughness eq 2 is modified as follows 3 g ξ ξ x 2 ξ y a 2 1 2 h where ξx and ξy are the wavenumbers in the x and y directions respectively a is the anisotropy factor of a fracture wall surface for a 1 the anisotropy is parallel to the x direction for a 1 the wall surface is isotropic and for a 1 the anisotropy is transverse to the x direction using eq 3 for amplitude on grid points together with random numbers for phase angles we obtain a field of complex numbers which after an inverse fourier transform corresponds to heights of a self affine surface the two opposing surfaces of a natural rock fracture do not have a perfect match brown et al 1986 it is well established that the two surfaces are correlated at large wavelengths but below a certain length scale are increasingly uncorrelated brown 1995 glover et al 1998 this length scale is called a mismatch or cutoff length scale lc the corresponding cutoff wavenumber is ξc the mismatch can be caused by a number of factors including surface damage during the fracturing thermal effects and plastic deformation chemical reaction and gouge formation due to load change the aperture field is the height between the two surfaces of a fracture due to the mismatch characteristic the aperture profile of fracture lacks large roughness features lang et al 2018 implementing the theory of brown brown 1995 we generate sixty realizations of aperture fields 1024 256 for each of a 1 2 4 and 8 the other parameters are the same for each set h 0 8 ξ c 64 the mean aperture b 0 3 mm the standard deviation of apertures σ b 0 07 mm and the uniform grid spacing l 0 2 mm the values of these parameters all fall within the range reported by brown brown 1995 who investigated a large number of natural joint samples with different rock types including tuff granite basalt granodiorite rhyolitic dike siltstone and sandstone since we present a generic study the parameters are not specific to a certain rock type the anisotropy of wall surfaces represented by the anisotropy factor a is often also manifested in the aperture fields thompson and brown 1991 the anisotropy of which may need to be defined differently it should be noted that the anisotropy factor a may differ from the anisotropy of the hydraulic properties of the fractures in this study we also calculate the ratio between the correlation lengths in the x and y directions λx λy as another representation of the anisotropy of the aperture fields here the correlation length is defined as the separation distance at which the gaussian semivariogram reaches 95 percent of its sill we use the ratio between the permeabilities in the x and y directions kx ky to represent the anisotropy in the hydraulic property see table 1 example aperture fields with different anisotropy factors are shown in fig 2 one can clearly observe the long channels of large apertures for high anisotropy ratio a 2 3 simulation scenario we consider quasi static drainage in horizontal fractures of dimensions l x l y 204 8 mm 51 2 mm in the following we set the length of the fracture l l x the nonwetting fluid invades from the short edge on the left and displaces the wetting fluid through the short edge on the right the two long edges are closed boundaries the displacement continues until the invading phase reach the short edge on the right i e breakthrough the displacement could also be simulated by forcing the nonwetting fluid along the y direction but this would be not representative of natural conditions free of boundary effects where the displacement is expected to mainly follow the direction of the longer correlation length 2 4 fracture permeability for single phase flow a depth averaged steady state fluid pressure field p x y can be obtained by solving the reynolds equation eq 4 detwiler et al 2009 which is 4 b x y v 0 where b x y is the aperture field and the flow velocity is given by the local cubic law 5 v b 2 12 μ p x y where μ is the viscosity of the fluid over the two dimensional rectangular domain we solve the reynolds equation using a finite volume method we do so for both the x and y directions for example in the case of main flow parallel to the x direction we specify two constant pressure boundaries along the two edges perpendicular to the x direction and assign no flow boundaries to the other two edges parallel to the main flow the permeability kx of the fracture can be obtained by jaeger et al 2009 6 k x μ q p i n p o u t a where pin is the specified inlet pressure pout is the specified outlet pressure q is the total inflow rate through the inlet edge obtained by solving eq 4 and then integrating the volumetric flux along the inlet and a is the area of the inlet the permeability along the y direction ky can be obtained in a similar way we compute kx and ky for all the 240 fracture aperture fields fig 3 gives the arithmetic mean of 60 realizations of aperture fields for each anisotropy factor a the computed ensemble mean of permeability kx for the isotropic case can be compared to the approximate solution by zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 for a 1 we obtain k x 6 6 10 9 which is very close to the value 6 3 10 9 according to eq 48 in zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 theoretical and numerical works in the literature have also explored the ratio between permeabilities in two different directions for anisotropy hydraulic conductivity permeability fields in heterogeneous porous media e g dagan 1986 gelhar 1986 bear et al 1987 zarlenga et al 2018 and rough fractures e g auradou et al 2005 for a 8 we have k x k y 1 70 which is within the range 1 1 75 obtained in an experimental and numerical study auradou et al 2005 our result of kx ky is somewhat larger than that 1 30 estimated by a closed form equation ref zarlenga et al 2018 eq 6 recently obtained for heterogeneous porous media this discrepancy might be attributed to two important differences between porous media and rough fractures in the governing equations for flow and in the dimensionality 3d versus 2d in particular in contrast to the porous media flow equation the reynolds equation eq 4 used to solve for pressure contains the aperture as a spatially varying coefficient to the velocity 2 5 relative permeability simulations of the fluid fluid displacement in a fracture produce a phase distribution using the information of phase distribution we can compute the relative permeabilities of the nonwetting k rn and wetting k rw phases in this study we use the single phase flow averaging method eichel et al 2005 to calculate relative permeabilities this method assumes that the flow of one fluid has no impact on that of the other this allows us to compute the relative permeability of one phase while treating the area occupied by the other phase as impermeable imposing a pressure gradient along one direction we solve the reynolds equation using the aperture fields and phase geometries separately for the nonwetting phase and the wetting phase from the total flow rate at the inlet and the pressure gradient we obtain the effective permeability of the phase considered k eff each effective permeability is associated with its underlying phase distribution from which a saturation s of the considered phase can be calculated the relative permeability is defined as the ratio between the values of k eff at s and at full saturation s 1 performing the above procedure for all sub domains of size 256 256 of each simulated displacement patterns we obtain relative permeability data for both the nonwetting and wetting phases and for all cases of surface anisotropy factors it should be noted that relative permeabilities in our cases should generally be expected to be a tensor rather than a scalar keilegavlen et al 2012 wolff et al 2012 yang et al 2013c however it is still a challenging issue to properly handle tensorial relative permeabilities in macroscopic two phase flow numerical models bear et al 1987 wolff et al 2012 here we only calculate the relative permeabilities for both phases in the principal directions of flow k rn and k rw for the x direction and k rn and k rw for the y direction 3 results in this section we first present the fluid fluid displacement patterns for the example aperture fields and analyze the characteristics of the spatiotemporal evolution of invading fluid distribution then we investigate the ensemble characteristics of fluid saturation profile fractal dimension of the invading phase and interfacial tension for each set of stochastic simulations we also study the dependence of relative permeabilities on the anisotropy factor a these characteristics are chosen because they may be of importance for understanding of two phase flow behavior at the continuum fracture scale 3 1 displacement patterns fig 4 presents the simulated displacement patterns at breakthrough corresponding to the example aperture fields fig 2 it can be seen that when the aperture field is isotropic fig 4a the invasion pattern is characterized by tortuous fingers as the anisotropy factor increases the fingers become less and less tortuous this is an expected result since the large aperture zones become longer with increasing a and the invading nonwetting fluid prefers large aperture regions in the case of the highest anisotropy factor considered fig 4d the invading fluid produces a dendritic structure initially and then percolates the fracture with an almost straight finger the invading phase saturation at breakthrough s n bt for these example patterns from fig 4a to d is 0 50 0 45 0 27 and 0 27 respectively the effect of aperture field anisotropy on s n bt will be examined more carefully in the following subsections visual inspection of the example patterns also suggests that capillary dominated displacement in a rough fracture is strongly controlled by the aperture field geometry the displacement pattern of the isotropic aperture field see fig 4a resembles the classical capillary fingering pattern for porous media wilkinson and willemsen 1983 ferer et al 2003 the box counting fractal dimension d f of the invading phase at breakthrough is 1 80 for this pattern fig 4a which is close to the established value 1 82 for invasion percolation with trapping wilkinson and willemsen 1983 for random porous media however for the strongly anisotropic aperture field fig 2d the resemblance is destroyed by the long correlation length of apertures in the displacement direction with a fractal dimension d f of 1 68 of the invading phase the fractal dimensions d f computed by the box counting method of the simulated invading patterns at breakthrough are presented in fig 5 generally d f decreases with increasing anisotropy factor with the median values of d f being 1 79 for a 1 and 1 70 for a 8 in addition the inter realization variability also becomes stronger as a increases the dependence of fractal dimension on the correlation structure and the inter realization variability may suggest that the use of fractal dimension for quantitative comparison between experiments of different pore geometries should be performed more carefully by considering the difference in the underlying void geometries and correlation lengths knackstedt et al 2001 3 2 invading phase saturation the front propagation of the displacement can also be examined by a spatiotemporal plot of the saturation profile along the x direction s n y x see fig 6 here s n y x is calculated as the number of sites occupied by the invading phase at a given location of x divided by the total number of sites in the y direction in fig 6 the leading front the edge of the black region starts from normalized position x l 0 at beginning t t bt 0 of the displacement towards breakthrough x l 1 and t t bt 1 one can observe that for the isotropic aperture field see fig 6a the spatiotemporal evolution of s n y is featured by gradual advancement of the leading front increasing the degree of anisotropy of aperture fields leads to larger jumps of the invading tip location this is expected as the large aperture regions becomes elongated with increasing anisotropy factor besides the values of the overall invading phase saturation in the fracture at breakthrough s n bt for four individual simulations given previously the ensemble characteristics of s n bt needs to be compared fig 7 shows that in general s n bt decreases with increasing anisotropy factor the arithmetic means of s n bt for a 1 2 4 and 8 are 0 52 0 42 0 36 and 0 31 the decreasing trend implies that given the same volume of the invading nonwetting phase the fluid is expected to travel on average longer distances in the fractures with a larger anisotropy factor fig 8 presents the invading phase saturation profile s n y x for both individual realizations and their ensemble averages from the four individual saturation profiles fig 8a d it is hard to pinpoint the impact of anisotropy on the s n y x due to the randomness however ensemble average saturation profiles show clear dependence on the anisotropy for isotropic aperture fields the ensemble average of s n y x fluctuates around 0 54 except near the inlet and outlet boundaries fig 8e when the aperture field is anisotropic a 2 the ensemble average of s n y x shows a decreasing trend from the inlet to the outlet boundaries leading to a smaller overall saturation at breakthrough s n bt than that in the isotropic case the individual saturation profiles are further explored in terms of their power spectral density γ ω where ω is the normalized spatial frequency we use the welch method welch 1967 to compute γ ω for each simulated saturation profile the saturation profiles are trimmed by 10 of the data on both ends to eliminate the influence of the left and right boundaries of the domain fig 9 shows that for all anisotropy factors γ ω of s n y x decays as a power law with ω in addition the aperture anisotropy does not affect the power law exponent i e γ ω ω β with β 2 5 for all cases this result is indicative of a self organization of phase distribution for two phase flow in heterogeneous media 3 3 entrapped saturation and interfacial area fluid trapping during immiscible displacement is an important microscale process that is responsible for the effect of residual saturations in multiphase flow at the macroscale here we study the defending fluid wetting phase trapping in the capillary dominated flow entrapped wetting phase saturation s w ent is computed as the volume occupied the trapped fluid at breakthrough of the invading phase divided by the total volume of the fracture fig 10 a shows that ensemblewise the defending fluid trapping becomes less prominent as the anisotropy factor increases the median value of s w ent decreases by over a factor of 10 from 0 35 for a 1 to 0 029 for a 8 the strong dependence of fluid trapping on the anisotropy of the aperture field can be explained straightforwardly fluid trapping results either from the merge of two portions of the fluid fluid interface that travel ahead of the rest of the interface or from the intersection of the fluid fluid interface with the closed boundaries increasing the correlation length of aperture field in the displacement direction means a decreased probability of the invading fluid to travel in the transverse direction leading to fewer events of merging and intersecting with the closed boundaries fluid fluid interfacial area is a critical parameter controlling the inter phase mass transfer processes important in contaminant remediation problems detwiler et al 2009 yang et al 2013b for comparison of interfacial areas the specific interfacial area is usually used which is defined as the interfacial area divided by the invading fluid volume in this study we compute the specific interfacial area at breakthrough a int for all simulations it should be noted that only the propagating interface between the invading phase and the non trapped defending phase is taken into account for the calculation that is the interface between the invading fluid and the trapped fluid is excluded because its contribution to inter phase mass transfer is negligible compared with that of the propagating interface fig 10b shows that in general a int is larger for higher anisotropy ratios meanwhile the inter realization variation increases with an increasing degree of anisotropy the fact that a int increases with a is a result of the long fingers stretching in the displacement direction 3 4 relative permeabilities relative permeability to the nonwetting phase in the direction parallel to the main displacement direction k rn as a function of the wetting phase saturation is plotted in fig 11 the anisotropy of the aperture field strongly influences the relative permeability generally increasing the anisotropy factor of the aperture field leads to higher k rn the larger the anisotropy factor the closer the relative permeability to the linear relationship between k rn and 1 s w s n it is interesting to observe that some data points of k rn for a 4 are even above the 1 1 line this is because in these situations the nonwetting fluid occupies the long channels of large aperture high permeability and forms straight fingers i e no phase obstruction due to the wetting fluid the relative permeability data k rn for the nonwetting phase can be well fitted with a simple relationship 7 k rn 1 s w 1 1 8 a where the anisotropy factor a is a parameter this relationship captures the observation that the exponent to the nonwetting phase saturation 1 s w decreases with increasing a indicating that the relative permeability k rn approaches a linear relationship with s w for high anisotropy ratios a 4 and 8 relative permeability to the nonwetting phase in the direction perpendicular to the main displacement direction k rn as a function of the wetting phase saturation is plotted in fig 12 again the anisotropy of the aperture field strongly influences k rn contrary to the results for k rn increasing the anisotropy factor of the aperture field leads to lower k rn interestingly the k rn data can be fitted by an equation similar to eq 7 only with the anisotropy ratio replaced by its inverse 8 k rn 1 s w 1 1 8 a relative permeability to the wetting phase in the direction parallel to the main displacement direction k rw as a function of the wetting phase saturation is plotted in fig 13 it can be observed that increasing the anisotropy factor of the aperture field leads to higher k rw again this result suggests the weaker phase interference for higher degree of anisotropy in the aperture field we simply fit the relative permeability data for the wetting phase with the following relationship 9 k rw max 0 s w 0 55 a 0 22 1 0 55 a 0 22 relative permeability to the wetting phase in the direction perpendicular to the main displacement direction k rw is zero for all simulations this is because the nonwetting phase invades along the x direction and connects the inlet and outlet which results in no continuous path for the wetting phase between the two lateral boundaries 4 discussion we have investigated the effect of anisotropic aperture fields on two phase flow in rough fractures using numerical simulations capillary dominated fluid fluid displacement has been simulated for synthetic rough fractures with aperture fields of various anisotropic factors the results show that the aperture field anisotropy promotes elongated capillary fingers leading to different phase structures and spatiotemporal evolution of saturation profiles than those in the isotropic case aperture anisotropy significantly reduces the nonwetting phase saturation at breakthrough this means that for a given volume of the nonwetting fluid earlier breakthrough is expected for a rough fracture with a higher degree of aperture anisotropy entrapped wetting phase saturation also decreases with increasing anisotropy factor the specific fluid fluid interfacial area is found to be larger for higher anisotropy factor in the limit of strong anisotropy the displacement pattern characterized by long straight fingers is a result of the increased correlation length in the displacement direction previous works in the literature e g knackstedt et al 2001 in the isotropic case has demonstrated that spatial correlation strongly influences the invasion behavior in ip even small scale correlations can have a profound effect on the saturation measured at large scales knackstedt et al 2001 the hypothesis is that the site occupation probability is modified by the correlation length increasing the correlation length in the flow direction favors the invasion of large apertures for a given number of invaded sites in natural conditions free of the influence of boundaries the displacement is expected to mainly follow the direction of the longer correlation length however there can be situations where why fluid fluid displacement perpendicular to the direction of larger aperture channels can happen one example is the injection of fluid to a fault zone that has experience slip motivated by this scenario we have also simulated displacement along the y direction see supplementary material fig s1 in this simulation scenario when the anisotropy ratio is high 4 the invading fluid will preferentially extend along the large aperture channels parallel to the x direction until blocked by the no flow boundary i e the two short edges of the domain with the forced flow along the y direction the invading fluid eventually connects in a zig zag manner to the outlet at the breakthrough this scenario results in significantly larger nonwetting phase saturations for anisotropy aperture fields a 1 than those in the scenario of displacing along the x direction due to the channelized displacement pattern for anisotropy ratio a 4 and a 8 the ensemble average saturation profiles at breakthrough show a continuously decreasing trend with the distance we have performed additional simulations with elongated domains l x a l and l 1024 l according to the anisotropy ratio such that in each case the same number of horizontal correlation lengths has been passed by the displacing fluid at the time of breakthrough we find that the saturation eventually stabilizes with the distance see fig 14 a the overall saturations for a 1 are smaller than those in the simulations with fixed domain length l x 1024 l in addition it is shown that when ignoring the in plane curvature the behavior is similar but with smaller saturations see fig 14b due to the lack of interface smoothening effect yang et al 2016 the effect of aperture field anisotropy on relative permeabilities has been quantitatively analyzed the results show that in the x direction the relative permeabilities both to the nonwetting and wetting phases are higher for aperture fields with a stronger degree of anisotropy this effect is a result of the presence of long straight fingers for the strongly anisotropic case which suppress phase interference on the contrary in the y direction the relative permeability to the nonwetting phase decreases with increasing anisotropy ratio in effect the aperture field anisotropy causes a strong directional dependence of the relative permeabilities the influence of aperture field anisotropy on relative permeability is larger than on the fully saturated permeability for instance the fully saturated permeability kx increases by a factor of 1 3 from a 1 to a 8 the fitted relative permeability of the nonwetting phase k rn at s w 0 5 increases by a factor of 2 9 from a 1 to a 8 it should be noted that the calculation of relative permeabilities is performed on subdomains the reason for performing the calculation of relative permeability in subdomains is to allow the relative permeabilities to be computed for cases with small anisotropy ratios because the width of the simulation domain ly is finite the invading nonwetting phase will almost inevitably touch the transverse boundaries in cases of small anisotropy ratios a 2 thus there will be no continuous pathways of wetting fluid connecting the inlet and the outlet if the relative permeability calculations are performed on the entire domain we will obtain zero wetting phase permeability for all simulations with a 2 which is clearly not physical to circumvent this issue the relative permeability calculations have been performed in subdomains in this study however one needs to be careful about the domain size and the scale effect for the relative permeability calculations to be valid the fluid phase distribution needs to cover a sufficiently large volume area typically a domain length of several correlation lengths is enough for the calculation of macroscale quantities in our simulations the subdomains used for calculating the relative permeability meet this requirement with the exception of the case a 8 by performing the relative permeability calculations based on simulations with the elongated domains the subdomains are extended proportionately we confirm that the obtained relative permeability saturation relations previously are still valid the calculated relative permeabilities as a function of saturation are fitted using equations eqs 7 9 where the anisotropy factor is a parameter the obtained empirical equations link fracture scale relative permeabilities to aperture anisotropy for the first time and are useful for predicting two phase flow in fractured media at the large scale where the anisotropy producing mechanisms are a concern it should be pointed out that macro scale constitutive relationships are also a function of statistical parameters of the isotropic aperture field such as the mean aperture standard deviation and the hurst exponent e g ye et al 2015 wang and cardenas 2018 how these parameters affect the two phase flow properties in the anisotropic case remains to be investigated the anisotropic factor a in the power spectrum function eq 3 essentially reflects the ratio between correlation lengths in the x and y directions see table 1 even though a varies by a factor of 8 the ratio between absolute permeability k x k y only changes within a factor of 1 70 this is mainly because even in the strongly anisotropic case here a 8 the aperture coefficient of variation σ b b 0 07 0 3 is not very big and the large aperture regions remain well connected despite the small anisotropy ratio in terms of absolute permeability the relative permeabilities show a strong dependence on the anisotropy figs 11 13 this indicates that anisotropy often overlooked might partly explain the large variability in relative permeabilities for different rock samples it should be pointed out that this study assumes capillary dominated condition in simulating fluid fluid displacement in the rough fractures this simplification is commonly taken to save computational time especially in cases where in total hundreds of simulations are needed for stochastically generated random aperture fields when viscous forces are taken into account the displacement patterns also depend on the flow rate and viscosity ratio giving rise to viscous fingering and compact displacement patterns the combined influence of capillary and viscous forces on two phase flow properties in anisotropic fractures needs further experimental and modeling studies furthermore this study focuses on drainage future work is needed to obtain capillary pressure and relative permeability curves under imbibition conditions and to study their hysteretic behavior 5 conclusions in summary the impact of aperture field anisotropy on two phase flow properties in rough fractures has been studied it is found that the spatiotemporal distribution of fluid phases is strongly influenced by the aperture field anisotropy leading to lower nonwetting phase saturation and entrapped wetting phase saturation at breakthrough and higher specific interfacial area the aperture field anisotropy also leads to increased relative permeabilities to both phases in the direction parallel to the displacement and decreased relative permeabilities in the direction perpendicular to the displacement empirical equations are proposed to link the relative permeabilities to the anisotropy factor these results are especially useful for predicting two phase flow in fractured media at the large scale where geomechanical and chemical processes produce anisotropic aperture fields acknowledgment financial support from national natural

579,based on combined laboratory experiments and numerical simulations this paper examined seawater intrusion swi and seawater retreat swr processes caused by abrupt inland watertable changes in a laboratory scale unconfined aquifer length of 7 7 m and thickness of 1 0 m subjected to a synthetic sinusoidal tide the results showed that the salinity distribution was relatively stable and that swi and swr processes were almost temporally symmetrical given relatively large horizontal hydraulic gradients 0 0269 0 0209 and 0 0149 between the inland watertable and the mean sea level however the salt distribution changed significantly in response to the inland watertable variations when the horizontal hydraulic gradient was relatively small 0 0030 the speed of the swi and swr response to the inland watertable variations was temporally asymmetric e g swr was quicker than swi by a factor of 9 with respect to the observed saltwater wedge toe locations as a relatively thick mixing zone transition between freshwater and saltwater zones was induced by the tide simulated saltwater wedge toe locations as indicated by the 5 50 and 95 isohalines changed inconsistently different hysteresis behaviors were found in the relationship between the sw toe locations and total salt mass stored in the aquifer sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the response of both swi and swr to the inland watertable variations could be prolonged by a decreased tidal amplitude or decreased tidal period keywords seawater intrusion seawater retreat coastal aquifer tide response time laboratory experiment 1 introduction around 41 of the world population lives within 100 km from the coastline martínez et al 2007 the coastal zone is expected to be more densely populated in the future due to population growth and urbanization neumann et al 2015 to host such a densely distributed population excessive fresh groundwater is extracted from coastal aquifers mainly for drinking water and crop irrigation these anthropogenic activities together with climate change impacts including sea level rise lead to ubiquitous seawater intrusion swi the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers in coastal zones werner et al 2013 seawater intrusion is essentially caused by a decreased horizontal hydraulic gradient between the inland watertable and mean sea level on the contrary a rise in the inland watertable by reducing groundwater extraction and or increasing aquifer recharge may reverse swi i e cause seawater retreat swr transient variations of swi and swr as quantified by the movement of seawater freshwater interface could give important information for managing coastal groundwater resources however responses of both swi and swr in aquifers to various hydrological forcing factors are not immediate but can be delayed and exhibit temporal hysteresis lu and werner 2013 the timescales of swi and swr were investigated through experimental numerical and analytical methods abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 chang and clement 2012 lu and werner 2013 rathore et al 2018 watson et al 2010 webb and howard 2011 werner et al 2013 these studies predominantly focused on the effects of horizontal hydraulic gradients and assumed static oceanic conditions without tides and waves under this assumption they identified a narrow freshwater saltwater mixing zone that could be treated as a sharp saltwater wedge sw interface goswami and clement 2007 and chang and clement 2012 conducted laboratory experiments considering head controlled and flux controlled inland boundary conditions respectively they showed that the sw intrudes landward and that the slope of the sw interface reduces along with the reduced inland freshwater head or flux for changed boundary conditions the swi speed gradually decreases as it moves toward to the new steady state laboratory experiments also revealed a temporal asymmetry of aquifers in response to boundary variations slower swi in comparison with quicker swr abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 morgan et al 2013 this is because the inland freshwater flow is in the opposite direction to the swi an decreasing horizontal hydraulic gradient partly changes density induced saltwater flow whereas an increasing gradient changes saltwater flow direction chang and clement 2012 as such the timescales of swi and swr are not equal and cannot be quantified by tracking the variation of sw toe locations with respect to the change of the groundwater head or flux chang and clement 2012 morgan et al 2013 robinson et al 2015 2016 for example it was found that the response time of swi indicated by sw toe location is two times larger than that of swr in laboratory experiments abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 the numerical simulations of lu and werner 2013 and the analytical solution of rathore et al 2018 also show the temporal asymmetry of both swi and swr rathore et al 2018 defined a temporal asymmetry index the timescale ratio of swi to swr and suggested that this index mainly depends on the contrast of initial and final boundary conditions until now research predominately focused on static oceanic conditions and excluded dynamic tidal fluctuations tides occur in most coastlines worldwide and are found to affect salinity distributions in coastal aquifers ataie ashtiani et al 1999 robinson et al 2006 werner et al 2013 numerical simulations laboratory experiments and field investigations have identified a saltwater recirculation cell upper saline plume usp fig 1 a in coastal aquifers subjected to tidal fluctuations kuan et al 2012 liu et al 2016 robinson et al 2006 2007 2018 yu et al 2017 2019 tidal fluctuations also enhance the freshwater saltwater mixing and lead to a relatively thick mixing zone this is different to a sharp sw interface occurring under a static oceanic condition furthermore with a saltwater recirculation cell tides can inhibit swi and push sw seaward kuan et al 2012 werner and lockington 2006 and lenkopane et al 2009 demonstrated that the tidal effect on sw movement and mixing zone could be altered further by seasonal inland freshwater variation despite these studies have revealed significant tidal influence swi and swr processes caused by an abrupt inland hydraulic head change in tidally affected unconfined aquifers are rarely examined in this study we conducted both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations on swi and swr processes caused by an abrupt inland watertable drop and rise in a laboratory scale unconfined aquifer subjected to a synthetic sinusoidal tide which allowed investigation of the following questions 1 how do the sw patterns and the total salt mass stored in the aquifer respond to inland hydraulic head change 2 how does the temporal asymmetry between swi and swr change with the horizontal hydraulic gradient 3 are sw toe location and total salt mass related in tidally affected aquifers 2 methodology 2 1 laboratory experiments the laboratory experiments were carried out in a flume with the length height and width respectively of 7 7 1 2 and 0 16 m fig 1b the flume was constructed from tempered glass and mounted on a steel platform around 1 m above the ground the saltwater and freshwater reservoirs were on the ground and below the flume fig 1b the right side of the flume was linked to a tide generator which generated preset water fluctuations with a precision of 1 mm the water tank of the tide generator was installed with a variable height overflow column the water from the saltwater reservoir was continuously pumped into the tank to maintain the water level at the outlet of the overflow column a programmable logic controller automatically adjusted the height of the overflow outlet and generated the preset tide as done in previous studies robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 we considered a synthetic single frequency tide note semi diurnal and diurnal tides are predominant in most of coastal areas which can be described as follows note that the x z coordinate origin is set at the steel platform and the right boundary of the flume fig 1a 1 h t msl a sin 2 π t t where h t is the tidal level l at the time t t msl is the mean water level l set to 0 7 m and a and t are the tidal amplitude l set to 0 075 m and period t set to 240 s respectively note we focused on this tidal condition because 1 a usp is produced and 2 the tide induced groundwater propagation is damped out at the inland boundary thus avoiding spurious boundary reflections the left side of the flume was connected to a simple overflow column that can be lifted and lowered manually with circulating water from the freshwater reservoir this overflow column can set up a fixed inland watertable the water levels in the overflow columns at the two sides of the flume were monitored using solinst ltc 3001 during the experiment the flume was packed with quartz sand to simulate an unconfined coastal aquifer with a 1 m thickness bounded by a sloping beach surface slope 1 2 the beach slope was fixed using a stainless steel mesh as the flume was relatively narrow it represented essentially a 2 d vertical cross shore section of an unconfined aquifer prior to the experiment the sand was washed with freshwater and packed carefully to avoid air trapping in the sand flume the sand was well sorted and relatively uniform with d 50 median diameter the size of sieve pore for the 50 of sands to pass 0 5 mm and d 90 d 10 2 6 d 90 and d 10 are respectively the size of sieve pore for the 90 and 10 of sands to pass the porosity of the sand was 0 4 the measured saturated hydraulic conductivity using freshwater and the darcy column test at a constant temperature of 35 c note that a high temperature is related to a high soil hydraulic conductivity holzbecher 1997 was 6 4 10 3 m s we also measured soil saturation along a drying curve at different suctions and fitted the data with a van genuchten 1980 curve a well known water retention curve describing the relationship between soil saturation relative hydraulic conductivity and suction head details in xin et al 2010 for which the residual water saturation was swres 0 05 while the van genuchten constants were α 11 m 1 and n 6 during the experiments the saltwater salinity was set to 35 ppt parts per thousand mass fraction with the associated density at 1024 kg m3 the saltwater was prepared by dissolving 34 g of sodium chloride and 1 g of red food dye in a liter of freshwater density at 998 kg m3 and salinity at 0 as tested by kuan et al 2012 on the same quartz sand and dye the dye was inert and the sorption of the dye to the quartz sand was minor the dye did not affect the solution density as determined with a high precision liquid densimeter during the experiment fresh or saline water seeped out through the beach this was expected to dilute the seawater at the seaside to minimize this effect we set up a small submerged pump above the beach surface to ensure that the water was well mixed such that the seawater salinity at about 35 ppt a camera was used to take images to record instantaneous salinity distributions in the sand flume during the experiments the camera recorded salinity distributions at the same tidal level 0 7 m during the falling tide the captured images were processed in matlab to track the swi and swr dynamics for this the color photographs were converted to grayscale images which were further processed to produce binary images based on optimal threshold values otsu 1979 in this way the interface between the fresh white and saline black was delineated and the sw toe was determined it is worth noting that this method is not intended to delineate the freshwater saltwater mixing zone for convenience the abrupt freshwater level change was chosen to replace the gradual freshwater level variation found in nature and as widely adopted previously abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 chang et al 2011 chesnaux 2015 lu and werner 2013 mazi et al 2013 michael et al 2013 rathore et al 2018 watson et al 2010 werner and simmons 2009 yechieli et al 2010 it is worth noting that this would lead to faster response times compared with gradual water level variations hussain and javadi 2016 lu and werner 2013 mehdizadeh et al 2017 morgan et al 2015 during the experiments the tidal conditions were fixed the inland watertable hf declined from 0 88 to 0 84 0 80 0 76 and 0 72 m to investigate changes to the swi the associated horizontal hydraulic gradient h f msl l where l 6 7 m is the horizontal distance changed from 0 0269 to 0 0209 0 0149 0 0090 and 0 0030 respectively an opposite rising process was used to test the swr in all eight experiments were performed with each experiment run until quasi steady conditions were reached determined by comparing images over a 2 h period the experiments were set up such that five final hydraulic gradients with associated quasi steady states were reached as listed above 2 2 numerical simulations as suggested by previous studies chang and clement 2012 kuan et al 2012 morgan et al 2013 and also detected by our experiments results given later it is challenging to observe freshwater saltwater mixing zones using dye tracking to complement the experiments we also conducted numerical simulations using sutra voss and provost 2002 which models variably saturated and density dependent pore water flow and solute transport in sutra pore water flow is described by richards equation richards 1931 in which the relative hydraulic conductivity and soil saturation were calculated with the van genuchten 1980 formulas details in xin et al 2010 the model configuration and boundary condition set in the model were consistent with the experiments boundary ab was set as the inland boundary with a specified head boundary cde was the aquifer ocean interface linked to the periodic tide further details such as the setup of the tidal boundary condition and seepage face modeling can be found in xin et al 2010 otherwise no flow boundaries were used fig 1a the aquifer was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic in addition to the measured parameters the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity α l and α t were respectively set to 5 10 3 and 5 10 4 m hunt et al 2011 the diffusion coefficient was set to 10 9 m2 s voss and provost 2002 as suggested by voss and provost 2002 numerical stability was ensured based on the péclet number pe 4 criterion mesh sizes of δx 0 02 and δz 0 02 m 3 results in this section both the experimental and simulation results are examined in detail with respect to the salinity distribution and the total salt mass stored in the aquifer first we examined the salinity distribution at the quasi steady states section 3 1 afterwards we analyzed the timescales of swi and swr as determined by two widely used quantitative indicators sw toe locations section 3 2 and total salt mass section 3 3 the relationship between the two quantitative indicators was tested in section 3 4 finally we present a sensitivity analysis based on tidal conditions in section 3 5 3 1 salinity distributions at the quasi steady states similar to previous studies chang and clement 2012 kuan et al 2012 morgan et al 2013 dye tracking during the experiments recorded the sharp freshwater saltwater interface but failed to capture the freshwater saltwater transition mixing zone fig 2 and table 1 as expected a relatively thick freshwater saltwater mixing zone was present in the simulation results the 5 50 and 95 seawater isohalines were tracked along the aquifer base following ward et al 2007 and watson et al 2010 hereinafter termed as 5 isohaline toe 50 isohaline toe and 95 isohaline toe respectively the simulated 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes at quasi steady states were different from each other table 1 with a relatively larger horizontal hydraulic gradient i e 0 0269 0 0209 and 0 0149 when hf 0 88 0 84 and 0 80 m respectively the sw toe locations 0 78 0 88 and 1 05 m respectively determined by the experiments were close to those simulation results using the 50 isohalines 0 79 0 88 and 1 00 m respectively table 1 as the horizontal hydraulic gradient reduced i e 0 0090 and 0 0030 when hf 0 76 and 0 72 m respectively the sw significantly inclined and the simulated thickness of freshwater saltwater mixing zone increased considerably in these two cases the sw toe locations 1 39 and 3 18 m respectively determined by the experiments were close to those simulation results using the 5 isohalines 1 37 and 3 04 m respectively despite this difference the model well predicted salinity distributions in comparison with the laboratory experiments and these results served as model verification with the inland watertable hf set to 0 88 m no usp was obvious in either the experiment fig 2a or simulation fig 2b this suggests that a larger horizontal hydraulic gradient can inhibit usp development evans and wilson 2016 however with lower hf an increasingly evident usp appeared in both the experiments and simulations fig 2 concurrently the sw intruded landward in a tidally affected unconfined aquifer the swi responds to two factors the usp expansion occurring in the shallow aquifer and the lower sw movement towards the inland note however that the sw toe movement does not respond linearly to changes in hf for example decreasing hf from 0 88 to 0 84 m in the experiments led the sw toe to intrude landward by 0 10 m whereas the same decrease from 0 84 to 0 80 m led to a 0 17 m toe intrusion further when hf decreased from 0 76 to 0 72 m the sw toe intruded by 1 79 m which was an order of magnitude greater than the case with hf from 0 88 to 0 84 m this suggests that the swi extent is enhanced with a reduced horizontal hydraulic gradient based on the simulation results we further calculated the total salt mass stored in per unit width aquifer the total salt mass also demonstrated a nonlinear increase as hf dropped when hf decreased from 0 88 to 0 84 m the total salt mass increased from 3 31 to 3 88 kg m however a reduction in hf from 0 76 to 0 72 m almost doubled the total salt mass 5 87 10 10 kg m this is consistent with the sw toe intrusion and suggests that an aquifer with smaller horizontal hydraulic gradient is more vulnerable to swi it was expected that a reverse swr process would push sw back and lead to reduced total salt mass stored in the aquifer as stated above the final quasi steady states are controlled by the horizontal hydraulic gradients in both the experiments and simulations we detected the same seawater freshwater interfaces and the same quasi steady states given the same horizontal hydraulic gradients suggesting that swi and swr are opposite and reversible processes 3 2 timescales of swi and swr determined by toe locations in this section we examined both the experimental and simulated sw toe movement under the swi and swr settings intuitively a reduction in the inland freshwater head would lead to movement of the sw toe towards the inland the experimental and simulation results were consistent with this fig 3 when hf decreased from 0 88 to 0 84 m and from 0 84 to 0 80 m the simulated 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes moved almost equally fig 3a and b the monitored instantaneous toe locations using dye tracking in the experiments were close to the simulated 50 isohaline toe this suggested that the dye tracking represented the overall swi process in the aquifer with relatively large horizontal hydraulic gradients in contrast as the horizontal hydraulic gradients decreased further hf from 0 80 to 0 76 m and from 0 76 to 0 72 m the simulated 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes started to move unequally fig 3c and d and led to a thick freshwater saltwater mixing zone fig 2h and j the monitored instantaneous toe locations were close to the simulated 5 isohaline toe when hf dropped from 0 76 to 0 72 m both the simulated 5 isohaline and monitored toes kept moving inland before reaching the quasi steady state however the simulated 50 and 95 isohaline toes moved inland first and then retreated at t 11 23 and 2 57 h respectively that is the toes temporarily extended further inland than those at the eventual quasi steady state this overshoot phenomenon has been previously observed by numerical and experimental studies focusing on non tidal aquifers chang et al 2011 kiro et al 2008 lu and werner 2013 morgan et al 2013 2015 watson et al 2010 and represents a non monotonic swi process as hf dropped from 0 76 to 0 72 m the simulated 50 isohaline toe moved from 1 21 m to 1 95 m within 11 23 h and then returned to approach the final state at 1 55 m the overshoot distance was 54 of the total toe intrusion the 95 isohaline toe first intruded but then retreated seaward the final quasi steady location 0 77 m even exceeded seawards its initial location 0 94 m however the overshoot phenomenon was not evident in the experimental results tracking of the sharp freshwater saltwater interface we attributed the overshoot phenomenon demonstrated by the simulation to the freshwater saltwater mixing enhanced by the tide and examined the simulated tidally averaged salinity distribution and flow field when hf dropped from 0 76 to 0 72 m fig 4 at t 0 h a freshwater tube separated the upper usp and lower sw fig 4a after hf dropped the upper usp expanded both the 5 50 and 95 isohalines moved deeper and landward and started to merge with the lower sw fig 4b and c the freshwater tube contracted and concurrently a thick mixing zone developed that is the inland freshwater mixed more intensively with the circulating seawater in the aquifer before discharging to the sea consistent with the expanded mixing zone the 50 and 95 isohaline toes retreated while the 5 isohaline toe kept intruding before approaching the eventual steady state location fig 4c and d as hf rose from 0 72 to 0 76 0 80 0 84 and 0 88 m in turn fig 5 an opposite swr process occurred with a relatively small horizontal hydraulic gradient hf rose from 0 72 to 0 76 m the 50 and 95 isohaline toes also demonstrated overshoot trends fig 5a this also reflected a complex non monotonic adjustment of salinity distribution and flow field in the tidally affected aquifer after hf rose from 0 72 to 0 76 m the increased horizontal hydraulic gradient narrowed the freshwater saltwater mixing zone and led to the development of a freshwater tube fig 6 as before this process caused differential movement of the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes the tidally affected coastal aquifer moved from one quasi steady state to another after the inland groundwater head was changed based on the toe movement discussed earlier the swi and swr processes are reversible for the considered conditions to quantify the temporal adjustment of toes we defined the response time of tidally affected coastal aquifers as the time to reach the new quasi steady state rt similar to watson et al 2010 and lu and werner 2013 i e 2 qi r t qi qi qi 0 0 05 where qi is the status of a given quantitative indicator sw toe location or total salt mass stored in the aquifer at time t qi and qi 0 are the status of the quantitative indicator at the final and initial quasi steady state respectively as expected using the simulated 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes as the quantitative indicators gave different response times for example when hf dropped from 0 88 to 0 84 m the simulated 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes took 1 90 1 90 and 1 63 h to reach within 5 of the final static state condition respectively fig 7 the reverse swr process hf rose from 0 84 to 0 88 m took less time 1 63 1 63 and 1 37 h respectively for the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes this temporal asymmetry of response time was also demonstrated by the experimental results using dye tracking 1 90 versus 1 63 h for swi versus swr i e the asymmetry ratio rt swi rt swr was 1 17 as the overall horizontal hydraulic gradient decreased hf changed between 0 84 and 0 80 m the asymmetry ratio changed slightly to 1 14 note it was slightly less than that for the 0 84 versus 0 80 m setting perhaps due to the uncertainty involved in the experimental measurements however the small horizontal hydraulic gradients led to an apparent asymmetry of the response time when hf changed between 0 76 and 0 72 m the asymmetry ratio from the experimental results reached 9 00 this apparent temporal asymmetry was also demonstrated by the simulated 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes suggesting that the swi process was much slower in comparison with the swr 3 3 timescales of swi and swr determined by the total salt mass we then examined the simulated total salt mass stored in per unit width aquifer note this quantitative indicator considered both the upper usp and lower sw consistent with the toe movement the swi and swr processes quantified by the total salt mass were reversible fig 8 given a smaller horizontal hydraulic gradient the same hf change 0 04 m led to more apparent variation in the total salt mass e g as hf dropped from 0 88 to 0 84 0 80 0 76 and 0 72 m the total salt mass changed from 3 31 to 3 88 4 66 5 87 and 10 10 kg m respectively when hf increased in the swr setting an opposite process occurred with the total salt mass decreased it was interesting that an overshoot occurred 5 77 h after hf rose from 0 72 to 0 76 m fig 8d this elapsed time was not consistent with those demonstrated in the 50 and 95 isohaline toes 2 70 and 1 10 h respectively suggesting the complexity of the relationship between the total salt mass and sw toe location see details in section 3 4 consistent with the toe movement the large horizontal hydraulic gradients did not lead to an apparent asymmetry of response time in the total salt mass for the 0 88 versus 0 84 m 0 84 versus 0 80 m and 0 80 versus 0 76 m head changes the swi and swr processes took similar times to reach within 5 of the final quasi steady state condition fig 9 resulting in asymmetric response time ratios of 1 16 1 14 and 1 37 respectively while as the small horizontal hydraulic gradient led to an apparent asymmetry of response time for hf changed between 0 76 and 0 72 m the asymmetry ratio reached 6 43 this asymmetry was evident in the variation of the total salt mass fig 8d for swi the total salt mass increased slowly and reached the final static state condition for swr it decreased sharply after hf increased and was almost unchanged after the overshoot point 5 77 h fig 8 in the tidally affected aquifer the response of the usp was more rapid than the lower sw figs 4 and 6 which in turn modified the total salt mass stored in the aquifer the expansion and contract of the usp would then alter the lower sw 3 4 relationship between the toe location and total salt mass as discussed earlier an abrupt inland watertable change caused variations in the sw toe location and total salt mass in this section we examine the extent to which the two are related for each reversible stage including the simulated swi and swr processes we calculated the standardized toe location and total salt mass as follows 3a x t o e x t o e t min x t o e max x t o e min x t o e 3b m m t min m max m min m where x t o e and m are the standardized toe location and total salt mass respectively then we defined the dimensionless hysteresis dh as follows zhang and werner 2015 4 dh 0 1 x t o e d m swi 1 0 x t o e d m swr dh is the area enclosed by the standardized toe location and total salt mass related to each hf change fig 10 and varies between 1 and 1 a positive negative dh value indicates that the toe location was more less seaward during swi than during swr given the same salt mass the absolute value of dh which varies between 0 and 1 reflects the degree of hysteresis between swi and swr overall different behaviors between the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes and the total salt mass are evident fig 10 when hf changed between 0 88 and 0 84 m the dh values were positive for the 5 and 50 isohaline mass and negative for the 95 isohaline mass relationships respectively in other words given the same total salt mass the 5 50 isohaline toes were positioned seawards and the 95 isohaline toe was positioned landwards inversely during swi compared with swr nevertheless the dh values were small less than 0 1 indicating less hysteresis similar behavior was observed as hf changed between 0 84 and 0 80 m suggesting that the toe locations and total salt mass were almost linearly related when the horizontal hydraulic gradients were small as the horizontal hydraulic gradient decreased the dh values increased particularly as hf changed from 0 76 to 0 72 m the dh value for the 50 isohaline toe changed from positive fig 10a c to negative fig 10d the dh values for the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes and salt mass were respectively 0 38 0 34 and 0 64 this suggested that a high degree of hysteresis appeared during swi and swr given the same salt mass stored in the aquifer as such the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes failed to indicate the overall salinity distribution as they were not proportional to the total salt mass 3 5 sensitivity analysis of tidal conditions here we numerically tested the effects of tidal amplitudes and periods on swi and swr for given changes in hf for a tidal period of 240 s the reduced tidal amplitude led to a small even negligible usp fig 2 cf figs s1 and s2 s refers to supplementary materials as the tidal inhibition on swi weakened the sw moved landward in addition the freshwater saltwater mixing zone narrowed as the tidal amplitude decreased with the same reduction in the tidal amplitude the total salt mass increased and the usp gradually disappeared e g the total salt mass increased from 10 10 to 13 84 and 17 64 kg m as the tidal amplitude decreased respectively from 0 075 to 0 05 and 0 025 m at the quasi steady state for hf 0 72 m table s1 tidal amplitude variations did not affect the overall trend of the variation of the total salt mass for swi and swr driven respectively by an abrupt drop or rise of hf figs s3 and s4 for cases with hf large e g from 0 88 to 0 84 or from 0 84 to 0 88 m the differences in the total salt mass between the cases with different tidal amplitudes were more uniform during both swi and swr in addition a smaller tidal amplitude led to a slightly higher response time for both swi and swr while the relative differences in temporal asymmetry between cases with different tidal amplitudes were small fig 11 for cases with hf small e g from 0 76 to 0 72 or from 0 72 to 0 76 m by contrast the response of the total salt mass to the boundary head change for both swi and swr was slower with decreasing tidal amplitude interestingly an overshoot phenomenon was found for swr fig s4a it was found that the extent of overshoot was weakened when the tidal amplitude reduced furthermore the temporal asymmetry decreased changed from 6 44 to 5 04 4 87 as the tidal amplitude reduced for the case with lower hf with the tidal amplitude fixed 0 075 m a reduced tidal period led to a larger usp area and a seaward freshwater seawater interface fig 2 in comparison with figs s5 and s6 the freshwater saltwater mixing weakened with increasing tide frequency i e decreasing tidal period moreover a shorter tidal period resulted in less total salt mass table s2 a smaller hf results in a larger difference between the total salt mass in the swi cases with three different tidal periods fig s7 in contrast the total salt mass in the swr cases was not very sensitive to the tidal period despite that the swr cases with the smallest hf showed conspicuous differences fig s8 the response time monotonically increased for both swi and swr as the tidal period reduced fig 12 the temporal asymmetry hardly changed with the tidal period for lower hf it was found that the rate of variation of the total salt mass was much slower for swi in comparison to swr for equal reductions in the tidal period i e the response times were 14 37 23 37 and 52 57 h for swi in comparison with 2 77 3 63 and 7 90 for swr hence the temporal asymmetry tended to increase slightly when the tidal period reduced from 360 to 240 and 120 s in addition when hf rose abruptly from 0 72 to 0 76 m the duration of the swr overshoot was prolonged for a smaller tidal period 4 discussion both experimental and simulation results indicated that equal changes in hf led to inconsistent extents of swi and swr the smaller horizontal hydraulic gradient caused larger changes in swi and swr consistent with the previous work that did not consider tides abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 our results show that the salinity distribution in coastal aquifers is relatively stable and that the swi and swr processes are nearly symmetrical for large horizontal hydraulic gradients however for small gradients a change in inland watertable caused by groundwater pumping or reduced groundwater recharge would lead to extensive swi the overshoot phenomenon was previously demonstrated in cases without tidal forcing morgan et al 2013 2015 watson et al 2010 this was not observed in our experimental results possibly because the dye tracking method failed to delineate the freshwater saltwater mixing zone however the overshoot phenomenon was observed in both the sw toe locations and total salt mass from the simulations when a smaller horizontal hydraulic gradient was considered we find that the overshoot weakens for a reduced tidal amplitude and is prolonged for a smaller tidal period this complex non monotonic behavior reflects an adjustment of the coastal aquifer system in response to boundary condition changes which is quantified by changes in indicators of the temporal hysteresis of aquifers in practice the response of an aquifer to both anthropogenic e g groundwater extraction and aquifer recharge and natural hydrological stresses e g sea level rise would be delayed and associated swi or swr subsequences would be non monotonic as a result of the overshoot phenomenon toe location and total salt mass are two widely used quantitative indicators for describing swi and swr processes in coastal aquifers abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 feseker 2007 watson et al 2010 in most previous studies tides were not considered and so the freshwater seawater mixing zone was narrow as a consequence the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes changed consistently and served as an estimate of the salt distribution in aquifers our results showed that the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes vary inconsistently in tidally affected aquifers with small horizontal gradients more significantly strong hysteresis was detected in the relationship between the toe location and total salt mass all these suggest that the toe location is a poor indicator for describing swi and swr in tidally affected aquifers 5 conclusions this paper examined the swi and swr processes caused by abrupt inland watertable changes in a laboratory scale and tidally affected aquifer using both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations from the present study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 in the tidally affected unconfined aquifer swr is more rapid than swi this phenomenon is more apparent when the horizontal hydraulic gradient is small in our study the asymmetry ratio of the swi and swr response times were as high as 9 00 and 6 43 respectively with respect to the toe location from the experiment results and the simulated total salt mass stored in the aquifer 2 the sw toe locations were almost proportional to the total salt mass when the horizontal hydraulic gradients were large in the tidally affected aquifer when the horizontal hydraulic gradient was small a high degree of hysteresis existed in the relationship between the sw toe locations and total salt mass the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes moved inconsistently and failed to indicate the overall salinity distribution and demonstrates that the sw toe location is a poor indicator for delineating the salinity distribution in a tidally affected aquifer 3 the temporal response of swi and swr to inland hydraulic head change relates to tidal conditions the response time of both swi and swr to the inland watertable change increases with decreasing tidal amplitude or tidal period resulting in variation of the associated temporal asymmetry our results at the laboratory scale are based on a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer subjected to an abrupt inland watertable change a practical application should carefully consider aquifer properties e g heterogeneity and anisotropy tidal conditions multi constituent tides such as spring neap tides and gradual freshwater level variations nevertheless the results presented here shed light on trends in dynamic swi and swr processes in tidally affected unconfined aquifers and will help to better manage groundwater resources in coastal zones acknowledgments this

579,based on combined laboratory experiments and numerical simulations this paper examined seawater intrusion swi and seawater retreat swr processes caused by abrupt inland watertable changes in a laboratory scale unconfined aquifer length of 7 7 m and thickness of 1 0 m subjected to a synthetic sinusoidal tide the results showed that the salinity distribution was relatively stable and that swi and swr processes were almost temporally symmetrical given relatively large horizontal hydraulic gradients 0 0269 0 0209 and 0 0149 between the inland watertable and the mean sea level however the salt distribution changed significantly in response to the inland watertable variations when the horizontal hydraulic gradient was relatively small 0 0030 the speed of the swi and swr response to the inland watertable variations was temporally asymmetric e g swr was quicker than swi by a factor of 9 with respect to the observed saltwater wedge toe locations as a relatively thick mixing zone transition between freshwater and saltwater zones was induced by the tide simulated saltwater wedge toe locations as indicated by the 5 50 and 95 isohalines changed inconsistently different hysteresis behaviors were found in the relationship between the sw toe locations and total salt mass stored in the aquifer sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the response of both swi and swr to the inland watertable variations could be prolonged by a decreased tidal amplitude or decreased tidal period keywords seawater intrusion seawater retreat coastal aquifer tide response time laboratory experiment 1 introduction around 41 of the world population lives within 100 km from the coastline martínez et al 2007 the coastal zone is expected to be more densely populated in the future due to population growth and urbanization neumann et al 2015 to host such a densely distributed population excessive fresh groundwater is extracted from coastal aquifers mainly for drinking water and crop irrigation these anthropogenic activities together with climate change impacts including sea level rise lead to ubiquitous seawater intrusion swi the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers in coastal zones werner et al 2013 seawater intrusion is essentially caused by a decreased horizontal hydraulic gradient between the inland watertable and mean sea level on the contrary a rise in the inland watertable by reducing groundwater extraction and or increasing aquifer recharge may reverse swi i e cause seawater retreat swr transient variations of swi and swr as quantified by the movement of seawater freshwater interface could give important information for managing coastal groundwater resources however responses of both swi and swr in aquifers to various hydrological forcing factors are not immediate but can be delayed and exhibit temporal hysteresis lu and werner 2013 the timescales of swi and swr were investigated through experimental numerical and analytical methods abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 chang and clement 2012 lu and werner 2013 rathore et al 2018 watson et al 2010 webb and howard 2011 werner et al 2013 these studies predominantly focused on the effects of horizontal hydraulic gradients and assumed static oceanic conditions without tides and waves under this assumption they identified a narrow freshwater saltwater mixing zone that could be treated as a sharp saltwater wedge sw interface goswami and clement 2007 and chang and clement 2012 conducted laboratory experiments considering head controlled and flux controlled inland boundary conditions respectively they showed that the sw intrudes landward and that the slope of the sw interface reduces along with the reduced inland freshwater head or flux for changed boundary conditions the swi speed gradually decreases as it moves toward to the new steady state laboratory experiments also revealed a temporal asymmetry of aquifers in response to boundary variations slower swi in comparison with quicker swr abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 morgan et al 2013 this is because the inland freshwater flow is in the opposite direction to the swi an decreasing horizontal hydraulic gradient partly changes density induced saltwater flow whereas an increasing gradient changes saltwater flow direction chang and clement 2012 as such the timescales of swi and swr are not equal and cannot be quantified by tracking the variation of sw toe locations with respect to the change of the groundwater head or flux chang and clement 2012 morgan et al 2013 robinson et al 2015 2016 for example it was found that the response time of swi indicated by sw toe location is two times larger than that of swr in laboratory experiments abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 the numerical simulations of lu and werner 2013 and the analytical solution of rathore et al 2018 also show the temporal asymmetry of both swi and swr rathore et al 2018 defined a temporal asymmetry index the timescale ratio of swi to swr and suggested that this index mainly depends on the contrast of initial and final boundary conditions until now research predominately focused on static oceanic conditions and excluded dynamic tidal fluctuations tides occur in most coastlines worldwide and are found to affect salinity distributions in coastal aquifers ataie ashtiani et al 1999 robinson et al 2006 werner et al 2013 numerical simulations laboratory experiments and field investigations have identified a saltwater recirculation cell upper saline plume usp fig 1 a in coastal aquifers subjected to tidal fluctuations kuan et al 2012 liu et al 2016 robinson et al 2006 2007 2018 yu et al 2017 2019 tidal fluctuations also enhance the freshwater saltwater mixing and lead to a relatively thick mixing zone this is different to a sharp sw interface occurring under a static oceanic condition furthermore with a saltwater recirculation cell tides can inhibit swi and push sw seaward kuan et al 2012 werner and lockington 2006 and lenkopane et al 2009 demonstrated that the tidal effect on sw movement and mixing zone could be altered further by seasonal inland freshwater variation despite these studies have revealed significant tidal influence swi and swr processes caused by an abrupt inland hydraulic head change in tidally affected unconfined aquifers are rarely examined in this study we conducted both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations on swi and swr processes caused by an abrupt inland watertable drop and rise in a laboratory scale unconfined aquifer subjected to a synthetic sinusoidal tide which allowed investigation of the following questions 1 how do the sw patterns and the total salt mass stored in the aquifer respond to inland hydraulic head change 2 how does the temporal asymmetry between swi and swr change with the horizontal hydraulic gradient 3 are sw toe location and total salt mass related in tidally affected aquifers 2 methodology 2 1 laboratory experiments the laboratory experiments were carried out in a flume with the length height and width respectively of 7 7 1 2 and 0 16 m fig 1b the flume was constructed from tempered glass and mounted on a steel platform around 1 m above the ground the saltwater and freshwater reservoirs were on the ground and below the flume fig 1b the right side of the flume was linked to a tide generator which generated preset water fluctuations with a precision of 1 mm the water tank of the tide generator was installed with a variable height overflow column the water from the saltwater reservoir was continuously pumped into the tank to maintain the water level at the outlet of the overflow column a programmable logic controller automatically adjusted the height of the overflow outlet and generated the preset tide as done in previous studies robinson et al 2018 werner et al 2013 we considered a synthetic single frequency tide note semi diurnal and diurnal tides are predominant in most of coastal areas which can be described as follows note that the x z coordinate origin is set at the steel platform and the right boundary of the flume fig 1a 1 h t msl a sin 2 π t t where h t is the tidal level l at the time t t msl is the mean water level l set to 0 7 m and a and t are the tidal amplitude l set to 0 075 m and period t set to 240 s respectively note we focused on this tidal condition because 1 a usp is produced and 2 the tide induced groundwater propagation is damped out at the inland boundary thus avoiding spurious boundary reflections the left side of the flume was connected to a simple overflow column that can be lifted and lowered manually with circulating water from the freshwater reservoir this overflow column can set up a fixed inland watertable the water levels in the overflow columns at the two sides of the flume were monitored using solinst ltc 3001 during the experiment the flume was packed with quartz sand to simulate an unconfined coastal aquifer with a 1 m thickness bounded by a sloping beach surface slope 1 2 the beach slope was fixed using a stainless steel mesh as the flume was relatively narrow it represented essentially a 2 d vertical cross shore section of an unconfined aquifer prior to the experiment the sand was washed with freshwater and packed carefully to avoid air trapping in the sand flume the sand was well sorted and relatively uniform with d 50 median diameter the size of sieve pore for the 50 of sands to pass 0 5 mm and d 90 d 10 2 6 d 90 and d 10 are respectively the size of sieve pore for the 90 and 10 of sands to pass the porosity of the sand was 0 4 the measured saturated hydraulic conductivity using freshwater and the darcy column test at a constant temperature of 35 c note that a high temperature is related to a high soil hydraulic conductivity holzbecher 1997 was 6 4 10 3 m s we also measured soil saturation along a drying curve at different suctions and fitted the data with a van genuchten 1980 curve a well known water retention curve describing the relationship between soil saturation relative hydraulic conductivity and suction head details in xin et al 2010 for which the residual water saturation was swres 0 05 while the van genuchten constants were α 11 m 1 and n 6 during the experiments the saltwater salinity was set to 35 ppt parts per thousand mass fraction with the associated density at 1024 kg m3 the saltwater was prepared by dissolving 34 g of sodium chloride and 1 g of red food dye in a liter of freshwater density at 998 kg m3 and salinity at 0 as tested by kuan et al 2012 on the same quartz sand and dye the dye was inert and the sorption of the dye to the quartz sand was minor the dye did not affect the solution density as determined with a high precision liquid densimeter during the experiment fresh or saline water seeped out through the beach this was expected to dilute the seawater at the seaside to minimize this effect we set up a small submerged pump above the beach surface to ensure that the water was well mixed such that the seawater salinity at about 35 ppt a camera was used to take images to record instantaneous salinity distributions in the sand flume during the experiments the camera recorded salinity distributions at the same tidal level 0 7 m during the falling tide the captured images were processed in matlab to track the swi and swr dynamics for this the color photographs were converted to grayscale images which were further processed to produce binary images based on optimal threshold values otsu 1979 in this way the interface between the fresh white and saline black was delineated and the sw toe was determined it is worth noting that this method is not intended to delineate the freshwater saltwater mixing zone for convenience the abrupt freshwater level change was chosen to replace the gradual freshwater level variation found in nature and as widely adopted previously abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 chang et al 2011 chesnaux 2015 lu and werner 2013 mazi et al 2013 michael et al 2013 rathore et al 2018 watson et al 2010 werner and simmons 2009 yechieli et al 2010 it is worth noting that this would lead to faster response times compared with gradual water level variations hussain and javadi 2016 lu and werner 2013 mehdizadeh et al 2017 morgan et al 2015 during the experiments the tidal conditions were fixed the inland watertable hf declined from 0 88 to 0 84 0 80 0 76 and 0 72 m to investigate changes to the swi the associated horizontal hydraulic gradient h f msl l where l 6 7 m is the horizontal distance changed from 0 0269 to 0 0209 0 0149 0 0090 and 0 0030 respectively an opposite rising process was used to test the swr in all eight experiments were performed with each experiment run until quasi steady conditions were reached determined by comparing images over a 2 h period the experiments were set up such that five final hydraulic gradients with associated quasi steady states were reached as listed above 2 2 numerical simulations as suggested by previous studies chang and clement 2012 kuan et al 2012 morgan et al 2013 and also detected by our experiments results given later it is challenging to observe freshwater saltwater mixing zones using dye tracking to complement the experiments we also conducted numerical simulations using sutra voss and provost 2002 which models variably saturated and density dependent pore water flow and solute transport in sutra pore water flow is described by richards equation richards 1931 in which the relative hydraulic conductivity and soil saturation were calculated with the van genuchten 1980 formulas details in xin et al 2010 the model configuration and boundary condition set in the model were consistent with the experiments boundary ab was set as the inland boundary with a specified head boundary cde was the aquifer ocean interface linked to the periodic tide further details such as the setup of the tidal boundary condition and seepage face modeling can be found in xin et al 2010 otherwise no flow boundaries were used fig 1a the aquifer was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic in addition to the measured parameters the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity α l and α t were respectively set to 5 10 3 and 5 10 4 m hunt et al 2011 the diffusion coefficient was set to 10 9 m2 s voss and provost 2002 as suggested by voss and provost 2002 numerical stability was ensured based on the péclet number pe 4 criterion mesh sizes of δx 0 02 and δz 0 02 m 3 results in this section both the experimental and simulation results are examined in detail with respect to the salinity distribution and the total salt mass stored in the aquifer first we examined the salinity distribution at the quasi steady states section 3 1 afterwards we analyzed the timescales of swi and swr as determined by two widely used quantitative indicators sw toe locations section 3 2 and total salt mass section 3 3 the relationship between the two quantitative indicators was tested in section 3 4 finally we present a sensitivity analysis based on tidal conditions in section 3 5 3 1 salinity distributions at the quasi steady states similar to previous studies chang and clement 2012 kuan et al 2012 morgan et al 2013 dye tracking during the experiments recorded the sharp freshwater saltwater interface but failed to capture the freshwater saltwater transition mixing zone fig 2 and table 1 as expected a relatively thick freshwater saltwater mixing zone was present in the simulation results the 5 50 and 95 seawater isohalines were tracked along the aquifer base following ward et al 2007 and watson et al 2010 hereinafter termed as 5 isohaline toe 50 isohaline toe and 95 isohaline toe respectively the simulated 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes at quasi steady states were different from each other table 1 with a relatively larger horizontal hydraulic gradient i e 0 0269 0 0209 and 0 0149 when hf 0 88 0 84 and 0 80 m respectively the sw toe locations 0 78 0 88 and 1 05 m respectively determined by the experiments were close to those simulation results using the 50 isohalines 0 79 0 88 and 1 00 m respectively table 1 as the horizontal hydraulic gradient reduced i e 0 0090 and 0 0030 when hf 0 76 and 0 72 m respectively the sw significantly inclined and the simulated thickness of freshwater saltwater mixing zone increased considerably in these two cases the sw toe locations 1 39 and 3 18 m respectively determined by the experiments were close to those simulation results using the 5 isohalines 1 37 and 3 04 m respectively despite this difference the model well predicted salinity distributions in comparison with the laboratory experiments and these results served as model verification with the inland watertable hf set to 0 88 m no usp was obvious in either the experiment fig 2a or simulation fig 2b this suggests that a larger horizontal hydraulic gradient can inhibit usp development evans and wilson 2016 however with lower hf an increasingly evident usp appeared in both the experiments and simulations fig 2 concurrently the sw intruded landward in a tidally affected unconfined aquifer the swi responds to two factors the usp expansion occurring in the shallow aquifer and the lower sw movement towards the inland note however that the sw toe movement does not respond linearly to changes in hf for example decreasing hf from 0 88 to 0 84 m in the experiments led the sw toe to intrude landward by 0 10 m whereas the same decrease from 0 84 to 0 80 m led to a 0 17 m toe intrusion further when hf decreased from 0 76 to 0 72 m the sw toe intruded by 1 79 m which was an order of magnitude greater than the case with hf from 0 88 to 0 84 m this suggests that the swi extent is enhanced with a reduced horizontal hydraulic gradient based on the simulation results we further calculated the total salt mass stored in per unit width aquifer the total salt mass also demonstrated a nonlinear increase as hf dropped when hf decreased from 0 88 to 0 84 m the total salt mass increased from 3 31 to 3 88 kg m however a reduction in hf from 0 76 to 0 72 m almost doubled the total salt mass 5 87 10 10 kg m this is consistent with the sw toe intrusion and suggests that an aquifer with smaller horizontal hydraulic gradient is more vulnerable to swi it was expected that a reverse swr process would push sw back and lead to reduced total salt mass stored in the aquifer as stated above the final quasi steady states are controlled by the horizontal hydraulic gradients in both the experiments and simulations we detected the same seawater freshwater interfaces and the same quasi steady states given the same horizontal hydraulic gradients suggesting that swi and swr are opposite and reversible processes 3 2 timescales of swi and swr determined by toe locations in this section we examined both the experimental and simulated sw toe movement under the swi and swr settings intuitively a reduction in the inland freshwater head would lead to movement of the sw toe towards the inland the experimental and simulation results were consistent with this fig 3 when hf decreased from 0 88 to 0 84 m and from 0 84 to 0 80 m the simulated 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes moved almost equally fig 3a and b the monitored instantaneous toe locations using dye tracking in the experiments were close to the simulated 50 isohaline toe this suggested that the dye tracking represented the overall swi process in the aquifer with relatively large horizontal hydraulic gradients in contrast as the horizontal hydraulic gradients decreased further hf from 0 80 to 0 76 m and from 0 76 to 0 72 m the simulated 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes started to move unequally fig 3c and d and led to a thick freshwater saltwater mixing zone fig 2h and j the monitored instantaneous toe locations were close to the simulated 5 isohaline toe when hf dropped from 0 76 to 0 72 m both the simulated 5 isohaline and monitored toes kept moving inland before reaching the quasi steady state however the simulated 50 and 95 isohaline toes moved inland first and then retreated at t 11 23 and 2 57 h respectively that is the toes temporarily extended further inland than those at the eventual quasi steady state this overshoot phenomenon has been previously observed by numerical and experimental studies focusing on non tidal aquifers chang et al 2011 kiro et al 2008 lu and werner 2013 morgan et al 2013 2015 watson et al 2010 and represents a non monotonic swi process as hf dropped from 0 76 to 0 72 m the simulated 50 isohaline toe moved from 1 21 m to 1 95 m within 11 23 h and then returned to approach the final state at 1 55 m the overshoot distance was 54 of the total toe intrusion the 95 isohaline toe first intruded but then retreated seaward the final quasi steady location 0 77 m even exceeded seawards its initial location 0 94 m however the overshoot phenomenon was not evident in the experimental results tracking of the sharp freshwater saltwater interface we attributed the overshoot phenomenon demonstrated by the simulation to the freshwater saltwater mixing enhanced by the tide and examined the simulated tidally averaged salinity distribution and flow field when hf dropped from 0 76 to 0 72 m fig 4 at t 0 h a freshwater tube separated the upper usp and lower sw fig 4a after hf dropped the upper usp expanded both the 5 50 and 95 isohalines moved deeper and landward and started to merge with the lower sw fig 4b and c the freshwater tube contracted and concurrently a thick mixing zone developed that is the inland freshwater mixed more intensively with the circulating seawater in the aquifer before discharging to the sea consistent with the expanded mixing zone the 50 and 95 isohaline toes retreated while the 5 isohaline toe kept intruding before approaching the eventual steady state location fig 4c and d as hf rose from 0 72 to 0 76 0 80 0 84 and 0 88 m in turn fig 5 an opposite swr process occurred with a relatively small horizontal hydraulic gradient hf rose from 0 72 to 0 76 m the 50 and 95 isohaline toes also demonstrated overshoot trends fig 5a this also reflected a complex non monotonic adjustment of salinity distribution and flow field in the tidally affected aquifer after hf rose from 0 72 to 0 76 m the increased horizontal hydraulic gradient narrowed the freshwater saltwater mixing zone and led to the development of a freshwater tube fig 6 as before this process caused differential movement of the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes the tidally affected coastal aquifer moved from one quasi steady state to another after the inland groundwater head was changed based on the toe movement discussed earlier the swi and swr processes are reversible for the considered conditions to quantify the temporal adjustment of toes we defined the response time of tidally affected coastal aquifers as the time to reach the new quasi steady state rt similar to watson et al 2010 and lu and werner 2013 i e 2 qi r t qi qi qi 0 0 05 where qi is the status of a given quantitative indicator sw toe location or total salt mass stored in the aquifer at time t qi and qi 0 are the status of the quantitative indicator at the final and initial quasi steady state respectively as expected using the simulated 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes as the quantitative indicators gave different response times for example when hf dropped from 0 88 to 0 84 m the simulated 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes took 1 90 1 90 and 1 63 h to reach within 5 of the final static state condition respectively fig 7 the reverse swr process hf rose from 0 84 to 0 88 m took less time 1 63 1 63 and 1 37 h respectively for the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes this temporal asymmetry of response time was also demonstrated by the experimental results using dye tracking 1 90 versus 1 63 h for swi versus swr i e the asymmetry ratio rt swi rt swr was 1 17 as the overall horizontal hydraulic gradient decreased hf changed between 0 84 and 0 80 m the asymmetry ratio changed slightly to 1 14 note it was slightly less than that for the 0 84 versus 0 80 m setting perhaps due to the uncertainty involved in the experimental measurements however the small horizontal hydraulic gradients led to an apparent asymmetry of the response time when hf changed between 0 76 and 0 72 m the asymmetry ratio from the experimental results reached 9 00 this apparent temporal asymmetry was also demonstrated by the simulated 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes suggesting that the swi process was much slower in comparison with the swr 3 3 timescales of swi and swr determined by the total salt mass we then examined the simulated total salt mass stored in per unit width aquifer note this quantitative indicator considered both the upper usp and lower sw consistent with the toe movement the swi and swr processes quantified by the total salt mass were reversible fig 8 given a smaller horizontal hydraulic gradient the same hf change 0 04 m led to more apparent variation in the total salt mass e g as hf dropped from 0 88 to 0 84 0 80 0 76 and 0 72 m the total salt mass changed from 3 31 to 3 88 4 66 5 87 and 10 10 kg m respectively when hf increased in the swr setting an opposite process occurred with the total salt mass decreased it was interesting that an overshoot occurred 5 77 h after hf rose from 0 72 to 0 76 m fig 8d this elapsed time was not consistent with those demonstrated in the 50 and 95 isohaline toes 2 70 and 1 10 h respectively suggesting the complexity of the relationship between the total salt mass and sw toe location see details in section 3 4 consistent with the toe movement the large horizontal hydraulic gradients did not lead to an apparent asymmetry of response time in the total salt mass for the 0 88 versus 0 84 m 0 84 versus 0 80 m and 0 80 versus 0 76 m head changes the swi and swr processes took similar times to reach within 5 of the final quasi steady state condition fig 9 resulting in asymmetric response time ratios of 1 16 1 14 and 1 37 respectively while as the small horizontal hydraulic gradient led to an apparent asymmetry of response time for hf changed between 0 76 and 0 72 m the asymmetry ratio reached 6 43 this asymmetry was evident in the variation of the total salt mass fig 8d for swi the total salt mass increased slowly and reached the final static state condition for swr it decreased sharply after hf increased and was almost unchanged after the overshoot point 5 77 h fig 8 in the tidally affected aquifer the response of the usp was more rapid than the lower sw figs 4 and 6 which in turn modified the total salt mass stored in the aquifer the expansion and contract of the usp would then alter the lower sw 3 4 relationship between the toe location and total salt mass as discussed earlier an abrupt inland watertable change caused variations in the sw toe location and total salt mass in this section we examine the extent to which the two are related for each reversible stage including the simulated swi and swr processes we calculated the standardized toe location and total salt mass as follows 3a x t o e x t o e t min x t o e max x t o e min x t o e 3b m m t min m max m min m where x t o e and m are the standardized toe location and total salt mass respectively then we defined the dimensionless hysteresis dh as follows zhang and werner 2015 4 dh 0 1 x t o e d m swi 1 0 x t o e d m swr dh is the area enclosed by the standardized toe location and total salt mass related to each hf change fig 10 and varies between 1 and 1 a positive negative dh value indicates that the toe location was more less seaward during swi than during swr given the same salt mass the absolute value of dh which varies between 0 and 1 reflects the degree of hysteresis between swi and swr overall different behaviors between the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes and the total salt mass are evident fig 10 when hf changed between 0 88 and 0 84 m the dh values were positive for the 5 and 50 isohaline mass and negative for the 95 isohaline mass relationships respectively in other words given the same total salt mass the 5 50 isohaline toes were positioned seawards and the 95 isohaline toe was positioned landwards inversely during swi compared with swr nevertheless the dh values were small less than 0 1 indicating less hysteresis similar behavior was observed as hf changed between 0 84 and 0 80 m suggesting that the toe locations and total salt mass were almost linearly related when the horizontal hydraulic gradients were small as the horizontal hydraulic gradient decreased the dh values increased particularly as hf changed from 0 76 to 0 72 m the dh value for the 50 isohaline toe changed from positive fig 10a c to negative fig 10d the dh values for the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes and salt mass were respectively 0 38 0 34 and 0 64 this suggested that a high degree of hysteresis appeared during swi and swr given the same salt mass stored in the aquifer as such the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes failed to indicate the overall salinity distribution as they were not proportional to the total salt mass 3 5 sensitivity analysis of tidal conditions here we numerically tested the effects of tidal amplitudes and periods on swi and swr for given changes in hf for a tidal period of 240 s the reduced tidal amplitude led to a small even negligible usp fig 2 cf figs s1 and s2 s refers to supplementary materials as the tidal inhibition on swi weakened the sw moved landward in addition the freshwater saltwater mixing zone narrowed as the tidal amplitude decreased with the same reduction in the tidal amplitude the total salt mass increased and the usp gradually disappeared e g the total salt mass increased from 10 10 to 13 84 and 17 64 kg m as the tidal amplitude decreased respectively from 0 075 to 0 05 and 0 025 m at the quasi steady state for hf 0 72 m table s1 tidal amplitude variations did not affect the overall trend of the variation of the total salt mass for swi and swr driven respectively by an abrupt drop or rise of hf figs s3 and s4 for cases with hf large e g from 0 88 to 0 84 or from 0 84 to 0 88 m the differences in the total salt mass between the cases with different tidal amplitudes were more uniform during both swi and swr in addition a smaller tidal amplitude led to a slightly higher response time for both swi and swr while the relative differences in temporal asymmetry between cases with different tidal amplitudes were small fig 11 for cases with hf small e g from 0 76 to 0 72 or from 0 72 to 0 76 m by contrast the response of the total salt mass to the boundary head change for both swi and swr was slower with decreasing tidal amplitude interestingly an overshoot phenomenon was found for swr fig s4a it was found that the extent of overshoot was weakened when the tidal amplitude reduced furthermore the temporal asymmetry decreased changed from 6 44 to 5 04 4 87 as the tidal amplitude reduced for the case with lower hf with the tidal amplitude fixed 0 075 m a reduced tidal period led to a larger usp area and a seaward freshwater seawater interface fig 2 in comparison with figs s5 and s6 the freshwater saltwater mixing weakened with increasing tide frequency i e decreasing tidal period moreover a shorter tidal period resulted in less total salt mass table s2 a smaller hf results in a larger difference between the total salt mass in the swi cases with three different tidal periods fig s7 in contrast the total salt mass in the swr cases was not very sensitive to the tidal period despite that the swr cases with the smallest hf showed conspicuous differences fig s8 the response time monotonically increased for both swi and swr as the tidal period reduced fig 12 the temporal asymmetry hardly changed with the tidal period for lower hf it was found that the rate of variation of the total salt mass was much slower for swi in comparison to swr for equal reductions in the tidal period i e the response times were 14 37 23 37 and 52 57 h for swi in comparison with 2 77 3 63 and 7 90 for swr hence the temporal asymmetry tended to increase slightly when the tidal period reduced from 360 to 240 and 120 s in addition when hf rose abruptly from 0 72 to 0 76 m the duration of the swr overshoot was prolonged for a smaller tidal period 4 discussion both experimental and simulation results indicated that equal changes in hf led to inconsistent extents of swi and swr the smaller horizontal hydraulic gradient caused larger changes in swi and swr consistent with the previous work that did not consider tides abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 our results show that the salinity distribution in coastal aquifers is relatively stable and that the swi and swr processes are nearly symmetrical for large horizontal hydraulic gradients however for small gradients a change in inland watertable caused by groundwater pumping or reduced groundwater recharge would lead to extensive swi the overshoot phenomenon was previously demonstrated in cases without tidal forcing morgan et al 2013 2015 watson et al 2010 this was not observed in our experimental results possibly because the dye tracking method failed to delineate the freshwater saltwater mixing zone however the overshoot phenomenon was observed in both the sw toe locations and total salt mass from the simulations when a smaller horizontal hydraulic gradient was considered we find that the overshoot weakens for a reduced tidal amplitude and is prolonged for a smaller tidal period this complex non monotonic behavior reflects an adjustment of the coastal aquifer system in response to boundary condition changes which is quantified by changes in indicators of the temporal hysteresis of aquifers in practice the response of an aquifer to both anthropogenic e g groundwater extraction and aquifer recharge and natural hydrological stresses e g sea level rise would be delayed and associated swi or swr subsequences would be non monotonic as a result of the overshoot phenomenon toe location and total salt mass are two widely used quantitative indicators for describing swi and swr processes in coastal aquifers abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 feseker 2007 watson et al 2010 in most previous studies tides were not considered and so the freshwater seawater mixing zone was narrow as a consequence the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes changed consistently and served as an estimate of the salt distribution in aquifers our results showed that the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes vary inconsistently in tidally affected aquifers with small horizontal gradients more significantly strong hysteresis was detected in the relationship between the toe location and total salt mass all these suggest that the toe location is a poor indicator for describing swi and swr in tidally affected aquifers 5 conclusions this paper examined the swi and swr processes caused by abrupt inland watertable changes in a laboratory scale and tidally affected aquifer using both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations from the present study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 in the tidally affected unconfined aquifer swr is more rapid than swi this phenomenon is more apparent when the horizontal hydraulic gradient is small in our study the asymmetry ratio of the swi and swr response times were as high as 9 00 and 6 43 respectively with respect to the toe location from the experiment results and the simulated total salt mass stored in the aquifer 2 the sw toe locations were almost proportional to the total salt mass when the horizontal hydraulic gradients were large in the tidally affected aquifer when the horizontal hydraulic gradient was small a high degree of hysteresis existed in the relationship between the sw toe locations and total salt mass the 5 50 and 95 isohaline toes moved inconsistently and failed to indicate the overall salinity distribution and demonstrates that the sw toe location is a poor indicator for delineating the salinity distribution in a tidally affected aquifer 3 the temporal response of swi and swr to inland hydraulic head change relates to tidal conditions the response time of both swi and swr to the inland watertable change increases with decreasing tidal amplitude or tidal period resulting in variation of the associated temporal asymmetry our results at the laboratory scale are based on a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer subjected to an abrupt inland watertable change a practical application should carefully consider aquifer properties e g heterogeneity and anisotropy tidal conditions multi constituent tides such as spring neap tides and gradual freshwater level variations nevertheless the results presented here shed light on trends in dynamic swi and swr processes in tidally affected unconfined aquifers and will help to better manage groundwater resources in coastal zones acknowledgments this
