14920,bacterial pollution in water sources poses a serious threat to human health and causes a water crisis to treat it efficiently and ecologically many studies have explored the antibacterial properties of two dimensional nanomaterials in water but their static antibacterial modes limit their effectiveness in this work we designed a facile and effective antibacterial nanorobots by loading super small gold nanorods saunr onto the surface of mxene nanosheets mxene saunr the plasmon resonance effect of saunr can enhance the optical absorption cross section of the nanorobots thereby improving their motion ability under irradiation and then causing cell membrane mechanical damage to bacteria our research proved that nanorobots with good optical driving characteristics displayed gratifying antibacterial properties even at ultra low concentration as 5 µg ml within 30 min furthermore the nanorobots showed satisfactory antibacterial efficiency in real river samples under sunlight irradiation these nanorobots presented in this study provides valuable insights towards designing self energy collection and self driving antibacterial materials that overcome the shortcomings of conventional static antibacterial methods as sunlight is the cheapest and natural light source these nanorobots have opened an effective and sustainable way for large scale treatment of bacterial pollution in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibacterial nanorobots mxene nanosheets mechanical damage optical driving data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pathogenic microbial pollution in drinking water sources is a global issue that cannot be ignored the world health organization who reports that around 2 2 billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water and contaminated water causes at least 485 000 diarrheal deaths every year abia et al 2018 falk et al 2022 wu et al 2023 industrial disinfection processes such as chlorination ozonation ultraviolet uv and thermal sterilization can inactivate pathogenic microorganisms efficiently but they may cause chemical pollution and energy consumption that are unsustainable grote et al 2022 malvestiti and dantas 2018 maniakova et al 2021 though antibiotics are the preferred method to resist bacteria the increase of bacterial resistance has led to a vicious cycle of antibiotics use in addition antibiotic residues will also bring more disposal problems cao et al 2023 guha roy 2019 therefore it is urgent to seek simple safe and efficient antibacterial methods to achieve low cost water treatment photo catalytic materials kill pathogenic microorganisms through a photo excited oxidation reduction mechanism but they require ultraviolet light with appropriate excitation energy endo kimura et al 2022 ren et al 2020 it is difficult to apply them on a large scale due to their low energy utilization rate and poor efficiency arza et al 2018 guo et al 2020 rtimi et al 2019 recently two dimensional 2d materials have attracted extensive attention in antibacterial research due to their diverse origin and rich family members hao et al 2022 rasool et al 2019 tu et al proved that graphene and graphene oxide nanosheets can penetrate the bacterial membrane and extract a large amount of phospholipids from it induce bacterial membrane degradation and weaken its activity tu et al 2013 farbod et al studied the antibacterial properties of mno2 and mos2 and discussed the relationship between the ultra thin properties of 2d nanomaterials and bacterial activity they found that the edges of the nanosheets could compromise the cell walls upon contact leading to significant morphological changes alimohammadi et al 2018 the above research demonstrates that 2d nanomaterials exhibit a unique blade effect also known as nano knife where their edges or tips significantly impact the morphology of bacterial cell membranes upon contact leading to loss of physiological function and resulting leakage of ribonucleic acid rna deoxyribonucleic acid dna phospholipids and proteins ultimately leading to bacterial death liu et al 2011 pham et al 2015 wang et al 2022 in addition as a broad spectrum antibacterial method mechanical killing has sustained and stable antibacterial activity and will not lead to bacterial resistance however the above research relied on the passive contact between nano sheets and bacteria caused by diffusion effect and the interaction between them was very weak when facing external stimuli bacteria would secrete an aqueous polymer matrix to protect themselves from damage the barrier function of bacterial biofilm could also weaken the physical killing effect li et al 2019 yu et al 2022 therefore the quasi static antibacterial method based on diffusion contact was not sufficient transition metal carbides and nitrides mxene with high photothermal conversion efficiency excellent hydrophilicity and good mechanical properties show strong application potential in the antibacterial field li et al 2017 zhang et al 2023 kashif rasool et al studied the antibacterial activity of ti3c2 mxene based on the cutting effect for the first time but the high concentration of mxene caused serious color change of the aqueous solution up to 200 μg ml rasool et al 2016 andreas et al reported the highly effective antibacterial effect of few layers mxene under near infrared laser irradiation although the antibacterial mode based on a photothermal therapy effect is feasible in experimental research such high power infrared light faces the challenge of high cost in large scale water treatment rosenkranz et al 2021 however to the best of our knowledge there have been few studies to use mxene s photothermal conversion characteristics to improve its physical cutting effect in order to achieve large scale water bacterial pollution treatment the self energy collection and self driving characteristics of nanorobots drive people to explore their application possibilities in many fields nanorobots can convert environmental stimuli light magnetism sound into their own kinetic energy which gives researchers infinite imagination batool et al 2021 ren et al 2017 vaghasiya et al 2022 wu et al 2020 as an easily accessible environmental stimulus sunlight has high coverage low cost and easy access which makes it the most attractive driving mode for nanorobots ussia et al 2022 building a nanorobot based on mxene can overcome the shortcomings of mxene s static antibacterial and maximize the blade cutting effect chen et al 2021 wang et al 2021 the semi metallic mxene shows strong absorption and conversion efficiency under a wide bandwidth and appropriate light intensity the photothermal effect of mxene nanosheets could increase the temperature of the surrounding media rapidly and then enhance brownian motion li et al 2022 wu et al 2021 however the photothermal conversion ability of mxene alone may be insufficient especially at low concentrations it will reduce the mobility of mxene in solution localized surface plasmon resonance in gold nanorods can increase the optical cross section it amplified the light absorption in a specific wavelength range ultra small aunr saunr has higher photothermal conversion efficiency due to its better light absorption characteristics shibu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 combining saunr with mxene is an effective method to improve the optical driving characteristics of mxene based nanorobots it is expected that this sterilizing knife with active movement ability has better membrane destructiveness in this work we obtained an antibacterial nanorobot with good optical driving characteristics by loading saunr onto the surface of mxene nanosheets mxene saunr scheme 1 the nanorobots break through the disadvantages of the traditional 2d material antibacterial research in which the nanosheet and bacteria are in static contact with each other and effectively improve the antibacterial activity of 2d materials this nanorobots would not produce secondary pollution residues in water and bacterial tolerance this active killing mode makes nanorobots possess satisfactory antibacterial effect even at low concentration as 5 µg ml since sunlight is the cheapest and most efficient light source this work provides a new way based on sunlight driven active physical kill strategy and observes new insights for large scale treatment of microbial pollution in water 2 results and discussion 2 1 synthesis and characterization of materials mxenes nanosheets were synthesized by a mild exfoliation method with lif hcl as etchant ghidiu et al 2014 the combination of lif and hcl could avoids the generation of surface defects in the etching process and is expected to produce flakes with large transverse dimensions and high quality compared with the stacking like accordion of bulk ti3alc2 fig s1 exfoliated mxene nanosheets has obvious transparency difference with the surrounding ultra thin carbon film in fig 1 a indicating that it has ultra thin properties the sharp edge of the nanosheet can be clearly seen at the place marked by the red arrow afm images indicated the exfoliated mxene nanosheets possess a large size with a smooth surface height scan displayed a uniform thickness of approximately 2 nm corresponding to 4 1 layers these results prove the mxene nanosheets produced by this method possess excellent quality figure 1b the above results showed that mxene nanosheets with sharp edges and high crystal quality are obtained after al layer was removed the chemical compositions of mxene were analyzed by xps as displayed in fig s2 the main components of c n ti o and f after exfoliation were found which is consistent with the previous work jastrzębska et al 2017 the high resolution ti 2p spectrum is presented in fig 1c peaks at around 463 8 ev could be assigned to ti o bonds indicating the formation of oh on the terminal of ti atoms which contributes to the good hydrophilicity of mxene saunr is prepared separately according to the previous work ali et al 2012 and the assembly of a nanorobot was achieved based on electrostatic effects under continuous ultrasonic irradiation mxene nano sheet breaks up under the action of ultrasonic force fig s3 which brings more edge positions as the blade effect at the edge of nanosheets can disrupt bacterial membranes it is expected that the broken mxene has better antibacterial properties the high resolution tem in fig s4 displays the edge of the nanorobots nearly single layer structure at the edge can significantly improve the cutting ability of the blade wang et al 2021 after introducing saunr the absorption intensity of mxene nano sheets in near infrared region significantly improved fig 1d through integrating the absorption curve it can be found that the saunr improve the absorption capacity of mxene by 16 4 in the range of 600 1000 nm due to the energy of sunlight is mainly concentrated in the visible and near infrared bands so the introduction of saunr can significantly enhance the responsiveness of nanorobots to sunlight as shown in fig 1e most saunrs are decorated within the mxene sheets demonstrated that saunr and mxene can be closely combined which avoided the free state of saunr in solution realized the efficient utilization of saunr it is worth noting that the distribution of saunrs on the surface of mxene is random and has strong asymmetry which is conducive to the free movement of nanorobots under the light irradiation mxene nanosheets possess a negative charge as the surface termination the positive charge of saunr ensures the feasibility of nanorobot manufacturing insert in fig 1e element line scanning of nanorobots illustrated in fig 1f it clearly shows the adhesion of saunr on mxene surface all above results prove that mxene based nanorobot has been successfully prepared 2 2 photothermal and motion characterization the light stimulated nanorobot is driven by the asymmetric heat flow tang et al 2019 light and heat conversion capability in the near infrared region is crucial important for nanorobots thus the photothermal properties of the prepared mxene and nanorobots were characterized in fig s5 both mxene and nanorobots show good light absorption characteristics in the near infrared band 808nm laser is selected as the excitation light source and the photothermal effect is visually displayed through the thermal imaging camera as displayed in fig 2 a with the increase of mxene concentration the photothermal behavior is significantly improved and the temperature can rise to 41 5 c within 8 min under the same irradiation conditions only 1 c change of pure water is observed which indicates that mxene is a good photothermal conversion material compared with mxene nanosheets alone under the same concentration and irradiation conditions the temperature of nanorobots dispersion can reach to 48 c fig 2b in fig s5a the difference in photothermal capacity is more obvious due to the introduction of saunr the strong plasma absorption of saunr enhances the absorbance of mxene nanosheets at 808 nm due to the good synergistic photothermal effect between saunr and mxene in addition the photothermal characteristics of the nanorobots have no significant changes in five cycles of heating cooling fig s5b which shows the nanorobots have a robust photothermal features the slow rise of the maximum temperature is caused by the incomplete cooling fig s5c shows the linear relationship between ln θ and cooling time the photothermal conversion efficiency calculations showed that nanorobots 59 15 is higher than that of single mxene nanosheet 57 52 fig 2c and d displayed digital photothermal images and 3d heat distribution of mxene and nanorobots with a concentration of 50 μg ml the 3d heat distribution profile shows that nanorobots have a better photothermal response than that of mxene the photothermal effect and motion characteristics of nanorobots are closely related fig s6 shows the nanorobot s momentum change during the photothermal process since the measurement of particle size in the dynamic light scattering process strongly depends on the brownian motion of particles dls particle size measurement results of the nanorobots with fixed particle size can fully demonstrate the optical driving characteristics of the nanorobots and its motion ability is positively related to the photothermal effect as the temperature increases caused by the photothermal effect the particle size measurement value of the nanorobots decreases continuously which indicates that the motion ability of the nanorobots in the solution is enhanced in order to show the light driven motion process of nanorobots fig 2e and movie s1 intuitively demonstrated the enhanced brownian motion caused by the photothermal effect for the nanorobots dispersion with the same concentration under the 808nm laser irradiation the nanorobots dispersion in the right tube showed a violent diffusion process which was completely miscible in a short time 6s while the nanorobots in the left tube did not diffuse at the dispersion liquid interface without irradiation these results prove that the nanorobots have excellent optical driving characteristics can efficiently convert light energy into their own momentum and achieved high speed movement in water 2 3 antibacterial properties and mechanism e coli and s aureus were selected as antibacterial model to explore the antibacterial effect of nanorobots excited by light the bacteria were mixed with mxene and nanorobots respectively then the mixture exposed to nir laser and 20 minutes was selected as appropriate irradiation time fig s7 fig 3 a shows a typical photograph of the colonies in agar plates although the concentration is low as 5 µg ml nanorobots still display outstanding antibacterial effect the histogram in fig 3b and c show the antibacterial effect difference between mxene and nanorobots under 808nm laser irradiation nanorobots have more significant antibacterial effect bⅴ and cⅴ bacterial inhibition 99 98 of e coli and 98 14 of s aureus while mxene at the same concentration only shows negligible antibacterial effect bⅲ and cⅲ bacterial inhibition 1 92 of e coli and 1 1 of s aureus the enhancement of thermal motion caused by laser irradiation markedly affects the antibacterial properties of the knife without laser irradiation both mxene and nanorobots show negligible antibacterial effects bⅳ bⅵ and cⅳ cⅵ in addition without nanorobots laser irradiation alone would not cause bacterial death bⅰ and cⅰ norfloxacin was selected to quantify the antibacterial effect of nanorobots fig s8 nanorobots have better antibacterial performance than chemical drugs this shows the potential of nanorobots in replacing antibiotics to cope with bacterial pollution to eliminate the possible interference of saunr the influence of saunr on bacterial activity under different dilution was tested fig s9 for saunr it shows certain antibacterial behavior when the dilution ratio is 200 but there is no antibacterial phenomenon can be seen when the concentration of saunr same with the nanorobots about 1 2000 the antibacterial efficiency of mxene in different concentrations can be obtained from fig s10 11 the high concentration of mxene showed lower antibacterial activity under near infrared light irradiation presume the high concentration led to the stacking of mxene layers and the mxene in the upper layer of solution was like umbrella blocking the transmission of light through the solution compared with nanorobots fig s12 mxene alone showed weak antibacterial ability without irradiation mxene with high concentration didn t show any antibacterial ability which mainly due to the inhibition of its free movement in higher concentration and weakening its ability to cut the bacterial membrane s aureus showed better resistance to nanorobots as gram positive bacterium with an outer membrane structure its cell wall is thicker and harder than that of e coli which is consistent with the nano knife killing mechanism of nanorobots the membrane cutting effect of nano knife will induce the release of protein in bacteria the protein release effect of mxene and nanorobots were measured fig 3d compared with mxene nanorobots have excellent damage effect on the cell membrane of e coli although considerable studies have reported the free radical release effect of mxene we have not found the generation of free radicals in fig s13 which was attributed to the differences in mxene s exfoliation in addition when the bacteria were cultured in a water bath at a certain temperature same as the photothermal temperature of the nanorobots the simple thermal effect was not enough to produce a considerable antibacterial effect fig 3e fig s14 the above results further prove that the cutting effect of the nano knife driven by light irradiation dominated the bacterial death 2 4 fluorescence and electron microscopic characterization of bacteria in order to further prove the sterilizing knife function of nanorobots green fluorescent nucleic acid stain syto 9 and propidium iodide pi dyes were used to verify the membrane damage effect of nano knife cutting mode on bacteria since pi cannot pass through the cell membrane of living bacteria the fluorescence intensity of pi dye can reflect the state of bacteria in fig 4 a and b the fluorescence intensity of pi is very weak which indicates that almost all bacteria in the control group are alive after nanorobots were added without 808nm laser as the power source a few bacteria showed enhanced membrane permeability due to contact with the nanorobots the fluorescence intensity of pi increased due to the death of partial bacteria 808 nm laser has greatly enhanced the movement ability of nanorobots and significantly amplified the cutting effect of nano knifes the loss of bacterial viability of both strains was more than 98 at the concentration of 5μg ml nanorobots more bacterial death means that pi enters the bacteria freely leading to an increase in fluorescence intensity it is noted that syto 9 and pi fluorescence regions coincide perfectly and the interaction between nano knife and phospholipid of bacterial membrane leads to bacterial aggregation the interaction between nanorobots and bacteria were clearly displayed through sem control group in fig 4c and d showed e coli and s aureus with complete membrane structure and morphology after co incubated with nanorobots for 20 min 10 μg ml without 808nm laser irradiation the surface morphology of two kinds of bacteria changed significantly the interaction between nanorobots and bacterial membrane can be obviously seen at the red arrow and the red circle mark nanorobots were wrapped on the surface of e coli while some s aureus had membrane damage and cytoplasm leakage in the presence of 808nm laser irradiation both bacteria had obvious irreversible membrane damage the enhanced cutting effect of nano knife and the further broken bacterial membrane can be seen from the place marked by red arrow and red circle by comparing the bacterial membrane state with or without irradiation it can be concluded that laser irradiation greatly improves the movement ability of nanorobots and this active killing method significantly improves the antibacterial ability of nanorobots 2 4 antibacterial demonstration in real environment as the most common and facile radiation source the sun promotes us to explore the bacteriostatic ability of nanorobots under the excitation of sunlight the antibacterial performance of the nanorobots were verified in a real outdoor environment fig 5 a fig 5b shows the antibacterial experiment under actual sunlight there is no shelter above the sample and no human interference after exposure to sunlight a small volume of samples was collected every 30 min for plate paint to calculate the degree of bacterial death fig 5c and d showed the survival of bacteria under outdoor sunlight conditions the rapid decline of bacterial survival rate within half an hour confirmed that nanorobots possess excellent antibacterial effect with a significant antibacterial rate of more than 99 the survival rate of bacteria in the control group also decreased after exposure to sunlight for half an hour to one hour which was due to the existence of ultraviolet rays in sunlight which had a certain killing effect on bacteria however the existence of nanorobots significantly accelerated the process of bacterial death fig 5e and f finally we collected river water as a sample to test the killing effect of the nanorobots on multiple bacteria in the real environment as its physical killing mode the nanorobots showed good broad spectrum antibacterial activity after exposure to sunlight for 30 minutes fig 5g by comparing the absorption characteristics of full spectrum sunlight and nanorobots we explored the solar utilization of nanorobots as shown in fig 6 a the nanorobot s absorption range accounts for 65 58 of the energy of the full spectrum sunlight which indicates that nanorobots can make full use of sunlight and convert it into their own momentum to achieve effective membrane breaking and killing of bacteria compared with other work in antibacterial based on mxene fig 6b and table s1 nanorobots still have excellent antibacterial effect under the conditions of low laser power short time and low concentration bacterial mortality rate more than 98 our research shows that the mechanism of light promoting physical killing has great advantages in the field of mxene based antibacterial 3 conclusion in this work an antibacterial nanorobot with light response characteristics was prepared by combining saunr with mxene nanosheet saunr s unique plasma effects enable nanorobot to convert light energy into its own kinetic energy efficiently the enhancement of movement ability improves the cutting effect of mxene edge on bacterial cell membrane this study overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional static contact antibacterial method of two dimensional nanomaterials and reduces the minimum inhibitory concentration of mxene surprisingly this nanorobot shows good antibacterial effect in real environment with nanorobot the vitality of gram positive and gram negative bacteria decreased to zero under half an hour of sunlight for complex river samples nanorobot reduced the concentration of pathogenic microorganisms significantly we believe this research is expected to play an important role in the

the solution is enhanced in order to show the light driven motion process of nanorobots fig 2e and movie s1 intuitively demonstrated the enhanced brownian motion caused by the photothermal effect for the nanorobots dispersion with the same concentration under the 808nm laser irradiation the nanorobots dispersion in the right tube showed a violent diffusion process which was completely miscible in a short time 6s while the nanorobots in the left tube did not diffuse at the dispersion liquid interface without irradiation these results prove that the nanorobots have excellent optical driving characteristics can efficiently convert light energy into their own momentum and achieved high speed movement in water 2 3 antibacterial properties and mechanism e coli and s aureus were selected as antibacterial model to explore the antibacterial effect of nanorobots excited by light the bacteria were mixed with mxene and nanorobots respectively then the mixture exposed to nir laser and 20 minutes was selected as appropriate irradiation time fig s7 fig 3 a shows a typical photograph of the colonies in agar plates although the concentration is low as 5 µg ml nanorobots still display outstanding antibacterial effect the histogram in fig 3b and c show the antibacterial effect difference between mxene and nanorobots under 808nm laser irradiation nanorobots have more significant antibacterial effect bⅴ and cⅴ bacterial inhibition 99 98 of e coli and 98 14 of s aureus while mxene at the same concentration only shows negligible antibacterial effect bⅲ and cⅲ bacterial inhibition 1 92 of e coli and 1 1 of s aureus the enhancement of thermal motion caused by laser irradiation markedly affects the antibacterial properties of the knife without laser irradiation both mxene and nanorobots show negligible antibacterial effects bⅳ bⅵ and cⅳ cⅵ in addition without nanorobots laser irradiation alone would not cause bacterial death bⅰ and cⅰ norfloxacin was selected to quantify the antibacterial effect of nanorobots fig s8 nanorobots have better antibacterial performance than chemical drugs this shows the potential of nanorobots in replacing antibiotics to cope with bacterial pollution to eliminate the possible interference of saunr the influence of saunr on bacterial activity under different dilution was tested fig s9 for saunr it shows certain antibacterial behavior when the dilution ratio is 200 but there is no antibacterial phenomenon can be seen when the concentration of saunr same with the nanorobots about 1 2000 the antibacterial efficiency of mxene in different concentrations can be obtained from fig s10 11 the high concentration of mxene showed lower antibacterial activity under near infrared light irradiation presume the high concentration led to the stacking of mxene layers and the mxene in the upper layer of solution was like umbrella blocking the transmission of light through the solution compared with nanorobots fig s12 mxene alone showed weak antibacterial ability without irradiation mxene with high concentration didn t show any antibacterial ability which mainly due to the inhibition of its free movement in higher concentration and weakening its ability to cut the bacterial membrane s aureus showed better resistance to nanorobots as gram positive bacterium with an outer membrane structure its cell wall is thicker and harder than that of e coli which is consistent with the nano knife killing mechanism of nanorobots the membrane cutting effect of nano knife will induce the release of protein in bacteria the protein release effect of mxene and nanorobots were measured fig 3d compared with mxene nanorobots have excellent damage effect on the cell membrane of e coli although considerable studies have reported the free radical release effect of mxene we have not found the generation of free radicals in fig s13 which was attributed to the differences in mxene s exfoliation in addition when the bacteria were cultured in a water bath at a certain temperature same as the photothermal temperature of the nanorobots the simple thermal effect was not enough to produce a considerable antibacterial effect fig 3e fig s14 the above results further prove that the cutting effect of the nano knife driven by light irradiation dominated the bacterial death 2 4 fluorescence and electron microscopic characterization of bacteria in order to further prove the sterilizing knife function of nanorobots green fluorescent nucleic acid stain syto 9 and propidium iodide pi dyes were used to verify the membrane damage effect of nano knife cutting mode on bacteria since pi cannot pass through the cell membrane of living bacteria the fluorescence intensity of pi dye can reflect the state of bacteria in fig 4 a and b the fluorescence intensity of pi is very weak which indicates that almost all bacteria in the control group are alive after nanorobots were added without 808nm laser as the power source a few bacteria showed enhanced membrane permeability due to contact with the nanorobots the fluorescence intensity of pi increased due to the death of partial bacteria 808 nm laser has greatly enhanced the movement ability of nanorobots and significantly amplified the cutting effect of nano knifes the loss of bacterial viability of both strains was more than 98 at the concentration of 5μg ml nanorobots more bacterial death means that pi enters the bacteria freely leading to an increase in fluorescence intensity it is noted that syto 9 and pi fluorescence regions coincide perfectly and the interaction between nano knife and phospholipid of bacterial membrane leads to bacterial aggregation the interaction between nanorobots and bacteria were clearly displayed through sem control group in fig 4c and d showed e coli and s aureus with complete membrane structure and morphology after co incubated with nanorobots for 20 min 10 μg ml without 808nm laser irradiation the surface morphology of two kinds of bacteria changed significantly the interaction between nanorobots and bacterial membrane can be obviously seen at the red arrow and the red circle mark nanorobots were wrapped on the surface of e coli while some s aureus had membrane damage and cytoplasm leakage in the presence of 808nm laser irradiation both bacteria had obvious irreversible membrane damage the enhanced cutting effect of nano knife and the further broken bacterial membrane can be seen from the place marked by red arrow and red circle by comparing the bacterial membrane state with or without irradiation it can be concluded that laser irradiation greatly improves the movement ability of nanorobots and this active killing method significantly improves the antibacterial ability of nanorobots 2 4 antibacterial demonstration in real environment as the most common and facile radiation source the sun promotes us to explore the bacteriostatic ability of nanorobots under the excitation of sunlight the antibacterial performance of the nanorobots were verified in a real outdoor environment fig 5 a fig 5b shows the antibacterial experiment under actual sunlight there is no shelter above the sample and no human interference after exposure to sunlight a small volume of samples was collected every 30 min for plate paint to calculate the degree of bacterial death fig 5c and d showed the survival of bacteria under outdoor sunlight conditions the rapid decline of bacterial survival rate within half an hour confirmed that nanorobots possess excellent antibacterial effect with a significant antibacterial rate of more than 99 the survival rate of bacteria in the control group also decreased after exposure to sunlight for half an hour to one hour which was due to the existence of ultraviolet rays in sunlight which had a certain killing effect on bacteria however the existence of nanorobots significantly accelerated the process of bacterial death fig 5e and f finally we collected river water as a sample to test the killing effect of the nanorobots on multiple bacteria in the real environment as its physical killing mode the nanorobots showed good broad spectrum antibacterial activity after exposure to sunlight for 30 minutes fig 5g by comparing the absorption characteristics of full spectrum sunlight and nanorobots we explored the solar utilization of nanorobots as shown in fig 6 a the nanorobot s absorption range accounts for 65 58 of the energy of the full spectrum sunlight which indicates that nanorobots can make full use of sunlight and convert it into their own momentum to achieve effective membrane breaking and killing of bacteria compared with other work in antibacterial based on mxene fig 6b and table s1 nanorobots still have excellent antibacterial effect under the conditions of low laser power short time and low concentration bacterial mortality rate more than 98 our research shows that the mechanism of light promoting physical killing has great advantages in the field of mxene based antibacterial 3 conclusion in this work an antibacterial nanorobot with light response characteristics was prepared by combining saunr with mxene nanosheet saunr s unique plasma effects enable nanorobot to convert light energy into its own kinetic energy efficiently the enhancement of movement ability improves the cutting effect of mxene edge on bacterial cell membrane this study overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional static contact antibacterial method of two dimensional nanomaterials and reduces the minimum inhibitory concentration of mxene surprisingly this nanorobot shows good antibacterial effect in real environment with nanorobot the vitality of gram positive and gram negative bacteria decreased to zero under half an hour of sunlight for complex river samples nanorobot reduced the concentration of pathogenic microorganisms significantly we believe this research is expected to play an important role in the

14921,the influence of influent species immigration isi on membrane fouling behaviors of membrane bioreactors mbrs treating municipal wastewater remains elusive leading to an incomprehensive understanding of fouling ecology in mbrs to address this issue two anoxic aerobic mbrs which were fed with raw named mbr c and sterilized mbr e municipal wastewater were operated compared with the mbr e the average fouling rate of the mbr c was lowered by 30 over the long term operation in addition the mbr e sludge had significantly higher unified membrane fouling index and biofilm formation potential than the mbr c sludge considerably larger flocs size and lower soluble microbial products smp concentrations were observed in the mbr c than in the mbr e moreover the 16s rrna gene sequencing results showed that highly diverse and abundant populations responsible for floc forming hydrolysis fermentation and smp degradation readily inhabited the influent shaping a unique microbial niche based on species mass balance based assessment most of these populations were nongrowing and their relative abundances were higher in the mbr c than in the mbr e this suggested an important contribution of the isi on the assemblage of these bacteria thus supporting the increased flocs size and lowered smp concentrations in the mbr c moreover the smp degrading related bacteria and functional pathways played a more crucial role in the mbr c ecosystem as revealed by the bacterial co occurrence network and picrust2 analysis taken together this study reveals the positive role of isi in fouling mitigation and highlights the necessity for incorporating influent wastewater communities for fouling control in mbr plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane bioreactor membrane fouling influent species immigration sludge characteristic microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr technology possesses multiple advantages including better effluent quality and smaller footprint in comparison to the conventional activated sludge process which makes it widely applied for municipal wastewater treatment judd 2010 xiao et al 2019 nevertheless membrane fouling which causes high operational costs remains the primary challenge in full scale mbr applications the microorganisms and their metabolic products including extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp have been identified as crucial foulants drews 2010 among these microorganisms in mbrs are the drivers of fouling development therefore a comprehensive understanding of microbial community structure and function in reactor ecosystems and their relationships with fouling behavior is of critical importance for both scientific research and commercial application of mbr technology to date considerable efforts have been dedicated to characterizing microbial community of the mixed liquor and fouling layer in mbrs with the aid of high throughput sequencing approaches e g 16s rrna gene sequencing meng et al 2017 recent attempts were made to reveal community assembly and interaction patterns of bulk sludge and fouling layer and to identify key fouling causing bacteria from the perspective of microbial ecology matar et al 2017 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2019 these studies advanced our understanding of microbial diversity and fouling ecology in mbr systems in practice diverse microorganisms could be propagating within the municipal wastewater itself which form a unique microflora mclellan and roguet 2019 by comparing the differences between influent and receiving sludge communities previous studies have pointed out that influent communities can affect microbial diversity composition and dynamic of activated sludge communities lee et al 2015 mei and liu 2022 zhang et al 2022a zhang and meng 2021 zheng and wen 2019 moreover influent wastewater communities were experimentally verified to influence functional groups and nutrient removal of activated sludge systems for instance yu et al 2018 observed that continuous influent species immigration isi contributed to nitrifying community assembly and thus improved the nitrification performance of activated sludge systems moreover our recent study focused on the effect of isi on biological nutrient removal and the associated functional bacteria in mbrs and demonstrated that isi played ecological roles in enhancing biological phosphorus removal in mbrs xu et al 2021 based on these studies we gain insights into the effects of isi on mbr performance in terms of nutrient removal in addition to pollutants removal e g nutrient removal membrane fouling is another determinant of mbr performance nevertheless the roles of isi in membrane fouling in mbrs during long term operation have rarely been elucidated specifically the response of sludge characteristics associated with fouling behaviors e g sludge filterability particle size distribution to isi has not yet been explored experimentally importantly whether and how isi influences the microorganisms particularly fouling causing and fouling relieving populations and their metabolic products e g foulants occurrence and accumulation in bulk sludge remains uncertain these unsolved issues might lead to incomprehensive understanding of fouling behaviors in mbrs therefore this work aimed to experimentally investigate the effect of isi on membrane fouling behaviors and reveal the underlying mechanisms herein two identical lab scale anoxic aerobic a o mbrs fed with raw and sterilized municipal wastewater were operated to investigate the effects of isi on membrane fouling fouling rates of the mbrs and bulk sludge characteristics including smp eps concentrations sludge filterability particle size distribution and biofilm formation potential were systematically evaluated to comprehensively analyze fouling behavior variations microbial response to isi including abundant rare subcommunity diversity structure specifically enriched bacteria and keystone taxa was disclosed by 16s rrna gene sequencing combined with statistical approaches e g species mass balance co occurrence network community functioning differentiation induced by isi was further revealed by picrust2 overall this work systematically evaluated fouling behaviors regulated by isi and highlighted the importance of incorporating influent wastewater communities in the fouling ecology of mbr plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbrs setup and operation two identical a o mbrs with an effective volume of 12 l anoxic aerobic tank volume ratio of 1 1 figure s1 were constructed in a local municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp the wwtp adopts a conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic process with the treatment capacity of 100 000 m3 d and its schematic flow diagram is provided in figure s2 of note the wwtp was constructed without a primary settling tank the municipal wastewater after the grid chamber was used as the influent for the mbrs one mbr was performed for treating raw municipal wastewater i e control mbr thereafter named mbr c and the other was used for treating sterilized municipal wastewater i e experimental mbr named mbr e detailed information about the mbrs can be found in the literature xu et al 2021 in brief the influent wastewater entered a pretreatment tank effective volume of 0 6 l resulting in a sterilization time of 0 5 h placed in an oil bath at a temperature of 100 c for influent species sterilization and was then cooled to ambient temperature 25 2 c using a refrigerator 4 c before flowing into the anoxic tank of the mbr e whereas the pretreatment tank of the mbr c was under ambient temperature directly of note marginal differences in both concentrations of organics including cod soluble cod polysaccharide and protein and inorganics e g total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp all p values 0 05 table s1 were observed between the raw and sterilized influent the seeding sludge for both mbrs was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of the wwtp a pristine flat sheet membrane module 0 1 m2 0 1 μm pvdf sinap corp shanghai china was submerged in the aerobic tank and permeate was extracted by a peristaltic pump at a flux of 12 l m2 h the membrane module was operated with a continuous suction mode i e there was no relaxation and backwashing during one given filtration cycle for facilitating the comparative research of membrane fouling between the mbrs of note is that the intermittent filtration mode i e filtration combined with relaxation can alleviate membrane fouling which is widely adopted by mbr plants in engineering practice cheng et al 2020 judd 2010 the hydraulic retention time hrt and solid retention time srt were controlled at 10 5 h and 20 d respectively dissolved oxygen concentrations in the aerobic tanks were maintained in the range of 1 3 mg l by continuous air bubbling at a rate of ca 80 l h the transmembrane pressure tmp was monitored by using a vacuum gage membrane cleaning physically cleaned by tap water and then immersed in 0 3 naocl solution for 12 h was performed for permeability recovery once the tmp increased to ca 25 kpa 2 2 dna extraction sequencing and analysis during the stable operation of the mbrs 14 sludge samples from each mbr and 8 influent samples were collected regularly for microbial community analysis the fast dna spin extraction kits mp biomedicals santa ana ca usa were applied for microbial dna extraction from the collected biomass samples according to the manufacturer s protocols the primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcmtttragttt 3 were used to amplify the v4 v5 hypervariable regions of the bacteria 16s rrna gene the purified amplicons were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform the raw sequences have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive database under the accession number prjna599250 the sequencing data were processed by using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime v1 8 0 pipeline and the details can be found in our recent work xu et al 2021 in brief otus were clustered using uparse with 97 similarity cutoff and their taxonomic classification was identified based on the silva ssu database for an in depth understanding of the sludge community response to isi the overall community was divided into abundant at and rare taxa rt subcommunities according to a previous study zhang et al 2022b i e otus with average relative abundances above 0 5 in either mbr c or mbr e sludge communities were defined as at and the remaining otus were classified as rt bacterial diversity was calculated as fisher s alpha which is robust to variation in sample size hoffman and arnold 2010 nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds was performed to explore the community structure using euclidean distance of the bacterial communities at the otu level the differences in bacterial community structure between predefined groups i e influent mbr c sludge and mbr e sludge sub communities were tested by the analysis of similarity anosim the co occurrence networks of the identified genera in the mbr c and mbr e sludge microbiotas were constructed using the spearman s rank correlation analysis and the correlation cut off was determined by a random matrix theory based approach to minimize the uncertainty in network construction and comparison yuan et al 2021 since picrust2 has increased accuracy and flexibility for marker gene metagenome inference douglas et al 2020 it was used for the community functional potential prediction via marker gene sequencing profiles based on the metacyc database the welch s t test in the statistical analysis of the metagenomic profiles stamp software was performed for comparison in functional potentials between the mbr c and mbr e sludge communities with adjusted p 0 05 supposed as statistically significant in this study two strict criteria were employed for the identification of the specifically enriched genera or metabolic pathways in one group i e influent wastewater mbr c sludge mbr e sludge i among the three groups a genus or pathway with a total relative abundance over 50 was detected in a group and ii a genus or pathway that had significantly higher relative abundance in a group than in other groups 2 3 bacteria net growth rate assessment the mbrs were assumed to operate at a steady state which was supported by their stable nutrient removal performance bacterial net growth rate assessment was performed at the otu level as mbrs could complete biomass retention the effluent was believed to contain no microbes for organism x the mass balance equation can be described as follows d n x a s d t k n x a s n x w w n x s p n x bio cake where n x a s is the number of organism x in the activated sludge k is the net growth rate constant d 1 n x w w is the number of organism x entering reactor with the wastewater per day d 1 n x s p is the number of organism x exiting reactor with the surplus sludge per day d 1 n x bio cake is the number of organism x to form the bio cake attached on the membrane d 1 total microbial cells in the sludge biomass bio cake and influent samples were stained by syto 9 invitrogen carlsbad california and then analyzed using flow cytometer cytoflex beckman usa according to a previous study cheng et al 2019 according to the results of flow cytometry table s2 both the ratio of cells forming bio cake to influent biomass entering the reactor and the ratio of cells forming bio cake to sludge biomass exiting the reactor were less than 3 0 thus n x bio cake can be neglected in this work 2 4 dead end membrane filtration test filtration behaviors of the bulk solution of the mbrs and the influent wastewater including raw and sterilized influent were evaluated using a stirred dead end filtration cell msc300 mosu corp shanghai china with a filtration area of 35 cm2 and effective volume of 300 ml fresh pvdf membranes were used for the bulk solution and influent wastewater filtration the filtration tests were conducted under a pressure of 50 kpa and the stirring speed was constant at 300 rpm the permeate amount was automatically recorded by a digital balance connected to a computer then the filtration performance was quantified and compared using a unified membrane fouling index umfi according to a previous study huang et al 2008 all filtration experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 5 biofilm formation assay biofilm formation potentials of the influent wastewater and bulk sludge of the mbrs were assessed using a 96 well polystyrene microtiter plate assay as previously described izano et al 2008 briefly 50 μl of the cultivated biomass solutions with od595 adjusted to 0 08 using sterile pbs solution ph 7 4 were injected with 150 μl of sterile lb medium into each well of the microtiter plate sterile lb medium without inoculum was incubated as a blank group the biofilm cultivation lasted for 24 h at 30 c without agitation then the suspended solutions were discharged and the wells were carefully washed twice with pbs afterward 200 μl of crystal violet 1 was injected and incubated for 10 min after the excess dye was removed with the pbs the plate was thoroughly air dried finally 150 μl of 33 acetic acid was added to each well for 15 min and its absorbance at 595 nm was measured using a microplate reader multiskan fc thermo scientific the biofilm formation assays of each biomass group i e the influent mbr c sludge and mbr e sludge were replicated in ten wells 2 6 physicochemical analysis concentrations of mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss cod ammonium nitrate tn and tp were detected using standard methods federation and american 2005 bulk sludge 50 ml was centrifuged 3500 rpm 15 min 4 c and the supernatant was filtered by a 0 45 μm filter membrane to obtain the smp then the sludge pellet was resuspended to its original volume i e 50 ml by adding 0 05 nacl solution afterward a heating method was used to extract eps concentrations of polysaccharides and proteins in the eps and smp were determined by the dubois dubois et al 1951 and lowry lowry et al 1951 methods respectively particle size distribution of the bulk sludge was characterized using a mastersizer model 3000 malvern uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 fouling evolution and sludge filtration behaviors of the mbrs figure 1 a presents the tmp evolution profiles of the mbrs the mbr c and mbr e experienced 8 and 11 cycles of fouling cleaning respectively during the entire operation indicating the occurrence of more severe fouling in the mbr e the overall rate of tmp increment was 1 38 kpa day in the mbr c over the whole operation whereas that was 1 97 kpa day in the mbr e previous studies have reported a wide range of fouling rate i e 0 47 3 75 kpa day in a o mbrs treating real municipal wastewater yang et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 the differences in fouling rate between this study and previous studies are mostly attributed to different membrane operation conditions e g suction relaxation mode flux and operational parameters e g srt aeration nevertheless similar to previous studies hwang et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 the tmp development was clearly divided into two stages in both mbr operations i e long term gradual rise and short term sudden rise with a turning point of ca 10 kpa thus the operation period with tmp lower than 10 kpa was defined as stage i and that with tmp higher than 10 kpa as stage ii in one given filtration cycle in particular the fouling rate of the mbr e for stage i averaged at 1 10 kpa day fig 1b was significantly higher than that of the mbr c averaged at 0 71 kpa day p 0 001 by contrast the mbr e averaged at 4 26 kpa day had a slightly higher fouling rate than mbr c averaged at 3 53 kpa day p 0 05 during stage ii the dead end filtration test results showed that the mbr e bulk sludge needed much longer filtration time than the mbr c bulk sludge for the same permeate volume fig 1c in other words the mbr e bulk sludge had a more pronounced fouling potential compared to the mbr c bulk sludge as determined by their umfi values 0 71 0 05 vs 0 21 0 03 nevertheless the umfi values of raw influent 1 14 0 08 fig 1d were substantially higher than those of sterilized influent 0 51 0 05 which was opposite with those of their receiving sludge therefore it was reasonably concluded that the continuous isi into mbrs had positive roles in mitigating membrane fouling by influencing activated sludge characteristics over the long term operation 3 2 bulk sludge characteristics of the mbrs and their biofilm formation potentials the particle size distribution measurement showed that sludge flocs with large sizes accounted for a higher proportion in the mbr c than in the mbr e fig 2 a specifically the surface weighted mean diameter d 3 2 and volume weighted mean diameter d 4 3 of the mbr c bulk sludge were 37 3 and 85 1 μm respectively considering that the d 3 2 and d 4 3 are greatly affected by smaller and larger particles respectively lopez sanchez et al 2011 the obtained results indicated a considerable amount of large sized particles in the mbr c bulk sludge in comparison the mbr e bulk sludge possessed a substantially lower flocs size with the d 3 2 and d 4 3 of 27 5 and 50 3 μm respectively in addition the ratio of d 4 3 d 3 2 was much lower in the mbr e 1 8 than in the mbr c 2 3 bulk sludge indicating a more even particle size distribution in the former overall the isi was beneficial for forming large sized flocs in bulk sludge previously small sized flocs are substantiated to be predominant foulants because of their priority of deposition and or attachment on the membrane surface meng et al 2006 wang et al 2008 therefore a higher portion of small sized flocs can help to explain the more rapid bio cake formation and fouling development in the mbr e than mbr c as shown in fig 2b the proteins were the predominant biopolymers in both the eps and smp of bulk sludge from both mbrs in the mbr c the concentrations of polysaccharides and proteins in the smp were 1 58 0 70 and 3 61 1 18 mg g mlvss respectively both of which were significantly lower than those 2 28 0 98 mg g mlvss p 0 001 4 43 1 07 mg g mlvss p 0 01 in the mbr e previously zhou et al 2015 revealed that smp played crucial roles in the first stage of fouling development with the feature of a slow and gradual increase in tmp by metaproteomic analysis therefore much lower smp concentrations in the mbr c contributed to slower fouling evolution in a given operational cycle particularly in stage i fig 1a given that smp might contain refractory residual of the influent marginally higher biodegradability of the sterilized influent than raw influent p 0 05 table s1 illustrated that the elevated smp concentrations in the mbr e than mbr c was irrelevant to the sterilization effect in addition polysaccharide concentrations in the eps of the mbr c bulk sludge were higher than those in the mbr e 11 90 2 42 vs 10 36 3 82 mg g mlvss p 0 05 whereas marginal differences of protein concentrations in the eps were observed between the mbrs 34 84 8 67 vs 32 53 10 27 mg g mlvss p 0 05 as the hydrolysis of eps is generally considered to be the main source of smp production laspidou and rittmann 2002 it can be expected that smp formation was more pronounced in the mbr c because of higher eps contents within it however given that the occurrence and amount of smp are dependent on its production and degradation xu et al 2022 it is reasonable to assume that isi conferred an enhanced degradation capability of smp resulting in significantly lower concentrations of smp in the mbr c in essence membrane fouling is the process of biofilm formation of microbial cells sourced from the bulk sludge on the membrane surface xu et al 2019 hence the biofilm formation potential of the bulk sludge from the mbrs and influent wastewater was preliminarily explored to assess their fouling behavior as shown in fig 3 the influent wastewater possessed a certain level of biofilm formation potential with od595 values of 0 76 0 19 nevertheless the mbr e sludge had the highest biofilm formation potential with od595 values of 1 86 0 32 which was significantly higher than the mbr c sludge od595 1 53 0 16 p 0 01 therefore the isi lowered the biofilm formation potential of the receiving sludge potentially via regulating bacterial interactions flemming and wingender 2010 3 3 influence of the isi on sludge community diversity and structure as shown in fig 4 a the mbr c sludge communities harbored significantly higher fisher s alpha 188 35 5 p 0 05 than the mbr e 156 34 8 while marginal differences of fisher s alpha were observed between the influent 128 38 2 p 0 05 and the mbr e sludge microbiotas the bacterial diversities of the at and rt subcommunities in the sludge microbiotas were further analyzed to investigate the bacterial response to isi as for the at subcommunities marginal differences in fisher s alpha between the mbrs were observed fig 4b whereas the rt subcommunities in the mbr c 222 39 4 p 0 05 possessed significantly higher bacterial diversity than those in the mbr e 189 37 9 fig 4c this indicated the potential contribution of isi to the bacterial diversity of the receiving sludge communities particularly for the rt subcommunities as shown in fig 4d influent wastewater communities were distributed along the nmds2 axis whereas sludge microbiotas of the mbr c and mbr e were clustered together and primarily scattered across the nmds1 axis the anosim analysis further demonstrated significant differences between the influent and sludge microbiotas from the mbrs both p values 0 01 table s3 but marginal differences between the mbr c and mbr e sludge microbiotas p 0 05 in addition the at subcommunities in the mbrs were scattered across all quadrants fig 4e and showed a higher similarity than all taxa p 0 05 table s3 zhang and meng 2021 also found that core communities of activated sludge in a full scale mbr plant are impacted little by isi nevertheless the distribution pattern of the rt subcommunities in the mbr c was distinct from those in the mbr e r 0 076 p 0 05 fig 4f taken together the isi exerted a strong influence on the rt subcommunities but little influence on the at subcommunities ecologically rare species can act as an active seed bank and pool of metabolic potential that can become dominant under favorable conditions lynch and neufeld 2015 highlighting the great importance of rare species in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem functions recently zhou et al 2021 further revealed that rare taxa had important contributions to the carbon flow of ecosystems particularly the refractory carbon degradation this consistently supported more pronounced degradation of refractory smp in the mbr c than that in the mbr e 3 4 bacterial composition differentiation induced by isi as for the bacterial composition analysis a total of 363 genera dominant genera were provided in figure s3 were identified in this study we focused on the specifically enriched genera in the influent mbr c sludge and mbr e sludge to reveal compositional differentiation induced by isi a total of 130 genera were identified to be highly enriched in the influent wastewater communities among which 29 genera were exclusively detected in the influent table s4 this implied that a unique niche was shaped by the sewer pipe ecosystem where distinct microorganisms could thrive in addition the mbr c and mbr e sludge communities harbored 18 and 2 specifically enriched genera respectively the top 10 genera enriched in the influent and mbr c and all genera enriched in the mbr e were selected for an in depth investigation fig 5 a focusing on the specifically enriched genera in the influent community zoogloea was the most dominant with an average relative abundance above 10 this group is known as floc forming bacteria which takes part in flocs formation and maintains the structure stability of activated sludge an et al 2016 the sub dominant enriched genus was arcobacter also having a relative abundance of over 10 arcobacter was prevalent in municipal wastewater worldwide but zoogloea was less abundant fisher et al 2014 lamartina et al 2021 zheng and wen 2019 indicating commonality and biogeography of influent wastewater communities other enriched bacteria included macellibacteroides tolumonas cloacibacterium aeromonas sulfurospirillum prevotella 9 bacteroides and acinetobacter most of these genera functioned as hydrolytic fermentative bacteria hfb for instance arcobacter are fermenters of organic and amino acids nierychlo et al 2020 macellibacteroides is able to convert carbohydrates into volatile fatty acids she et al 2020 more recently we found that aeromonas and acinetobacter could be selectively enriched during smp biodegradation assays xu et al 2022 indicating that these groups harbored strong decomposition capability of refractory smp all the otus affiliated with these influent enriched genera had net growth rates 0 d 1 in the reactor system fig 5b indicating that these groups were nongrowing and their occurrence in activated sludge was largely attributed to the isi most 9 out of 10 of the influent enriched genera showed higher relative abundances in the mbr c than in the mbr e further corroborating the contribution of isi to the sludge ecosystem specifically higher relative abundances of floc forming bacteria i e zoogloea in the mbr c supported more large sized flocs within it more abundant hfb e g bacteroides and specific smp degrading bacteria i e aeromonas and acinetobacter in the mbr c were beneficial for converting complicated molecules into bioavailable organics and thus achieving more efficient degradation of smp in the mbr c the enriched genera in the mbr c included sulfuritalea haliangium luteimonas denitratisoma azohydromonas bryobacter candidatus accumulibacter terrimonas paracoccus and ferruginibacter these bacteria are ubiquitous in activated sludge systems and responsible for biological nutrient removal chen et al 2020 nierychlo et al 2020 remmas et al 2016 moreover bryobacter has been demonstrated to use polysaccharides as energy sources kulichevskaya et al 2010 and members of ferruginibacter are capable of hydrolyzing polysaccharides nierychlo et al 2020 supporting much lower polysaccharide concentrations in smp of the mbr c by contrast reyranella and olb12 were identified to be highly enriched in the mbr e both of which were found to be associated with nutrient removal kim et al 2013 li et al 2022 it should be noted that all the otus affiliated with the enriched genera in both mbrs were actively growing in the activated sludge with net growth rates 0 d 1 fig 5b laying a foundation for effective nutrient removal in bioreactor systems intriguingly most of these otus 47 out of 51 were of low relative abundance 0 5 in the reactors fig 5b further corroborating that isi triggered the changes in microbial structure of the rt rather than the at subcommunities 3 5 influence of isi on bulk sludge functioning ecologically community structure relates directly to the functioning of the ecosystem fuhrman 2009 the picrust2 analysis revealed that a total of 88 metabolic pathways were identified to be highly enriched in the influent wastewater communities figure s4 in particular metabolic pathway of l asparagine biosynthesis which was required for floc formation an et al 2016 was significantly enriched in the influent microbiotas table s5 additionally fermentation and degradation of aromatic compounds and polysaccharides were also observed to be enriched in the influent communities these results were coincident with the specifically enriched genera in the influent communities moreover a two sided welch s t test was used to compare the functional differences between the mbr c and mbr e sludge microbiotas the results showed that 26 metacyc pathways differed significantly between the sludge microbiotas corrected p values 0 05 fig 6 among them 15 pathways were enriched in the mbr c sludge communities such as anhydromuropeptides recycling 2 aminophenol degradation creatinine degradation i galactose degradation i glycine betaine degradation i l tryptophan degradation xii aerobic toluene degradation phenylethylamine degradation these pathways likely contributed to the degradation of refractory aromatic compounds and polysaccharides thus ensuring lower concentrations of smp including both proteins and polysaccharides in the mbr c higher potentials in the synthesis of electron carriers such as menaquinol 8 and 1 4 dihydroxy 6 naphthoate were associated with the mbr c suggesting superior redox functions relative to those of the mbr e chen and wu 2022 colanic acid building block biosynthesis which is part of the extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis superclass was also enriched in the mbr c sludge microbiota partially supporting higher polysaccharide contents in the eps of the mbr c sludge this implied that isi may not influence or even increase the production but greatly improve the degradation capability of membrane foulants in mbrs by contrast metabolic pathways including biosynthesis of heme and nucleotides were enriched in the mbr e indicating active growth and metabolic state of microbial cells within it 3 6 bacterial co occurrence network influenced by isi the co occurrence networks of bacterial genera in the mbr c and mbr e were analyzed to disclose the influence of isi on potential bacterial interactions fig 7 the mbr c sludge community network was composed of 80 nodes and 88 edges 56 8 negative and 43 2 positive edges whereas the mbr e counterpart consisted of 72 nodes and 155 edges 51 6 negative and 48 4 positive edges this indicated that isi weakened bacterial interactions of the co occurring genera in the receiving sludge communities of note a total of 15 modules were observed in the mbr c sludge community network with a modularity of 0 75 which was substantially higher than that in the mbr e counterpart 0 46 including 10 modules high modular structure implied fewer interactions and dependencies between bacterial genera thus allowing these bacteria to function more efficiently as they did not need to depend on other members zhang et al 2019 moreover the modules are supposed as functional units or microbial niches within the molecular ecological networks eiler et al 2012 luo et al 2006 indicating the mbr c sludge communities receiving isi harbored higher metabolic and functional versatility this was consistent with more enriched genera and functional pathways in the mbr c sludge microbiotas figs 5a and 6 in particular aeromonas and dechloromonas showed the maximum degree in the mbr c sludge community network whereas candidatus alysiosphaera had the most links with the neighboring genera in the mbr e denoting that they were potential keystone taxa with the highest connectivity to other microorganisms in the corresponding ecosystems ren et al 2018 aeromonas as a functionally important genus in smp degradation xu et al 2022 played keystone roles in the mbr c ecosystem assuring efficient transformation of smp in it by contrast candidatus alysiosphaera as filamentous bacterium is often involved in bulking incidents which could cause severe membrane fouling meng and yang 2007 their occurrence as keystone taxa may explain more rapid fouling development in the mbr e overall the isi regulated the modular structure and keystone taxa of the bulk sludge community network via involving bacterial interactions 3 7 environmental implications in this work we conducted a study on the influence of isi on membrane fouling behaviors and revealed its positive roles in alleviating fouling of mbrs from the perspectives of bulk sludge characteristics and sludge community response fig 8 the particle size distribution foulant concentrations sludge filterability and their biofilm formation assays were comprehensively characterized while the responses of the at rt subcommunity structure and composition metabolic pathways and bacterial co occurrence network were progressively revealed in brief the isi was beneficial to lower concentrations of critical foulants e g smp and increase sludge flocs size both of which contributed to better sludge filterability importantly the shifts of bulk sludge characteristics were strongly associated with the response of important functional guilds e g floc forming bacteria hfb and smp degrading bacteria phenotypes e g refractory organics degradation and biofilm formation and bacterial co occurrence network these findings enhance our fundamental understanding of fouling behavior and highlight the necessity for mbr plants to incorporate influent wastewater microbiome for fouling control in fact particulate organic matters constitute a major portion of influent organics of municipal wwtps which are mainly removed in the primary clarifier and cause carbon source insufficiency for biological nutrient removal qu et al 2022 to address this issue engineering practices e g without primary settling retrofitting into activated primary clarifier have been adopted and shown their feasibility in enhancing nutrient removal hu et al 2011 vergara araya et al 2022 according to our findings these practices might also be favorable for fouling mitigation in mbr plants given that influent microorganisms are primarily deposited or absorbed onto the particulate organic matter for instance hfb immigration would greatly accelerate hydrolysis and transformation of refractory foulants due to the slow growing state of most hfb in activated sludge in particular mbr plants usually use fine mesh screen or sieve to remove small particles and fibers for better fouling control itokawa et al 2008 but it will also largely eliminate influent related microorganisms beneficial for fouling control this trade off effect merits further investigation in future work in addition mbr sludge normally had significantly smaller flocs size than conventional activated sludge which was mainly attributable to physiochemical factors e g srt shear rate condition in previous studies fenu et al 2010 this work highlights the need of taking isi into consideration e g the contribution of floc forming bacteria in influent to sludge particle size distribution furthermore hfb were found to be the dominant microbes in the fouling layer and control the fouling development of anaerobic mbrs xu et al 2023 therefore the immigration of influent wastewater communities dominated by hfb is expected to affect the assembly and development of the fouling layer community which should be further investigated in the future in the present study the physicochemical characteristics e g organic and inorganic concentrations of influent wastewater were little affected by sterilization at 100 c for 30 min and expected to play a negligible role in altering the bulk sludge microbiota given that sterilization at 100 c for 10 min has been already sufficient to result in not amplifiable dna from biomass bergerova et al 2011 calderón franco et al 2020 the dna from the sterilized influent was supposed to play a minor role in the receiving sludge communities nevertheless we cannot completely exclude the effects of the residual genomic dna after sterilization which can be identified and quantified by rna based sequencing assays in the future work 4 conclusion the influence of isi on fouling behaviors and the underlying mechanism were comprehensively investigated in this study the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 continuous isi was beneficial to mitigating the fouling development of mbrs treating municipal wastewater in particular isi could help to increase flocs size to decrease smp concentration and biofilm formation potential of the receiving activated sludge in mbrs 2 isi significantly enhanced bacterial diversity of the rare subcommunities but influenced little on the abundant subcommunities of the sludge microbiotas importantly the immigration of functional groups e g floc forming bacteria hydrolytic fermentative bacteria and smp degrading bacteria contributed greatly to their occurrence and assembly in the sludge communities of mbrs 3 isi facilitated an enhanced functional redundancy particularly the functional potentials responsible for refractory smp degradation within the receiving sludge ecosystem in addition the smp degrading bacteria played a more crucial role in the bacterial co occurrence network of the sludge system receiving raw wastewater

14921,the influence of influent species immigration isi on membrane fouling behaviors of membrane bioreactors mbrs treating municipal wastewater remains elusive leading to an incomprehensive understanding of fouling ecology in mbrs to address this issue two anoxic aerobic mbrs which were fed with raw named mbr c and sterilized mbr e municipal wastewater were operated compared with the mbr e the average fouling rate of the mbr c was lowered by 30 over the long term operation in addition the mbr e sludge had significantly higher unified membrane fouling index and biofilm formation potential than the mbr c sludge considerably larger flocs size and lower soluble microbial products smp concentrations were observed in the mbr c than in the mbr e moreover the 16s rrna gene sequencing results showed that highly diverse and abundant populations responsible for floc forming hydrolysis fermentation and smp degradation readily inhabited the influent shaping a unique microbial niche based on species mass balance based assessment most of these populations were nongrowing and their relative abundances were higher in the mbr c than in the mbr e this suggested an important contribution of the isi on the assemblage of these bacteria thus supporting the increased flocs size and lowered smp concentrations in the mbr c moreover the smp degrading related bacteria and functional pathways played a more crucial role in the mbr c ecosystem as revealed by the bacterial co occurrence network and picrust2 analysis taken together this study reveals the positive role of isi in fouling mitigation and highlights the necessity for incorporating influent wastewater communities for fouling control in mbr plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane bioreactor membrane fouling influent species immigration sludge characteristic microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr technology possesses multiple advantages including better effluent quality and smaller footprint in comparison to the conventional activated sludge process which makes it widely applied for municipal wastewater treatment judd 2010 xiao et al 2019 nevertheless membrane fouling which causes high operational costs remains the primary challenge in full scale mbr applications the microorganisms and their metabolic products including extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp have been identified as crucial foulants drews 2010 among these microorganisms in mbrs are the drivers of fouling development therefore a comprehensive understanding of microbial community structure and function in reactor ecosystems and their relationships with fouling behavior is of critical importance for both scientific research and commercial application of mbr technology to date considerable efforts have been dedicated to characterizing microbial community of the mixed liquor and fouling layer in mbrs with the aid of high throughput sequencing approaches e g 16s rrna gene sequencing meng et al 2017 recent attempts were made to reveal community assembly and interaction patterns of bulk sludge and fouling layer and to identify key fouling causing bacteria from the perspective of microbial ecology matar et al 2017 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2019 these studies advanced our understanding of microbial diversity and fouling ecology in mbr systems in practice diverse microorganisms could be propagating within the municipal wastewater itself which form a unique microflora mclellan and roguet 2019 by comparing the differences between influent and receiving sludge communities previous studies have pointed out that influent communities can affect microbial diversity composition and dynamic of activated sludge communities lee et al 2015 mei and liu 2022 zhang et al 2022a zhang and meng 2021 zheng and wen 2019 moreover influent wastewater communities were experimentally verified to influence functional groups and nutrient removal of activated sludge systems for instance yu et al 2018 observed that continuous influent species immigration isi contributed to nitrifying community assembly and thus improved the nitrification performance of activated sludge systems moreover our recent study focused on the effect of isi on biological nutrient removal and the associated functional bacteria in mbrs and demonstrated that isi played ecological roles in enhancing biological phosphorus removal in mbrs xu et al 2021 based on these studies we gain insights into the effects of isi on mbr performance in terms of nutrient removal in addition to pollutants removal e g nutrient removal membrane fouling is another determinant of mbr performance nevertheless the roles of isi in membrane fouling in mbrs during long term operation have rarely been elucidated specifically the response of sludge characteristics associated with fouling behaviors e g sludge filterability particle size distribution to isi has not yet been explored experimentally importantly whether and how isi influences the microorganisms particularly fouling causing and fouling relieving populations and their metabolic products e g foulants occurrence and accumulation in bulk sludge remains uncertain these unsolved issues might lead to incomprehensive understanding of fouling behaviors in mbrs therefore this work aimed to experimentally investigate the effect of isi on membrane fouling behaviors and reveal the underlying mechanisms herein two identical lab scale anoxic aerobic a o mbrs fed with raw and sterilized municipal wastewater were operated to investigate the effects of isi on membrane fouling fouling rates of the mbrs and bulk sludge characteristics including smp eps concentrations sludge filterability particle size distribution and biofilm formation potential were systematically evaluated to comprehensively analyze fouling behavior variations microbial response to isi including abundant rare subcommunity diversity structure specifically enriched bacteria and keystone taxa was disclosed by 16s rrna gene sequencing combined with statistical approaches e g species mass balance co occurrence network community functioning differentiation induced by isi was further revealed by picrust2 overall this work systematically evaluated fouling behaviors regulated by isi and highlighted the importance of incorporating influent wastewater communities in the fouling ecology of mbr plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbrs setup and operation two identical a o mbrs with an effective volume of 12 l anoxic aerobic tank volume ratio of 1 1 figure s1 were constructed in a local municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp the wwtp adopts a conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic process with the treatment capacity of 100 000 m3 d and its schematic flow diagram is provided in figure s2 of note the wwtp was constructed without a primary settling tank the municipal wastewater after the grid chamber was used as the influent for the mbrs one mbr was performed for treating raw municipal wastewater i e control mbr thereafter named mbr c and the other was used for treating sterilized municipal wastewater i e experimental mbr named mbr e detailed information about the mbrs can be found in the literature xu et al 2021 in brief the influent wastewater entered a pretreatment tank effective volume of 0 6 l resulting in a sterilization time of 0 5 h placed in an oil bath at a temperature of 100 c for influent species sterilization and was then cooled to ambient temperature 25 2 c using a refrigerator 4 c before flowing into the anoxic tank of the mbr e whereas the pretreatment tank of the mbr c was under ambient temperature directly of note marginal differences in both concentrations of organics including cod soluble cod polysaccharide and protein and inorganics e g total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp all p values 0 05 table s1 were observed between the raw and sterilized influent the seeding sludge for both mbrs was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of the wwtp a pristine flat sheet membrane module 0 1 m2 0 1 μm pvdf sinap corp shanghai china was submerged in the aerobic tank and permeate was extracted by a peristaltic pump at a flux of 12 l m2 h the membrane module was operated with a continuous suction mode i e there was no relaxation and backwashing during one given filtration cycle for facilitating the comparative research of membrane fouling between the mbrs of note is that the intermittent filtration mode i e filtration combined with relaxation can alleviate membrane fouling which is widely adopted by mbr plants in engineering practice cheng et al 2020 judd 2010 the hydraulic retention time hrt and solid retention time srt were controlled at 10 5 h and 20 d respectively dissolved oxygen concentrations in the aerobic tanks were maintained in the range of 1 3 mg l by continuous air bubbling at a rate of ca 80 l h the transmembrane pressure tmp was monitored by using a vacuum gage membrane cleaning physically cleaned by tap water and then immersed in 0 3 naocl solution for 12 h was performed for permeability recovery once the tmp increased to ca 25 kpa 2 2 dna extraction sequencing and analysis during the stable operation of the mbrs 14 sludge samples from each mbr and 8 influent samples were collected regularly for microbial community analysis the fast dna spin extraction kits mp biomedicals santa ana ca usa were applied for microbial dna extraction from the collected biomass samples according to the manufacturer s protocols the primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcmtttragttt 3 were used to amplify the v4 v5 hypervariable regions of the bacteria 16s rrna gene the purified amplicons were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform the raw sequences have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive database under the accession number prjna599250 the sequencing data were processed by using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime v1 8 0 pipeline and the details can be found in our recent work xu et al 2021 in brief otus were clustered using uparse with 97 similarity cutoff and their taxonomic classification was identified based on the silva ssu database for an in depth understanding of the sludge community response to isi the overall community was divided into abundant at and rare taxa rt subcommunities according to a previous study zhang et al 2022b i e otus with average relative abundances above 0 5 in either mbr c or mbr e sludge communities were defined as at and the remaining otus were classified as rt bacterial diversity was calculated as fisher s alpha which is robust to variation in sample size hoffman and arnold 2010 nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds was performed to explore the community structure using euclidean distance of the bacterial communities at the otu level the differences in bacterial community structure between predefined groups i e influent mbr c sludge and mbr e sludge sub communities were tested by the analysis of similarity anosim the co occurrence networks of the identified genera in the mbr c and mbr e sludge microbiotas were constructed using the spearman s rank correlation analysis and the correlation cut off was determined by a random matrix theory based approach to minimize the uncertainty in network construction and comparison yuan et al 2021 since picrust2 has increased accuracy and flexibility for marker gene metagenome inference douglas et al 2020 it was used for the community functional potential prediction via marker gene sequencing profiles based on the metacyc database the welch s t test in the statistical analysis of the metagenomic profiles stamp software was performed for comparison in functional potentials between the mbr c and mbr e sludge communities with adjusted p 0 05 supposed as statistically significant in this study two strict criteria were employed for the identification of the specifically enriched genera or metabolic pathways in one group i e influent wastewater mbr c sludge mbr e sludge i among the three groups a genus or pathway with a total relative abundance over 50 was detected in a group and ii a genus or pathway that had significantly higher relative abundance in a group than in other groups 2 3 bacteria net growth rate assessment the mbrs were assumed to operate at a steady state which was supported by their stable nutrient removal performance bacterial net growth rate assessment was performed at the otu level as mbrs could complete biomass retention the effluent was believed to contain no microbes for organism x the mass balance equation can be described as follows d n x a s d t k n x a s n x w w n x s p n x bio cake where n x a s is the number of organism x in the activated sludge k is the net growth rate constant d 1 n x w w is the number of organism x entering reactor with the wastewater per day d 1 n x s p is the number of organism x exiting reactor with the surplus sludge per day d 1 n x bio cake is the number of organism x to form the bio cake attached on the membrane d 1 total microbial cells in the sludge biomass bio cake and influent samples were stained by syto 9 invitrogen carlsbad california and then analyzed using flow cytometer cytoflex beckman usa according to a previous study cheng et al 2019 according to the results of flow cytometry table s2 both the ratio of cells forming bio cake to influent biomass entering the reactor and the ratio of cells forming bio cake to sludge biomass exiting the reactor were less than 3 0 thus n x bio cake can be neglected in this work 2 4 dead end membrane filtration test filtration behaviors of the bulk solution of the mbrs and the influent wastewater including raw and sterilized influent were evaluated using a stirred dead end filtration cell msc300 mosu corp shanghai china with a filtration area of 35 cm2 and effective volume of 300 ml fresh pvdf membranes were used for the bulk solution and influent wastewater filtration the filtration tests were conducted under a pressure of 50 kpa and the stirring speed was constant at 300 rpm the permeate amount was automatically recorded by a digital balance connected to a computer then the filtration performance was quantified and compared using a unified membrane fouling index umfi according to a previous study huang et al 2008 all filtration experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 5 biofilm formation assay biofilm formation potentials of the influent wastewater and bulk sludge of the mbrs were assessed using a 96 well polystyrene microtiter plate assay as previously described izano et al 2008 briefly 50 μl of the cultivated biomass solutions with od595 adjusted to 0 08 using sterile pbs solution ph 7 4 were injected with 150 μl of sterile lb medium into each well of the microtiter plate sterile lb medium without inoculum was incubated as a blank group the biofilm cultivation lasted for 24 h at 30 c without agitation then the suspended solutions were discharged and the wells were carefully washed twice with pbs afterward 200 μl of crystal violet 1 was injected and incubated for 10 min after the excess dye was removed with the pbs the plate was thoroughly air dried finally 150 μl of 33 acetic acid was added to each well for 15 min and its absorbance at 595 nm was measured using a microplate reader multiskan fc thermo scientific the biofilm formation assays of each biomass group i e the influent mbr c sludge and mbr e sludge were replicated in ten wells 2 6 physicochemical analysis concentrations of mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss cod ammonium nitrate tn and tp were detected using standard methods federation and american 2005 bulk sludge 50 ml was centrifuged 3500 rpm 15 min 4 c and the supernatant was filtered by a 0 45 μm filter membrane to obtain the smp then the sludge pellet was resuspended to its original volume i e 50 ml by adding 0 05 nacl solution afterward a heating method was used to extract eps concentrations of polysaccharides and proteins in the eps and smp were determined by the dubois dubois et al 1951 and lowry lowry et al 1951 methods respectively particle size distribution of the bulk sludge was characterized using a mastersizer model 3000 malvern uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 fouling evolution and sludge filtration behaviors of the mbrs figure 1 a presents the tmp evolution profiles of the mbrs the mbr c and mbr e experienced 8 and 11 cycles of fouling cleaning respectively during the entire operation indicating the occurrence of more severe fouling in the mbr e the overall rate of tmp increment was 1 38 kpa day in the mbr c over the whole operation whereas that was 1 97 kpa day in the mbr e previous studies have reported a wide range of fouling rate i e 0 47 3 75 kpa day in a o mbrs treating real municipal wastewater yang et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 the differences in fouling rate between this study and previous studies are mostly attributed to different membrane operation conditions e g suction relaxation mode flux and operational parameters e g srt aeration nevertheless similar to previous studies hwang et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 the tmp development was clearly divided into two stages in both mbr operations i e long term gradual rise and short term sudden rise with a turning point of ca 10 kpa thus the operation period with tmp lower than 10 kpa was defined as stage i and that with tmp higher than 10 kpa as stage ii in one given filtration cycle in particular the fouling rate of the mbr e for stage i averaged at 1 10 kpa day fig 1b was significantly higher than that of the mbr c averaged at 0 71 kpa day p 0 001 by contrast the mbr e averaged at 4 26 kpa day had a slightly higher fouling rate than mbr c averaged at 3 53 kpa day p 0 05 during stage ii the dead end filtration test results showed that the mbr e bulk sludge needed much longer filtration time than the mbr c bulk sludge for the same permeate volume fig 1c in other words the mbr e bulk sludge had a more pronounced fouling potential compared to the mbr c bulk sludge as determined by their umfi values 0 71 0 05 vs 0 21 0 03 nevertheless the umfi values of raw influent 1 14 0 08 fig 1d were substantially higher than those of sterilized influent 0 51 0 05 which was opposite with those of their receiving sludge therefore it was reasonably concluded that the continuous isi into mbrs had positive roles in mitigating membrane fouling by influencing activated sludge characteristics over the long term operation 3 2 bulk sludge characteristics of the mbrs and their biofilm formation potentials the particle size distribution measurement showed that sludge flocs with large sizes accounted for a higher proportion in the mbr c than in the mbr e fig 2 a specifically the surface weighted mean diameter d 3 2 and volume weighted mean diameter d 4 3 of the mbr c bulk sludge were 37 3 and 85 1 μm respectively considering that the d 3 2 and d 4 3 are greatly affected by smaller and larger particles respectively lopez sanchez et al 2011 the obtained results indicated a considerable amount of large sized particles in the mbr c bulk sludge in comparison the mbr e bulk sludge possessed a substantially lower flocs size with the d 3 2 and d 4 3 of 27 5 and 50 3 μm respectively in addition the ratio of d 4 3 d 3 2 was much lower in the mbr e 1 8 than in the mbr c 2 3 bulk sludge indicating a more even particle size distribution in the former overall the isi was beneficial for forming large sized flocs in bulk sludge previously small sized flocs are substantiated to be predominant foulants because of their priority of deposition and or attachment on the membrane surface meng et al 2006 wang et al 2008 therefore a higher portion of small sized flocs can help to explain the more rapid bio cake formation and fouling development in the mbr e than mbr c as shown in fig 2b the proteins were the predominant biopolymers in both the eps and smp of bulk sludge from both mbrs in the mbr c the concentrations of polysaccharides and proteins in the smp were 1 58 0 70 and 3 61 1 18 mg g mlvss respectively both of which were significantly lower than those 2 28 0 98 mg g mlvss p 0 001 4 43 1 07 mg g mlvss p 0 01 in the mbr e previously zhou et al 2015 revealed that smp played crucial roles in the first stage of fouling development with the feature of a slow and gradual increase in tmp by metaproteomic analysis therefore much lower smp concentrations in the mbr c contributed to slower fouling evolution in a given operational cycle particularly in stage i fig 1a given that smp might contain refractory residual of the influent marginally higher biodegradability of the sterilized influent than raw influent p 0 05 table s1 illustrated that the elevated smp concentrations in the mbr e than mbr c was irrelevant to the sterilization effect in addition polysaccharide concentrations in the eps of the mbr c bulk sludge were higher than those in the mbr e 11 90 2 42 vs 10 36 3 82 mg g mlvss p 0 05 whereas marginal differences of protein concentrations in the eps were observed between the mbrs 34 84 8 67 vs 32 53 10 27 mg g mlvss p 0 05 as the hydrolysis of eps is generally considered to be the main source of smp production laspidou and rittmann 2002 it can be expected that smp formation was more pronounced in the mbr c because of higher eps contents within it however given that the occurrence and amount of smp are dependent on its production and degradation xu et al 2022 it is reasonable to assume that isi conferred an enhanced degradation capability of smp resulting in significantly lower concentrations of smp in the mbr c in essence membrane fouling is the process of biofilm formation of microbial cells sourced from the bulk sludge on the membrane surface xu et al 2019 hence the biofilm formation potential of the bulk sludge from the mbrs and influent wastewater was preliminarily explored to assess their fouling behavior as shown in fig 3 the influent wastewater possessed a certain level of biofilm formation potential with od595 values of 0 76 0 19 nevertheless the mbr e sludge had the highest biofilm formation potential with od595 values of 1 86 0 32 which was significantly higher than the mbr c sludge od595 1 53 0 16 p 0 01 therefore the isi lowered the biofilm formation potential of the receiving sludge potentially via regulating bacterial interactions flemming and wingender 2010 3 3 influence of the isi on sludge community diversity and structure as shown in fig 4 a the mbr c sludge communities harbored significantly higher fisher s alpha 188 35 5 p 0 05 than the mbr e 156 34 8 while marginal differences of fisher s alpha were observed between the influent 128 38 2 p 0 05 and the mbr e sludge microbiotas the bacterial diversities of the at and rt subcommunities in the sludge microbiotas were further analyzed to investigate the bacterial response to isi as for the at subcommunities marginal differences in fisher s alpha between the mbrs were observed fig 4b whereas the rt subcommunities in the mbr c 222 39 4 p 0 05 possessed significantly higher bacterial diversity than those in the mbr e 189 37 9 fig 4c this indicated the potential contribution of isi to the bacterial diversity of the receiving sludge communities particularly for the rt subcommunities as shown in fig 4d influent wastewater communities were distributed along the nmds2 axis whereas sludge microbiotas of the mbr c and mbr e were clustered together and primarily scattered across the nmds1 axis the anosim analysis further demonstrated significant differences between the influent and sludge microbiotas from the mbrs both p values 0 01 table s3 but marginal differences between the mbr c and mbr e sludge microbiotas p 0 05 in addition the at subcommunities in the mbrs were scattered across all quadrants fig 4e and showed a higher similarity than all taxa p 0 05 table s3 zhang and meng 2021 also found that core communities of activated sludge in a full scale mbr plant are impacted little by isi nevertheless the distribution pattern of the rt subcommunities in the mbr c was distinct from those in the mbr e r 0 076 p 0 05 fig 4f taken together the isi exerted a strong influence on the rt subcommunities but little influence on the at subcommunities ecologically rare species can act as an active seed bank and pool of metabolic potential that can become dominant under favorable conditions lynch and neufeld 2015 highlighting the great importance of rare species in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem functions recently zhou et al 2021 further revealed that rare taxa had important contributions to the carbon flow of ecosystems particularly the refractory carbon degradation this consistently supported more pronounced degradation of refractory smp in the mbr c than that in the mbr e 3 4 bacterial composition differentiation induced by isi as for the bacterial composition analysis a total of 363 genera dominant genera were provided in figure s3 were identified in this study we focused on the specifically enriched genera in the influent mbr c sludge and mbr e sludge to reveal compositional differentiation induced by isi a total of 130 genera were identified to be highly enriched in the influent wastewater communities among which 29 genera were exclusively detected in the influent table s4 this implied that a unique niche was shaped by the sewer pipe ecosystem where distinct microorganisms could thrive in addition the mbr c and mbr e sludge communities harbored 18 and 2 specifically enriched genera respectively the top 10 genera enriched in the influent and mbr c and all genera enriched in the mbr e were selected for an in depth investigation fig 5 a focusing on the specifically enriched genera in the influent community zoogloea was the most dominant with an average relative abundance above 10 this group is known as floc forming bacteria which takes part in flocs formation and maintains the structure stability of activated sludge an et al 2016 the sub dominant enriched genus was arcobacter also having a relative abundance of over 10 arcobacter was prevalent in municipal wastewater worldwide but zoogloea was less abundant fisher et al 2014 lamartina et al 2021 zheng and wen 2019 indicating commonality and biogeography of influent wastewater communities other enriched bacteria included macellibacteroides tolumonas cloacibacterium aeromonas sulfurospirillum prevotella 9 bacteroides and acinetobacter most of these genera functioned as hydrolytic fermentative bacteria hfb for instance arcobacter are fermenters of organic and amino acids nierychlo et al 2020 macellibacteroides is able to convert carbohydrates into volatile fatty acids she et al 2020 more recently we found that aeromonas and acinetobacter could be selectively enriched during smp biodegradation assays xu et al 2022 indicating that these groups harbored strong decomposition capability of refractory smp all the otus affiliated with these influent enriched genera had net growth rates 0 d 1 in the reactor system fig 5b indicating that these groups were nongrowing and their occurrence in activated sludge was largely attributed to the isi most 9 out of 10 of the influent enriched genera showed higher relative abundances in the mbr c than in the mbr e further corroborating the contribution of isi to the sludge ecosystem specifically higher relative abundances of floc forming bacteria i e zoogloea in the mbr c supported more large sized flocs within it more abundant hfb e g bacteroides and specific smp degrading bacteria i e aeromonas and acinetobacter in the mbr c were beneficial for converting complicated molecules into bioavailable organics and thus achieving more efficient degradation of smp in the mbr c the enriched genera in the mbr c included sulfuritalea haliangium luteimonas denitratisoma azohydromonas bryobacter candidatus accumulibacter terrimonas paracoccus and ferruginibacter these bacteria are ubiquitous in activated sludge systems and responsible for biological nutrient removal chen et al 2020 nierychlo et al 2020 remmas et al 2016 moreover bryobacter has been demonstrated to use polysaccharides as energy sources kulichevskaya et al 2010 and members of ferruginibacter are capable of hydrolyzing polysaccharides nierychlo et al 2020 supporting much lower polysaccharide concentrations in smp of the mbr c by contrast reyranella and olb12 were identified to be highly enriched in the mbr e both of which were found to be associated with nutrient removal kim et al 2013 li et al 2022 it should be noted that all the otus affiliated with the enriched genera in both mbrs were actively growing in the activated sludge with net growth rates 0 d 1 fig 5b laying a foundation for effective nutrient removal in bioreactor systems intriguingly most of these otus 47 out of 51 were of low relative abundance 0 5 in the reactors fig 5b further corroborating that isi triggered the changes in microbial structure of the rt rather than the at subcommunities 3 5 influence of isi on bulk sludge functioning ecologically community structure relates directly to the functioning of the ecosystem fuhrman 2009 the picrust2 analysis revealed that a total of 88 metabolic pathways were identified to be highly enriched in the influent wastewater communities figure s4 in particular metabolic pathway of l asparagine biosynthesis which was required for floc formation an et al 2016 was significantly enriched in the influent microbiotas table s5 additionally fermentation and degradation of aromatic compounds and polysaccharides were also observed to be enriched in the influent communities these results were coincident with the specifically enriched genera in the influent communities moreover a two sided welch s t test was used to compare the functional differences between the mbr c and mbr e sludge microbiotas the results showed that 26 metacyc pathways differed significantly between the sludge microbiotas corrected p values 0 05 fig 6 among them 15 pathways were enriched in the mbr c sludge communities such as anhydromuropeptides recycling 2 aminophenol degradation creatinine degradation i galactose degradation i glycine betaine degradation i l tryptophan degradation xii aerobic toluene degradation phenylethylamine degradation these pathways likely contributed to the degradation of refractory aromatic compounds and polysaccharides thus ensuring lower concentrations of smp including both proteins and polysaccharides in the mbr c higher potentials in the synthesis of electron carriers such as menaquinol 8 and 1 4 dihydroxy 6 naphthoate were associated with the mbr c suggesting superior redox functions relative to those of the mbr e chen and wu 2022 colanic acid building block biosynthesis which is part of the extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis superclass was also enriched in the mbr c sludge microbiota partially supporting higher polysaccharide contents in the eps of the mbr c sludge this implied that isi may not influence or even increase the production but greatly improve the degradation capability of membrane foulants in mbrs by contrast metabolic pathways including biosynthesis of heme and nucleotides were enriched in the mbr e indicating active growth and metabolic state of microbial cells within it 3 6 bacterial co occurrence network influenced by isi the co occurrence networks of bacterial genera in the mbr c and mbr e were analyzed to disclose the influence of isi on potential bacterial interactions fig 7 the mbr c sludge community network was composed of 80 nodes and 88 edges 56 8 negative and 43 2 positive edges whereas the mbr e counterpart consisted of 72 nodes and 155 edges 51 6 negative and 48 4 positive edges this indicated that isi weakened bacterial interactions of the co occurring genera in the receiving sludge communities of note a total of 15 modules were observed in the mbr c sludge community network with a modularity of 0 75 which was substantially higher than that in the mbr e counterpart 0 46 including 10 modules high modular structure implied fewer interactions and dependencies between bacterial genera thus allowing these bacteria to function more efficiently as they did not need to depend on other members zhang et al 2019 moreover the modules are supposed as functional units or microbial niches within the molecular ecological networks eiler et al 2012 luo et al 2006 indicating the mbr c sludge communities receiving isi harbored higher metabolic and functional versatility this was consistent with more enriched genera and functional pathways in the mbr c sludge microbiotas figs 5a and 6 in particular aeromonas and dechloromonas showed the maximum degree in the mbr c sludge community network whereas candidatus alysiosphaera had the most links with the neighboring genera in the mbr e denoting that they were potential keystone taxa with the highest connectivity to other microorganisms in the corresponding ecosystems ren et al 2018 aeromonas as a functionally important genus in smp degradation xu et al 2022 played keystone roles in the mbr c ecosystem assuring efficient transformation of smp in it by contrast candidatus alysiosphaera as filamentous bacterium is often involved in bulking incidents which could cause severe membrane fouling meng and yang 2007 their occurrence as keystone taxa may explain more rapid fouling development in the mbr e overall the isi regulated the modular structure and keystone taxa of the bulk sludge community network via involving bacterial interactions 3 7 environmental implications in this work we conducted a study on the influence of isi on membrane fouling behaviors and revealed its positive roles in alleviating fouling of mbrs from the perspectives of bulk sludge characteristics and sludge community response fig 8 the particle size distribution foulant concentrations sludge filterability and their biofilm formation assays were comprehensively characterized while the responses of the at rt subcommunity structure and composition metabolic pathways and bacterial co occurrence network were progressively revealed in brief the isi was beneficial to lower concentrations of critical foulants e g smp and increase sludge flocs size both of which contributed to better sludge filterability importantly the shifts of bulk sludge characteristics were strongly associated with the response of important functional guilds e g floc forming bacteria hfb and smp degrading bacteria phenotypes e g refractory organics degradation and biofilm formation and bacterial co occurrence network these findings enhance our fundamental understanding of fouling behavior and highlight the necessity for mbr plants to incorporate influent wastewater microbiome for fouling control in fact particulate organic matters constitute a major portion of influent organics of municipal wwtps which are mainly removed in the primary clarifier and cause carbon source insufficiency for biological nutrient removal qu et al 2022 to address this issue engineering practices e g without primary settling retrofitting into activated primary clarifier have been adopted and shown their feasibility in enhancing nutrient removal hu et al 2011 vergara araya et al 2022 according to our findings these practices might also be favorable for fouling mitigation in mbr plants given that influent microorganisms are primarily deposited or absorbed onto the particulate organic matter for instance hfb immigration would greatly accelerate hydrolysis and transformation of refractory foulants due to the slow growing state of most hfb in activated sludge in particular mbr plants usually use fine mesh screen or sieve to remove small particles and fibers for better fouling control itokawa et al 2008 but it will also largely eliminate influent related microorganisms beneficial for fouling control this trade off effect merits further investigation in future work in addition mbr sludge normally had significantly smaller flocs size than conventional activated sludge which was mainly attributable to physiochemical factors e g srt shear rate condition in previous studies fenu et al 2010 this work highlights the need of taking isi into consideration e g the contribution of floc forming bacteria in influent to sludge particle size distribution furthermore hfb were found to be the dominant microbes in the fouling layer and control the fouling development of anaerobic mbrs xu et al 2023 therefore the immigration of influent wastewater communities dominated by hfb is expected to affect the assembly and development of the fouling layer community which should be further investigated in the future in the present study the physicochemical characteristics e g organic and inorganic concentrations of influent wastewater were little affected by sterilization at 100 c for 30 min and expected to play a negligible role in altering the bulk sludge microbiota given that sterilization at 100 c for 10 min has been already sufficient to result in not amplifiable dna from biomass bergerova et al 2011 calderón franco et al 2020 the dna from the sterilized influent was supposed to play a minor role in the receiving sludge communities nevertheless we cannot completely exclude the effects of the residual genomic dna after sterilization which can be identified and quantified by rna based sequencing assays in the future work 4 conclusion the influence of isi on fouling behaviors and the underlying mechanism were comprehensively investigated in this study the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 continuous isi was beneficial to mitigating the fouling development of mbrs treating municipal wastewater in particular isi could help to increase flocs size to decrease smp concentration and biofilm formation potential of the receiving activated sludge in mbrs 2 isi significantly enhanced bacterial diversity of the rare subcommunities but influenced little on the abundant subcommunities of the sludge microbiotas importantly the immigration of functional groups e g floc forming bacteria hydrolytic fermentative bacteria and smp degrading bacteria contributed greatly to their occurrence and assembly in the sludge communities of mbrs 3 isi facilitated an enhanced functional redundancy particularly the functional potentials responsible for refractory smp degradation within the receiving sludge ecosystem in addition the smp degrading bacteria played a more crucial role in the bacterial co occurrence network of the sludge system receiving raw wastewater

china suffering from increasingly frequent cyanobacterial habs high resolution time series of sedimentary biomarkers n alkanes chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments microcystins and geochemistry organic carbon nutrients metals were quantitatively integrated with monitoring data and historical archives using ordination analysis and generalized additive models we address two key questions i what are the dynamic trajectories of photoautotrophic succession macrophyte versus phytoplankton habs and cyanotoxin production and how were catastrophic shifts shaped by multiple stressors interacting through time ii whether current habs and historical changes in ecological variability were consistent with the establishment of an alternative stable state in lake taihu and what are the implications for ecosystem resilience and baselines our methodology has considerable potential application globally to provide evolutionary insights into the mechanisms of freshwater ecosystem degradation and to open new management perspectives for ecological adaptation perga et al 2015 to climate warming 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling lake taihu china s third largest freshwater lake 2338 km2 is located in the rapidly developing and highly urbanized yangtze river delta fig s1 currently the catchment area is dominated by agricultural land 47 9 urban land 24 3 and water bodies 13 6 that supports 4 8 65 million of china s population and produces 11 6 of national gdp despite occupying only 0 4 36 500 km2 of china s land area there are approximately 219 rivers with inflows going to the northern and western lake sides and outflows occurring on the eastern sides due to nutrient supply and climate warming this shallow 3 m lake has experienced accelerated eutrophication accompanied by potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms microcystis spp guo et al 2019 coupled with southerly or southeasterly winds annual cyanobacterial habs occur earlier and persist longer in the northern and western lake shi et al 2019 threatening the water security of approximately 30 millions of inhabitants qin et al 2019 however continuous water quality monitoring and remote sensing observations are limited to recent 30 years in order to reconstruct longer term history of lake eutrophication and habs for assessing ecosystem state dynamics and optimizing management strategies two duplicate sediment cores 40 cm with intact sediment water interfaces were retrieved smol 2010 from one typical relatively sedimentation stable area of lake taihu central west n31 11623 e120 06152 in march 2017 and july 2020 fig s1 lin et al 2020 the cores were cut into 0 5 cm contiguous intervals and subsamples were refrigerated at 4 modern samples including cultured cyanobacterium microcystis n 5 predominant macrophytes 6 species and surface forest soil n 5 in and around the lake were also collected table s1 in the laboratory all the samples were freeze dried and core sediment subsamples were processed for radiochronology physicochemical parameters and biomarker analyses the sediment core collected in 2020 was specifically for the measurement of microcystins and other proxy analyses were conducted on the previous core these cores from the increasingly blooming area were taken as an analytical test for multi biomarker reconstruction in this study 2 2 radiochronology isotopes of 210pb 226ra and 137cs for sediment dating were measured using a gamma spectrometer ortec usa which provides an absolute detection efficiency 95 according to calibrated sources and standard samples the age model of the sediment core collected in 2017 was computed with serac r package bruel and sabatier 2020 we have previously reported detailed protocols of geochronology and reliable results that suggested mean sedimentation rates of 0 38 cm yr 1 for the lake area over the past hundred years lin et al 2020 the age for another core was thus determined through core matching based on lithology and gecochemical parameters cheng et al 2023 2 3 sediment physicochemical analysis the analytical determination of major sediment physicochemical parameters including grain size mass magnetic susceptibility metal elements e g al ti fe mn total phosphorus p total nitrogen n organic carbon oc and nutrient stoichiometry molar ratios of c n and n p have been well described in our previous studies lin et al 2020 2021 the temporal changes of these paleovariables are shown in detail in fig s2 2 4 multi biomarker analysis three kinds of sedimentary molecular biomarkers were analyzed comprehensively in lake taihu cores to characterize the integral historical processes of habs first aliphatic hydrocarbons particularly n alkanes were used to distinguish the relative contributions of organic matter from algae macrophytes and terrestrial plants reflecting major succession of photoautotrophic communities meyers 2003 second photosynthetic subfossil pigments are reliable indicators to track the past changes in lake primary productivity and algal community mcgowan 2013 particularly the abundance and composition of bloom forming algae bjorndahl et al 2022 on this basis concentrations of cyanotoxins were measured in the sediments to infer the magnitude of past habs and their toxin production through time waters et al 2021 aliphatic hydrocarbons sediment core subsamples samples of cultured cyanobacterium microcystis collected aquatic macrophytes and surface forest soil were all analyzed for n alkanes following standard procedures zhang et al 2019 in brief homogenized dry samples were ultrasonically extracted four times using the dichloromethane methanol 9 1 v v mixture total lipids were concentrated to dry with pure nitrogen and saponified with 6 koh in methanol at room temperature for 12 h the neutral lipids containing n alkanes were further extracted with n hexane through silica gel column chromatography finally n alkanes were measured using an agilent 7890 gas chromatograph gc equipped with an agilent 5975 mass spectrometer ms with an external c16 standard for identification and quantification a set of proxies acl tar paq and s m were calculated based on odd carbon n alkanes to identify the composition and sources of sedimentary organic matter ficken et al 2000 meyers 2003 which are explicitly described in the supporting information text s1 photosynthetic subfossil pigments sedimentary chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments were extracted and purified following the standard method with optimal mixtures of acetone methanol and deionized water at 20 for 12 h mcgowan 2013 after filtering nitrogen blowing and re dissolution individual chlorophyll and carotenoid compounds were isolated and quantified using an agilent 1200 series high performance liquid chromatography unit hplc canada with an ods hypersil column 250 4 6 mm 5 µm particle size and photo diode array detector pigment concentrations were calibrated with authentic standards dhi lab denmark and are expressed as nmol pigment g 1 oc because the degradation of organic pool can partly compensate for bias of pigment diagenesis leavitt 1993 mcgowan 2013 an ultraviolet radiation uvr index was calculated by dividing uvr absorbing pigment scytonemin derivative relative to the sum of key carotenoids diatoxanthin lutein zeaxanthin and alloxanthin and multiplying by 100 leavitt et al 1997 calibration in whole lake experiments revealed that this index increases as a linear function of the depth of uvr penetration leavitt et al 1997 such that higher index values indicate greater exposure to potentially damaging uvr namely better light conditions and higher water clarity mcgowan et al 2012 cyanotoxins sedimentary microcystins mcs were analyzed following previously published procedures cheng et al 2023 briefly homogenized sediment subsamples were ultrasonically extracted three times using 0 1 mol edta na4p2o7 1 1 v v ph 3 mixture the extracts were loaded into hydrophilic lipophilic balance cartridges previously activated with methanol and washed with deionized water after a further washing step and elution with methanol the toxin eluent was dried using pure nitrogen at 40 finally three dominant mc congeners mc lr mc yr mc rr henao et al 2019 xue et al 2023 were measured using a waters h class ultra hplc tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometer usa with an acquity uplc beh c18 column 100 1 mm 1 7 µm particle size the calibration ranges were 0 200 µg l 1 r2 0 99 using mc standards from sigma aldrich 95 germany and the relative standard deviations were less than 5 as quantified from external standards and blanks the mcs were reported as ng toxin g 1 oc to compensate for diagenetic degradation waters et al 2021 2 5 historical

program sequential t test algorithm based on variance analysis with prewhitening p 0 05 cut off length 10 and calculation of cumulative sum of differences were also performed to identify significant change points and the main phases of past ecological dynamics andersen et al 2009 cao et al 2020 ordination analysis the gradient length of 1 total standard deviation unit for the paleorecords suggested that a linear model was suitable for unconstrained and constrained ordinations using canoco 5 program ter braak and šmilauer 2012 nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis based on bray curtis distances was performed to identify structural changes in paleorecords through time in a reduced two dimensional space for technical purposes the scores of both nmds axes nmds1 nmds2 were taken as the main representative variation indices of ecological dynamics ibrahim et al 2020 up to ten environmental variables referring to regional climate agriculture and urbanization fig s3 were included in the initial analysis to evaluate their significance and collinearity via a series of forward selection and restricted monte carlo permutation tests n 999 ter braak and šmilauer 2012 four runs of redundancy analysis rda were then conducted to explore potential relationships between paleorecords and individual categories of significant environmental variables of agriculture fertilizer consumption urbanization sewage population and climate air temperature wind speed respectively variance partitioning analysis vpa was used to estimate the fractions of historical variances in the paleorecord time series explained by all categories of significant environmental variables and their interactions bunting et al 2016 generalized additive model analysis generalized additive models gams analysis were performed to distinguish and quantify the impacts of local human activity and regional climate change on lake taihu ecosystem dynamics through time the inferred human index i e weighted averages of z score normalized population and fertilizer consumption and climate index i e ratios of annual mean air temperature to wind speed were chosen as representative predictor variables while the response variables were scores of both nmds axes calculated from the dataset collating multiple paleorecords details in text s2 the functions gam and predict gam from mgcv package

pigments and other biomarkers can accurately record the variability of algal communities following fertilization through time cottingham et al 2000 meyers 2003 and thus reliably reflect changes in

estimated by the numerical simulation of both variance and rate of change roc following standard technical recommendations simpson 2018 bjorndahl et al 2022 the variances were extracted by calculating the standard deviations performed with the earlywarnings packages in r dakos et al 2015 the rocs were generated from the posterior simulations of the fitted gams using the first derivative of a spline all models fitting the selected time series contained a continuous time first order autoregressive car 1 process to account for temporal autocorrelation these analyses were performed using r software with the mgcv and vegan packages wood 2017 simpson 2018 3 results multiple analyses of sediment cores from lake taihu revealed distinct dynamics of lake primary producers following fertilization and climate change proxies for organic matter nutrients autotrophic production and cyanobacterial habs showed particularly prominent changes which exhibited three similar phases since the 1900s 3 1 sedimentary oc nutrients and n alkanes sediments were mainly composed of coarse silt 16 63 µm accounting for 50 prior to 1950 peaks of oc c n ratios 12 total phosphorus and nitrogen in the mid 1910s and 1930s coeval with higher sand content and lithogenic elements e g al ti fig 1 a and fig s2 probably showed enhanced inputs of terrigenous nutrients and organic matter meyers 2003 sedimentary n alkanes before the 1950s were dominated by middle chain n c21 n c23 n c25 and long chain n c27 n c29 n c31 n c33 components averaged 87 5 fig 1a and fig s4 similar to that of macrophytes and surface soil fig s5 these characteristics together with relatively high values of tar and paq 0 4 and low s m ratios suggested dominant contributions of organic matter from submerged floating macrophytes and allochthonous origin ficken et al 2000 meyers 2003 during the 1950s 1980s content of fine silt 4 16 µm and lithogenic elements increased slightly while oc and nutrients remained stable fig 1a and fig s2 the c n ratios decreased continuously to 10 and proportions of short chain n alkanes n c17 n c19 increased sharply since the mid 1970s reflecting substantially higher algal organic matter contribution as algal communities particularly cyanobacteria have been identified as main contributors of short chain n alkanes in our survey fig s5 and previous analyses zhang et al 2017 middle chain n alkanes and paq decreased and remained at low levels while s m ratios fluctuated and increased to a high level suggesting a potential transition toward an algae dominated lake state meanwhile long chain n alkanes acl and tar as indicators of allochthonous organic matter input meyers 2003 showed coeval decreases and relatively low values from 1970 since the 1990s sediments were dominated by fine particles 16 µm enriched with magnetic mineral and lithogenic elements fig s2 relating to well weathered terrigenous detritus lin et al 2020 sedimentary phosphorus nitrogen and oc showed 1 5 fold increases while c n ratios fluctuated around 10 short chain n alkanes from algae maintained a relatively high abundance followed by a decrease whereas middle chain n alkanes and paq values remained relatively low and stable fig 1a these results along with relatively high s m ratios suggested an algae dominated organic matter source and a lake ecological regime that has greatly deviated from the historical conditions prior to 1950 3 2 subfossil pigments and cyanotoxins analyses of subfossil chlorophylls carotenoids and cyanotoxins revealed main shifts of algal communities are consistent with pronounced lake eutrophication figs 1b and 2 an increase in the ratios of labile to chemically stable chlorophylls chl a pheophytin a in the upper core fig s6 reflected slightly improved pigment preservation when algal production increases as expected leavitt 1993 waters et al 2021 additionally ratios of total carotenoids to total identified pigments did not change with depth indicating a relatively constant preservation environment since the 1900s this phenomenon coincided with generally stable redox conditions since the 1950s as inferred from fe mn ratios fig 2 thus the molecular biomarkers were well preserved in recent sediments of lake taihu beyond similar human impacted waters elsewhere bunting et al 2016 zastepa et al 2017 waters et al 2021 huang et al 2022 zeng et al 2023 cluster analysis of pigment assemblages identified the most significant turning points around the 1950s and 1980s and that algal communities showed two main patterns of change fig 1b first concentrations of pigments from siliceous algae diatoxanthin and cryptophytes alloxanthin that commonly grow in the spring deng et al 2014 were too low to be detected before 1995 then generally increased in recent sediments second subfossil biomarkers from summer bloom forming colonial cyanobacteria and chlorophytes canthaxanthin lutein zeaxanthin pheophytin b and b guo et al 2019 together with chemically stable indicators of total algal abundance β carotene total carotenoids were relatively constant during most of the 20th century increased 300 700 to high levels during the 1980s 1990s then showed few fluctuations or lower trends in the recent decade the echinenone cyanobacterial pigment that is often found to be extremely enriched in microcystis hesse et al 2001 was coeluted with labile chl a all phototrophs in hplc which collectively showed a 9 fold increase similar to β carotene correspondingly a sharp decrease of the uvr index occurred during the 1980s 2000s indicating a marked decline in uv exposure and water clarity leavitt et al 1997 taken together these results demonstrate that algal production increased 3 to 7 fold since the 1980s when an ecosystem state shift was initiated recent modification of algal communities inferred from pigments is basically consistent with modern monitoring and molecular genetic results that showed a 50 phytoplankton biomass contribution from microcystis dominated cyanobacteria zhang et al 2018a guo et al 2019 2023 cyanotoxins three microcystin congeners were detected throughout the century long sediment record and their production showed historical variations corresponding to bloom forming cyanobacterial proliferation fig 2 in general concentrations of total mcs fluctuated without clear directional trends before 1950 peaked between the 1960s 514 ng g 1 oc and the 1980s 1752 ng g 1 oc then increased exponentially since the 1990s to the highest value 40 000 ng g 1 oc in the surface sediments elevated production of total mcs was mainly sourced from increased contributions of highly toxic mc yr averaged 45 and mc lr averaged 36 whereas contribution of hypotoxic mc rr averaged 19 generally decreased since the 1950s moreover rapid growth of cyanotoxin production was in pace with enriched nitrogen phosphorus elevated n p ratios and decreased c n ratios indicating a combined effect of nutrient inputs and stoichiometry changes xue et al 2023 3 3 driver response relationships nmds analysis tracked three distinguishable groups from biomarker and geochemistry assemblages since the 1900s fig s7 as also observed from the stratigraphic temporal cluster fig 1 the main gradient of paleorecord changes was associated with increased levels of autotrophic production bloom forming cyanobacterial proliferation cyanotoxin occurrence and loss of macrophytes and water clarity as nutrient enrichment led to changes in trophic state this ecological gradient was highly correlated with nmds1 and explained 81 3 of variation compared to 18 7 from nmds2 further statistical analyses using sequential t test and cumulative sum of differences for nmds1 scores confirmed shifting points of the lake ecosystem around the 1950s and 1980s fig s8 rda with the agriculture predictor fertilizer alone explained 32 1 of variation in geochemistry and biomarkers during the past hundred years similar to the variation explained by the sewage predictor population 30 9 alone fig 3 a and fig s9 in contrast rda using climate variables either elevated air temperature 23 6 or declined wind speed 30 6 alone explained fewer changes in the paleorecords vpa showed that environmental variation associated with agriculture sewage and climate totally explained 61 4 of past dynamics in lake ecosystem fig s9 comparison of individual and interactive categories suggested that most of the explained variance arose from total interactions between agriculture sewage and climate change 20 1 followed by that from sewage 17 5 and that from agriculture 10 4 alone fig 3a the remaining unexplained variance 38 6 may be related to other environmental factors particularly precipitation hydrological fluctuations and extreme weather events which are important but usually hard to statistically quantify in long term driver response analysis mcgowan et al 2012 bunting et al 2016 gams estimated when and to what extent human activities and climate change contributed to the past ecological dynamics of lake taihu as indicated by the nmds1 and nmds2 scores of the paleorecords fig 3 documentary data inferred human and climate indices text s2 fig s7 were considered as representative predictor variables according to our rda results and previous investigations at lake taihu zhang et al 2018b lin et al 2021 human and climate indices together explained 94 4 of variation in nmds1 and 91 3 in nmds2 respectively table s2 the smooth functions fig 3b illustrated a nonlinear response of nmds1 to human index and a significantly linear response to climate nmds2 also responded significantly to human and climate indices with nonlinear trends from a temporal perspective the simultaneous effects of changing human activity and climate were detected for both nmds axis scores since the 1980s when simultaneous positive effects on the nmds1 prevailed fig 3c as lake trophic status deteriorated the contribution of climate increased and even surpassed that of anthropogenic nutrient influx in recent decades 3 4 historical changes in ecological variability the fitted gams were significant p 0 001 for dominant biomarker time series of primary producers community turnover and cyanotoxins table s3 allowing estimation of historical patterns of lake ecosystem variability temporal trends in variance and roc were similar for specific variables fig 4 a variance of time series in total and bloom forming algae particularly cyanobacteria started to increase from the early 1990s and the corresponding rocs increased significantly since the mid 1980s in contrast cyanotoxins showed sharp increases in variance and roc after 2010 lagging behind the initial microcystis blooms changes in variance and roc of the scores of nmds1 axis were particularly coherent in recent three decades manifesting as a significant increase followed by a decline notably temporal variability of these key ecosystem components increased to varying degrees following the apparent ecosystem state change 4 discussion this work shows that integrated application of multi biomarkers and geochemistry proxies on lake sediment sequences provides a powerful means to retrospectively assess long term dynamics in habs cyanotoxin production and ecosystem variability in response to multiple stressors and their interactions our results revealed critical processes of eutrophication and primary production culminating in an abrupt ecological shift characterized by increasingly toxic cyanobacterial blooms microcystis from the 1980s in lake taihu thereafter increasing ecological variability suggested that lake taihu was probably subjected to elevated variation in the forcing mechanism dakos et al 2015 and or exhibited a paradox of enrichment cottingham et al 2000 bunting et al 2016 with nutrient cyclic loops scheffer et al 2001 xu et al 2021 which failed to establish an alternative stable state carpenter et al 2011 our findings have demonstrated increased ecological vulnerability and reduced predictability of cyanobacterial habs following state change and climate warming which has profound environmental implications 4 1 multiple stressors underlying habs and cyanotoxin production freshwater ecosystems are widely experiencing the allied attack of climate change and eutrophication moss et al 2011 particularly for degrading shallow lakes zhou et al 2022 given their potential driving synergy paerl and scott 2010 meerhoff et al 2022 as shown in previous investigations kosten et al 2012 experiments richardson et al 2019 modeling taranu et al 2017 kakouei et al 2021 and syntheses havens and paerl 2015 taranu et al 2015 jeppesen et al 2020 eutrophic conditions and warmer climate contribute to higher phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacterial dominance thus increase the risk of toxic habs and water quality degradation huisman et al 2018 this phenomenon is extremely true for large shallow lake taihu similar to lakes okeechobee usa winnipeg canada võrtsjärv estonia kasumigaura japan chaohu china and shallow parts of other large lakes worldwide qin et al 2019 zhou et al 2022 accelerated climate warming and nutrients influx n p from the watershed due to rapid agricultural expansion and urbanization fig s3 are widely recognized as the driving factors xu et al 2021 zeng et al 2023 our paleolimnological reconstruction and ordination results figs 2 and 3a offered empirical complement of lake eutrophication from long term perspective associating largely with agricultural practices and urban sewage moreover interactions between climate change warming wind stilling and anthropogenic nutrients in vpa explained a large part of the historical dynamics in the taihu ecosystem fig 3a this is consistent with theoretical and empirical expectations that environmental effects work on lakes via coupled influxes of energy temperature irradiance wind and mass precipitation nutrients particles leavitt et al 2009 according to the gam results fig 3c the majority of the forcing interactions through time were cumulative with simultaneous positive effects since intensified fertilization and cyanobacterial blooms in the 1980s thus our empirical results highlight the synergistic effects of eutrophication and climate change on cyanobacterial temporal dynamics as previously and newly loaded nutrients are effectively retained and recycled in lake taihu zhu et al 2020 xu et al 2021 warming effects have produced a suite of favorable environmental conditions to sustain the hab potential first phytoplankton universally optimize growth as temperatures increase to a certain extent notably for cyanobacteria and other bloom forming algae that prefer warming conditions carey et al 2012 havens and paerl 2015 second enhanced water column stability and thermal stratification following joint regional warming and atmospheric stilling fig s3 modify phytoplankton communities by favoring surface bloom forming cyanobacteria through buoyancy regulation kosten et al 2012 the consequent accumulation of detrital organic matter from algae in summer and autumn usually enhances deoxygenation of subsurface water layers stimulates the release of internal phosphorus yin et al 2022 and inhibits nitrification denitrification coupling in lake taihu zhu et al 2020 this is also indicated by the shifts in the sediment nutrient stoichiometry such as elevated n p ratios and fluctuated c n ratios following blooms fig 2 bloom induced underwater light attenuation fig 1b further reinforce buoyant cyanobacteria dominance carey et al 2012 guo et al 2019 third rising temperature can not only increase the mineralization rate of watershed soils but also be accompanied by more extreme rainstorms both of which could enhance diffuse and legacy nutrient delivery to waters tropical cyclones and extreme weather have been reported to play an important role in stimulating cyanobacterial bloom formation in lake taihu zhu et al 2014 yang et al 2016 furthermore human and climate driven hydrological alterations e g 20 rise of taihu lake level since 1992 zhang et al 2018b combined with projected warming and drought woolway et al 2020 are expected to extend vertical stratification and water residence time which will likely promote habs and complicate eutrophication management havens and paerl 2015 yang et al 2017 meerhoff et al 2022 in turn the interactive effects also strongly stimulate the production of hazardous cyanotoxins particularly microcystins as found in microcosm experiments lürling et al 2018 our biomarker reconstruction revealed that significant increases in mcs lagged behind the initial blooms by over a decade in lake taihu fig 2 until the shift to and formation of toxic microcystis blooms hu et al 2016 guo et al 2019 as climate change and eutrophication intensified in the 1990s in particular this process promoted the strains producing more toxic mc lr and mc yr and exacerbated the ecological risk as similarly observed in other degraded freshwaters zastepa et al 2017 henao et al 2019 increasing temperature and nutrient concentrations are corroborated as major predictors of large increases in regional mc maxima e g north america taranu et al 2017 hayes et al 2020 and even global patterns of mc congeners taranu et al 2019 despite faster photodegradation in some environments e g the tropics surface freshwaters like lake taihu in the warming future might experience a predicted higher occurrence of highly toxic mcs with increasing risks to environmental and human health multiple stressors can further provoke large changes in food webs with potential cascading effects in particular weakening top down control in regulating phytoplankton biomass and habs meerhoff et al 2022 in lake taihu long term loss of macrophytes fig 1a probably have caused less refuge available for phytoplankton competitors such as grazer macroinvertebrates and zooplankton moss et al 2011 janssen et al 2014 over fishing and extensive stocking have altered lake fish community diversity and structure by favoring large amounts of small zooplanktivorous species notably anchovy mao et al 2020 these shifts in aquatic communities substantially reduced algal grazing by zooplankton in the lake furthermore fewer piscivorous fish more omnivorous and herbivorous species and decreased body size of zooplankton are expected in warmer waters jeppesen et al 2020 such changes are likely to reinforce the positive interaction between climate change and eutrophication given the projected algal proliferation toxin producing cyanobacterial dominance and less intensive top down effects 4 2 ecosystem state shift and baseline implications studies on shallow lakes suggest that increased variations in phytoplankton parameters and regulatory mechanisms are reliable indicators of ecosystem state change from clear water to turbid water dominated by prolific nuisance cyanobacteria scheffer et al 2001 janssen et al 2014 yang et al 2017 this catastrophic shift may arise from abrupt but persistent changes in external forcings e g climate change nutrient enrichment and or gradual variation in intrinsic factors e g trophic cascades bunting et al 2016 carpenter et al 2022 ecological theory predicts that during the transitions among alternate stable states lake ecosystems may exhibit transient rising then decreasing variability in focal parameters carpenter et al 2011 dakos et al 2015 following the re establishment of internal feedback mechanisms e g internal nutrient cycling loss of macrophytes shading scheffer and van nes 2007 janssen et al 2014 however both temporal variance and roc analyses in lake taihu explicitly demonstrated increasing phytoplankton variability after the ecological shift fig 4a and fig s8 suggesting that a stable state has not yet been established in particular the persistent rise in variability of total algae bloom forming taxa and cyanotoxins is more consistent with the paradox of enrichment wherein ecological resilience and predictability declined cottingham et al 2000 bunting et al 2016 carpenter et al 2022 the rising variability of primary producers probably reflects persistent increases in external forcings dakos et al 2015 huang et al 2022 or the constraints of similar large lakes to establish alternative stable states scheffer and van nes 2007 janssen et al 2014 bruel et al 2021 although a series of measures costing us 30 billion have been implemented to address wastewater discharge and improve water quality in lake taihu watershed qin et al 2019 recent warming climate and extreme weather continue to exacerbate non point nutrient loading xu et al 2021 and internal release from sediments yin et al 2022 meanwhile growing evidence indicates that cyanobacterial dominance is exerting a positive feedback with climate warming huisman et al 2018 meerhoff et al 2022 as blooms usually promote the release of nutrients xu et al 2021 yin et al 2022 and greenhouse gasses yan et al 2017 that increase the warming potential under these circumstances cyanobacterial dominance may thus be a self perpetuating phenomenon havens and paerl 2015 meerhoff et al 2022 and toxic habs are predicted to increase in lake taihu with climate change outside of the littoral habitats and east bays of lake taihu it is arguable that the pelagic areas have always lacked enough macrophytes as a result of strong winds zhang et al 2018b therefore alternative stable states are unlikely to occur there it is particularly noteworthy that the synergistic effects of eutrophication and climate change can reduce ecosystem resilience and cause unexpected collapse e g cyanobacterial habs even when individual stressors remain at levels that are considered to be safe ryo et al 2019 meerhoff et al 2022 since long term eutrophication altered the nutrient cycling and reorganized the configurations of primary producers and food webs in lake taihu and beyond as discussed above the ecosystems are likely more responsive to warming than before state shift fig 4b ecological resistance and vulnerability to climate change thus inherited the legacy of local human pressure similar to previous observations battarbee et al 2005 bruel et al 2021 as a consequence if local pressures e g nutrients must be reduced to build resilience and mitigate blooms reduction strategies may be overwhelmed by climate change impacts on the ecosystems unless more costly and aggressive approaches are employed furthermore the current and future managers should acknowledge that the ecosystem changed permanently to different configurations with shifting baselines beyond the pre disturbance reference fig 4b battarbee et al 2005 ryo et al 2019 it is important to realize the contemporary process e g re oligotrophication the hysteresis of ecological response scheffer et al 2001 and the integral eutrophication history when setting appropriate eco environmental baselines our study underlines the complexity and interactivity of multiple stressors on lake ecosystems and habs and the necessity of long term perspectives to contextualize modern ecological conditions and inform integrated management 4 3 integrated biomarker reconstruction merits and prospects in contrast to in situ monitoring and remote sensing observations of lake surface our novel analysis produces a longer term continuous record of lake primary productivity and habs which integrates phytoplankton from both surface and deeper waters mcgowan 2013 waters et al 2021 this supplement allows to assess the complete trajectory magnitude and decadal variability of ecosystem deterioration particularly covering a time span where abrupt ecological shifts and toxic habs occur the paleo reconstruction can further shed light on the dynamics of algal community composition toxin producing taxa and toxicity risk of cyanobacterial habs through time which may facilitate the development of effective control and restoration strategies however specific taxa and biodiversity changes of harmful algae particularly cyanobacteria are still difficult to be determined using biogeochemical tools the next generation high throughput sequencing of environmental dna is increasingly recognized as an effective complementary means domaizon et al 2017 monchamp et al 2018 zhang et al 2023 a combined application of molecular biomarkers and dna techniques to well dated sediment sequences is thus very promising in deepening our understanding of long term lake ecosystem dynamics biodiversity functioning and their linkages to environmental forcings meanwhile the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of limnological characteristics sedimentation and anthropogenic disturbances in most large lakes like taihu requires future research with multiple well placed cores lin et al 2020 2021 to improve the assessment of habs and eco environmental risk on the whole lake scale 5 conclusions we applied molecular biomarkers of aliphatic hydrocarbons photosynthetic pigments and cyanotoxins on lake sediment sequences to successfully reconstruct the long term trajectories and variability of cyanobacterial habs which provided empirical evidence on the abrupt regime shifts and causes underlying aquatic ecosystem degradation the biomarker reconstruction in china s lake taihu revealed that significant increases in cyanotoxins lagged behind the initial blooms by over a decade until the formation of toxic microcystis blooms in the 1990s this process was accompanied with the shift to and the occurrence of more toxic microcystins mc lr and mc yr leading to exacerbated harmful effects our ordination and numerical modeling results emphasize the synergy of climate warming and eutrophication through nutrient recycling and their feedback through buoyant cyanobacterial proliferation which sustain bloom forming potential and promote the occurrence of increasingly toxic cyanotoxins cyanobacterial dominance particularly in shallow lakes may become a self perpetuating phenomenon and toxic hab outbreaks are likely to occur continuously with climate change the increasing variance and rate of change metrics of phytoplankton particularly bloom forming taxa in lake taihu probably indicated increased ecosystem vulnerability and resilience loss with potential risk to shift to another undesirable state we deduce that an alternative stable state has not yet been established there current ecological resistance and vulnerability to climate warming inherited the legacy of local human pressure e g lake eutrophication and alterations of food web with shifting baseline beyond the pre disturbance reference to build resilience and reverse blooms therefore more aggressive and integrated strategies dealing with legacy nutrients and global warming are imperative

14922,harmful algal blooms habs producing toxic metabolites are increasingly threatening environmental and human health worldwide unfortunately long term process and mechanism triggering habs remain largely unclear due to the scarcity of temporal monitoring retrospective analysis of sedimentary biomarkers using up to date chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques provide a potential means

systematic monitoring programs are typically initiated once environmental problems have emerged and they rarely capture the full spectrum of aquatic ecosystem deterioration battarbee et al 2005 qin et

china suffering from increasingly frequent cyanobacterial habs high resolution time series of sedimentary biomarkers n alkanes chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments microcystins and geochemistry organic carbon nutrients metals were quantitatively integrated with monitoring data and historical archives using ordination analysis and generalized additive models we address two key questions i what are the dynamic trajectories of photoautotrophic succession macrophyte versus phytoplankton habs and cyanotoxin production and how were catastrophic shifts shaped by multiple stressors interacting through

is located in the rapidly developing and highly urbanized yangtze river delta fig s1 currently the catchment area is dominated by agricultural land 47 9 urban land 24 3 and water bodies 13 6 that supports 4 8 65 million of china s population and produces 11 6 of national gdp despite occupying only 0 4 36 500 km2 of china s land area there are approximately 219 rivers with inflows going to the northern and western lake sides and outflows occurring on the eastern sides due to nutrient supply and climate warming this shallow 3 m lake has experienced accelerated eutrophication accompanied by potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms microcystis spp guo et al 2019 coupled with southerly or southeasterly winds annual cyanobacterial habs occur earlier and persist longer in the northern and western lake shi et al 2019 threatening the water security of approximately 30 millions of inhabitants qin et al 2019 however continuous water quality monitoring and remote sensing observations are limited to recent 30 years in order to reconstruct longer term history of lake eutrophication and habs for assessing ecosystem state dynamics and optimizing management strategies two duplicate sediment cores 40 cm with intact sediment water interfaces were retrieved smol 2010 from one typical relatively sedimentation stable area of lake taihu central west n31 11623 e120 06152 in march 2017

predominant macrophytes 6 species and surface forest soil n 5 in and around the lake were also collected table s1 in the laboratory all the samples were freeze dried and core sediment subsamples were processed for radiochronology physicochemical parameters and biomarker analyses the sediment core collected in 2020 was specifically for the measurement of microcystins and other proxy analyses were conducted on the previous core these cores from the increasingly blooming area were taken as an analytical test for multi biomarker reconstruction in this study 2 2 radiochronology isotopes of 210pb 226ra and 137cs for sediment dating were measured using a gamma spectrometer ortec usa which provides an absolute detection efficiency 95 according to calibrated sources and standard samples the age model of the sediment core collected in 2017 was computed with serac r package bruel and sabatier 2020 we have previously reported detailed protocols of geochronology and reliable results that suggested mean sedimentation rates of 0 38 cm yr 1 for the lake area over the past hundred years lin et al 2020 the age for another core was thus determined through core matching based on lithology

comprehensively in lake taihu cores to characterize the integral historical processes of habs first aliphatic hydrocarbons particularly n alkanes were used to distinguish the relative contributions of organic matter from algae macrophytes and terrestrial plants reflecting major succession of photoautotrophic communities meyers 2003 second photosynthetic subfossil pigments are reliable indicators to track the past changes in lake primary productivity and algal community mcgowan 2013 particularly the abundance and composition of bloom forming algae bjorndahl et al 2022 on this basis concentrations of cyanotoxins were measured in the sediments to infer the magnitude of past habs and their toxin production through time waters et al 2021 aliphatic hydrocarbons sediment core subsamples samples of cultured cyanobacterium microcystis collected aquatic macrophytes and surface forest soil were all analyzed for n alkanes following standard procedures zhang et al 2019 in brief homogenized dry samples were ultrasonically extracted four times using the dichloromethane methanol 9 1 v v mixture total lipids were concentrated to dry with pure nitrogen and saponified with 6 koh in methanol at room temperature for 12 h the neutral lipids containing n alkanes were further extracted with n hexane through silica gel column chromatography finally n alkanes were measured using an agilent 7890 gas chromatograph gc equipped with an agilent 5975 mass spectrometer ms with an external c16 standard for identification and quantification a set of proxies acl tar paq and s m were calculated based on odd carbon n alkanes to identify the composition and sources of sedimentary organic matter ficken et al 2000 meyers 2003 which are explicitly described in the supporting information text s1 photosynthetic subfossil pigments sedimentary chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments were extracted and purified following the standard method with optimal mixtures of acetone methanol and deionized water at 20 for 12 h mcgowan 2013 after filtering nitrogen blowing and re dissolution individual chlorophyll and carotenoid compounds were isolated and quantified using an agilent 1200 series high

program sequential t test algorithm based on variance analysis with prewhitening p 0 05 cut off length 10 and calculation of cumulative sum of differences were also performed to identify significant change points and the main phases of past ecological dynamics andersen et al 2009 cao et al 2020 ordination analysis the gradient length of 1 total standard deviation unit for the paleorecords suggested that a linear model was suitable for unconstrained and constrained ordinations using canoco 5 program ter braak and šmilauer 2012 nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis based on bray curtis distances was performed to identify structural changes in paleorecords through time in a reduced two dimensional space for technical purposes the scores of both nmds axes nmds1 nmds2 were taken as the main representative variation indices of ecological dynamics ibrahim et al 2020 up to ten environmental variables referring to regional climate agriculture and urbanization fig s3 were included in the initial analysis to evaluate their significance and collinearity via a series of forward selection and restricted monte carlo permutation tests n 999 ter braak and šmilauer 2012 four runs of redundancy analysis rda were then conducted to explore potential relationships between paleorecords and individual categories of significant environmental variables of agriculture fertilizer

paleorecord time series explained by all categories of significant environmental variables and their interactions bunting et al 2016 generalized additive model analysis generalized additive models

pigments and other biomarkers can accurately record the variability of algal communities following fertilization through time cottingham et al 2000 meyers 2003 and thus reliably reflect changes in

estimated by the numerical simulation of both variance and rate of change roc following standard technical recommendations simpson 2018 bjorndahl et al 2022 the variances were extracted by calculating the standard deviations performed with the earlywarnings packages in r dakos et al 2015 the rocs were generated from the posterior simulations of the fitted gams using the first derivative of a spline all models fitting the selected time series contained a continuous time first order autoregressive car 1 process to account for temporal autocorrelation these analyses were performed using r software with the mgcv and vegan packages wood 2017 simpson 2018 3 results multiple analyses of sediment cores from lake taihu revealed distinct dynamics of lake primary producers following fertilization and climate change proxies for organic matter nutrients autotrophic production and cyanobacterial habs showed particularly prominent changes which exhibited three similar phases since the 1900s 3 1 sedimentary oc nutrients and n alkanes sediments were mainly composed of coarse silt 16 63 µm accounting for 50 prior to 1950 peaks of oc c n ratios 12 total phosphorus and nitrogen in the mid 1910s and 1930s coeval with higher sand content and lithogenic elements e g al ti fig 1 a and fig s2 probably showed enhanced inputs of terrigenous nutrients and organic matter meyers 2003 sedimentary n alkanes before the 1950s were dominated by middle chain n c21 n c23 n c25 and long chain n c27 n c29 n c31 n c33 components averaged 87 5 fig 1a and fig s4 similar to that of macrophytes and surface soil fig s5 these characteristics together with relatively high values of tar and paq 0 4 and low s m ratios suggested dominant contributions of organic matter from submerged floating macrophytes and allochthonous origin ficken et al 2000 meyers 2003 during the 1950s 1980s content of fine silt 4 16 µm and lithogenic elements increased slightly while oc and nutrients remained stable fig 1a and fig s2 the c n ratios decreased continuously to 10 and proportions of short chain n alkanes n c17 n c19 increased sharply since the mid 1970s reflecting substantially higher algal organic matter contribution as algal communities particularly cyanobacteria have been identified as main contributors of short chain n alkanes in our survey fig s5 and previous analyses zhang et al 2017 middle chain n alkanes and paq decreased and remained at low levels while s m ratios fluctuated and increased to a high level suggesting a potential transition toward an algae dominated lake state meanwhile long chain n alkanes acl and tar as indicators of allochthonous organic matter input meyers 2003 showed coeval decreases and relatively low values from 1970 since the 1990s sediments were dominated by fine particles 16 µm enriched with magnetic mineral and lithogenic elements fig s2 relating to well weathered terrigenous detritus lin et al 2020 sedimentary phosphorus nitrogen and oc showed 1 5 fold increases while c n ratios fluctuated around 10 short chain n alkanes from algae maintained a relatively high abundance followed by a decrease whereas middle chain n alkanes and paq values remained relatively low and stable fig 1a these results along with relatively high s m ratios suggested an algae dominated organic matter source and a lake ecological regime that has greatly deviated from the historical conditions prior to 1950 3 2 subfossil pigments and cyanotoxins analyses of subfossil chlorophylls carotenoids and cyanotoxins revealed main shifts of algal communities are consistent with pronounced lake eutrophication figs 1b and 2 an increase in the ratios of labile to chemically stable chlorophylls chl a pheophytin a in the upper core fig s6 reflected slightly improved pigment preservation when algal production increases as expected leavitt 1993 waters et al 2021 additionally ratios of total carotenoids to total identified pigments did not change with depth indicating a relatively constant preservation environment since the 1900s this phenomenon coincided with generally stable redox conditions since the 1950s as inferred from fe mn ratios fig 2 thus the molecular biomarkers were well preserved in recent sediments of lake taihu beyond similar human impacted waters elsewhere bunting et al 2016 zastepa et al 2017 waters et al 2021 huang et al 2022 zeng et al 2023 cluster analysis of pigment assemblages identified the most significant turning points around the 1950s and 1980s and that algal communities showed two main patterns of change fig 1b first concentrations of pigments from siliceous algae diatoxanthin and cryptophytes alloxanthin that commonly grow in the spring deng et al 2014 were too low to be detected before 1995 then generally increased in recent sediments second subfossil biomarkers from summer bloom forming colonial cyanobacteria and chlorophytes canthaxanthin lutein zeaxanthin pheophytin b and b guo et al 2019 together with chemically stable indicators of total algal abundance β carotene total carotenoids were relatively constant during most of the 20th century increased 300 700 to high levels during the 1980s 1990s then showed few fluctuations or lower trends in the recent decade the echinenone cyanobacterial pigment that is often found to be extremely enriched in microcystis hesse et al 2001 was coeluted with labile chl a all phototrophs in hplc which collectively showed a 9 fold increase similar to β carotene correspondingly a sharp decrease of the uvr index occurred during the 1980s 2000s indicating a marked decline in uv exposure and water clarity leavitt et al 1997 taken together these results demonstrate that algal production increased 3 to 7 fold since the 1980s when an ecosystem state shift was initiated recent modification of algal communities inferred from pigments is basically consistent with modern monitoring and molecular genetic results that showed a 50 phytoplankton biomass contribution from microcystis dominated cyanobacteria zhang et al 2018a guo et al 2019 2023 cyanotoxins three microcystin congeners were detected throughout the century long sediment record and their production showed historical variations corresponding to bloom forming cyanobacterial proliferation fig 2 in general concentrations of total mcs fluctuated without clear directional trends before 1950 peaked between the 1960s 514 ng g 1 oc and the 1980s 1752 ng g 1 oc then increased exponentially since the 1990s to the highest value 40 000 ng g 1 oc in the surface sediments elevated production of total mcs was mainly sourced from increased contributions of highly toxic mc yr averaged 45 and mc lr averaged 36 whereas contribution of hypotoxic mc rr averaged 19 generally decreased since the 1950s moreover rapid growth of cyanotoxin production was in pace with enriched nitrogen phosphorus elevated n p ratios and decreased c n ratios indicating a combined effect of nutrient inputs and stoichiometry changes xue et al 2023 3 3 driver response relationships nmds analysis tracked three distinguishable groups from biomarker and geochemistry assemblages since the 1900s fig s7 as also observed from the stratigraphic temporal cluster fig 1 the main gradient of paleorecord changes was associated with increased levels of autotrophic production bloom forming cyanobacterial proliferation cyanotoxin occurrence and loss of macrophytes and water clarity as nutrient enrichment led to changes in trophic state this ecological gradient was highly correlated with nmds1 and explained 81 3 of variation compared to 18 7 from nmds2 further statistical analyses using sequential t test and cumulative sum of differences for nmds1 scores confirmed shifting points of the lake ecosystem around the 1950s and 1980s fig s8 rda with the agriculture predictor fertilizer alone explained 32 1 of variation in geochemistry and biomarkers during the past hundred years similar to the variation explained by the sewage predictor population 30 9 alone fig 3 a and fig s9 in contrast rda using climate variables either elevated air temperature 23 6 or declined wind speed 30 6 alone explained fewer changes in the paleorecords vpa showed that environmental variation associated with agriculture sewage and climate totally explained 61 4 of past dynamics in lake ecosystem fig s9 comparison of individual and interactive categories suggested that most of the explained variance arose from total interactions between agriculture sewage and climate change 20 1 followed by that from sewage 17 5 and that from agriculture 10 4 alone fig 3a the remaining unexplained variance 38 6 may be related to other environmental factors particularly precipitation hydrological fluctuations and extreme weather events which are important but usually hard to statistically quantify in long term driver response analysis mcgowan et al 2012 bunting et al 2016 gams estimated when and to what extent human activities and climate change contributed to the past ecological dynamics of lake taihu as indicated by the nmds1 and nmds2 scores of the paleorecords fig 3 documentary data inferred human and climate indices text s2 fig s7 were considered as representative predictor variables according to our rda results and previous investigations at lake taihu zhang et al 2018b lin et al 2021 human and climate indices together explained 94 4 of variation in nmds1 and 91 3 in nmds2 respectively table s2 the smooth functions fig 3b illustrated a nonlinear response of nmds1 to human index and a significantly linear response to climate nmds2 also responded significantly to human and climate indices with nonlinear trends from a temporal perspective the simultaneous effects of changing human activity and climate were detected for both nmds axis scores since the 1980s when simultaneous positive effects on the nmds1 prevailed fig 3c as lake trophic status deteriorated the contribution of climate increased and even surpassed that of anthropogenic nutrient influx in recent decades 3 4 historical changes in ecological variability the fitted gams were significant p 0 001 for dominant biomarker time series of primary producers community turnover and cyanotoxins table s3 allowing estimation of historical patterns of lake ecosystem variability temporal trends in variance and roc were similar for specific variables fig 4 a variance of time series in total and bloom forming algae particularly cyanobacteria started to increase from the early 1990s and the corresponding rocs increased significantly since the mid 1980s in contrast cyanotoxins showed sharp increases in variance and roc after 2010 lagging behind the initial microcystis blooms changes in variance and roc of the scores of nmds1 axis were particularly coherent in recent three decades manifesting as a significant increase followed by a decline notably temporal variability of these key ecosystem components increased to varying degrees following the apparent ecosystem state change 4 discussion this work shows that integrated application of multi biomarkers and geochemistry proxies on lake sediment sequences provides a powerful means to retrospectively assess long term dynamics in habs cyanotoxin production and ecosystem variability in response to multiple stressors and their interactions our results revealed critical processes of eutrophication and primary production culminating in an abrupt ecological shift characterized by increasingly toxic cyanobacterial blooms microcystis from the 1980s in lake taihu thereafter increasing ecological variability suggested that lake taihu was probably subjected to elevated variation in the forcing mechanism dakos et al 2015 and or exhibited a paradox of enrichment cottingham et al 2000 bunting et al 2016 with nutrient cyclic loops scheffer et al 2001 xu et al 2021 which failed to establish an alternative stable state carpenter et al 2011 our findings have demonstrated increased ecological vulnerability and reduced predictability of cyanobacterial habs following state change and climate warming which has profound environmental implications 4 1 multiple stressors underlying habs and cyanotoxin production freshwater ecosystems are widely experiencing the allied attack of climate change and eutrophication moss et al 2011 particularly for degrading shallow lakes zhou et al 2022 given their potential driving synergy paerl and scott 2010 meerhoff et al 2022 as shown in previous investigations kosten et al 2012 experiments richardson et al 2019 modeling taranu et al 2017 kakouei et al 2021 and syntheses havens and paerl 2015 taranu et al 2015 jeppesen et al 2020 eutrophic conditions and warmer climate contribute to higher phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacterial dominance thus increase the risk of toxic habs and water quality degradation huisman et al 2018 this phenomenon is extremely true for large shallow lake taihu similar to lakes okeechobee usa winnipeg canada võrtsjärv estonia kasumigaura japan chaohu china and shallow parts of other large lakes worldwide qin et al 2019 zhou et al 2022 accelerated climate warming and nutrients influx n p from the watershed due to rapid agricultural expansion and urbanization fig s3 are widely recognized as the driving factors xu et al 2021 zeng et al 2023 our paleolimnological reconstruction and ordination results figs 2 and 3a offered empirical complement of lake eutrophication from long term perspective associating largely with agricultural practices and urban sewage moreover interactions between climate change warming wind stilling and anthropogenic nutrients in vpa explained a large part of the historical dynamics in the taihu ecosystem fig 3a this is consistent with theoretical and empirical expectations that environmental effects work on lakes via coupled influxes of energy temperature irradiance wind and mass precipitation nutrients particles leavitt et al 2009 according to the gam results fig 3c the majority of the forcing interactions through time were cumulative with simultaneous positive effects since intensified fertilization and cyanobacterial blooms in the 1980s thus our empirical results highlight the synergistic effects of eutrophication and climate change on cyanobacterial temporal dynamics as previously and newly loaded nutrients are effectively retained and recycled in lake taihu zhu et al 2020 xu et al 2021 warming effects have produced a suite of favorable environmental conditions to sustain the hab potential first phytoplankton universally optimize growth as temperatures increase to a certain extent notably for cyanobacteria and other bloom forming algae that prefer warming conditions carey et al 2012 havens and paerl 2015 second enhanced water column stability and thermal stratification following joint regional warming and atmospheric stilling fig s3 modify phytoplankton communities by favoring surface bloom forming cyanobacteria through buoyancy regulation kosten et al 2012 the consequent accumulation of detrital organic matter from algae in summer and autumn usually enhances deoxygenation of subsurface water layers stimulates the release of internal phosphorus yin et al 2022 and inhibits nitrification denitrification coupling in lake taihu zhu et al 2020 this is also indicated by the shifts in the sediment nutrient stoichiometry such as elevated n p ratios and fluctuated c n ratios following blooms fig 2 bloom induced underwater light attenuation fig 1b further reinforce buoyant cyanobacteria dominance carey et al 2012 guo et al 2019 third rising temperature can not only increase the mineralization rate of watershed soils but also be accompanied by more extreme rainstorms both of which could enhance diffuse and legacy nutrient delivery to waters tropical cyclones and extreme weather have been reported to play an important role in stimulating cyanobacterial bloom formation in lake taihu zhu et al 2014 yang et al 2016 furthermore human and climate driven hydrological alterations e g 20 rise of taihu lake level since 1992 zhang et al 2018b combined with projected warming and drought woolway et al 2020 are expected to extend vertical stratification and water residence time which will likely promote habs and complicate eutrophication management havens and paerl 2015 yang et al 2017 meerhoff et al 2022 in turn the interactive effects also strongly stimulate the production of hazardous cyanotoxins particularly microcystins as found in microcosm experiments lürling et al 2018 our biomarker reconstruction revealed that significant increases in mcs lagged behind the initial blooms by over a decade in lake taihu fig 2 until the shift to and formation of toxic microcystis blooms hu et al 2016 guo et al 2019 as climate change and eutrophication intensified in the 1990s in particular this process promoted the strains producing more toxic mc lr and mc yr and exacerbated the ecological risk as similarly observed in other degraded freshwaters zastepa et al 2017 henao et al 2019 increasing temperature and nutrient concentrations are corroborated as major predictors of large increases in regional mc maxima e g north america taranu et al 2017 hayes et al 2020 and even global patterns of mc congeners taranu et al 2019 despite faster photodegradation in some environments e g the tropics surface freshwaters like lake taihu in the warming future might experience a predicted higher occurrence of highly toxic mcs with increasing risks to environmental and human health multiple stressors can further provoke large changes in food webs with potential cascading effects in particular weakening top down control in regulating phytoplankton biomass and habs meerhoff et al 2022 in lake taihu long term loss of macrophytes fig 1a probably have caused less refuge available for phytoplankton competitors such as grazer macroinvertebrates and zooplankton moss et al 2011 janssen et al 2014 over fishing and extensive stocking have altered lake fish community diversity and structure by favoring large amounts of small zooplanktivorous species notably anchovy mao et al 2020 these shifts in aquatic communities substantially reduced algal grazing by zooplankton in the lake furthermore fewer piscivorous fish more omnivorous and herbivorous species and decreased body size of zooplankton are expected in warmer waters jeppesen et al 2020 such changes are likely to reinforce the positive interaction between climate change and eutrophication given the projected algal proliferation toxin producing cyanobacterial dominance and less intensive top down effects 4 2 ecosystem state shift and baseline implications studies on shallow lakes suggest that increased variations in phytoplankton parameters and regulatory mechanisms are reliable indicators of ecosystem state change from clear water to turbid water dominated by prolific nuisance cyanobacteria scheffer et al 2001 janssen et al 2014 yang et al 2017 this catastrophic shift may arise from abrupt but persistent changes in external forcings e g climate change nutrient enrichment and or gradual variation in intrinsic factors e g trophic cascades bunting et al 2016 carpenter et al 2022 ecological theory predicts that during the transitions among alternate stable states lake ecosystems may exhibit transient rising then decreasing variability in focal parameters carpenter et al 2011 dakos et al 2015 following the re establishment of internal feedback mechanisms e g internal nutrient cycling loss of macrophytes shading scheffer and van nes 2007 janssen et al 2014 however both temporal variance and roc analyses in lake taihu explicitly demonstrated increasing phytoplankton variability after the ecological shift fig 4a and fig s8 suggesting that a stable state has not yet been established in particular the persistent rise in variability of total algae bloom forming taxa and cyanotoxins is more consistent with the paradox of enrichment wherein ecological resilience and predictability declined cottingham et al 2000 bunting et al 2016 carpenter et al 2022 the rising variability of primary producers probably reflects persistent increases in external forcings dakos et al 2015 huang et al 2022 or the constraints of similar large lakes to establish alternative stable states scheffer and van nes 2007 janssen et al 2014 bruel et al 2021 although a series of measures costing us 30 billion have been implemented to address wastewater discharge and improve water quality in lake taihu watershed qin et al 2019 recent warming climate and extreme weather continue to exacerbate non point nutrient loading xu et al 2021 and internal release from sediments yin et al 2022 meanwhile growing evidence indicates that cyanobacterial dominance is exerting a positive feedback with climate warming huisman et al 2018 meerhoff et al 2022 as blooms usually promote the release of nutrients xu et al 2021 yin et al 2022 and greenhouse gasses yan et al 2017 that increase the warming potential under these circumstances cyanobacterial dominance may thus be a self perpetuating phenomenon havens and paerl 2015 meerhoff et al 2022 and toxic habs are predicted to increase in lake taihu with climate change outside of the littoral habitats and east bays of lake taihu it is arguable that the pelagic areas have always lacked enough macrophytes as a result of strong winds zhang et al 2018b therefore alternative stable states are unlikely to occur there it is particularly noteworthy that the synergistic effects of eutrophication and climate change can reduce ecosystem resilience and cause unexpected collapse e g cyanobacterial habs even when individual stressors remain at levels that are considered to be safe ryo et al 2019 meerhoff et al 2022 since long term eutrophication altered the nutrient cycling and reorganized the configurations of primary producers and food webs in lake taihu and beyond as discussed above the ecosystems are likely more responsive to warming than before state shift fig 4b ecological resistance and vulnerability to climate change thus inherited the legacy of local human pressure similar to previous observations battarbee et al 2005 bruel et al 2021 as a consequence if local pressures e g nutrients must be reduced to build resilience and mitigate blooms reduction strategies may be overwhelmed by climate change impacts on the ecosystems unless more costly and aggressive approaches are employed furthermore the current and future managers should acknowledge that the ecosystem changed permanently to different configurations with shifting baselines beyond the pre disturbance reference fig 4b battarbee et al 2005 ryo et al 2019 it is important to realize the contemporary process e g re oligotrophication the hysteresis of ecological response scheffer et al 2001 and the integral eutrophication history when setting appropriate eco environmental baselines our study underlines the complexity and interactivity of multiple stressors on lake ecosystems and habs and the necessity of long term perspectives to contextualize modern ecological conditions and inform integrated management 4 3 integrated biomarker reconstruction merits and prospects in contrast to in situ monitoring and remote sensing observations of lake surface our novel analysis produces a longer term continuous record of lake primary productivity and habs which integrates phytoplankton from both surface and deeper waters mcgowan 2013 waters et al 2021 this supplement allows to assess the complete trajectory magnitude and decadal variability of ecosystem deterioration particularly covering a time span where abrupt ecological shifts and toxic habs occur the paleo reconstruction can further shed light on the dynamics of algal community composition toxin producing taxa and toxicity risk of cyanobacterial habs through time which may facilitate the development of effective control and restoration strategies however specific taxa and biodiversity changes of harmful algae particularly cyanobacteria are still difficult to be determined using biogeochemical tools the next generation high throughput sequencing of environmental dna is increasingly recognized as an effective complementary means domaizon et al 2017 monchamp et al 2018 zhang et al 2023 a combined application of molecular biomarkers and dna techniques to well dated sediment sequences is thus very promising in deepening our understanding of long term lake ecosystem dynamics biodiversity functioning and their linkages to environmental forcings meanwhile the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of limnological characteristics sedimentation and anthropogenic disturbances in most large lakes like taihu requires future research with multiple well placed cores lin et al 2020 2021 to improve the assessment of habs and eco environmental risk on the whole lake scale 5 conclusions we applied molecular biomarkers of aliphatic hydrocarbons photosynthetic pigments and cyanotoxins on lake sediment sequences to successfully reconstruct the long term trajectories and variability of cyanobacterial habs which provided empirical evidence on the abrupt regime shifts and causes underlying aquatic ecosystem degradation the biomarker reconstruction in china s lake taihu revealed that significant increases in cyanotoxins lagged behind the initial blooms by over a decade until the formation of toxic microcystis blooms in the 1990s this process was accompanied with the shift to and the occurrence of more toxic microcystins mc lr and mc yr leading to exacerbated harmful effects our ordination and numerical modeling results emphasize the synergy of climate warming and eutrophication through nutrient recycling and their feedback through buoyant cyanobacterial proliferation which sustain bloom forming potential and promote the occurrence of increasingly toxic cyanotoxins cyanobacterial dominance particularly in shallow lakes may become a self perpetuating phenomenon and toxic hab outbreaks are likely to occur continuously with climate change the increasing variance and rate of change metrics of phytoplankton particularly bloom forming taxa in lake taihu probably indicated increased ecosystem vulnerability and resilience loss with potential risk to shift to another undesirable state we deduce that an alternative stable state has not yet been established there current ecological resistance and vulnerability to climate warming inherited the legacy of local human pressure e g lake eutrophication and alterations of food web with shifting baseline beyond the pre disturbance reference to build resilience and reverse blooms therefore more aggressive and integrated strategies dealing with legacy nutrients and global warming are imperative

14923,identifying a chemical s potential for biotransformation in the aquatic environment is crucial to predict its fate and manage its potential hazards due to the complexity of natural water bodies especially river networks biotransformation is often studied in laboratory experiments assuming that study outcomes can be extrapolated to compound behavior in the field here we investigated to what extent outcomes of laboratory simulation studies indeed reflect biotransformation kinetics observed in riverine systems to determine in field biotransformation we measured loads of 27 wastewater treatment plant effluent borne compounds along the rhine and its major tributaries during two seasons up to 21 compounds were detected at each sampling location measured compound loads were used in an inverse model framework of the rhine river basin to derive k bio field values a compound specific parameter describing the compounds average biotransformation potential during the field studies to support model calibration we performed phototransformation and sorption experiments with all the study compounds identifying 5 compounds that are susceptible towards direct phototransformation and determining k oc values covering four orders of magnitude on the laboratory side we used a similar inverse model framework to derive k bio lab values from water sediment experiments run according to a modified oecd 308 type protocol the comparison of k bio lab and k bio field revealed that their absolute values differed pointing towards faster transformation in the rhine river basin yet we could demonstrate that relative rankings of biotransformation potential and groups of compounds with low moderate and high persistence agree reasonably well between laboratory and field outcomes overall our results provide evidence that laboratory based biotransformation studies using the modified oecd 308 protocol and k bio values derived thereof bear considerable potential to reflect biotransformation of micropollutants in one of the largest european river basins graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biotransformation kinetics laboratory field comparison micropollutants bayesian model frameworks data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps often discharge their effluents into rivers and streams resulting in exposure of riverine ecosystems to chemicals hamdhani et al 2020 actual exposure levels and the individual chemical s potential to cause damage to these ecosystems depends on their mass load in the wwtp effluents and the extent to which they can be removed from the aquatic environment via biotic and abiotic transformation berkner and thierbach 2014 fenner et al 2013 schwarzenbach et al 2006 therefore a chemical s persistence i e recalcitrance towards transformation in aquatic environments is considered a key hazard property in chemical regulations worldwide cousins et al 2019 yet directly quantifying transformation of chemicals in rivers is challenging for several reasons first especially in industrialized and densely populated regions distances and hence hydraulic residence times between wwtps along rivers are typically short unless a compound is transformed at a very high rate and its transformation can therefore be observed along the short distance between two wwtps new emissions from wwtps will overlay upstream compound loads and mask the transformation signal second chemical concentrations are modulated by dilution in river networks which needs to be explicitly accounted for to quantify compound loads and hence removal lastly while a chemical s structure determines to some extent its potential to be transformed the actual extent of transformation in a riverine environment is additionally influenced by the chemical s bioavailability the environmental conditions such as ph and temperature and in the case of biotransformation the abundance of enzymes and or competent microbial degraders that can transform a given chemical structure both environmental conditions as well as microbial community composition and activity are known to vary spatially and temporally chalifour et al 2021 fenner et al 2013 gao et al 2019 helbling et al 2012 winter et al 2007 indeed previous field studies showed large variabilities in compound attenuation from different sections of various european rivers rendering it almost impossible to derive conclusive evidence regarding a chemical s environmental persistence from the observation of riverine concentrations alone jaeger et al 2019 li et al 2016 for all of these reasons persistence of chemicals is most often studied in laboratory experiments under controlled conditions since aerobic biotransformation is considered the dominant removal pathway for most commonly detected chemical pollutants it is common practice to use laboratory biotransformation studies following internationally accepted oecd guidelines to assess aquatic persistence this practice is based on the assumption that laboratory observations are representative of compound behavior in the field yet the robustness of this assumption has barely been addressed in previous research adriaanse et al 1997 montforts 2006 in fact the few attempts to relate outcomes of e g oecd 308 water sediment studies to compound behavior in riverine environments remained inconclusive honti et al 2018a radke and maier 2014b southwell et al 2020 recently shrestha et al 2016 2021 introduced broadly tested and characterized a novel laboratory system in which a thin predominantly aerobic sediment layer is covered by an aerated water column favoring aerobic biotransformation as dominant compound removal pathway referred to as modified oecd 308 type study in seller et al 2021 it has been argued that such a laboratory system may be well suited to elucidate a chemical s potential for biotransformation in riverine environments i e in fully mixed water bodies with the first few centimeters of sediment being aerobic seller et al 2021 however this hypothesis has not yet been tested and warrants further exploration therefore the primary aim of this study was to investigate to what extent outcomes of modified oecd 308 type studies can be compared to biotransformation kinetics of chemicals observed in riverine systems across a large number of relevant aquatic pollutants to fulfill this aim a sound basis for comparison of laboratory and field biotransformation had to be sought transformation half lives dt50 while being essential pieces of information in a regulatory context typically lump together transformation and phase transfer processes particularly in water sediment systems and are system specific in many aspects i e dependent on e g water sediment ratios suspended solids concentration or sediment total organic carbon toc making them unfit for comparison of biotransformation between laboratory test systems and river environments honti et al 2016 to eliminate some of the most influential system specific differences affecting aquatic biotransformation honti et al 2016 2018a introduced k bio a biomass corrected second order rate constant k bio is estimated from measured chemical concentration patterns and information on the physicochemical properties of and biomass in the studied system through inverse modeling it hinges on the assumption that total biomass or in case such information is missing toc can serve as proxies for the abundance of degrading enzymes and or competent microbial degraders since k bio is also corrected for differences in the chemical s bioavailability in water sediment systems exhibiting different sediment to water ratios it should in principle allow comparing a chemical s biotransformation potential across laboratory and field systems yet previous attempts to derive k bio from field observations in the rhine river catchment were subject to large uncertainties mostly due to a substantial lack of accurately known compound emissions into the rhine but also due to a lack of precise knowledge on other relevant fate properties that are required for the inverse estimation of k bio those include the compounds susceptibility towards abiotic transformation i e hydrolysis and phototransformation and their organic carbon water partition coefficient k oc influencing the compounds estimated bioavailability honti et al 2018a therefore in order to apply the k bio concept for comparing chemicals biotransformation kinetics between laboratory studies and riverine environments a secondary aim of this work was to improve the estimation of k bio from monitored river concentration in the catchment of the river rhine one of the largest and most important catchments of europe to this end we i conducted sorption and phototransformation laboratory experiments to provide sufficiently accurate data describing the compounds abiotic fate properties ii determined weekly compound loads in the main channel of the rhine and its major tributaries in switzerland germany and the netherlands during catchment wide field campaigns in spring and summer 2017 and iii estimated compound emission into the rhine based on an effluent monitoring based approach presented by varga et al 2023 finally we inferred k bio values from the rhine field study k bio field and from modified oecd 308 type studies k bio lab using inverse model frameworks and systematically compared model outcomes to evaluate to what extent biotransformation data from laboratory experiments reflect micropollutant degradation in a large river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 test compounds based on the compound selection of seller et al 2021 k bio lab values describing biotransformation in modified oecd 308 type studies were derived for 42 compounds including 23 pharmaceuticals 15 pesticides 3 artificial sweeteners and 1 industrial chemical k bio field values describing biotransformation in the rhine river catchment were inferred for a subset of 27 compounds that were expected to be released into the aquatic environment via wwtp effluents i e pharmaceuticals artificial sweeteners and industrial chemicals here referred to as field compounds it has to be noted that the here employed analytical methods did not allow to differentiate between 4 and 5 methylbenzotriazole and therefore compound loads measured in the rhine river catchment are most likely a combination of both ruff et al 2015 a list of all compounds including name abbreviations is provided in table si1 2 2 experimental and field data of test compounds 2 2 1 compound loads in the rhine catchment to determine the field compounds abundance and transformation behavior within the rhine river catchment this study benefited from the activities of the international commission for the protection of the rhine iksr in the frame of the sampling campaign sondermessprogramm chemie smpc iksr 2019 during the smpc four water parcels were tracked along the rhine during each season of 2017 the water parcels were sampled by means of weekly composite samples at eleven locations within the main channel of the rhine and at six locations along its major tributaries close to their confluence points with the rhine table si2 and fig si1 we received samples from two of the four smpc campaigns i e from the p1 campaign with samples taken between march 19th april 6th 2017 and from the p3 campaign with samples taken between july 10th 27th 2017 we measured concentrations of field compounds using an agilent 6495c triple quad mass spectrometer coupled to an agilent hplc 1290 binary pump system si1 3 compound loads were calculated by multiplying the concentrations measured in the iksr samples with the discharge measured at each sampling time and location table si10 table si13 2 2 2 data from biotransformation simulation studies data provided by seller et al 2021 describe compound behavior in modified oecd 308 type studies i e in systems in which a sediment layer was covered by an aerated water column to a sediment water ratio of 1 10 v v further information provided in si1 4 inocula for modified oecd 308 type studies were sampled from two locations i e a wwtp effluent impacted river and a pristine pond we used compound concentrations measured during 54 days of biotransformation experiments in both sediment and water phase to derive k bio lab values as described in 2 3 2 2 3 biotransformation kinetics modelling frameworks 2 3 1 determination of k bio field values to derive k bio field values we used the catchment scale water quality model of honti et al 2018a and extended the model framework with abiotic hydrolysis and direct phototransformation as potential removal pathways for dissolved parent compounds please note that we experimentally studied our field compounds susceptibility towards indirect phototransformation and based on the results decided to neglect indirect phototransformation as a potential compound removal pathway for the selected field compounds from the rhine river catchment see 3 1 1 the most important underlying assumptions of the rhine catchment model are i that only dissolved compound mass fractions are available for abiotic and biotic transformation following a first order decay and ii that converting k bio field into compound specific degradation rate constants requires considering degrader biomass total organic carbon toc estimates were used as a proxy for degrader biomass as previous studies were able to link organic carbon content of river bed sediments to microbial activity fischer et al 2002 the rhine catchment model is based on individual river reaches described by the catchment characterization model europe ccm2 de jager and vogt 2007 in each reach partitioning and transformation at equilibrium are described as functions of the physical properties of the reach and the sorption transformation properties of the field compounds a compound s behavior in the entire catchment of the river rhine was then simulated by connecting the 18 000 stream reaches following the topology of the stream network in each reach the output compound flux was calculated as 1 f o u t f i n exp δ τ w k w where fin and fout kg d 1 are the incoming and outflowing fluxes of the parent compound for a single reach respectively and τw d is the compounds mean water residence time in a reach k w d 1 is the compound s transformation rate constant in water considering rate constants

2005 the mean physical properties for each reach in the rhine river catchment were estimated based on drainage area and channel slope provided by the ccm2 database mean sscs were derived from estimated channel geometry flow velocity and sediment grain size distribution in reality ssc is governed by discharge season the state of the upstream catchment and the stage of flood pulses which together make it highly dynamic here we had to neglect those variabilities as we had no information to model dynamic ssc in the entire stream network the model was fitted to field compound loads measured along the rhine during the two smpc campaigns p1 and p3 resulting in k bio field p1 and k bio field p3 values respectively model calibration took place in a bayesian framework parameter priors for calibration of k oc and transformation rate constants were set to capture experimentally determined values as described thereinafter see 2 4 parameter posteriors were sampled by markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling based on the classical metropolis algorithm two parallel chains were launched with 4000 steps each out of which the first 3000 served for burn in 2 3 2 determination of k bio lab values we adapted the model framework of honti and fenner 2015 to describe transformation and sorption processes in modified oecd 308 type studies i e a two compartment system seller et al 2021 we defined the settled sediment layer including pore water as the first compartment and the supernatant water column which we assumed to not contain any suspended sediment as the second compartment test compounds were assumed to be either in dissolved phase in the water compartment i e neglecting association with dissolved organic carbon or in sorbed or dissolved state in the sediment compartment the model is structurally compatible with the rhine catchment model as we apply the same underlying assumptions i e that only dissolved compound mass fractions are available for abiotic and biotic transformation following a first order decay and that k bio lab requires normalization to degrader biomass in line with procedures to derive k bio field values we use toc measured in the sediment and water compartment of the experimental vessels as a proxy for degrader biomass however as the k bio concept thrives from an accurate description of degrader biomass we furthermore explored the possibility to use bacterial cell densities measured during modified oecd 308 type studies seller et al 2021 as proxy for degrader biomass to derive a second set of k bio lab values generally we assume that the fraction of active degraders relative to total bacterial biomass is the same in both laboratory inocula dispersion and diffusion processes connecting sediment and water compartments were described following fick s law sorption equilibrium in the sediment was assumed to be reached instantaneously and the sediment compartment itself was treated as a fully mixed reactor i e transformation processes were assumed to take place synchronously and at the same rate throughout the entire shallow sediment layer following those model assumptions compound dissipation over time from the water and sediment compartment respectively can be described as 5 d p w d t k h y d r o k b i o l a b d b w p w d p p w z w p w s e d z s e d z s e d 2 6 d p s e d d t k h y d r o k b i o l a

parameters zw and zsed cm describe the height of the water and sediment compartment respectively dp cm2 d 1 is a diffusion dispersion coefficient contrary to the rhine catchment model phototransformation was neglected as potential compound removal pathway as modified oecd 308 type studies were conducted in the dark the model was fitted to concentration time series obtained from modified oecd 308 type systems with river and pond inocula seller et al 2021 we used a bayesian parameter estimation framework to calibrate the model for individual river and pond studies separately i e deriving k bio lab r and k bio lab p respectively and jointly across both studies i e deriving k bio lab joint the joint fit was performed to verify whether the model can fit experimental data from two biotransformation simulation studies with one set of substance specific parameters i e k bio lab joint k hydro and k oc parameter priors for calibration were set to capture experimentally determined values as described thereinafter see 2 4 posterior parameter distributions were sampled by mcmc sampling with 25 000 iterations from which the first 10 000 were dedicated to burn in 2 4 prior parameter estimates for model calibration using bayesian inference for model calibration allows to incorporate prior knowledge on parameter distributions into the calibration process to calibrate the k bio model frameworks several parameters used to describe transformation kinetics of compounds in modified oecd 308 type studies i e eqs 5 and 6 or in the rhine river catchment i e eq 1 are assumed to be compound specific and hence less dependent on the system considered besides k bio those compound specific parameters are k hydro k photo and k oc see 2 4 1 and 2 4 2 for derivation of k photo and k oc prior distributions respectively another set of prior estimates describe parameters specific to the considered system e g ssc toc or sediment porosity honti et al 2018b to estimate compound emission into the rhine we used quarterly compound consumption data available for switzerland and germany and a dimensionless escape factor k esc describing the proportion of marketed compound reaching the rhine stream network table si7 varga et al 2023 a compilation of all prior estimates is provided in si2 2 4 1 phototransformation experiments and prior estimation of k photo calibration of the rhine catchment model requires a prior estimate for k photo therefore we conducted phototransformation experiments with the goal to semi quantitatively assess whether direct or indirect phototransformation may be relevant pathways for removal of selected field compounds from the rhine river catchment phototransformation kinetics were determined i in buffered nanopure water 5 mm phosphate buffer ph 8 ii in buffered nanopure water amended with pony lake fulvic acid plfa to a dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of 10 mg l 1 to assess the field compounds potential for indirect phototransformation at elevated doc loads and iii in river and pond water previously used for modified oecd 308 type studies sterilized by filtration through glass fiber filters with a pore size of 0 2 µm i e doc concentrations of 2 2 and 1 2 mg l 1 respectively field compounds were spiked into different test waters in mixture to individual concentrations of 1 µg l 1 40 µm furfuryl alcohol ffa were added to determine the concentration of the reactive oxygen species 1o2 to monitor light flux during the experiments a para nitroanisole pyridine pna pyr actinometer was used with initial pna and pyr concentrations of 10 μm and 0 5 mm respectively laszakovits et al 2017 phototransformation experiments were carried out in quartz tubes 25 ml inner diameter 1 5 cm which were positioned in a water bath 25 c at an 30 angle 40 cm below the light source of a solar simulator heraeus model suntest cps equipped with a xenon arc lamp subsamples of 500 µl were taken from each quartz tube before irradiation and at five time points within 4 h of experiment subsamples were spiked with a mixture of internal standards istds to a concentration of 500 ng l 1 prior to analysis dark control samples were used to account for hydrolysis or other non photochemical losses of the test compounds dark controls were kept in 2 ml amber glass vials covered with aluminum foil and were immersed in the water bath shielded from the light source to be otherwise exposed to the same experimental conditions as the irradiated samples during our phototransformation experiments the light emitted by the solar simulator was approximately half of the strength of peak summer sunlight in central europe i e zürich switzerland 408 m above sea level further the solar simulator suitably mimicked the spectral output of natural sunlight as indicated by the good overlap of the irradiance spectra of the solar simulator and natural sunlight spectra from europe fig si3 to derive prior estimates for k photo in the rhine river catchment we followed methods outlined in tixier et al 2003 briefly we used the gcsolar software to calculate a pseudo first order rate constant based on diclofenac s absorbance spectrum figure si4 and its quantum yield previously determined by davis et al 2017 i e 0 071 we calculated diclofenac s k photo during spring and summer in the top first centimetre of a water body at conditions in mainz germany i e roughly the center of the rhine river basin latitude 49 99 n elevation 89 m above sea level for other compounds showing susceptibility towards phototransformation we then multiplied the prior phototransformation rate constant for diclofenac with a factor describing the respective compound s rate constant relative to diclofenac s rate constant measured in our direct phototransformation experiments further details are provided in si1 5 2 4 2 sorption experiments and prior estimation of koc to gather consistently derived experimental k oc values for the selected field compounds we carried out a series of sorption experiments following the experimental procedures described by davis and janssen 2020 further details in si1 6 to that end sorption experiments were carried out with both sediments used in modified oecd 308 type studies by seller et al 2021 and one standardized soil i e lufa 2 1 such that experiments captured sorption under two different ph conditions and with two different sediment toc contents table si4 sorption experiments were carried out in two stages first we determined the time needed to reach sorption equilibrium and second we derived sorption isotherms for five concentration levels spanning two orders of magnitude of initial aqueous concentrations i e 0 3 to 30 µg l 1 according to outcomes of the first stage of sorption experiments an equilibration time of 16 h was used to ensure steady conditions in all experimental vessels during the second stage of sorption experiments sorption isotherms were derived using a linear and a freundlich model however data suggested that linear sorption isotherms were suitable to describe sorption behavior of most compounds therefore we calculated k oc values based on k d values measured in each of the sediments soil oecd 2000 to derive k oc prior distributions to describe sorption behavior of our compounds in the laboratory and in the field experimentally determined k oc values were averaged across the three sediments soil in case of pesticides which were only studied in the laboratory prior estimates for k oc values were based on data provided by the pesticides properties database ppdb of the university of hertfordshire prior distributions for k oc were assumed to be lognormal due to the rather high variability of experimentally determined k oc values and the fact that only positive values are meaningful for this quantity mean and standard deviation of the k oc priors lognormal distributions were derived from our own experimental k oc values as described in si1 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 phototransformation and sorption experiments 3 1 1 phototransformation kinetics and derivation of k photo priors phototransformation experiments were run to identify compounds that might potentially undergo phototransformation reactions in the field given an average hydraulic residence time in the rhine river catchment of roughly 7 days honti et al 2018a we found that direct phototransformation could be a relevant removal pathway for five field compounds i e diclofenac hydrochlorothiazide aliskiren atazanavir and sulfamethoxazole with the first two compounds showing the most rapid transformation fig 1 those results are in line with previous studies showing the susceptibility of aliskiren diclofenac hydrochlorothiazide and sulfamethoxazole towards direct phototransformation especially the phototransformation behavior of diclofenac has been studied widely avetta et al 2016 davis et al 2017 gonçalves et al 2021 peuravuori 2012 to our knowledge no previous studies examined phototransformation behavior of atazanavir our results indicate that this compound can indeed undergo direct phototransformation at conditions relevant for rivers and lakes as it absorbs light within the solar spectrum figure si4 therefore we considered phototransformation as additional dissipation process for those five compounds in the rhine catchment model see 3 3 prior distributions of k photo for model calibration were derived as described in 2 4 1 and are provided in table si6 indirect phototransformation appeared to be a less significant removal pathway for the selected field compounds compound dissipation during experiments targeting indirect phototransformation was statistically significant only for the four compounds carbamazepine clopidogrel carboxylic acid lidocaine and mefenamic acid with the latter showing the greatest susceptibility towards indirect phototransformation which is in line with studies reported in the literature davis et al 2017 however it has to be noted that we did not detect removal via indirect phototransformation from the two natural waters tested i e from the river and pond samples but only from the test water amended with plfa to a high doc concentration of 10 mg l 1 even at this elevated doc concentration the maximum observed rate for indirect phototransformation was in all cases 0 067 d 1 based on the fact that doc concentrations in the river rhine are commonly 3 9 fold lower abril et al 2002 rodríguez murillo et al 2015 and considering the compound s average hydraulic residence time within the rhine river catchment i e 7 days we assume that indirect phototransformation is not a relevant dissipation process for the selected field compounds in this catchment and therefore neglect this transformation pathway in the rhine catchment model 3 1 2 sorption behavior and derivation of koc priors a compilation of measured k d and k oc values for selected field compounds is provided in table 1 field compounds covered a broad range of different sorption behavior with calculated k d values ranging from 0 17 to 286 l kg 1 resulting in k oc values ranging from 15 to 28 550 l kg 1 highest affinity for sorption to solids with k oc values 1000 l kg 1 in at least one of the tested sediments soil were calculated for aliskiren citalopram fexofenadine sitagliptin trimethoprim and venlafaxine which is in line with previously reported experimentally determined k oc values table 1 and table si19 barron et al 2009 klement et al 2018 le guet et al 2018 li and zhang 2017 k oc values consistently 100 l kg 1 were determined for nine compounds i e acesulfame bezafibrate cyclamate irbesartan levetiracetam lidocaine saccharin sulfamethoxazole and valsartan accordingly previous studies on acesulfame and sulfamethoxazole report little sorption to soil sludge or sediment barron et al 2009 carballa et al 2008 le guet et al 2018 storck et al 2016 in case of bezafibrate k oc values reported in the literature are mostly higher than here determined k oc values however those previous sorption studies were performed in soil with partially lower ph i e ph 3 5 6 4 table si18 than the here employed sediments soil i e ph 5 7 5 barron et al 2009 revitt et al 2015 due to the low pka of bezafibrate i e pka 3 83 the compound can be assumed to have been present in its deprotonated anionic form in our own sorption experiments while the lower ph in previous soil studies may have resulted in presence of more neutral species leading to increased sorption for compounds exhibiting moderate sorption behavior i e 5 methylbenzotriazole atenolol carbamazepine diclofenac lamotrigine mefenamic acid and metoprolol our experimentally determined k oc values mostly fall within the range previously reported in literature table 1 based on our literature search table si19 which we do not claim to be fully comprehensive we concluded that experimentally derived k oc values have not been reported previously for 13 of our test compounds table 1 highlighting the importance of performing our own sorption studies prior to estimating k bio prior distributions for k oc values used for calibration of the k bio model frameworks to determine k bio field and k bio lab see 3 3 and 3 4 were derived as described in 2 4 2 and are listed in table si6 in this context we acknowledge that the assumption behind using k oc values to describe a compound s sorption behavior i e that compounds predominantly sorb to organic carbon is not necessarily correct for small polar or charged compounds which might also sorb to minerals because more detailed studies on sorption mechanisms of our many field compounds were out of scope we attempted to account for those variabilities in sorption behavior by defining prior distributions of k oc based on average values derived from three sediments soils differing in toc grain size distribution and ph in doing so we try to describe a reasonable range of sorption behavior a compound might exhibit when exposed to different environmental conditions and sediments along the rhine river catchment 3 2 compound concentrations and loads in the rhine river basin all of our 27 field compounds were detected in water samples from the smpc sampling locations during both campaigns p1 and p3 with 21 and 17 compounds detected at each sampling location at concentrations above their limits of quantification loqs table si10 table si13 during p1 and p3 respectively indicating continuous use and emissions in significant amounts of those compounds measured compound concentrations are given in tables si10 si13 depending on compound and sampling location concentrations ranged from 1 ng l 1 to 5 µg l 1 during p1 and from 1 ng l 1 to 2 5 µg l 1 during p3 which is comparable to the concentration range previously measured for various pharmaceuticals or artificial sweeteners in water samples from the river rhine ruff et al 2015 generally highest compound concentrations were measured in samples taken from two of the rhine s tributaries i e schwarzbach and emscher which enter the main channel of the rhine at 475 and 798 rhine km respectively at all sampling locations 4 5 methylbenzotriazole and acesulfame together with gabapentin during p1 and cyclamate during p3 were measured at highest concentrations fig 2 the weekly loads of compounds along the rhine and its tributaries were calculated separately for the p1 and p3 campaigns by multiplying corresponding discharge and concentration measurements at each location discharge measurements in table si10 table si13 generally compound loads gradually increased along the rhine during both sampling campaigns fig 2 as the rhine receives input from tributaries and wwtps distributed all along the river the cumulative weekly loads of our field compounds passing the last monitoring station before the rhine estuary i e lobith at 865 rhine km were 2 5 and 1 6 tons during p1 and p3 respectively fig 2 quarterly consumption of the majority of the field compounds in germany and switzerland can be assumed to have been similar during the p1 and p3 campaign table si8 hence the reduced cumulative compound loads in p3 point towards increased compound transformation during summer months while compound removal in wwtps can potentially undergo seasonal changes di marcantonio et al 2020 fernández et al 2014 kahl et al 2018 varga et al 2023 did not find a statistically significant seasonal dependency of the field compounds emission into the rhine based on wwtp effluent monitoring data except for three compounds ace cyc and gab hence we assume that at least part of the almost 40 decrease in cumulative compound load along the rhine during p3 resulted from more rapid transformation within the riverine environment such an increase in compound removal from the aquatic environment during summer can amongst others result from increased biotransformation due to higher microbial biomass and or activity at elevated water temperatures table si16 greater abundance of phototrophic degrader bacteria as well as from increased removal of photo reactive compounds at higher light intensities and longer light exposure times 3 3 biotransformation in the rhine river basin calculation of k bio field values we calculated k bio field values to describe the compounds biotransformation potential in the rhine catchment compound loads measured along the rhine and its tributaries as well as laboratory derived sorption and phototransformation parameters served as basis for model calibration the rhine catchment model generally achieved good fits to the compound loads monitored during both field campaigns figs 3 b and si7 calibrated k bio field values are listed in tables si14 and si15 and posterior distributions are shown in fig 3a mean k bio field values ranged from 1 to 3000 l g oc d 1 fig 3a it has to be noted that the model framework only allows to differentiate k bio field values 30 to 1000 l g oc d 1 lower k bio field values practically mean that no transformation was observed along the rhine higher k bio field values indicate complete disappearance of the respective compound between subsequent sampling locations based on the differences in compound loads accumulating along the rhine during the two field campaigns biotransformation can be assumed to have been increased during p3 compared to p1 see 3 2 accordingly for eleven compounds i e acesulfame aliskiren bezafibrate diclofenac levetiracetam mefenamic acid saccharin sitagliptin trimethoprim valsartan and venlafaxine k bio field values derived from p3 data k bio field p3 were significantly higher than k bio field values derived from p1 data k bio field p1 i e there was no overlap of their interquartile range another group of eight compounds showed a possible but less significant difference of the same kind i e atazanavir atenolol bicalutamide citalopram cyclamate lidocaine metoprolol and saccharin for clopidogrel carboxylic acid hydrochlorothiazide lamotrigine and sulfamethoxazole k bio field values were similar during p1 and p3 suggesting that their biotransformation is less sensitive towards temporal variations e g changes in season carbamazepine and fexofenadine were the only counter examples with significantly higher k bio field p1 values compared to k bio field p3 values i e no overlap of interquartile range however mean k bio field values derived for carbamazepine were close to below the here defined identifiability range in the case of fexofenadine an antihistamine quarterly consumption data available to estimate compound emission into the rhine may not fully capture the seasonal use of this pharmaceutical potentially resulting in overestimation of both emissions and k bio field p1 it can be assumed that a major factor driving differences between k bio field p1 and k bio field p3 are seasonal variations in water temperature table si16 ideally the rhine catchment model should be updated to account for the compounds varying transformation kinetics at changing temperatures however a simple correction of k bio field according to the arrhenius equation does not seem feasible as the ratios between k bio field p1 and k bio field p3 vary across compounds i e there is no systematic increase for all compounds removal via biotransformation during summer fig 3a this is in line with recent findings of meynet et al 2020 showing that temperature optima for micropollutant biotransformation in activated sludge can vary strongly depending on compound and expected reaction pathways generally absolute k bio field values are to be treated with caution as our model framework calculates bio transformation for an entire catchment which requires a number of simplifying assumptions resulting in uncertainties in model output parameters it is not possible to distinguish between biotransformation and other fate processes based on observed compound loads in the rhine water body exclusively hence k bio field values are conditional on the assumptions made during model calibration for example by using a single k oc value for the entire catchment the model framework cannot capture spatially varying sorption behavior of compounds under changing bed sediment and suspended particle properties within the stream network as indicated by variable outcomes of our sorption experiments and the literature data such variability is undeniable table 1 yet the posterior distributions of k hyro k photo and k oc closely followed their prior distributions which indicates that there was no strong evidence against our laboratory experiments based prior assumptions in the observed field data however as expected prior distributions for abiotic transformation influenced calibrated k bio field values this is especially critical in the case of phototransformation as translating k photo from laboratory to field is subject to a number of uncertainties e g actual light penetration into the water body sensitivity to this parameter was nonlinear i e changing the mean prior value of k photo by a factor of 2 did not result in statistically significant changes of the k bio field estimates however 5 fold changes of k photo resulted in k bio field estimates differing by two orders of magnitude however previous field studies on phototransformation kinetics of diclofenac at the surface of german river stretches 15 cm water depth during the month of july resulted in rate constants differing by a factor of 2 4 compared to the here employed mean of the k photo prior distribution supporting its feasibility for calibration of the rhine catchment model kunkel and radke 2012 radke et al 2010 finally from a microbiology perspective the model would need to be further underpinned with molecular biology data characterizing the potential of sediment and water microbial communities to catalyze a range of initial contaminant biotransformation reactions consequently the parameters of the rhine model should be considered as abstract values that describe the observed behavior at the catchment scale and k bio field estimates should not be considered measurable as such at any specific location in the catchment yet when including data from our phototransformation and sorption experiments the rhine catchment model allowed to at least semi quantitatively elucidate biotransformation kinetics of 20 chemical contaminants ubiquitously present within the river rhine it can therefore be considered a valuable contribution towards estimating the rate and extent of biotransformation processes in riverine environments even when wwtps densely distributed along the river preclude the direct observation of compound attenuation while k bio field p1 and k bio field p3 differ in terms of their absolute values the compounds rank relative to each other was well conserved spearman rank ρ 0 78 p value 0 05 meaning that the rhine catchment model identified the same compounds as slowly or rapidly degrading regardless of whether calibrated with p1 or p3 data therewith outcomes of the rhine catchment model qualitatively align well with findings of previous biotransformation studies in laboratory or field for example smallest k bio field values during both field campaigns were calculated for carbamazepine and 4 5 methylbenzotriazole carbamazepine is well known to remain persistent in aquatic environments coll et al 2020 tixier et al 2003 while 5 methylbenzotriazole was previously shown to biotransform at moderate rates in water sediment systems seller et al 2021 the low k bio field values are probably distorted by the persistent 4 methylbezotriazole which cannot be distinguished from 5 methylbenzotriazole with the analytical method used here dummer 2014 highest k bio field values were found for compounds easily biodegraded by a range of enzymes present in wwtp effluent impacted surface waters or widespread among aquatic microbial communities in general e g atenolol bezafibrate levetiracetam or valsartan achermann et al 2018 desiante et al 2021 seller et al 2021 3 4 biotransformation in laboratory studies calculation of k bio lab values the k bio lab values were calculated based on data from modified oecd 308 type studies in order to enable a comparison of laboratory and field derived transformation kinetics further k bio lab values were derived from studies conducted with different inocula allowing to simultaneously test whether the k bio concept could facilitate unifying observations from different laboratory studies as previously suggested yet only tested on three compounds honti et al 2016 hence we inferred k bio lab from experiments conducted in river and pond inoculum individually k bio lab r and k bio lab p respectively and across both experimental setups k bio lab joint for 38 compounds first k bio lab values were normalized to toc as proxy for degrader biomass and ranged from 0 004 to 4000 l g oc d 1 with standard model errors mostly below 10 fig 4 table si16 it has to be noted that k bio lab values 0 01 or 100 l g oc d 1 are subject to identifiability issues due to slow or very fast transformation respectively comparison of mean k bio lab r to mean k bio lab p revealed that the two quantities show a statistically significant strong correlation i e pearson s r 0 81 p values 0 001 figure si8 regardless of slight differences in absolute values further it was possible to derive biotransformation rate constants that are valid across both sets of biotransformation simulation studies k bio lab joint fig 4a the good fit to the experimental data when jointly fitting data from both experiments figs 4b and si9 confirms the hypothesis that the k bio concept allows linking biotransformation kinetics of compounds with a range of different properties across different water sediment studies comparing the individual fits to the joint fit revealed that the joint model solution yielded more likely results for all compounds except for atenolol and fenoxycarb whose k bio lab r values were outside of the here defined identifiability range comparison based on akaike information criterion table si17 further for the large majority of compounds k bio lab joint values were less uncertain than values from individual fits coefficients of variation cv in table si17 second in addition to toc normalization we also derived k bio lab values normalized to what we assume to be a more precise measure of total biomass than toc i e cell densities measured using flow cytometry during modified oecd 308 type studies those k bio lab cell values ranged from 0 01 to 4000 ml 109 cells d 1 table si18 and when inferred from river and pond experiments individually correlated equally strongly as k bio lab values normalized to toc i e pearson s r 0 81 p value 0 001 fig si8 yet t statistics on the correlation between cell density normalised k bio lab cell r and k bio lab cell p showed that the slope of the linear regression was not statistically significantly different from 1 while in contrast the correlation between the two quantities normalized to toc had a slope distinctly lower than 1 fig si8 those differences in slope indicate that normalization to cell densities as a more precise measure for total biomass increases the transferability of k bio lab between different experiments in a regulatory context in which oecd biotransformation studies are typically performed model frameworks that enable system agnostic approaches are of special interest in risk assessment of synthetic chemicals where compound specific transformation parameters are prime targets as the measurement of biodegradation kinetics according to regulatory testing guidelines is laborious and costly reducing the amount of experiments that need to be performed in order to determine a compound s biotransformation potential brings economic and ecological benefits allowing to more easily consider a compound s environmental degradability during earlier phases of chemical design fenner et al 2020 in the future different indicators for degrader biomass such as atp measurements could be tested to further improve the transferability of kinetic parameters between different studies 3 5 comparison of biotransformation kinetics in modified oecd 308 type studies and the rhine river basin 3 5 1 direct comparison of k bio lab and k bio field we compared k bio lab and k bio field values in order to assess to what extent biotransformation data from laboratory experiments reflect compound degradation in the rhine river basin comparing biotransformation between laboratory and field was possible for 23 compounds i e field compounds for which we were able to derive both meaningful k bio field and k bio lab joint values we directly compared k bio field p3 to k bio lab joint estimates as the temperatures measured in the water column of the main channel of the rhine during p3 table si16 were in the same range as temperatures during modified oecd 308 type studies i e 22 2 c seller et al 2021 on the laboratory side we used k bio lab joint values normalized to toc to allow for a direct comparison of quantities comparing absolute values of k bio field p3 to k bio lab joint revealed that k bio lab joint values are generally about two orders of magnitude lower than k bio field p3 values fig 5 a while uncertainties associated with absolute values of k bio field p3 are to be expected see 3 3 the large difference between laboratory and field k bio may point to a systematic under estimation of field degradation rates by laboratory simulation tests faster transformation in the field can be speculated to be due to the fact that the compounds were exposed to more diverse microbial degraders and degradation pathways during their travel in the rhine river catchment than while being entrapped in experimental vessels chalifour et al 2021 in its current form i e using toc as proxy for degrader biomass the k bio concept cannot account for such differing characteristics of microbial communities and their varying capacities for biotransformation of chemicals further the extent of hyporheic exchange i e contact with sediment biofilms has been demonstrated to influence contaminant transformation jaeger et al 2019 jaeger et al 2021 the lower k bio lab joint values may suggest that even modified oecd 308 type test systems do not fully capture the impact of hyporheic exchange on biotransformation differences in sediment water mixing might thus explain part of the increased degradation observed in the field regardless of the differences in absolute values linear regression revealed a statistically significant moderate correlation between k bio field p3 and k bio lab joint i e pearson s r 0 6 p value 0 05 fig 5a the compound valsartan is the strongest outlier in the correlation between k bio field p3 and k bio lab joint however together with bezafibrate and levetiracetam its k bio field p3 value is above the here defined identifiability range yet it has to be noted that fixing outlier k bio values to the identifiability range i e 30 l g oc d 1 k bio field p3 1000 l g oc d 1 and 0 01 l g oc d 1 k bio lab joint 100 l g oc d 1 does not influence correlation parameters i e pearson s r value of 0 6 remains compared to previous for the majority inconclusive attempts to relate biotransformation parameters derived from standard oecd 308 studies i e dt50 to compound dissipation from riverine environments radke and maier 2014a the observed relationship between k bio lab and k bio field values represents a clear improvement suggesting that outcomes of laboratory simulation studies indeed to some extent reflect transformation kinetics observed in the environment hence compared to dt50 the k bio concept appears more suitable to investigate biotransformation kinetics of compounds covering a wide range of different transformation and sorption behavior e g field compounds with k oc values covering roughly four orders of magnitude table 1 under spatially varying conditions as indicated by the increased transferability of k bio lab values between different laboratory studies when normalized to cell densities figure si8 a more accurate estimator of degrader biomass may allow to further converge k bio lab and k bio field values while data on bacterial cell densities in the rhine river catchment is not yet available flow cytometry has been shown to be feasible for in situ monitoring of cell densities in aquatic ecosystems besmer et al 2014 and may hopefully be considered in future field campaigns 3 4 2 relative ranking and clustering of compounds in laboratory and field relative comparison of biotransformation kinetics in laboratory and field allowed a ranking like analysis of the compounds derived k bio values were scaled to the range of values derived from laboratory studies p1 and p3 respectively and logarithmized to allow for a clear differentiation between lower values fig 5b scaled k bio values differed 1 log unit between laboratory and field for the majority of compounds compared i e 20 out of 23 only for the three compounds carbamazepine lamotrigine and lidocaine scaled k bio values differed by 2 log units between laboratory and field in case of carbamazepine absolute k bio lab joint and k bio field p3 values are lower than the here defined identifiability ranges and differences in scaled values are therefore to be treated with caution the overall good accordance of scaled k bio vales indicates that regardless of differences in absolute k bio values the behavior of the field compounds relative to each other stays well conserved when relating outcomes of laboratory studies to biotransformation kinetics in the field based on relative rankings it was possible to cluster compounds into groups showing consistently fast moderate or slow transformation in both modified oecd 308 type studies and in the rhine river catchment fig 5b c eleven compounds were identified as showing rather fast biotransformation in both laboratory and field studies i e atenolol bezafibrate clopidogrel carboxylic acid cyclamate diclofenac levetiracetam metoprolol saccharin sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and valsartan the nine compounds acesulfame bicalutamide citalopram gabapentin irbesartan lidocaine mefenamic acid sitagliptin and venlafaxine showed moderate transformation kinetics finally very slow to no biotransformation was observed in case of carbamazepine hydrochlorothiazide and lamotrigine based on this grouping into slow moderate and fast degrading compounds we calculated the geometric mean k bio values across all compounds belonging to the same group fig 5c from their absolute k bio values regardless whether considering field or laboratory data mean k bio values differed significantly between each group allowing to clearly distinguish between compounds exhibiting different potential for biotransformation as our selected field compounds cover quite a wide range of different transformation and sorption behavior here derived mean k bio values may be considered as points of reference when aiming to classify further compounds potential for biotransformation based on field or laboratory data additional data from future laboratory and field studies could help to fine tune mean k bio lab k bio field values as points of reference both in terms of their feasibility for read across applications between other laboratory and field studies and also in terms of their chemical applicability domain 4 conclusion we demonstrate that inverse modeling in combination with the k bio concept can be used to describe biotransformation kinetics of wwtp effluent borne compounds within a large densely populated river basin our field studies reveal that the 27 field compounds are ubiquitously present within the rhine river catchment and accumulate along the main channel of the rhine making it impossible to directly observe compound dissipation from monitoring data yet k bio field showed to be a suitable parameter to at least semi quantitatively elucidate the compounds varying potential for biotransformation the evaluation of aerobic laboratory simulation experiments proved that the k bio concept allows to unify observed transformation kinetics across laboratory studies with different sediments i e k bio lab joint and that transferability of k bio between different water sediment systems increases with a more precise measure of total biomass i e employing bacterial cell densities rather than toc as the normalizing factor for transformation comparing k bio lab and k bio field revealed that absolute values differed between laboratory and field pointing towards faster transformation in the rhine river basin yet data gathered for the large number of 23 directly comparable compounds demonstrate that grouping based on relative compound behavior bears considerable potential when aiming to reflect biotransformation of micropollutants in natural riverine environments by performing biotransformation simulation studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

14923,identifying a chemical s potential for biotransformation in the aquatic environment is crucial to predict its fate and manage its potential hazards due to the complexity of natural water bodies especially river networks biotransformation is often studied in laboratory experiments assuming that study outcomes can be extrapolated to compound behavior in the field here we investigated to what extent outcomes of laboratory simulation studies indeed reflect biotransformation kinetics observed in riverine systems to determine in field biotransformation we measured loads of 27 wastewater treatment plant effluent borne compounds along the rhine and its major tributaries during two seasons up to 21 compounds were detected at each sampling location measured compound loads were used in an inverse model framework of the rhine river basin to derive k bio field values a compound specific parameter describing the compounds average biotransformation potential during the field studies to support model calibration we performed phototransformation and sorption experiments with all the study compounds identifying 5 compounds that are susceptible towards direct phototransformation and determining k oc values covering four orders of magnitude on the laboratory side we used a similar inverse model framework to derive k bio lab values from water sediment experiments run according to a modified oecd 308 type protocol the comparison of k bio lab and k bio field revealed that their absolute values differed pointing towards faster transformation in the rhine river basin yet we could demonstrate that relative rankings of biotransformation potential and groups of compounds with low moderate and high persistence agree reasonably well between laboratory and field outcomes overall our results provide evidence that laboratory based biotransformation studies using the modified oecd 308 protocol and k bio values derived thereof bear considerable potential to reflect biotransformation of micropollutants in one of the largest european river basins graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biotransformation kinetics laboratory field comparison micropollutants bayesian model frameworks data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps often discharge their effluents into rivers and streams resulting in exposure of riverine ecosystems to chemicals hamdhani et al 2020 actual exposure levels and the individual chemical s potential to cause damage to these ecosystems depends on their mass load in the wwtp effluents and the extent to which they can be removed from the aquatic environment via biotic and abiotic transformation berkner and thierbach 2014 fenner et al 2013 schwarzenbach et al 2006 therefore a chemical s persistence i e recalcitrance towards transformation in aquatic environments is considered a key hazard property in chemical regulations worldwide cousins et al 2019 yet directly quantifying transformation of chemicals in rivers is challenging for several reasons first especially in industrialized and densely populated regions distances and hence hydraulic residence times between wwtps along rivers are typically short unless a compound is transformed at a very high rate and its transformation can therefore be observed along the short distance between two wwtps new emissions from wwtps will overlay upstream compound loads and mask the transformation signal second chemical concentrations are modulated by dilution in river networks which needs to be explicitly accounted for to quantify compound loads and hence removal lastly while a chemical s structure determines to some extent its potential to be transformed the actual extent of transformation in a riverine environment is additionally influenced by the chemical s bioavailability the environmental conditions such as ph and temperature and in the case of biotransformation the abundance of enzymes and or competent microbial degraders that can transform a given chemical structure both environmental conditions as well as microbial community composition and activity are known to vary spatially and temporally chalifour et al 2021 fenner et al 2013 gao et al 2019 helbling et al 2012 winter et al 2007 indeed previous field studies showed large variabilities in compound attenuation from different sections of various european rivers rendering it almost impossible to derive conclusive evidence regarding a chemical s environmental persistence from the observation of riverine concentrations alone jaeger et al 2019 li et al 2016 for all of these reasons persistence of chemicals is most often studied in laboratory experiments under controlled conditions since aerobic biotransformation is considered the dominant removal pathway for most commonly detected chemical pollutants it is common practice to use laboratory biotransformation studies following internationally accepted oecd guidelines to assess aquatic persistence this practice is based on the assumption that laboratory observations are representative of compound behavior in the field yet the robustness of this assumption has barely been addressed in previous research adriaanse et al 1997 montforts 2006 in fact the few attempts to relate outcomes of e g oecd 308 water sediment studies to compound behavior in riverine environments remained inconclusive honti et al 2018a radke and maier 2014b southwell et al 2020 recently shrestha et al 2016 2021 introduced broadly tested and characterized a novel laboratory system in which a thin predominantly aerobic sediment layer is covered by an aerated water column favoring aerobic biotransformation as dominant compound removal pathway referred to as modified oecd 308 type study in seller et al 2021 it has been argued that such a laboratory system may be well suited to elucidate a chemical s potential for biotransformation in riverine environments i e in fully mixed water bodies with the first few centimeters of sediment being aerobic seller et al 2021 however this hypothesis has not yet been tested and warrants further exploration therefore the primary aim of this study was to investigate to what extent outcomes of modified oecd 308 type studies can be compared to biotransformation kinetics of chemicals observed in riverine systems across a large number of relevant aquatic pollutants to fulfill this aim a sound basis for comparison of laboratory and field biotransformation had to be sought transformation half lives dt50 while being essential pieces of information in a regulatory context typically lump together transformation and phase transfer processes particularly in water sediment systems and are system specific in many aspects i e dependent on e g water sediment ratios suspended solids concentration or sediment total organic carbon toc making them unfit for comparison of biotransformation between laboratory test systems and river environments honti et al 2016 to eliminate some of the most influential system specific differences affecting aquatic biotransformation honti et al 2016 2018a introduced k bio a biomass corrected second order rate constant k bio is estimated from measured chemical concentration patterns and information on the physicochemical properties of and biomass in the studied system through inverse modeling it hinges on the assumption that total biomass or in case such information is missing toc can serve as proxies for the abundance of degrading enzymes and or competent microbial degraders since k bio is also corrected for differences in the chemical s bioavailability in water sediment systems exhibiting different sediment to water ratios it should in principle allow comparing a chemical s biotransformation potential across laboratory and field systems yet previous attempts to derive k bio from field observations in the rhine river catchment were subject to large uncertainties mostly due to a substantial lack of accurately known compound emissions into the rhine but also due to a lack of precise knowledge on other relevant fate properties that are required for the inverse estimation of k bio those include the compounds susceptibility towards abiotic transformation i e hydrolysis and phototransformation and their organic carbon water partition coefficient k oc influencing the compounds estimated bioavailability honti et al 2018a therefore in order to apply the k bio concept for comparing chemicals biotransformation kinetics between laboratory studies and riverine environments a secondary aim of this work was to improve the estimation of k bio from monitored river concentration in the catchment of the river rhine one of the largest and most important catchments of europe to this end we i conducted sorption and phototransformation laboratory experiments to provide sufficiently accurate data describing the compounds abiotic fate properties ii determined weekly compound loads in the main channel of the rhine and its major tributaries in switzerland germany and the netherlands during catchment wide field campaigns in spring and summer 2017 and iii estimated compound emission into the rhine based on an effluent monitoring based approach presented by varga et al 2023 finally we inferred k bio values from the rhine field study k bio field and from modified oecd 308 type studies k bio lab using inverse model frameworks and systematically compared model outcomes to evaluate to what extent biotransformation data from laboratory experiments reflect micropollutant degradation in a large river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 test compounds based on the compound selection of seller et al 2021 k bio lab values describing biotransformation in modified oecd 308 type studies were derived for 42 compounds including 23 pharmaceuticals 15 pesticides 3 artificial sweeteners and 1 industrial chemical k bio field values describing biotransformation in the rhine river catchment were inferred for a subset of 27 compounds that were expected to be released into the aquatic environment via wwtp effluents i e pharmaceuticals artificial sweeteners and industrial chemicals here referred to as field compounds it has to be noted that the here employed analytical methods did not allow to differentiate between 4 and 5 methylbenzotriazole and therefore compound loads measured in the rhine river catchment are most likely a combination of both ruff et al 2015 a list of all compounds including name abbreviations is provided in table si1 2 2 experimental and field data of test compounds 2 2 1 compound loads in the rhine catchment to determine the field compounds abundance and transformation behavior within the rhine river catchment this study benefited from the activities of the international commission for the protection of the rhine iksr in the frame of the sampling campaign sondermessprogramm chemie smpc iksr 2019 during the smpc four water parcels were tracked along the rhine during each season of 2017 the water parcels were sampled by means of weekly composite samples at eleven locations within the main channel of the rhine and at six locations along its major tributaries close to their confluence points with the rhine table si2 and fig si1 we received samples from two of the four smpc campaigns i e from the p1 campaign with samples taken between march 19th april 6th 2017 and from the p3 campaign with samples taken between july 10th 27th 2017 we measured concentrations of field compounds using an agilent 6495c triple quad mass spectrometer coupled to an agilent hplc 1290 binary pump system si1 3 compound loads were calculated by multiplying the concentrations measured in the iksr samples with the discharge measured at each sampling time and location table si10 table si13 2 2 2 data from biotransformation simulation studies data provided by seller et al 2021 describe compound behavior in modified oecd 308 type studies i e in systems in which a sediment layer was covered by an aerated water column to a sediment water ratio of 1 10 v v further information provided in si1 4 inocula for modified oecd 308 type studies were sampled from two locations i e a wwtp effluent impacted river and a pristine pond we used compound concentrations measured during 54 days of biotransformation experiments in both sediment and water phase to derive k bio lab values as described in 2 3 2 2 3 biotransformation kinetics modelling frameworks 2 3 1 determination of k bio field values to derive k bio field values we used the catchment scale water quality model of honti et al 2018a and extended the model framework with abiotic hydrolysis and direct phototransformation as potential removal pathways for dissolved parent compounds please note that we experimentally studied our field compounds susceptibility towards indirect phototransformation and based on the results decided to neglect indirect phototransformation as a potential compound removal pathway for the selected field compounds from the rhine river catchment see 3 1 1 the most important underlying assumptions of the rhine catchment model are i that only dissolved compound mass fractions are available for abiotic and biotic transformation following a first order decay and ii that converting k bio field into compound specific degradation rate constants requires considering degrader biomass total organic carbon toc estimates were used as a proxy for degrader biomass as previous studies were able to link organic carbon content of river bed sediments to microbial activity fischer et al 2002 the rhine catchment model is based on individual river reaches described by the catchment characterization model europe ccm2 de jager and vogt 2007 in each reach partitioning and transformation at equilibrium are described as functions of the physical properties of the reach and the sorption transformation properties of the field compounds a compound s behavior in the entire catchment of the river rhine was then simulated by connecting the 18 000 stream reaches following the topology of the stream network in each reach the output compound flux was calculated as 1 f o u t f i n exp δ τ w k w where fin and fout kg d 1 are the incoming and outflowing fluxes of the parent

2005 the mean physical properties for each reach in the rhine river catchment were estimated based on drainage area and channel slope provided by the ccm2 database mean sscs were derived from estimated channel geometry flow velocity and sediment grain size distribution in reality ssc is governed by discharge season the state of the upstream catchment and the stage of flood pulses which together make it highly dynamic here we had to neglect those variabilities as we had no information to model dynamic ssc in the entire stream network the model was fitted to field compound loads measured along the rhine during the two smpc campaigns p1 and p3 resulting in k bio field p1 and k bio field p3 values respectively model calibration took place in a bayesian framework parameter priors for calibration of k oc and transformation rate constants were set to capture experimentally determined values as described thereinafter see 2 4 parameter posteriors were sampled by markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling based on the classical metropolis algorithm two parallel chains were launched with 4000 steps each out of which the first 3000 served for burn in 2 3 2 determination of k bio lab values we adapted the model framework of honti and fenner 2015 to describe transformation and sorption processes in modified oecd 308 type studies i e a two compartment system seller et al 2021 we defined the settled sediment layer including pore water as the first compartment and the supernatant water column which we assumed to not contain any suspended sediment as the second compartment test compounds were assumed to be either in dissolved phase in the water compartment i e neglecting association with dissolved organic carbon or in sorbed or dissolved state in the sediment compartment the model is structurally compatible with the rhine catchment model as we apply the same underlying assumptions i e that only dissolved compound mass fractions are available for abiotic and biotic transformation following a first order decay and that k bio lab requires normalization to degrader biomass in line with procedures to derive k bio field values we use toc measured in the sediment and water compartment of the experimental vessels as a proxy for degrader biomass however as the k bio concept thrives from an accurate description of degrader biomass we furthermore explored the possibility to use bacterial cell densities measured during modified oecd 308 type studies seller et al 2021 as proxy for degrader biomass to derive a second set of k bio lab values generally we assume that the fraction of active degraders relative to total bacterial biomass is the same in both laboratory inocula dispersion and diffusion processes connecting sediment and water compartments were described following fick s law sorption equilibrium in the sediment was assumed to be reached instantaneously and the sediment compartment itself was treated as a fully mixed reactor i e transformation processes were assumed to take place synchronously and at the same rate throughout the entire shallow sediment layer following those model assumptions compound dissipation over time

phototransformation was neglected as potential compound removal pathway as modified oecd 308 type studies were conducted in the dark the model was fitted to concentration time series obtained from modified oecd 308 type systems with river and pond inocula seller et al 2021 we used a bayesian parameter estimation framework to calibrate the model for individual river and pond studies separately i e deriving k bio lab r and k bio lab p respectively and jointly across both studies i e deriving k bio lab joint the joint fit was performed to verify whether the model can fit experimental data from two biotransformation simulation studies with one set of substance specific parameters i e k bio lab joint k hydro and k oc parameter priors for calibration were set to capture experimentally determined values as described thereinafter see 2 4 posterior parameter distributions were sampled by mcmc sampling with 25 000 iterations from which the first 10 000 were dedicated to burn in 2 4 prior parameter estimates for model calibration using bayesian inference for model calibration allows to incorporate prior knowledge on parameter distributions into the calibration process to calibrate the k bio model frameworks several parameters used to describe transformation kinetics of compounds in modified oecd 308 type studies i e eqs 5 and 6 or in the rhine river catchment i e eq 1 are assumed to be compound specific and hence less dependent on the system considered besides k bio those compound specific parameters are k hydro k photo and k oc see 2 4 1 and 2 4 2 for derivation of k photo and k oc prior distributions respectively another set of prior estimates describe parameters specific to the considered system e g ssc toc or sediment porosity honti et al 2018b to estimate compound emission into the rhine we used quarterly compound consumption data available for switzerland and germany and a dimensionless escape factor k esc describing the proportion of marketed compound reaching the rhine stream network table si7 varga et al 2023 a compilation of all prior estimates is provided in si2 2 4 1 phototransformation experiments and prior estimation of k photo calibration of the rhine catchment model requires a prior estimate for k photo therefore we conducted phototransformation experiments with the goal to semi quantitatively assess whether direct or indirect phototransformation may be relevant pathways for removal of selected field compounds from the rhine river catchment phototransformation kinetics were determined i in buffered nanopure water 5 mm phosphate buffer ph 8 ii in buffered nanopure water amended with pony lake fulvic acid plfa to a dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of 10 mg l 1 to assess the field compounds potential for indirect phototransformation at elevated doc loads and iii in river and pond water previously used for modified oecd 308 type studies sterilized by filtration through glass fiber filters with a pore size of 0 2 µm i e doc concentrations of 2 2 and 1 2 mg l 1 respectively field compounds were spiked into different test waters in mixture to individual concentrations of 1 µg l 1 40 µm furfuryl alcohol ffa were added to determine the concentration of the reactive oxygen species 1o2 to monitor light flux during the experiments a para nitroanisole pyridine pna pyr actinometer was used with initial pna and pyr concentrations of 10 μm and 0 5 mm respectively laszakovits et al 2017 phototransformation experiments were carried out in quartz tubes 25 ml inner diameter 1 5 cm which were positioned in a water bath 25 c at an 30 angle 40 cm below the light source of a solar simulator heraeus model suntest cps equipped with a xenon arc lamp subsamples of 500 µl were taken from each quartz tube before irradiation and at five time points within 4 h of experiment subsamples were spiked with a mixture of internal standards istds to a concentration of 500 ng l 1 prior to analysis dark control samples were used to account for hydrolysis or other non photochemical losses of the test compounds dark controls were kept in 2 ml amber glass vials covered with aluminum foil and were immersed in the water bath shielded from the light source to be otherwise exposed to the same experimental conditions as the irradiated samples during our phototransformation experiments the light emitted by the solar simulator was approximately half of the strength of peak summer sunlight in central europe i e zürich switzerland 408 m above sea level further the solar simulator suitably mimicked the spectral output of natural sunlight as indicated by the good overlap of the irradiance spectra of the solar simulator and natural sunlight spectra from europe fig si3 to derive prior estimates for k photo in the rhine river catchment we followed methods outlined in tixier et al 2003 briefly we used the gcsolar software to calculate a pseudo first order rate constant based on diclofenac s absorbance spectrum figure si4 and its quantum yield previously determined by davis et al 2017 i e 0 071 we calculated diclofenac s k photo during spring and summer in the top first centimetre of a water body at conditions in mainz germany i e roughly the center of the rhine river basin latitude 49 99 n elevation 89 m above sea level for other compounds showing susceptibility towards phototransformation we then multiplied the prior phototransformation rate constant for diclofenac with a factor describing the respective compound s rate constant relative to diclofenac s rate constant measured in our direct phototransformation experiments further details are provided in si1 5 2 4 2 sorption experiments and prior estimation of koc to gather consistently derived experimental k oc values for the selected field compounds we carried out a series of sorption experiments following the experimental procedures described by davis and janssen 2020 further details in si1 6 to that end sorption experiments were carried out with both sediments used in modified oecd 308 type studies by seller et al 2021 and one standardized soil i e lufa 2 1 such that experiments captured sorption under two different ph conditions and with two different sediment toc contents table si4 sorption experiments were carried out in two stages first we determined the time needed to reach sorption equilibrium and second we derived sorption isotherms for five concentration levels spanning two orders of magnitude of initial aqueous concentrations i e 0 3 to 30 µg l 1 according to outcomes of the first stage of sorption experiments an equilibration time of 16 h was used to ensure steady conditions in all experimental vessels during the second stage of sorption experiments sorption isotherms were derived using a linear and a freundlich model however data suggested that linear sorption isotherms were suitable to describe sorption behavior of most compounds therefore we calculated k oc values based on k d values measured in each of the sediments soil oecd 2000 to derive k oc prior distributions to describe sorption behavior of our compounds in the laboratory and in the field experimentally determined k oc values were averaged across the three sediments soil in case of pesticides which were only studied in the laboratory prior estimates for k oc values were based on data provided by the pesticides properties database ppdb of the university of hertfordshire prior distributions for k oc were assumed to be lognormal due to the rather high variability of experimentally determined k oc values and the fact that only positive values are meaningful for this quantity mean and standard deviation of the k oc priors lognormal distributions were derived from our own experimental k oc values as described in si1 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 phototransformation and sorption experiments 3 1 1 phototransformation kinetics and derivation of k photo priors phototransformation experiments were run to identify compounds that might potentially undergo phototransformation reactions in the field given an average hydraulic residence time in the rhine river catchment of roughly 7 days honti et al 2018a we found that direct phototransformation could be a relevant removal pathway for five field compounds i e diclofenac hydrochlorothiazide aliskiren atazanavir and sulfamethoxazole with the first two compounds showing the most rapid transformation fig 1 those results are in line with previous studies showing the susceptibility of aliskiren diclofenac hydrochlorothiazide and sulfamethoxazole towards direct phototransformation especially the phototransformation behavior of diclofenac has been studied widely avetta et al 2016 davis et al 2017 gonçalves et al 2021 peuravuori 2012 to our knowledge no previous studies examined phototransformation behavior of atazanavir our results indicate that this compound can indeed undergo direct phototransformation at conditions relevant for rivers and lakes as it absorbs light within the solar spectrum figure si4 therefore we considered phototransformation as additional dissipation process for those five compounds in the rhine catchment model see 3 3 prior distributions of k photo for model calibration were derived as described in 2 4 1 and are provided in table si6 indirect phototransformation appeared to be a less significant removal pathway for the selected field compounds compound dissipation during experiments targeting indirect phototransformation was statistically significant only for the four compounds carbamazepine clopidogrel carboxylic acid lidocaine and mefenamic acid with the latter showing the greatest susceptibility towards indirect phototransformation which is in line with studies reported in the literature davis et al 2017 however it has to be noted that we did not detect removal via indirect phototransformation from the two natural waters tested i e from the river and pond samples but only from the test water amended with plfa to a high doc concentration of 10 mg l 1 even at this elevated doc concentration the maximum observed rate for indirect phototransformation was in all cases 0 067 d 1 based on the fact that doc concentrations in the river rhine are commonly 3 9 fold lower abril et al 2002 rodríguez murillo et al 2015 and considering the compound s average hydraulic residence time within the rhine river catchment i e 7 days we assume that indirect phototransformation is not a relevant dissipation process for the selected field compounds in this catchment and therefore neglect this transformation pathway in the rhine catchment model 3 1 2 sorption behavior and derivation of koc priors a compilation of measured k d and k oc values for selected field compounds is provided in table 1 field compounds covered a broad range of different sorption behavior with calculated k d values ranging from 0 17 to 286 l kg 1 resulting in k oc values ranging from 15 to 28 550 l kg 1 highest affinity for sorption to solids with k oc values 1000 l kg 1 in at least one of the tested sediments soil were calculated for aliskiren citalopram fexofenadine sitagliptin trimethoprim and venlafaxine which is in line with previously reported experimentally determined k oc values table 1 and table si19 barron et al 2009 klement et al 2018 le guet et al 2018 li and zhang 2017 k oc values consistently 100 l kg 1 were determined for nine compounds i e acesulfame bezafibrate cyclamate irbesartan levetiracetam lidocaine saccharin sulfamethoxazole and valsartan accordingly previous studies on acesulfame and sulfamethoxazole report little sorption to soil sludge or sediment barron et al 2009 carballa et al 2008 le guet et al 2018 storck et al 2016 in case of bezafibrate k oc values reported in the literature are mostly higher than here determined k oc values however those previous sorption studies were performed in soil with partially lower ph i e ph 3 5 6 4 table si18 than the here employed sediments soil i e ph 5 7 5 barron et al 2009 revitt et al 2015 due to the low pka of bezafibrate i e pka 3 83 the compound can be assumed to have been present in its deprotonated anionic form in our own sorption experiments while the lower ph in previous soil studies may have resulted in presence of more neutral species leading to increased sorption for compounds exhibiting moderate sorption behavior i e 5 methylbenzotriazole atenolol carbamazepine diclofenac lamotrigine mefenamic acid and metoprolol our experimentally determined k oc values mostly fall within the range previously reported in literature table 1 based on our literature search table si19 which we do not claim to be fully comprehensive we concluded that experimentally derived k oc values have not been reported previously for 13 of our test compounds table 1 highlighting the importance of performing our own sorption studies prior to estimating k bio prior distributions for k oc values used for calibration of the k bio model frameworks to determine k bio field and k bio lab see 3 3 and 3 4 were derived as described in 2 4 2 and are listed in table si6 in this context we acknowledge that the assumption behind using k oc values to describe a compound s sorption behavior i e that compounds predominantly sorb to organic carbon is not necessarily correct for small polar or charged compounds which might also sorb to minerals because more detailed studies on sorption mechanisms of our many field compounds were out of scope we attempted to account for those variabilities in sorption behavior by defining prior distributions of k oc based on average values derived from three sediments soils differing in toc grain size distribution and ph in doing so we try to describe a reasonable range of sorption behavior a compound might exhibit when exposed to different environmental conditions and sediments along the rhine river catchment 3 2 compound concentrations and loads in the rhine river basin all of our 27 field compounds were detected in water samples from the smpc sampling locations during both campaigns p1 and p3 with 21 and 17 compounds detected at each sampling location at concentrations above their limits of quantification loqs table si10 table si13 during p1 and p3 respectively indicating continuous use and emissions in significant amounts of those compounds measured compound concentrations are given in tables si10 si13 depending on compound and sampling location concentrations ranged from 1 ng l 1 to 5 µg l 1 during p1 and from 1 ng l 1 to 2 5 µg l 1 during p3 which is comparable to the concentration range previously measured for various pharmaceuticals or artificial sweeteners in water samples from the river rhine ruff et al 2015 generally highest compound concentrations were measured in samples taken from two of the rhine s tributaries i e schwarzbach and emscher which enter the main channel of the rhine at 475 and 798 rhine km respectively at all sampling locations 4 5 methylbenzotriazole and acesulfame together with gabapentin during p1 and cyclamate during p3 were measured at highest concentrations fig 2 the weekly loads of compounds along the rhine and its tributaries were calculated separately for the p1 and p3 campaigns by multiplying corresponding discharge and concentration measurements at each location discharge measurements in table si10 table si13 generally compound loads gradually increased along the rhine during both sampling campaigns fig 2 as the rhine receives input from tributaries and wwtps distributed all along the river the cumulative weekly loads of our field compounds passing the last monitoring station before the rhine estuary i e lobith at 865 rhine km were 2 5 and 1 6 tons during p1 and p3 respectively fig 2 quarterly consumption of the majority of the field compounds in germany and switzerland can be assumed to have been similar during the p1 and p3 campaign table si8 hence the reduced cumulative compound loads in p3 point towards increased compound transformation during summer months while compound removal in wwtps can potentially undergo seasonal changes di marcantonio et al 2020 fernández et al 2014 kahl et al 2018 varga et al 2023 did not find a statistically significant seasonal dependency of the field compounds emission into the rhine based on wwtp effluent monitoring data except for three compounds ace cyc and gab hence we assume that at least part of the almost 40 decrease in cumulative compound load along the rhine during p3 resulted from more rapid transformation within the riverine environment such an increase in compound removal from the aquatic environment during summer can amongst others result from increased biotransformation due to higher microbial biomass and or activity at elevated water temperatures table si16 greater abundance of phototrophic degrader bacteria as well as from increased removal of photo reactive compounds at higher light intensities and longer light exposure times 3 3 biotransformation in the rhine river basin calculation of k bio field values we calculated k bio field values to describe the compounds biotransformation potential in the rhine catchment compound loads measured along the rhine and its tributaries as well as laboratory derived sorption and phototransformation parameters served as basis for model calibration the rhine catchment model generally achieved good fits to the compound loads monitored during both field campaigns figs 3 b and si7 calibrated k bio field values are listed in tables si14 and si15 and posterior distributions are shown in fig 3a mean k bio field values ranged from 1 to 3000 l g oc d 1 fig 3a it has to be noted that the model framework only allows to differentiate k bio field values 30 to 1000 l g oc d 1 lower k bio field values practically mean that no transformation was observed along the rhine higher k bio field values indicate complete disappearance of the respective compound between subsequent sampling locations based on the differences in compound loads accumulating along the rhine during the two field campaigns biotransformation can be assumed to have been increased during p3 compared to p1 see 3 2 accordingly for eleven compounds i e acesulfame aliskiren bezafibrate diclofenac levetiracetam mefenamic acid saccharin sitagliptin trimethoprim valsartan and venlafaxine k bio field values derived from p3 data k bio field p3 were significantly higher than k bio field values derived from p1 data k bio field p1 i e there was no overlap of their interquartile range another group of eight compounds showed a possible but less significant difference of the same kind i e atazanavir atenolol bicalutamide citalopram cyclamate lidocaine metoprolol and saccharin for clopidogrel carboxylic acid hydrochlorothiazide lamotrigine and sulfamethoxazole k bio field values were similar during p1 and p3 suggesting that their biotransformation is less sensitive towards temporal variations e g changes in season carbamazepine and fexofenadine were the only counter examples with significantly higher k bio field p1 values compared to k bio field p3 values i e no overlap of interquartile range however mean k bio field values derived for carbamazepine were close to below the here defined identifiability range in the case of fexofenadine an antihistamine quarterly consumption data available to estimate compound emission into the rhine may not fully capture the seasonal use of this pharmaceutical potentially resulting in overestimation of both emissions and k bio field p1 it can be assumed that a major factor driving differences between k bio field p1 and k bio field p3 are seasonal variations in water temperature table si16 ideally the rhine catchment model should be updated to account for the compounds varying transformation kinetics at changing temperatures however a simple correction of k bio field according to the arrhenius equation does not seem feasible as the ratios between k bio field p1 and k bio field p3 vary across compounds i e there is no systematic increase for all compounds removal via biotransformation during summer fig 3a this is in line with recent findings of meynet et al 2020 showing that temperature optima for micropollutant biotransformation in activated sludge can vary strongly depending on compound and expected reaction pathways generally absolute k bio field values are to be treated with caution as our model framework calculates bio transformation for an entire catchment which requires a number of simplifying assumptions resulting in uncertainties in model output parameters it is not possible to distinguish between biotransformation and other fate processes based on observed compound loads in the rhine water body exclusively hence k bio field values are conditional on the assumptions made during model calibration for example by using a single k oc value for the entire catchment the model framework cannot capture spatially varying sorption behavior of compounds under changing bed sediment and suspended particle properties within the stream network as indicated by variable outcomes of our sorption experiments and the literature data such variability is undeniable table 1 yet the posterior distributions of k hyro k photo and k oc closely followed their prior distributions which indicates that there was no strong evidence against our laboratory experiments based prior assumptions in the observed field data however as expected prior distributions for abiotic transformation influenced calibrated k bio field values this is especially critical in the case of phototransformation as translating k photo from laboratory to field is subject to a number of uncertainties e g actual light penetration into the water body sensitivity to this parameter was nonlinear i e changing the mean prior value of k photo by a factor of 2 did not result in statistically significant changes of the k bio field estimates however 5 fold changes of k photo resulted in k bio field estimates differing by two orders of magnitude however previous field studies on phototransformation kinetics of diclofenac at the surface of german river stretches 15 cm water depth during the month of july resulted in rate constants differing by a factor of 2 4 compared to the here employed mean of the k photo prior distribution supporting its feasibility for calibration of the rhine catchment model kunkel and radke 2012 radke et al 2010 finally from a microbiology perspective the model would need to be further underpinned with molecular biology data characterizing the potential of sediment and water microbial communities to catalyze a range of initial contaminant biotransformation reactions consequently the parameters of the rhine model should be considered as abstract values that describe the observed behavior at the catchment scale and k bio field estimates should not be considered measurable as such at any specific location in the catchment yet when including data from our phototransformation and sorption experiments the rhine catchment model allowed to at least semi quantitatively elucidate biotransformation kinetics of 20 chemical contaminants ubiquitously present within the river rhine it can therefore be considered a valuable contribution towards estimating the rate and extent of biotransformation processes in riverine environments even when wwtps densely distributed along the river preclude the direct observation of compound attenuation while k bio field p1 and k bio field p3 differ in terms of their absolute values the compounds rank relative to each other was well conserved spearman rank ρ 0 78 p value 0 05 meaning that the rhine catchment model identified the same compounds as slowly or rapidly degrading regardless of whether calibrated with p1 or p3 data therewith outcomes of the rhine catchment model qualitatively align well with findings of previous biotransformation studies in laboratory or field for example smallest k bio field values during both field campaigns were calculated for carbamazepine and 4 5 methylbenzotriazole carbamazepine is well known to remain persistent in aquatic environments coll et al 2020 tixier et al 2003 while 5 methylbenzotriazole was previously shown to biotransform at moderate rates in water sediment systems seller et al 2021 the low k bio field values are probably distorted by the persistent 4 methylbezotriazole which cannot be distinguished from 5 methylbenzotriazole with the analytical method used here dummer 2014 highest k bio field values were found for compounds easily biodegraded by a range of enzymes present in wwtp effluent impacted surface waters or widespread among aquatic microbial communities in general e g atenolol bezafibrate levetiracetam or valsartan achermann et al 2018 desiante et al 2021 seller et al 2021 3 4 biotransformation in laboratory studies calculation of k bio lab values the k bio lab values were calculated based on data from modified oecd 308 type studies in order to enable a comparison of laboratory and field derived transformation kinetics further k bio lab values were derived from studies conducted with different inocula allowing to simultaneously test whether the k bio concept could facilitate unifying observations from different laboratory studies as previously suggested yet only tested on three compounds honti et al 2016 hence we inferred k bio lab from experiments conducted in river and pond inoculum individually k bio lab r and k bio lab p respectively and across both experimental setups k bio lab joint for 38 compounds first k bio lab values were normalized to toc as proxy for degrader biomass and ranged from 0 004 to 4000 l g oc d 1 with standard model errors mostly below 10 fig 4 table si16 it has to be noted that k bio lab values 0 01 or 100 l g oc d 1 are subject to identifiability issues due to slow or very fast transformation respectively comparison of mean k bio lab r to mean k bio lab p revealed that the two quantities show a statistically significant strong correlation i e pearson s r 0 81 p values 0 001 figure si8 regardless of slight differences in absolute values further it was possible to derive biotransformation rate constants that are valid across both sets of biotransformation simulation studies k bio lab joint fig 4a the good fit to the experimental data when jointly fitting data from both experiments figs 4b and si9 confirms the hypothesis that the k bio concept allows linking biotransformation kinetics of compounds with a range of different properties across different water sediment studies comparing the individual fits to the joint fit revealed that the joint model solution yielded more likely results for all compounds except for atenolol and fenoxycarb whose k bio lab r values were outside of the here defined identifiability range comparison based on akaike information criterion table si17 further for the large majority of compounds k bio lab joint values were less uncertain than values from individual fits coefficients of variation cv in table si17 second in addition to toc normalization we also derived k bio lab values normalized to what we assume to be a more precise measure of total biomass than toc i e cell densities measured using flow cytometry during modified oecd 308 type studies those k bio lab cell values ranged from 0 01 to 4000 ml 109 cells d 1 table si18 and when inferred from river and pond experiments individually correlated equally strongly as k bio lab values normalized to toc i e pearson s r 0 81 p value 0 001 fig si8 yet t statistics on the correlation between cell density normalised k bio lab cell r and k bio lab cell p showed that the slope of the linear regression was not statistically significantly different from 1 while in contrast the correlation between the two quantities normalized to toc had a slope distinctly lower than 1 fig si8 those differences in slope indicate that normalization to cell densities as a more precise measure for total biomass increases the transferability of k bio lab between different experiments in a regulatory context in which oecd biotransformation studies are typically performed model frameworks that enable system agnostic approaches are of special interest in risk assessment of synthetic chemicals where compound specific transformation parameters are prime targets as the measurement of biodegradation kinetics according to regulatory testing guidelines is laborious and costly reducing the amount of experiments that need to be performed in order to determine a compound s biotransformation potential brings economic and ecological benefits allowing to more easily consider a compound s environmental degradability during earlier phases of chemical design fenner et al 2020 in the future different indicators for degrader biomass such as atp measurements could be tested to further improve the transferability of kinetic parameters between different studies 3 5 comparison of biotransformation kinetics in modified oecd 308 type studies and the rhine river basin 3 5 1 direct comparison of k bio lab and k bio field we compared k bio lab and k bio field values in order to assess to what extent biotransformation data from laboratory experiments reflect compound degradation in the rhine river basin comparing biotransformation between laboratory and field was possible for 23 compounds i e field compounds for which we were able to derive both meaningful k bio field and k bio lab joint values we directly compared k bio field p3 to k bio lab joint estimates as the temperatures measured in the water column of the main channel of the rhine during p3 table si16 were in the same range as temperatures during modified oecd 308 type studies i e 22 2 c seller et al 2021 on the laboratory side we used k bio lab joint values normalized to toc to allow for a direct comparison of quantities comparing absolute values of k bio field p3 to k bio lab joint revealed that k bio lab joint values are generally about two orders of magnitude lower than k bio field p3 values fig 5 a while uncertainties associated with absolute values of k bio field p3 are to be expected see 3 3 the large difference between laboratory and field k bio may point to a systematic under estimation of field degradation rates by laboratory simulation tests faster transformation in the field can be speculated to be due to the fact that the compounds were exposed to more diverse microbial degraders and degradation pathways during their travel in the rhine river catchment than while being entrapped in experimental vessels chalifour et al 2021 in its current form i e using toc as proxy for degrader biomass the k bio concept cannot account for such differing characteristics of microbial communities and their varying capacities for biotransformation of chemicals further the extent of hyporheic exchange i e contact with sediment biofilms has been demonstrated to influence contaminant transformation jaeger et al 2019 jaeger et al 2021 the lower k bio lab joint values may suggest that even modified oecd 308 type test systems do not fully capture the impact of hyporheic exchange on biotransformation differences in sediment water mixing might thus explain part of the increased degradation observed in the field regardless of the differences in absolute values linear regression revealed a statistically significant moderate correlation between k bio field p3 and k bio lab joint i e pearson s r 0 6 p value 0 05 fig 5a the compound valsartan is the strongest outlier in the correlation between k bio field p3 and k bio lab joint however together with bezafibrate and levetiracetam its k bio field p3 value is above the here defined identifiability range yet it has to be noted that fixing outlier k bio values to the identifiability range i e 30 l g oc d 1 k bio field p3 1000 l g oc d 1 and 0 01 l g oc d 1 k bio lab joint 100 l g oc d 1 does not influence correlation parameters i e pearson s r value of 0 6 remains compared to previous for the majority inconclusive attempts to relate biotransformation parameters derived from standard oecd 308 studies i e dt50 to compound dissipation from riverine environments radke and maier 2014a the observed relationship between k bio lab and k bio field values represents a clear improvement suggesting that outcomes of laboratory simulation studies indeed to some extent reflect transformation kinetics observed in the environment hence compared to dt50 the k bio concept appears more suitable to investigate biotransformation kinetics of compounds covering a wide range of different transformation and sorption behavior e g field compounds with k oc values covering roughly four orders of magnitude table 1 under spatially varying conditions as indicated by the increased transferability of k bio lab values between different laboratory studies when normalized to cell densities figure si8 a more accurate estimator of degrader biomass may allow to further converge k bio lab and k bio field values while data on bacterial cell densities in the rhine river catchment is not yet available flow cytometry has been shown to be feasible for in situ monitoring of cell densities in aquatic ecosystems besmer et al 2014 and may hopefully be considered in future field campaigns 3 4 2 relative ranking and clustering of compounds in laboratory and field relative comparison of biotransformation kinetics in laboratory and field allowed a ranking like analysis of the compounds derived k bio values were scaled to the range of values derived from laboratory studies p1 and p3 respectively and logarithmized to allow for a clear differentiation between lower values fig 5b scaled k bio values differed 1 log unit between laboratory and field for the majority of compounds compared i e 20 out of 23 only for the three compounds carbamazepine lamotrigine and lidocaine scaled k bio values differed by 2 log units between laboratory and field in case of carbamazepine absolute k bio lab joint and k bio field p3 values are lower than the here defined identifiability ranges and differences in scaled values are therefore to be treated with caution the overall good accordance of scaled k bio vales indicates that regardless of differences in absolute k bio values the behavior of the field compounds relative to each other stays well conserved when relating outcomes of laboratory studies to biotransformation kinetics in the field based on relative rankings it was possible to cluster compounds into groups showing consistently fast moderate or slow transformation in both modified oecd 308 type studies and in the rhine river catchment fig 5b c eleven compounds were identified as showing rather fast biotransformation in both laboratory and field studies i e atenolol bezafibrate clopidogrel carboxylic acid cyclamate diclofenac levetiracetam metoprolol saccharin sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and valsartan the nine compounds acesulfame bicalutamide citalopram gabapentin irbesartan lidocaine mefenamic acid sitagliptin and venlafaxine showed moderate transformation kinetics finally very slow to no biotransformation was observed in case of carbamazepine hydrochlorothiazide and lamotrigine based on this grouping into slow moderate and fast degrading compounds we calculated the geometric mean k bio values across all compounds belonging to the same group fig 5c from their absolute k bio values regardless whether considering field or laboratory data mean k bio values differed significantly between each group allowing to clearly distinguish between compounds exhibiting different potential for biotransformation as our selected field compounds cover quite a wide range of different transformation and sorption behavior here derived mean k bio values may be considered as points of reference when aiming to classify further compounds potential for biotransformation based on field or laboratory data additional data from future laboratory and field studies could help to fine tune mean k bio lab k bio field values as points of reference both in terms of their feasibility for read across applications between other laboratory and field studies and also in terms of their chemical applicability domain 4 conclusion we demonstrate that inverse modeling in combination with the k bio concept can be used to describe biotransformation kinetics of wwtp effluent borne compounds within a large densely populated river basin our field studies reveal that the 27 field compounds are ubiquitously present within the rhine river catchment and accumulate along the main channel of the rhine making it impossible to directly observe compound dissipation from monitoring data yet k bio field showed to be a suitable parameter to at least semi quantitatively elucidate the compounds varying potential for biotransformation the evaluation of aerobic laboratory simulation experiments proved that the k bio concept allows to unify observed transformation kinetics across laboratory studies with different sediments i e k bio lab joint and that transferability of k bio between different water sediment systems increases with a more precise measure of total biomass i e employing bacterial cell densities rather than toc as the normalizing factor for transformation comparing k bio lab and k bio field revealed that absolute values differed between laboratory and field pointing towards faster transformation in the rhine river basin yet data gathered for the large number of 23 directly comparable compounds demonstrate that grouping based on relative compound behavior bears considerable potential when aiming to reflect biotransformation of micropollutants in natural riverine environments by performing biotransformation simulation studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

14924,biogas production from anaerobic sludge digestion plays a central role for wastewater treatment plants to become more energy efficient or even energy neutral dedicated configurations have been developed to maximize the diversion of soluble and suspended organic matter to sludge streams for energy production through anaerobic digestion such as a stage treatment or chemically enhanced primary treatment cept instead of primary clarifiers still it remains to be investigated to what extent these different treatment steps affect the sludge characteristics and digestibility which may also impact the economic feasibility of the integrated systems in this study a detailed characterization has been performed for sludge obtained from primary clarification primary sludge a stage treatment a sludge and cept the characteristics of all sludges differed significantly from each other the organic compounds in primary sludge consisted mainly of 40 of carbohydrates 23 of lipids and 21 of proteins a sludge was characterized by a high amount of proteins 40 and a moderate amount of carbohydrates 23 and lipids 16 while in cept sludge organic compounds were mainly 26 of proteins 18 of carbohydrates 18 of lignin and 12 of lipids the highest methane yield was obtained from anaerobic digestion of primary sludge 347 16 ml ch4 g vs and a sludge 333 6 ml ch4 g vs while it was lower for cept sludge 245 5 ml ch4 g vs furthermore an economic evaluation has been carried out for the three systems considering energy consumption and recovery as well as effluent quality and chemical costs energy consumption of a stage was the highest among the three configurations due to aeration energy demand while cept had the highest operational costs due to chemical use energy surplus was the highest by the use of cept resulting from the highest fraction of recovered organic matter by considering the effluent quality of the three systems cept had the highest benefits followed by a stage integration of cept or a stage instead of primary clarification in existing wastewater treatment plants would potentially improve the effluent quality and energy recovery graphical abstract image

2008 abdelrahman et al 2021 generally the biomethane potential bmp test is performed to measure the digestibility of any substrate including sludge in this test inoculum obtained from a well functioning digester is mixed with the sludge in bottles these bottles are incubated under a specific temperature and mixing intensity and the generated methane amount is then counted holliger et al 2016 bmp represents the maximum methane amount which can be produced from sludge during anaerobic digestion per mass of volatile solids vs or cod bmp can be used to design full scale digesters in terms of digester size organic loading and potential biogas production it also can be used to investigate treatment options prior and after anaerobic digestion filer et al 2019 to recover the energy primary clarifiers are constructed to redirect part of the organics from the wastewater into the sludge line for anaerobic digestion these clarifiers capture up to 40 of the organics present in wastewater while the rest of the organics are transferred to a downstream biological system wan et al 2016 ersahin 2018 increasing the capture of organic matter will improve the energy recovery in wwtps ozgun 2019 novel process configurations have been developed to concentrate soluble and suspended organic matter in sludge e g based on a stage and chemically enhanced primary treatment cept wan et al 2016 a stage the first stage of the adsorption bio oxidation a b process is a high rate activated sludge hras system which is operated at a high sludge loading rate 2 g bod g vss d followed by an intermediate clarifier the activated sludge system is operated at short hydraulic retention times hrts 1 h and sludge retention times srts 2 days and low dissolved oxygen do concentration 1 mg l in this process extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by the bacteria play an important role in capturing the organic carbon via adsorption and bioflocculation mechanisms rahman et al 2017 the removal of cod can reach more than 70 with the help of this physical entrapment kinyua et al 2017 guven et al 2019a cept is another configuration in which chemicals such as ferric chloride fecl3 or poly aluminum chloride are added to the wastewater to enhance the coagulation and flocculation of organics then the organics are collected through the underflow of a clarifier which can be constructed on half of the area of a conventional primary clarifier high cod removal efficiency was reported by the cept process in which 80 of cod can be redirected to sludge guven et al 2019a several studies have investigated the digestibility of cept sludge and a stage sludge a sludge kooijman et al 2017 compared the digestibility of primary sludge and cept sludge obtained with different flocculant concentrations 2 5 10 g kg a decrease in bmp was reported for sludge samples with flocculant concentrations of more than 5 g kg this observation was explained by the fact that flocculants partially irreversibly bound organics and made them unavailable for digestion ge et al 2013 investigated the digestibility of a sludge from an a stage system operated under different srts 2 4 days and found that specific methane production was lower at srt of 4 days 306 ml ch4 g vs compared to 2 days 352 ml ch4 g vs which was explained by higher cod oxidation in a stage at higher srt meerburg et al 2015 reported that the specific methane yield of a sludge was more than two fold of that of waste activated sludge taboada santos et al 2020 compared the digestibility of sludge originated from cept and a stage via the bmp test it was found that cept sludge yielded similar methane as a sludge which was around 300 ml ch4 g vs different methane production of sludge reported in the literature could be related to the different physicochemical composition of each sludge bernat et al 2017 the wide range of reported values for bmp of the sludge originating from the previously mentioned systems is sometimes conflicting which requires further research to investigate to what extent these different treatment steps affect the sludge characteristics and digestibility thus characterization of a sludge and cept sludge in comparison with primary sludge is important to understand the effect of use of these systems on sludge stream and energy recovery potential therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of primary sludge a sludge and cept sludge in detail the physicochemical characteristics and digestibility of each sludge were investigated degradation of each organic fraction and changes in sludge characteristics during anaerobic digestion were determined additionally techno economic analysis was carried out to investigate the impact of sludge digestibility on the economic feasibility of the integrated systems the techno economic analysis including plant wide mass balance for cod nitrogen and phosphorous energy balance and operational costs was performed for each configuration 2 materials and methods 2 1 bmp tests 2 1 1 inoculum characteristics inoculum to perform the bmp test was obtained from a full scale 8000 m3 anaerobic digester of a wwtp with a daily treatment capacity of 250 000 m3 in istanbul the ratio of volatile solids to total solids vs ts in the inoculum was around 47 6 the characteristics of the inoculum are illustrated in table 1 which fulfilled the recommended values in the studies of holliger et al 2016 and angelidaki et al 2009 2 1 2 substrates sludge samples from primary clarification a stage and cept were used as substrates in this study all sludge samples were screened through a 10 mm sieve to remove coarse particles and kept at 4 c the primary sludge sample was taken from a primary clarifier of a full scale municipal wwtp with a daily treatment capacity of 600 000 m3 the wwtp contained two circular primary clarifiers with a diameter of 50 5 m and a depth of 3 2 m which are operated at an hrt of 30 min the a sludge sample was obtained from a pilot scale a stage system this pilot system was fed with municipal wastewater after grit removal units in a preliminary wwtp the average do and mlss concentrations in the biological tank were 0 50 and 2600 mg l respectively and the average of srt was 0 5 day the hrt of the a reactor and clarifier were 75 and 30 min respectively lamella plate settlers are installed in the clarifier in order to obtain cept sludge 60 l of raw wastewater was supplied with 100 mg fecl3 l without ph adjustment using jar test set up fig s1 the wastewater was processed as follows rapid mixing at 150 rpm for 1 min slow mixing at 50 rpm for 15 min followed by settling for 30 min the supernatant was withdrawn and the settled sludge was collected and considered as cept sludge 2 1 3 bmp experimental set up the bmp test was conducted by using an automated methane potential test system ampts ii bioprocess control sweden the test was conducted in triplicate the mixture ratio was 2 1 between inoculum and substrate based on added vs the working volume of the mixture of inoculum and substrates was 400 ml oxygen free deionized water was added to the mixtures to compensate for the missing volume phosphate buffer macronutrients and trace elements were prepared according to zhang et al 2014 cellulose microcrystalline sigma aldrich usa was used as a positive control of the bmp test 2 1 4 bmp modeling and kinetics the modified gompertz model was used to simulate the digestion process fig s2 as shown in eq 1 1 b t b 0 exp exp r m exp 1 b 0 λ t

to the lag phase d and t refers to the srt in the digester d the lag phase λ describes the minimum time for biogas production or acclimation of the bacteria to the environment the maximum methane production rate rm represents the maximum catabolic methane production rate of methanogenic archaea 2 2 techno economic assessment 2 2 1 primary and sludge treatment configurations under study three different process flow diagrams were designed fig 1 including scenario 1 a primary clarifier was applied and the sludge was sent to the anaerobic digester scenario 2 a stage was applied as a primary treatment unit and the sludge was thickened by a gravitational thickener then sent to the anaerobic digester scenario 3 cept including flash and slow chemical mixing tanks and clarification were carried out and the sludge was sent to the anaerobic digester the digestate was assumed to be dumped into landfills in all scenarios 2 2 2 mass balances mass balances were set up for each scenario describing the fate of cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp in the primary treatment units primary settler a stage and cept and in the anaerobic digester for this purpose samples of influent effluent and sludge were taken from each primary treatment configuration furthermore experimental data obtained from the bmp test was used to represent the data needed to conduct the mass balance over the anaerobic digesters the mass balance did not include the thickener in the a stage scenario since the a sludge was not thickened before conducting bmp test for primary clarification and cept configurations the cod load in the influent codinf g d was considered as the sum of cod load in the effluent codeff g d and in the sludge codsludge g d for the a stage configuration the mineralized fraction of cod codmin g d which is lost in oxidation for bacterial growth was used to close the cod mass balance as shown in eq 2 2 c o d m i n c o d i n f c o d e f f c o d s l u d g e for the anaerobic digesters the cod load in the influent sludge codsludge g d was considered as the sum of cod which is converted into methane gas codmethane g d and the cod that remained in the digestate

included environmental benefits cen which represent the costs avoided for removal of undesirable outputs cod tn tp etc during wastewater treatment if these pollutants are released into the marine

concentrations of cod soluble cod scod tn total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn nh4 n tp alkalinity and ph of all samples were measured based on standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2017 vfas were measured for all sludge samples by a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector shimadzu japan protein content of the sludge was estimated based on multiplying the difference between tkn and nh4 n by 6 25 fao 2002 soluble carbohydrate scarbohydrates of all sludge samples was measured based on the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 lipids content in all sludge samples was measured by using the chloroform methanol extraction method bligh and dyer 1959 cellulose hemi cellulose and lignin were measured based on the van soest method van soest 1963 the particle size distribution of sludge samples was measured by a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments hydro 2000 mu uk sludge samples were imaged by a scanning electron microscope thermo fisher scientific inc fei quanta feg 250 esem uk coupled with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer ametek gmbh ametek edax apollo x germany principal component analysis pca was performed to investigate the correlation between sludge characteristics organic fractions and digestibility of sludge by using origin 2019b originlab corporation usa the sma was measured for inoculum and sludge mixtures after bmp to evaluate the activity of methanogenic bacteria after bmp the sma was measured by using ampts ii bioprocess control sweden based on the method described by abdelrahman et al 2022 briefly the anaerobic sludge samples were analyzed as triplicates sodium acetate was used as a substrate sma tests were conducted in bottles with effective volumes of 400 ml at 37 c the mixing ratio of anaerobic sludge vs concentration to substrate cod concentration was set as 2 1 phosphate buffer macronutrients and trace elements were prepared according to zhang et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of each sludge the implementation of a primary clarifier a stage or cept for wastewater treatment had different impacts on the physicochemical characteristics of the obtained sludge table 2 the ts concentration of primary sludge was the highest which is in the range of the reported values in the literature 20 60 g l tchobanoglous et al 2014 a sludge had the lowest solids concentration which is a typical concentration for activated sludge 8 12 g l and requires thickening to 20 30 g l prior to anaerobic digestion tchobanoglous et al 2014 the vs ts ratio was relatively low in all sludge types compared to the typical value of primary sludge 60 80 tyagi and lo 2013 this low value could be due to inappropriate operation of the grit removal unit in which some inorganics e g sands may pass to the primary treatment unit therefore these inorganic particles settle in the primary treatment unit causing a decrease in the vs ts ratio in the sludge tn content was the highest in the a sludge which was close to tn content reported for waste activated sludge 2 4 5 tyagi and lo 2013 rahman et al 2019 reported that assimilation for biomass growth was the main mechanism for nutrients capture in a stage cept sludge contained a high content of tp which was double that of primary sludge this high content was related to the addition of fecl3 which binds orthophosphate in the wastewater wilfert et al 2015 each sludge type had a unique organic fraction composition including vfa proteins lipids scarbohydrates cellulose hemi cellulose and lignin table 2 the vfa concentration was the highest in primary sludge which could explain its relatively low ph the protein content in a sludge was the highest reaching two fold the protein content in primary sludge the high protein content could be explained by originating from bacterial cells exo enzymes and microbial metabolic products guo et al 2020 lipids content was the highest in primary sludge contributing to around 23 of vs which was in the range reported in the literature 7 35 ts tyagi and lo 2013 liu et al 2020 reported a higher lipids content in primary sludge than in sludge obtained from hras systems operated at different srts in which lipids concentration was lower for those operated at higher srts free fatty acids can be used as substrates for assimilation by microorganisms and released in the wastewater as by products chipasa and mdrzycka 2008 the content of carbohydrates including scarbohydrates cellulose and hemi cellulose was around 40 of vs in primary sludge which was almost double of the carbohydrates content in cept and a sludge bernat et al 2017 reported that organic matter in primary sludge mainly consists of lipids and carbohydrate fibrous material cellulose accounts for 25 30 of the suspended solids in the wastewater due to the discharge of toilet papers directly into sewer it was reported that primary clarifiers can capture around 80 of cellulose while it is partially degraded in activated sludge systems ahmed et al 2019 therefore lower cellulose content could be expected in a sludge compared to primary sludge lignin was around 18 of vs in cept sludge which was higher than those in primary 8 7 and a sludge 5 ma et al 2022 reported that the phenolic functional group on lignin like compounds can provide binding sites for fe3 and form complexes which facilitate the formation of flocs thus lignin content in cept sludge could be relatively high the remaining uncharacterized organic matter in a sludge 14 of vs and cept sludge 24 of vs may be other organic compounds such as humic fulvic and nucleic acid compounds jimenez et al 2013 and or organic compounds that were trapped inside the flocs and were not extracted by the used extraction techniques zhu et al 2018 the morphology of the different types of sludge was imaged by scanning electron microscopy fig 2 primary sludge contained small discrete particles which facilitate its gravitational settling possibly preceded by flocculation with other particles bacteria cells conglomerated forming large flocs in a sludge in the a stage process the bacteria play the main role in the removal of organics in which particulate and colloidal organics are adsorbed by eps in the a stage soluble organics are converted to biomass which will jointly settle with the particulate and colloidal matters in the intermediate clarifier kartal et al 2010 in cept sludge the presence of fecl3 enhanced coagulation and flocculation of particles in the wastewater forming large flocs fig 2c the main removal mechanisms of organics in cept are charge neutralization and electrostatic bridging zhu et al 2011 energy dispersive x ray spectrometer was used to determine the inorganic compositions for each sludge elements such as o c and n were the main components in all types of sludge forming more than 86 of the inorganic elements on the surface of the sludge fe and p in cept sludge were more than double that of primary sludge and a sludge because of the addition of fecl3 which highly removes the phosphorous from the wastewater this finding was consistent with the measured tp content in each sludge table 2 the particle size distribution was distinctly different in each sludge fig 3 all particle sizes in primary sludge were less than 500 µm in which the majority with particle sizes less than 20 µm 35 and between 100 and 500 µm 31 on the other hand a small amount of particles with sizes less than 20 µm only 13 could be found in a sludge the particle sizes were distributed mainly among 20 50 50 100 and 100 500 µm in a sludge on contrary to a sludge and primary sludge cept sludge was also composed of large particle sizes 500 1000 µm which contributed to around 12 of the total mass guo et al 2020 found a small fraction of particles in a size between 500 and 2000 µm in primary sludge which is consistent with this study compared to primary sludge the presence of bigger particles in a and cept sludge was due to biosorption bioflocculation and coagulant binding effect respectively guven et al 2019a the average median particle size d50 of primary sludge a sludge and cept sludge was 36 8 0 7 60 7 0 2 and 34 0 0 5 µm respectively 3 2 bmp batch test results and modeling the digestibility of the sludges was assessed by conducting the bmp test fig 4 the average bmp of the positive control pc was 356 3 17 5 ml ch4 g vs holliger et al 2021 reported that bmp values of pc should be between 340 and 395 ml ch4 g vs which was fulfilled in this study the highest bmp value was for primary sludge which was 346 6 16 3 ml ch4 g vs on average this high bmp value might be related to the relatively high lipids content table 2 which yields higher methane than protein and carbohydrates hu et al 2020 the bmp value of a sludge was slightly lower than primary sludge reaching 333 3 5 7 ml ch4 g vs this value was higher than the values reported by taboada santos et al 2020 in which a sludge yielded around 295 ml ch4 g vs the lower bmp value obtained in the latter study could be related to the higher srt 2 5 3 days at which their a stage was operated the digestibility of the sludge indeed shows an inverse correlation with the operational srt in activated sludge systems guven et al 2019a interestingly cept sludge had the lowest bmp value 244 5 4 5 ml ch4 g vs lin et al 2017 and kooijman et al 2017 reported that the aggregate flocs due to the addition of coagulant would create a cage effect that would restrict the accessibility of bacteria and enzymes to organic compounds trapped inside the flocs resulting in a relatively low degradability of cept sludge different methane production rates and lag phases were observed for each sludge fig 4 therefore the modified gompertz model was used to determine the methane production instead of a simplified first order rate model kafle and chen 2016 the methane production curves were well fitted with the modified gompertz model r2 0 95 for all curves fig 4 the average b0 values for primary a and cept sludge were 347 3 16 9 335 0 5 2 and 245 9 5 5 ml ch4 g vs respectively the cept sludge showed the highest rm 57 7 0 6 ml ch4 g vs day and λ 2 3 0 1 day among the other sludges fig 5 the kinetics of primary sludge was close to cept sludge with an average rm and λ of 54 0 2 0 ml ch4 g vs day and 2 2 0 1 day respectively the shortest lag phase was during a sludge digestion 1 0 0 0 day which could be related to its relatively high protein content table 2 astals et al 2014 reported that proteins yielded methane with shorter lag phase than carbohydrates and lipids a sludge had slightly lower rm 49 0 0 3 ml ch4 g vs day in comparison with other sludges the organic composition of sludge affects its digestibility mottet et al 2010 therefore pca was applied for each sludge to understand the correlation between the organic fractions and the observed bmp fig 6 the first component pc1 65 2 and second component pc2 30 6 together represent more than 95 of the total dataset variability different score combinations for pc1 and pc2 were obtained for the three sludge types which confirms that they had distinct organic fraction characteristics and bmp the angle between the vectors in the pca graph represents the correlation between variables small angles 90 represent positive correlation and angles of 90 and 180 correspond to not correlated and negative correlations respectively strong positive correlations were found between bmp and fractions of cellulose lipids and vfa lignin exhibited a strong negative correlation with bmp only a weak positive correlation between bmp and hemicellulose was observed and a very weak positive correlation between bmp and proteins 3 3 changes in sludge characteristics during digestion the effect of sludge type and sludge characteristics on anaerobic digestibility was investigated by determining the sludge characteristics before and after digestion table 3 cod removal was consistent with bmp results in which cod removal with primary sludge digestion was the highest 40 7 followed by a sludge digestion 38 8 the cod removal during digestion of cept sludge was the lowest 25 7 which resulted in a high cod concentration in the digested sludge the residual organics in digested sludge can be converted to energy through thermal processes such as pyrolysis cao and pawłowski 2012 nh4 n concentration and ph increased after digestion of all sludges due to the breakdown of protein compounds yenigün and demirel 2013 digestion of a sludge resulted in a relatively high nh4 n production and an increase in ph since a sludge contained the highest protein content the sma was measured for the different sludges after digestion to investigate whether there was any improvement or inhibition in methanogenesis by considering sma of the inoculum as a reference the results showed that digestion of a sludge improved the methanogenesis more than those in primary and cept sludge these results confirmed the bmp results in which digestion of a sludge had the lowest λ indicating the highest bacterial acclimation the organic fractions were measured for sludge mixtures before and after bmp to reveal the differences in anaerobic biodegradation of each sludge fig s3 lipids represented the major fraction of the degraded organic compounds for all sludges around 57 2 52 2 and 58 4 during digestion of primary sludge a sludge and cept sludge respectively fig 7 proteins were around 20 and 16 of degraded organic compounds during digestion of a sludge and cept sludge respectively no vfa was detected in the sludge after bmp in which vfa was around 19 10 3 and 14 of the degraded organic compounds during digestion of primary sludge a sludge and cept sludge respectively degradation of carbohydrates including cellulose hemicellulose and scarbohydrates were responsible for around 6 6 9 0 and 6 8 of cod decrease during digestion of primary sludge a sludge and cept sludge respectively the other remaining organic compounds such as lignin did not significantly affect the cod decrease 9 3 4 techno economic assessment 3 4 1 mass balances mass balances were set up to analyze the fate of influent cod tn and tp in each scenario fig 8 primary clarification had the lowest removal efficiency of all parameters whereas cept had the highest removal efficiency of cod and tp a stage had a removal efficiency of cod 64 4 and tn 22 8 close to cept with moderate tp removal 32 2 rahman et al 2019 reported that a stage could capture 19 27 of tn and 30 36 of tp in the influent into sludge a stage redirected less cod to sludge for anaerobic digestion since 13 of cod was lost via oxidation for bacterial growth which was converted to co2 this value was consistent with the oxidation values reported by ge et al 2017 in which cod loss via oxidation was less than 25 at different operational srts 0 5 3 days integration of an a stage or cept instead of a primary clarifier is expected to affect the side stream as well based on the cod mass balance in comparison with primary clarification integration of a stage and cept could recover more cod from the wastewater i e 37 and 67 respectively for subsequent conversion into methane gas partial nitritation anammox technology with low aeration requirements can be used for the treatment of effluent of the a stage and cept since cod tn ratio was low around 3 in the effluent which is favorable for anammox bacteria typically 2 3 zhang et al 2019 3 4 2 energy and cost considerations overall energy balance and operational costs were estimated for each scenario fig 9 in the case of primary clarification nearly all the energy consumed 27 2 wh m3 was required for operation of the anaerobic digester energy consumption was the highest in a stage scenario 73 9 wh m3 which was mainly due to aeration in the a stage system aeration contributed to around 54 5 of the total energy consumption in the a stage scenario while the rest was mainly for heat requirement of anaerobic digestion 41 4 and sludge pumping 4 1 especially for sludge recirculation in the a stage system in the cept scenario total energy consumption was around 56 wh m3 which was mainly because of heating requirement for anaerobic digestion 83 6 and mixing of chemicals dosing tanks 16 3 among all scenarios heating requirement for anaerobic digestion was the highest in cept scenario due to the high sludge production in cept configuration which needed to be heated guven et al 2019a energy recovery from methane production was the highest in cept scenario 449 wh m3 followed by energy recovery in a stage 393 wh m3 and primary clarification 304 wh m3 scenarios fig 9a guven et al 2019b reported that the energy recovery in the form of electricity was 180 wh m3 for a designed wwtp with a capacity of 100 000 m3 d and influent cod of 509 mg l based on the energy balance cept showed to be the most energy efficient system among the other systems with a net positive energy recovery of around 393 wh m3 fig 9a it should be noted that the highest amount of cod was recovered accompanied by cept with a concomitant low energy consumption for mixing of chemicals the net energy gained via a stage 319 wh m3 was close to that via primary clarifier 277 wh m3 the operational costs in the cept scenario 0 04 m3 were the highest among all scenarios mainly due to the use of chemicals which accounted for around 75 6 of the total operational costs fig 9b the benefits gained via heat and electricity generation from methane were higher than the operational costs in all the scenarios which were in the range of 0 04 0 07 m3 since these systems vary in the removal performance of different pollutants which could affect the following treatment processes environmental benefits were integrated into the economic analysis cept scenario had the highest environmental benefits 0 14 m3 followed by a stage 0 10 m3 and primary clarification 0 03 m3 scenarios all configurations had positive net benefits accounting for around 0 17 and 0 15 m3 by a stage and cept respectively as benefits which were significantly higher than benefits gained with primary clarification 0 07 m3 4 conclusions this study investigated the impact of primary treatment methods primary clarifier a stage or cept on sludge characteristics and digestibility and plant wide economics the treatment process technology affected the sludge characteristics and digestibility distinctly primary sludge contained the highest amount of lipids cellulose and hemicellulose while a sludge had the highest amounts of proteins and cept sludge had the highest amounts of lignin digestion of primary sludge yielded the highest amount of methane followed by a sludge cept sludge digestion yielded the lowest amount of methane which was 30 lower than that of primary sludge based on plant wide mass balances the amount of organic matter in wastewater converted into methane gas was around 20 27 4 and 33 4 with the implementation of primary clarifier a stage and cept respectively energy consumption of a stage was the highest among the three configurations due to aeration energy demand while cept had the highest operational costs due to chemical use by considering the effluent quality cept and a stage had more than two fold net benefit compared to primary clarification integration of cept or a stage instead of primary clarifier in wwtps can improve energy recovery and effluent

developed to maximize the diversion of soluble and suspended organic matter to sludge streams for energy production through anaerobic digestion such as a stage treatment or chemically enhanced primary treatment cept instead of primary clarifiers still it remains to be investigated to what extent these different treatment steps affect the sludge characteristics and digestibility which may also impact the economic feasibility of the integrated systems in this study a detailed characterization has been performed for sludge obtained from primary clarification primary sludge a stage treatment a sludge and cept the characteristics of all sludges differed significantly from each other the organic compounds in primary sludge consisted mainly of 40 of carbohydrates 23 of lipids and 21 of proteins a sludge was characterized by a high amount of proteins 40 and a moderate amount of carbohydrates 23 and lipids 16 while in cept sludge organic compounds were mainly 26 of proteins 18 of carbohydrates 18 of lignin and 12 of lipids the highest methane yield was obtained from anaerobic digestion of primary sludge 347 16 ml ch4 g vs and a sludge 333 6 ml ch4 g vs while it was lower for cept sludge 245 5 ml ch4 g vs furthermore an economic evaluation has been carried out for the three systems considering energy consumption and recovery as well as effluent quality and chemical costs energy consumption of a stage was the highest among the three configurations due to aeration energy demand while cept had the highest operational costs due to chemical use energy surplus was the highest by the use of cept resulting from the highest fraction of recovered organic matter by considering the effluent quality of the three systems cept had the highest benefits followed by a stage integration of cept or a stage instead of primary clarification in existing wastewater treatment plants would potentially improve the effluent quality and energy recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords a stage biochemical methane potential chemically enhanced primary treatment economic evaluation physicochemical characteristics primary clarification data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction wastewater treatment is essential for the protection of public health and ecosystems wastewater treatment plants wwtps are in the first place designed to meet the required effluent criteria in terms of organics expressed as biological oxygen demand bod or chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrients besides energy efficiency has become more and more important over the last decade wwtps have even been rebranded as water resource recovery facilities to recover the energy and other resources included in the wastewater coats and wilson 2017 municipal wastewater contains chemical energy 1 5 1 9 kwh m3 of wastewater which is enclosed in the chemical bonds of organic molecules scherson and criddle 2014 hao et al 2019 furthermore wastewater itself can be considered a thermal source of energy 4 6 7 0 kwh m3 of wastewater which can be recovered by heat pumps mccarty et al 2011 hao et al 2019 thus recovering this energy has the potential to cover more than the energy consumption 0 3 2 1 kwh m3 of wastewater in the wwtps siegrist et al 2008 gandiglio et al 2017 the anaerobic digestion process is widely applied to convert the organics in sludge into biogas methane which can be utilized in combined heat and power units for energy recovery this recovered energy is used to offset the energy consumed in the wwtp appels et al 2008 abdelrahman et al 2021 generally the biomethane potential bmp test is performed to measure the digestibility of any substrate including sludge in this test inoculum obtained from a well functioning digester is mixed with the sludge in bottles these bottles are incubated under a specific temperature and mixing intensity and the generated methane amount is then counted holliger et al 2016 bmp represents the maximum methane amount which can be produced from sludge during anaerobic digestion per mass of volatile solids vs or cod bmp can be used to design full scale digesters in terms of digester size organic loading and potential biogas production it also can be used to investigate treatment options prior and after anaerobic digestion filer et al 2019 to recover the energy primary clarifiers are constructed to redirect part of the organics from the wastewater into the sludge line for anaerobic digestion these clarifiers capture up to 40 of the organics present in wastewater while the rest of the organics are transferred to a downstream biological system wan et al 2016 ersahin 2018 increasing the capture of organic matter will improve the energy recovery in wwtps ozgun 2019 novel process configurations have been developed to concentrate soluble and suspended organic matter in sludge e g based on a stage and chemically enhanced primary treatment cept wan et al 2016 a stage the first stage of the adsorption bio oxidation a b process is a high rate activated sludge hras system which is operated at a high sludge loading rate 2 g bod g vss d followed by an intermediate clarifier the activated sludge system is operated at short hydraulic retention times hrts 1 h and sludge retention times srts 2 days and low dissolved oxygen do concentration 1 mg l in this process extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by the bacteria play an important role in capturing the organic carbon via adsorption and bioflocculation mechanisms rahman et al 2017 the removal of cod can reach more than 70 with the help of this physical entrapment kinyua et al 2017 guven et al 2019a cept is another configuration in which chemicals such as ferric chloride fecl3 or poly aluminum chloride are added to the wastewater to enhance the coagulation and flocculation of organics then the organics are collected through the underflow of a clarifier which can be constructed on half of the area of a conventional primary clarifier high cod removal efficiency was reported by the cept process in which 80 of cod can be redirected to sludge guven et al 2019a several studies have investigated the digestibility of cept sludge and a stage sludge a sludge kooijman et al 2017 compared the digestibility of primary sludge and cept sludge obtained with different flocculant concentrations 2 5 10 g kg a decrease in bmp was reported for sludge samples with flocculant concentrations of more than 5 g kg this observation was explained by the fact that flocculants partially irreversibly bound organics and made them unavailable for digestion ge et al 2013 investigated the digestibility of a sludge from an a stage system operated under different srts 2 4 days and found that specific methane production was lower at srt of 4 days 306 ml ch4 g vs compared to 2 days 352 ml ch4 g vs which was explained by higher cod oxidation in a stage at higher srt meerburg et al 2015 reported that the specific methane yield of a sludge was more than two fold of that of waste activated sludge taboada santos et al 2020 compared the digestibility of sludge originated from cept and a stage via the bmp test it was found that cept sludge yielded similar methane as a sludge which was around 300 ml ch4 g vs different methane production of sludge reported in the literature could be related to the different physicochemical composition of each sludge bernat et al 2017 the wide range of reported values for bmp of the sludge originating from the previously mentioned systems is sometimes conflicting which requires further research to investigate to what extent these different treatment steps affect the sludge characteristics and digestibility thus characterization of a sludge and cept sludge in comparison with primary sludge is important to understand the effect of use of these systems on sludge stream and energy recovery potential therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of primary sludge a sludge and cept sludge in detail the physicochemical characteristics and digestibility of each sludge were investigated degradation of each organic fraction and changes in sludge characteristics during anaerobic digestion were determined additionally techno economic analysis was carried out to investigate the impact of sludge digestibility on the economic feasibility of the integrated systems the techno economic analysis including plant wide mass balance for cod nitrogen and phosphorous energy balance and operational costs was performed for each configuration 2 materials and methods 2 1 bmp tests 2 1 1 inoculum characteristics inoculum to perform the bmp test was obtained from a full scale 8000 m3 anaerobic digester of a wwtp with a daily treatment capacity of 250 000 m3 in istanbul the ratio of volatile solids to total solids vs ts in the inoculum was around 47 6 the characteristics of the inoculum are illustrated in table 1 which fulfilled the recommended values in the studies of holliger et al 2016 and angelidaki et al 2009 2 1 2 substrates sludge samples from primary clarification a stage and cept were used as substrates in this study all sludge samples were screened through a 10 mm sieve to remove coarse particles and kept at 4 c the primary sludge sample was taken from a primary clarifier of a full scale municipal wwtp with a daily treatment capacity of 600 000 m3 the wwtp contained two circular primary clarifiers with a diameter of 50 5 m and a depth of 3 2 m which are operated at an hrt of 30 min the a sludge sample was obtained from a pilot scale a stage system this pilot system was fed with municipal wastewater after grit removal units in a preliminary wwtp the average do and mlss concentrations in the biological tank were 0 50 and 2600 mg l respectively and the average of srt was 0 5 day the hrt of the a reactor and clarifier were 75 and 30 min respectively lamella plate settlers are installed in the clarifier in order to obtain cept sludge 60 l of raw wastewater was supplied with 100 mg fecl3 l without ph adjustment using jar test set up fig s1 the wastewater was processed as follows rapid mixing at 150 rpm for 1 min slow mixing at 50 rpm for 15 min followed by settling for 30 min the supernatant was withdrawn and the settled sludge was collected and considered as cept sludge 2 1 3 bmp experimental set up the bmp test was conducted by using an automated methane potential test system ampts ii bioprocess control sweden the test was conducted in triplicate the mixture ratio was 2 1 between inoculum and substrate based on added vs the working volume of the mixture of inoculum and substrates was 400 ml oxygen free deionized water was added to the mixtures to compensate for the missing volume phosphate buffer macronutrients and trace elements were prepared according to zhang et al 2014 cellulose microcrystalline sigma aldrich usa was used as a positive control of the bmp test 2 1 4 bmp modeling and kinetics the modified gompertz model was used to simulate the digestion process fig s2 as shown in eq 1 1 b t b 0 exp exp r m exp 1 b 0 λ t

production rate rm represents the maximum catabolic methane production rate of methanogenic archaea 2 2 techno economic assessment 2 2 1 primary and sludge treatment configurations under study three different process flow diagrams were designed fig 1 including scenario 1 a primary clarifier was applied and the sludge was sent to the anaerobic digester scenario 2 a stage was applied as a primary treatment unit and the sludge was thickened by a gravitational thickener then sent to the anaerobic digester scenario 3 cept including flash and slow chemical mixing tanks and clarification were carried out and the sludge was sent to the anaerobic digester the digestate was assumed to be dumped into landfills in all scenarios 2 2 2 mass balances mass balances were set up for each scenario describing the fate of cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp in the primary treatment units primary settler a stage and cept and in the anaerobic digester for this purpose samples of influent effluent and sludge were taken from each primary treatment configuration furthermore experimental data obtained from the bmp test was used to represent the data needed to conduct the mass balance over the anaerobic digesters the mass balance did not include the thickener in the a stage scenario since the a sludge was not thickened before conducting bmp test for primary clarification and cept configurations the cod load in the influent codinf g d was considered as the sum of cod load in the effluent codeff g d and in the sludge codsludge g d for the a stage configuration the mineralized fraction of cod codmin g d which is lost in oxidation for bacterial growth was used to close the cod mass balance as shown in eq 2 2 c o d m i n c o d i n f c o d e f f c o d s l u d g e for the anaerobic digesters the cod load in the influent sludge codsludge g d was considered as the sum of cod which is converted into methane gas codmethane g d and the cod that remained in the digestate

2017 vfas were measured for all sludge samples by a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector shimadzu japan protein content of the sludge was estimated based on multiplying the difference between tkn and nh4 n by 6 25 fao 2002 soluble carbohydrate scarbohydrates of all sludge samples was measured based on the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 lipids content in all sludge samples was measured by using the chloroform methanol extraction method bligh and dyer 1959 cellulose hemi cellulose and lignin were measured based on the van soest method van soest 1963 the particle size distribution of sludge samples was measured by a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments hydro 2000 mu uk sludge samples were imaged by a scanning electron microscope thermo fisher scientific inc fei quanta feg 250 esem uk coupled with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer ametek gmbh ametek edax apollo x germany principal component analysis pca was performed to investigate the correlation between sludge characteristics organic fractions and digestibility of sludge by using origin 2019b originlab corporation usa the sma was measured for inoculum and sludge mixtures after bmp to evaluate the activity of methanogenic bacteria after bmp the sma was measured by using ampts ii bioprocess control sweden based on the method described by abdelrahman et al 2022 briefly the anaerobic sludge samples were analyzed as triplicates sodium acetate was used as a substrate sma tests were conducted in bottles with effective volumes of 400 ml at 37 c the mixing ratio of anaerobic sludge vs concentration to substrate cod concentration was set as 2 1 phosphate buffer macronutrients and trace elements were prepared according to zhang et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of each sludge the implementation of a primary clarifier a stage or cept for wastewater treatment had different impacts on the physicochemical characteristics of the obtained sludge table 2 the ts concentration of primary sludge was the highest which is in the range of the reported values in the literature 20 60 g l tchobanoglous et al 2014 a sludge had the lowest solids concentration which is a typical concentration for activated sludge 8 12 g l and requires thickening to 20 30 g l prior to anaerobic digestion tchobanoglous et al 2014 the vs ts ratio was relatively low in all sludge types compared to the typical value of primary sludge 60 80 tyagi and lo 2013 this low value could be due to inappropriate operation of the grit removal unit in which some inorganics e g sands may pass to the primary treatment unit therefore these inorganic particles settle in the primary treatment unit causing a decrease in the vs ts ratio in the sludge tn content was the highest in the a sludge which was close to tn content reported for waste activated sludge 2 4 5 tyagi and lo 2013 rahman et al 2019 reported that assimilation for biomass growth was the main mechanism for nutrients capture in a stage cept sludge contained a high content of tp which was double that of primary sludge this high content was related to the addition of fecl3 which binds orthophosphate in the wastewater wilfert et al 2015 each sludge type had a unique organic fraction composition including vfa proteins lipids scarbohydrates cellulose hemi cellulose and lignin table 2 the vfa concentration was the highest in primary sludge which could explain its relatively low ph the protein content in a sludge was the highest reaching two fold the protein content in primary sludge the high protein content could be explained by originating from bacterial cells exo enzymes and microbial metabolic products guo et al 2020 lipids content was the highest in primary sludge contributing to around 23 of vs which was in the range reported in the literature 7 35 ts tyagi and lo 2013 liu et al 2020 reported a higher lipids content in primary sludge than in sludge obtained from hras systems operated at different srts in which lipids concentration was lower for those operated at higher srts free fatty acids can be used as substrates for assimilation by microorganisms and released in the wastewater as by products chipasa and mdrzycka 2008 the content of carbohydrates including scarbohydrates cellulose and hemi cellulose was around 40 of vs in primary sludge which was almost double of the carbohydrates content in cept and a sludge bernat et al 2017 reported that organic matter in primary sludge mainly consists of lipids and carbohydrate fibrous material cellulose accounts for 25 30 of the suspended solids in the wastewater due to the discharge of toilet papers directly into sewer it was reported that primary clarifiers can capture around 80 of cellulose while it is partially degraded in activated sludge systems ahmed et al 2019 therefore lower cellulose content could be expected in a sludge compared to primary sludge lignin was around 18 of vs in cept sludge which was higher than those in primary 8 7 and a sludge 5 ma et al 2022 reported that the phenolic functional group on lignin like compounds can provide binding sites for fe3 and form complexes which facilitate the formation of flocs thus lignin content in cept sludge could be relatively high the remaining uncharacterized organic matter in a sludge 14 of vs and cept sludge 24 of vs may be other organic compounds such as humic fulvic and nucleic acid compounds jimenez et al 2013 and or organic compounds that were trapped inside the flocs and were not extracted by the used extraction techniques zhu et al 2018 the morphology of the different types of sludge was imaged by scanning electron microscopy fig 2 primary sludge contained small discrete particles which facilitate its gravitational settling possibly preceded by flocculation with other particles bacteria cells conglomerated forming large flocs in a sludge in the a stage process the bacteria play the main role in the removal of organics in which particulate and colloidal organics are adsorbed by eps in the a stage soluble organics are converted to biomass which will jointly settle with the particulate and colloidal matters in the intermediate clarifier kartal et al 2010 in cept sludge the presence of fecl3 enhanced coagulation and flocculation of particles in the wastewater forming large flocs fig 2c the main removal mechanisms of organics in cept are charge neutralization and electrostatic bridging zhu et al 2011 energy dispersive x ray spectrometer was used to determine the inorganic compositions for each sludge elements such as o c and n were the main components in all types of sludge forming more than 86 of the inorganic elements on the surface of the sludge fe and p in cept sludge were more than double that of primary sludge and a sludge because of the addition of fecl3 which highly removes the phosphorous from the wastewater this finding was consistent with the measured tp content in each sludge table 2 the particle size distribution was distinctly different in each sludge fig 3 all particle sizes in primary sludge were less than 500 µm in which the majority with particle sizes less than 20 µm 35 and between 100 and 500 µm 31 on the other hand a small amount of particles with sizes less than 20 µm only 13 could be found in a sludge the particle sizes were distributed mainly among 20 50 50 100 and 100 500 µm in a sludge on contrary to a sludge and primary sludge cept sludge was also composed of large particle sizes 500 1000 µm which contributed to around 12 of the total mass guo et al 2020 found a small fraction of particles in a size between 500 and 2000 µm in primary sludge which is consistent with this study compared to primary sludge the presence of bigger particles in a and cept sludge was due to biosorption bioflocculation and coagulant binding effect respectively guven et al 2019a the average median particle size d50 of primary sludge a sludge and cept sludge was 36 8 0 7 60 7 0 2 and 34 0 0 5 µm respectively 3 2 bmp batch test results and modeling the digestibility of the sludges was assessed by conducting the bmp test fig 4 the average bmp of the positive control pc was 356 3 17 5 ml ch4 g vs holliger et al 2021 reported that bmp values of pc should be between 340 and 395 ml ch4 g vs which was fulfilled in this study the highest bmp value was for primary sludge which was 346 6 16 3 ml ch4 g vs on average this high bmp value might be related to the relatively high lipids content table 2 which yields higher methane than protein and carbohydrates hu et al 2020 the bmp value of a sludge was slightly lower than primary sludge reaching 333 3 5 7 ml ch4 g vs this value was higher than the values reported by taboada santos et al 2020 in which a sludge yielded around 295 ml ch4 g vs the lower bmp value obtained in the latter study could be related to the higher srt 2 5 3 days at which their a stage was operated the digestibility of the sludge indeed shows an inverse correlation with the operational srt in activated sludge systems guven et al 2019a interestingly cept sludge had the lowest bmp value 244 5 4 5 ml ch4 g vs lin et al 2017 and kooijman et al 2017 reported that the aggregate flocs due to the addition of coagulant would create a cage effect that would restrict the accessibility of bacteria and enzymes to organic compounds trapped inside the flocs resulting in a relatively low degradability of cept sludge different methane production rates and lag phases were observed for each sludge fig 4 therefore the modified gompertz model was used to determine the methane production instead of a simplified first order rate model kafle and chen 2016 the methane production curves were well fitted with the modified gompertz model r2 0 95 for all curves fig 4 the average b0 values for primary a and cept sludge were 347 3 16 9 335 0 5 2 and 245 9 5 5 ml ch4 g vs respectively the cept sludge showed the highest rm 57 7 0 6 ml ch4 g vs day and λ 2 3 0 1 day among the other sludges fig 5 the kinetics of primary sludge was close to cept sludge with an average rm and λ of 54 0 2 0 ml ch4 g vs day and 2 2 0 1 day respectively the shortest lag phase was during a sludge digestion 1 0 0 0 day which could be related to its relatively high protein content table 2 astals et al 2014 reported that proteins yielded methane with shorter lag phase than carbohydrates and lipids a sludge had slightly lower rm 49 0 0 3 ml ch4 g vs day in comparison with other sludges the organic composition of sludge affects its digestibility mottet et al 2010 therefore pca was applied for each sludge to understand the correlation between the organic fractions and the observed bmp fig 6 the first component pc1 65 2 and second component pc2 30 6 together represent more than 95 of the total dataset variability different score combinations for pc1 and pc2 were obtained for the three sludge types which confirms that they had distinct organic fraction characteristics and bmp the angle between the vectors in the pca graph represents the correlation between variables small angles 90 represent positive correlation and angles of 90 and 180 correspond to not correlated and negative correlations respectively strong positive correlations were found between bmp and fractions of cellulose lipids and vfa lignin exhibited a strong negative correlation with bmp only a weak positive correlation between bmp and hemicellulose was observed and a very weak positive correlation between bmp and proteins 3 3 changes in sludge characteristics during digestion the effect of sludge type and sludge characteristics on anaerobic digestibility was investigated by determining the sludge characteristics before and after digestion table 3 cod removal was consistent with bmp results in which cod removal with primary sludge digestion was the highest 40 7 followed by a sludge digestion 38 8 the cod removal during digestion of cept sludge was the lowest 25 7 which resulted in a high cod concentration in the digested sludge the residual organics in digested sludge can be converted to energy through thermal processes such as pyrolysis cao and pawłowski 2012 nh4 n concentration and ph increased after digestion of all sludges due to the breakdown of protein compounds yenigün and demirel 2013 digestion of a sludge resulted in a relatively high nh4 n production and an increase in ph since a sludge contained the highest protein content the sma was measured for the different sludges after digestion to investigate whether there was any improvement or inhibition in methanogenesis by considering sma of the inoculum as a reference the results showed that digestion of a sludge improved the methanogenesis more than those in primary and cept sludge these results confirmed the bmp results in which digestion of a sludge had the lowest λ indicating the highest bacterial acclimation the organic fractions were measured for sludge mixtures before and after bmp to reveal the differences in anaerobic biodegradation of each sludge fig s3 lipids represented the major fraction of the degraded organic compounds for all sludges around 57 2 52 2 and 58 4 during digestion of primary sludge a sludge and cept sludge respectively fig 7 proteins were around 20 and 16 of degraded organic compounds during digestion of a sludge and cept sludge respectively no vfa was detected in the sludge after bmp in which vfa was around 19 10 3 and 14 of the degraded organic compounds during digestion of primary sludge a sludge and cept sludge respectively degradation of carbohydrates including cellulose hemicellulose and scarbohydrates were responsible for around 6 6 9 0 and 6 8 of cod decrease during digestion of primary sludge a sludge and cept sludge respectively the other remaining organic compounds such as lignin did not significantly affect the cod decrease 9 3 4 techno economic assessment 3 4 1 mass balances mass balances were set up to analyze the fate of influent cod tn and tp in each scenario fig 8 primary clarification had the lowest removal efficiency of all parameters whereas cept had the highest removal efficiency of cod and tp a stage had a removal efficiency of cod 64 4 and tn 22 8 close to cept with moderate tp removal 32 2 rahman et al 2019 reported that a stage could capture 19 27 of tn and 30 36 of tp in the influent into sludge a stage redirected less cod to sludge for anaerobic digestion since 13 of cod was lost via oxidation for bacterial growth which was converted to co2 this value was consistent with the oxidation values reported by ge et al 2017 in which cod loss via oxidation was less than 25 at different operational srts 0 5 3 days integration of an a stage or cept instead of a primary clarifier is expected to affect the side stream as well based on the cod mass balance in comparison with primary clarification integration of a stage and cept could recover more cod from the wastewater i e 37 and 67 respectively for subsequent conversion into methane gas partial nitritation anammox technology with low aeration requirements can be used for the treatment of effluent of the a stage and cept since cod tn ratio was low around 3 in the effluent which is favorable for anammox bacteria typically 2 3 zhang et al 2019 3 4 2 energy and cost considerations overall energy balance and operational costs were estimated for each scenario fig 9 in the case of primary clarification nearly all the energy consumed 27 2 wh m3 was required for operation of the anaerobic digester energy consumption was the highest in a stage scenario 73 9 wh m3 which was mainly due to aeration in the a stage system aeration contributed to around 54 5 of the total energy consumption in the a stage scenario while the rest was mainly for heat requirement of anaerobic digestion 41 4 and sludge pumping 4 1 especially for sludge recirculation in the a stage system in the cept scenario total energy consumption was around 56 wh m3 which was mainly because of heating requirement for anaerobic digestion 83 6 and mixing of chemicals dosing tanks 16 3 among all scenarios heating requirement for anaerobic digestion was the highest in cept scenario due to the high sludge production in cept configuration which needed to be heated guven et al 2019a energy recovery from methane production was the highest in cept scenario 449 wh m3 followed by energy recovery in a stage 393 wh m3 and primary clarification 304 wh m3 scenarios fig 9a guven et al 2019b reported that the energy recovery in the form of electricity was 180 wh m3 for a designed wwtp with a capacity of 100 000 m3 d and influent cod of 509 mg l based on the energy balance cept showed to be the most energy efficient system among the other systems with a net positive energy recovery of around 393 wh m3 fig 9a it should be noted that the highest amount of cod was recovered accompanied by cept with a concomitant low energy consumption for mixing of chemicals the net energy gained via a stage 319 wh m3 was close to that via primary clarifier 277 wh m3 the operational costs in the cept scenario 0 04 m3 were the highest among all scenarios mainly due to the use of chemicals which accounted for around 75 6 of the total operational costs fig 9b the benefits gained via heat and electricity generation from methane were higher than the operational costs in all the scenarios which were in the range of 0 04 0 07 m3 since these systems vary in the removal performance of different pollutants which could affect the following treatment processes environmental benefits were integrated into the economic analysis cept scenario had the highest environmental benefits 0 14 m3 followed by a stage 0 10 m3 and primary clarification 0 03 m3 scenarios all configurations had positive net benefits accounting for around 0 17 and 0 15 m3 by a stage and cept respectively as benefits which were significantly higher than benefits gained with primary clarification 0 07 m3 4 conclusions this study investigated the impact of primary treatment methods primary clarifier a stage or cept on sludge characteristics and digestibility and plant wide economics the treatment process technology affected the sludge characteristics and digestibility distinctly primary sludge contained the highest amount of lipids cellulose and hemicellulose while a sludge had the highest amounts of proteins and cept sludge had the highest amounts of lignin digestion of primary sludge yielded the highest amount of methane followed by a sludge cept sludge digestion yielded the lowest amount of methane which was 30 lower than that of primary sludge based on plant wide mass balances the amount of organic matter in wastewater converted into methane gas was around 20 27 4 and 33 4 with the implementation of primary clarifier a stage and cept respectively energy consumption of a stage was the highest among the three configurations due to aeration energy demand while cept had the highest operational costs due to chemical use by considering the effluent quality cept and a stage had more than two fold net benefit compared to primary clarification integration of cept or a stage instead of primary clarifier in wwtps can improve energy recovery and effluent
